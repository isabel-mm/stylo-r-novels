ANTHONY
PATCH




in
1913
,
when
Anthony
Patch
be
twenty
-
five
,
two
year
be
already
go


since
irony
,
the
Holy
Ghost
of
this
later
day
,
have
,
theoretically
at


least
,
descend
upon
he
.
Irony
be
the
final
polish
of
the
shoe
,
the


ultimate
dab
of
the
clothe
-
brush
,
a
sort
of
intellectual
"
there!"--yet


at
the
brink
of
this
story
he
have
as
yet
go
no
far
than
the


conscious
stage
.
as
you
first
see
he
he
wonder
frequently
whether
he


be
not
without
honor
and
slightly
mad
,
a
shameful
and
obscene
thinness


glisten
on
the
surface
of
the
world
like
oil
on
a
clean
pond
,
these


occasion
be
varied
,
of
course
,
with
those
in
which
he
think
himself


rather
an
exceptional
young
man
,
thoroughly
sophisticated
,
well
adjust


to
his
environment
,
and
somewhat
more
significant
than
any
one
else


he
know
.




this
be
his
healthy
state
and
it
make
he
cheerful
,
pleasant
,
and
very


attractive
to
intelligent
man
and
to
all
woman
.
in
this
state
he


consider
that
he
would
one
day
accomplish
some
quiet
subtle
thing
that


the
elect
would
deem
worthy
and
,
pass
on
,
would
join
the
dimmer
star


in
a
nebulous
,
indeterminate
heaven
half
-
way
between
death
and


immortality
.
until
the
time
come
for
this
effort
he
would
be
Anthony


Patch
--
not
a
portrait
of
a
man
but
a
distinct
and
dynamic
personality
,


opinionate
,
contemptuous
,
function
from
within
outward
--
a
man
who


be
aware
that
there
could
be
no
honor
and
yet
have
honor
,
who
know
the


sophistry
of
courage
and
yet
be
brave
.






a
worthy
MAN
and
his
gifted
son




Anthony
draw
as
much
consciousness
of
social
security
from
be
the


grandson
of
Adam
J.
Patch
as
he
would
have
have
from
trace
his
line


over
the
sea
to
the
crusader
.
this
be
inevitable
;
Virginians
and


Bostonians
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
,
an
aristocracy
found


sheerly
on
money
postulate
wealth
in
the
particular
.




now
Adam
J.
Patch
,
more
familiarly
know
as
"
Cross
Patch
,
"
leave
his


father

and
ill

seventy
-
five
million
dollar

this
occupy
his
energy
until
he
be
fifty
-
seven
year
old
.
it
be


then
that
he
determine
,
after
a
severe
attack
of
sclerosis
,
to


consecrate
the
remainder
of
his
life
to
the
moral
regeneration
of
the


world
.
he
become
a
reformer
among

.
emulate
the
magnificent


effort
of
Anthony

,
after
whom
his
grandson
be

,
he


level
a
varied
assortment
of
uppercut
and
body
-
blow
at
liquor
,


literature
,
vice
,
art
,
patent
medicine
,
and
Sunday

.
his
mind
,


under
the
influence
of
that
insidious
mildew
which
eventually
form
on


all
but
the
few
,
give
itself
up
furiously
to
every
indignation
of
the


age
.
from
an
armchair
in
the
office
of
his
Tarrytown
estate
he
direct


against
the
enormous
hypothetical
enemy
,
unrighteousness
,
a
campaign


which
go
on
through
fifteen
year
,
during
which
he
display
himself
a


rabid
monomaniac
,
an
unqualified
nuisance
,
and
an
intolerable
bore
.
the


year
in
which
this
story
open
find
he
weary
;
his
campaign
have


grown
desultory
;
1861
be
creep
up
slowly
on
1895
;
his
thought
run
a


great
deal
on
the
Civil
War
,
somewhat
on
his
dead
wife
and
son
,
almost


infinitesimally
on
his
grandson
Anthony
.




early
in
his
career
Adam
Patch
have
marry
an
anemic
lady
of
thirty
,


Alicia
Withers
,
who
bring
he
one
hundred
thousand
dollar
and
an


impeccable
entre
into
the
banking
circle
of
New
York
.
immediately
and


rather
spunkily
she
have
bear
he
a
son
and
,
as
if
completely


devitalize
by
the
magnificence
of
this
performance
,
she
have
thenceforth


efface
herself
within
the
shadowy
dimension
of
the
nursery
.
the
boy
,


Adam
Ulysses
Patch
,
become
an
inveterate
joiner
of
club
,
connoisseur
of


good
form
,
and
driver
of
tandem
--
at
the
astonishing
age
of
twenty
-
six


he
begin
his
memoir
under
the
title
"
New
York
Society
as
I
have
see


it
.
"
on
the
rumor
of
its
conception
this
work
be
eagerly
bid
for
among


publisher
,
but
as
it
prove
after
his
death
to
be
immoderately
verbose


and
overpoweringly
dull
,
it
never
obtain
even
a
private
printing
.




this
Fifth
Avenue
Chesterfield
marry
at
twenty
-
two
.
his
wife
be


Henrietta
Lebrune
,
the
Boston
"
Society
Contralto
,
"
and
the
single
child


of
the
union
be
,
at
the
request
of
his
grandfather
,
christen
Anthony


Comstock
Patch
.
when
he
go
to
Harvard
,
the
Comstock
drop
out
of
his


name
to
a
nether
hell
of
oblivion
and
be
never
hear
of
thereafter
.




Young
Anthony
have
one
picture
of
his
father
and
mother
together
--
so


often
have
it
face
his
eye
in
childhood
that
it
have
acquire
the


impersonality
of
furniture
,
but
every
one
who
come
into
his
bedroom


regard
it
with
interest
.
it
show
a
dandy
of
the
ninety
,
spare
and


handsome
,
stand
beside
a
tall
dark
lady
with
a
muff
and
the


suggestion
of
a
bustle
.
between
they
be
a
little
boy
with
long
brown


curl
,
dress
in
a
velvet
Lord
Fauntleroy
suit
.
this
be
Anthony
at


five
,
the
year
of
his
mother
's
death
.




his
memory
of
the
Boston
Society
Contralto
be
nebulous
and
musical
.


she
be
a
lady
who
sing
,
sing
,
sing
,
in
the
music
room
of
their
house
on


Washington
Square
--
sometimes
with
guest
scatter
all
about
she
,
the


man
with
their
arm
fold
,
balance
breathlessly
on
the
edge
of
sofas
,


the
woman
with
their
hand
in
their
lap
,
occasionally
make
little


whisper
to
the
man
and
always
clap
very
briskly
and
utter
coo


cry
after
each
song
--
and
often
she
sing
to
Anthony
alone
,
in
italian


or
french
or
in
a
strange
and
terrible
dialect
which
she
imagine
to
be


the
speech
of
the
southern
negro
.




his
recollection
of
the
gallant
Ulysses
,
the
first
man
in
America
to


roll
the
lapel
of
his
coat
,
be
much
more
vivid
.
after
Henrietta


Lebrune
Patch
have
"
join
another
choir
,
"
as
her
widower
huskily


remark
from
time
to
time
,
father
and
son
live
up
at
grampa
's
in


Tarrytown
,
and
Ulysses
come
daily
to
Anthony
's
nursery
and
expel


pleasant
,
thick
-
smell
word
for
sometimes
as
much
as
an
hour
.
he
be


continually
promise
Anthony
hunting
trip
and
fishing
trip
and


excursion
to
Atlantic
City
,
"
oh
,
some
time
soon
now
"
;
but
none
of
they


ever
materialize
.
one
trip
they
do
take
;
when
Anthony
be
eleven
they


go
abroad
,
to
England
and
Switzerland
,
and
there
in
the
good
hotel
in


Lucerne
his
father
die
with
much
sweating
and
grunt
and
cry
aloud


for
air
.
in
a
panic
of
despair
and
terror
Anthony
be
bring
back
to


America
,
wed
to
a
vague
melancholy
that
be
to
stay
beside
he


through
the
rest
of
his
life
.






PAST
and
person
of
the
HERO




at
eleven
he
have
a
horror
of
death
.
within
six
impressionable
year
his


parent
have
die
and
his
grandmother
have
fade
off
almost
imperceptibly
,


until
,
for
the
first
time
since
her
marriage
,
her
person
hold
for
one


day
an
unquestioned
supremacy
over
her
own
drawing
room
.
so
to
Anthony


life
be
a
struggle
against
death
,
that
wait
at
every
corner
.
it
be


as
a
concession
to
his
hypochondriacal
imagination
that
he
form
the


habit
of
reading
in
bed
--
it
soothe
he
.
he
read
until
he
be
tired
and


often
fall
asleep
with
the
light
still
on
.




his
favorite
diversion
until
he
be
fourteen
be
his
stamp
collection
;


enormous
,
as
nearly
exhaustive
as
a
boy
's
could
be
--
his
grandfather


consider
fatuously
that
it
be
teach
he
geography
.
so
Anthony
keep


up
a
correspondence
with
a
half
dozen
"
Stamp
and
Coin
"
company
and
it


be
rare
that
the
mail
fail
to
bring
he
new
stamp
-
book
or
package


of
glitter
approval
sheet
--
there
be
a
mysterious
fascination
in


transfer
his
acquisition
interminably
from
one
book
to
another
.
his


stamp
be
his
great
happiness
and
he
bestow
impatient
frown
on


any
one
who
interrupt
he
at
play
with
they
;
they
devour
his


allowance
every
month
,
and
he
lie
awake
at
night
musing
untiringly
on


their
variety
and
many
-
colored
splendor
.




at
sixteen
he
have
live
almost
entirely
within
himself
,
an
inarticulate


boy
,
thoroughly
un
-
american
,
and
politely
bewilder
by
his


contemporary
.
the
two
precede
year
have
be
spend
in
Europe
with
a


private
tutor
,
who
persuade
he
that
Harvard
be
the
thing
;
it
would


"
open
door
,
"
it
would
be
a
tremendous
tonic
,
it
would
give
he


innumerable
self
-
sacrifice
and
devoted
friend
.
so
he
go
to


Harvard
--
there
be
no
other
logical
thing
to
be
do
with
he
.




oblivious
to
the
social
system
,
he
live
for
a
while
alone
and
unsought


in
a
high
room
in
Beck
Hall
--
a
slim
dark
boy
of
medium
height
with
a
shy


sensitive
mouth
.
his
allowance
be
more
than
liberal
.
he
lay
the


foundation
for
a
library
by
purchase
from
a
wandering
bibliophile


first
edition
of
Swinburne
,
Meredith
,
and
hardy
,
and
a
yellowed


illegible
autograph
letter
of
Keats
's
,
find
later
that
he
have
be


amazingly
overcharge
.
he
become
an
exquisite
dandy
,
amass
a
rather


pathetic
collection
of
silk
pajama
,
brocade
dressing
-
gown
,
and


necktie
too
flamboyant
to
wear
;
in
this
secret
finery
he
would
parade


before
a
mirror
in
his
room
or
lie
stretch
in
satin
along
his


window
-
seat
look
down
on
the
yard
and
realize
dimly
this
clamor
,


breathless
and
immediate
,
in
which
it
seem
he
be
never
to
have


a
part
.




curiously
enough
he
find
in
senior
year
that
he
have
acquire
a
position


in
his
class
.
he
learn
that
he
be
look
upon
as
a
rather
romantic


figure
,
a
scholar
,
a
recluse
,
a
tower
of
erudition
.
this
amuse
he
but


secretly
please
he
--
he
begin
go
out
,
at
first
a
little
and
then
a


great
deal
.
he
make
the
Pudding
.
he
drink
--
quietly
and
in
the
proper


tradition
.
it
be
say
of
he
that
have
he
not
come
to
college
so

to

alert
with
intelligence

might
lie

warmly
and
sensuously
on


her

the

keep
clean
by
an

servant
with
the
singularly
,


almost
theatrically
,
appropriate
name
of
Bounds
,
whose
technic
be


mar
only
by
the
fact
that
he
wear
a

collar

have
he
be
entirely


Anthony
's
Bounds
this
defect
would
have
be
summarily
remedied
,
but
he


be
also
the
Bounds
of
two
other
gentleman
in
the
neighborhood
.
from


eight
until
eleven
in
the
morning
he
be
entirely
Anthony
's
.
he
arrive


with
the
mail
and
cook
breakfast
.
at
nine
-
thirty
he
pull
the
edge
of


Anthony
's
blanket
and
speak
a
few
terse
word
--
Anthony
never
remember


clearly
what
they
be
and
rather
suspect
they
be
deprecative
;
then


he
serve
breakfast
on
a
card
-
table
in
the
front
room
,
make
the
bed
and
,


after
ask
with
some
hostility
if
there
be
anything
else
,
withdraw
.




in
the
morning
,
at
least
once
a
week
,
Anthony
go
to
see
his
broker
.


his
income
be
slightly
under
seven
thousand
a
year
,
the
interest
on


money
inherit
from
his
mother
.
his
grandfather
,
who
have
never
allow


his
own
son
to
graduate
from
a
very
liberal
allowance
,
judge
that
this


sum
be
sufficient
for
young
Anthony
's
need
.
every
Christmas
he
send


he
a
five
-
hundred
-
dollar
bond
,
which
Anthony
usually
sell
,
if
possible
,


as
he
be
always
a
little
,
not
very
,
hard
up
.




the
visit
to
his
broker
vary
from
semi
-
social
chat
to
discussion
of


the
safety
of
eight
per
cent
investment
,
and
Anthony
always
enjoy


they
.
the
big
trust
company
building
seem
to
link
he
definitely
to


the
great
fortune
whose
solidarity
he
respect
and
to
assure
he
that


he
be
adequately
chaperone
by
the
hierarchy
of
finance
.
from
these


hurried
man
he
derive
the
same
sense
of
safety
that
he
have
in


contemplate
his
grandfather
's
money
--
even
more
,
for
the
latter


appear
,
vaguely
,
a
demand
loan
make
by
the
world
to
Adam
Patch
's
own


moral
righteousness
,
while
this
money
down
-
town
seem
rather
to
have


be
grasp
and
hold
by
sheer
indomitable
strength
and
tremendous


feat
of
will
;
in
addition
,
it
seem
more
definitely
and


explicitly
--
money
.




closely
as
Anthony
trod
on
the
heel
of
his
income
,
he
consider
it
to


be
enough
.
some
golden
day
,
of
course
,
he
would
have
many
million
;


meanwhile
he
possess
a
_
raison
d'etre
_
in
the
theoretical
creation
of


essay
on
the
pope
of
the
Renaissance
.
this
flash
back
to
the


conversation
with
his
grandfather
immediately
upon
his
return
from
Rome
.




he
have
hope
to
find
his
grandfather
dead
,
but
have
learn
by


telephone
from
the
pier
that
Adam
Patch
be
comparatively
well


again
--
the
next
day
he
have
conceal
his
disappointment
and
go
out
to


tarrytown
.
five
mile
from
the
station
his
taxicab
enter
an


elaborately
groom
drive
that
thread
a
veritable
maze
of
wall
and


wire
fence
guard
the
estate
--
this
,
say
the
public
,
be
because
it


be
definitely
know
that
if
the
Socialists
have
their
way
,
one
of
the


first
man
they
'd
assassinate
would
be

Cross

.




Anthony

the

usher
Anthony
into
the

,
exhibit
his
redeemer
and


benefactor
as
though
he
be

a

of
immense
value
.




they

gravely
.
"
I
be
awfully
glad
to
hear

Anthony
say
.




the
senior
Patch
,
with
an
air
of
having

his
grandson

week
,
pull
out

he
ask
mildly
.




it
have
irritate
he
to
wait
for
Anthony
.
he
be
under
the
delusion
not


only
that
in
his
youth
he
have
handle
his
practical

scrupulousness

AFTERNOON




it
be
October
in
1913
,
midway
in
a
week
of
pleasant
day
,
with
the


sunshine
loitering
in
the
cross

street

the
atmosphere
so
languid
as


to
seem

with
ghostly
fall

pleasant

his

to

with
the

into
the


tub
,
and
as
he
look
at
the
picture
of
Hazel
Dawn
upon
the
wall
he
put


an
imaginary
violin
to
his
shoulder
and
softly
caress
it
with
a


phantom
bow
.
through
his
closed
lip
he
make
a
humming
noise
,
which
he


vaguely
imagine
resemble
the
sound
of
a
violin
.
after
a
moment
his


hand
cease
their
gyration

to
his
shirt
,

he
begin


to
unfasten

strip
,
and
adopt
an
athletic
posture

tiger

he
relax
into
a
state


of
drowsy
content

when
he
finish
his
bath

would
dress
leisurely


and
walk
down
Fifth
Avenue
to
the
Ritz
,
where
he
have
an
appointment
for


dinner
with
his
two
most
frequent
companion
,
Dick
Caramel

noble

afterward
he

Maury
be
go
to

probably
trot
home

his
book

pretty
soon

down

up
,
not

word
in
which
to
clothe


thought

thought
worthy
of

the
whole
thing
be


absurdly
beyond
his
desire
.




emerge
from
his
bath
he
polish
himself
with
the
meticulous
attention


of
a

.
then
he
wander
into
the
bedroom
,
and
whistle
the


while

uncertain
melody

then
pause
in

track
with
the
cigarette
two
inch

his


mouth

which
fall
faintly
ajar
.
his
eye
be
focusse
upon
a
spot
of


brilliant
color
on
the
roof
of
a
house
far
down
the
alley
.

of

afternoon
or
the


triumphant
vividness
of
red

he
feel
persistently
that
the

beautiful
--
then
of
a
sudden
he
understand
:
it
be
her
distance
,
not
a


rare
and
precious
distance
of
soul
but
still
distance
,

for
a
not

explain
second
,
pose


perversely
in
time

his
emotion

be
nearer
to
adoration
than
in
the


deep
kiss

he
finish
his
dressing

it


carefully
by
the
three

.
then
yield
to
an


impulse

obvious
satisfaction
.
his
day

a


jelly
-
like
creature
,
a
shapeless
,
spineless
thing
,
have
attain
Mesozoic


structure
.
it
be
march
along
surely
,
even
jauntily
,
toward
a
climax
,


as
a
play
should
,
as
a
day
should
.
he
dread
the
moment
when
the


backbone
of
the

should
be
break
,
when
he
should
have
meet
the

,
talk
to
she
,
and
then
bow
her
laughter
out

only
to
the
melancholy
dreg
in
the
teacup
and
the
gathering


staleness
of
the
uneaten
sandwich
.




there
be
a
grow
lack
of
color
in
Anthony
's
day
.
he
feel
it


constantly
and
sometimes
trace
it
to
a
talk
he
have
have
with
Maury
Noble


a
month
before
.
that
anything
so
ingenuous
,
so
priggish
,
as
a
sense
of


waste
should
oppress
he
be
absurd
,
but
there
be
no
deny
the
fact


that
some
unwelcome
survival
of
a
fetish
have
draw
he
three
week


before
down
to
the
public
library
,
where
,
by
the
token
of
Richard


Caramel
's
card
,
he
have
draw
out
half
a
dozen
book
on
the
italian


Renaissance
.
that
these
book
be
still
pile
on
his
desk
in
the


original
order
of
carriage
,
that
they
be
daily
increase
his


liability
by
twelve
cent
,
be
no
mitigation
of
their
testimony
.
they


be
cloth
and
morocco
witness
to
the
fact
of
his
defection
.
Anthony


have
have
several
hour
of
acute
and
startling
panic
.




in
justification
of
his
manner
of
living
there
be
first
,
of
course
,
the


meaninglessness
of
Life
.
as
aide
and
minister
,
page
and
squire
,


butler
and
lackey
to
this
great
Khan
there
be
a
thousand
book


glow
on
his
shelf
,
there
be
his
apartment
and
all
the
money
that


be
to
be
his
when
the
old
man
up
the
river
should
choke
on
his
last


morality
.
from
a
world
fraught
with
the
menace
of
débutante
and
the


stupidity
of
many
Geraldines
he
be
thankfully
deliver
--
rather
should


he
emulate
the
feline
immobility
of
Maury
and
wear
proudly
the


culminative
wisdom
of
the
numbered
generation
.




over
and
against
these
thing
be
something
which
his
brain
persistently


analyze
and
deal
with
as
a
tiresome
complex
but
which
,
though


logically
dispose
of
and
bravely
trample
under
foot
,
have
send
he
out


through
the
soft
slush
of
late
November
to
a
library
which
have
none
of


the
book
he
most
want
.
it
be
fair
to
analyze
Anthony
as
far
as
he


could
analyze
himself
;
far
than
that
it
be
,
of
course
,
presumption
.


he
find
in
himself
a
grow
horror
and
loneliness
.
the
idea
of
eat


alone
frighten
he
;
in
preference
he
dine
often
with
man
he
detest
.


travel
,
which
have
once
charm
he
,
seem
at
length
,
unendurable
,
a


business
of
color
without
substance
,
a
phantom
chase
after
his
own


dream
's
shadow
.




--If
I
be
essentially
weak
,
he
think
,
I
need
work
to
do
,
work
to
do
.


it
worry
he
to
think
that
he
be
,
after
all
,
a
facile
mediocrity
,


with
neither
the
poise
of
Maury
nor
the
enthusiasm
of
Dick
.
it
seem
a


tragedy
to
want
nothing
--
and
yet
he
want
something
,
something
.
he
know


in
flash
what
it
be
--
some
path
of
hope
to
lead
he
toward
what
he


think
be
an
imminent
and
ominous
old
age
.




after
cocktail
and
luncheon
at
the
University
Club
Anthony
feel
well
.


he
have
run
into
two
man
from
his
class
at
Harvard
,
and
in
contrast
to


the
gray
heaviness
of
their
conversation
his
life
assume
color
.
both
of


they
be
married
:
one
spend
his
coffee
time
in
sketch
an


extra
-
nuptial
adventure
to
the
bland
and
appreciative
smile
of
the


other
.
both
of
they
,
he
think
,
be
Mr.
Gilberts
in
embryo
;
the
number


of
their
"
yes
be
"
would
have
to
be
quadruple
,
their
nature
crab
by


twenty
year
--
then
they
would
be
no
more
than
obsolete
and
break


machine
,
pseudo
-
wise
and
valueless
,
nurse
to
an
utter
senility
by
the


woman
they
have
break
.




ah
,
he
be
more
than
that
,
as
he
pace
the
long
carpet
in
the
lounge


after
dinner
,
pause
at
the
window
to
look
into
the
harried
street
.
he


be
Anthony
Patch
,
brilliant
,
magnetic
,
the
heir
of
many
year
and
many


man
.
this
be
his
world
now
--
and
that
last
strong
irony
he
crave
lie
in


the
offing
.




with
a
stray
boyishness
he
see
himself
a
power
upon
the
earth
;
with
his


grandfather
's
money
he
might
build
his
own
pedestal
and
be
a
Talleyrand
,


a
Lord
Verulam
.
the
clarity
of
his
mind
,
its
sophistication
,
its


versatile
intelligence
,
all
at
their
maturity
and
dominate
by
some


purpose

find
he
work

on
this
minor
his


dream
fade

work

:
he
try
to
imagine
himself
in
Congress
root


around
in
the
litter
of
that
incredible
pigsty
with
the
narrow
and


porcine
brow

make


plain
the
different
value
of
her
profile
,
the
wonderfully
alive


expression
of
her
mouth

the
authentic
distinction

there

a
hush
upon
the

careless
violin

shrill

away

the
freshness
of
her
cheek
be
a
gossamer


projection
from
a

of
delicate

undiscovered
shade

she

in

with
this
docile
hundred

the


rise

novelist

Muriel
Kane

originate
in
a
rise
family

East
Orange

short
rather
than
small

hover
audaciously
between
plumpness
and


width
.
her
hair
be
black
and
elaborately
arrange
.
this
,
in
conjunction


with
her
handsome
,
rather
bovine
eye
,
and
her
over
-
red
lip
,
combine


to
make
she
resemble
Theda
Bara
,
the
prominent
motion
picture
actress
.


People
tell
she
constantly
that
she

she
believe


they

she
suspect
hopefully
that
they
be
afraid
of
she
,
and
she
do


her
utmost
under
all
circumstance
to
give
the
impression
of
danger
.
an


imaginative
man
could
see
the
red
flag
that
she
constantly

,

again
:

with
dark
hair

vague

these
two

of
the
song
with
the
only


word

the
word

at

oh
,
Gloria
,
Gloria

a
cab
yawn
at
the
curb
.
as
it
move
off
like
a
boat
on
a
labyrinthine


ocean
and
lose
itself
among
the
inchoate
night
masse
of
the
great


building
,
among
the
now
still
,
now
strident
,
cry
and
clanging
,


Anthony
put
his
arm
around
the
girl
,
draw
she
over
to
he
and
kiss
she


damp
,
childish
mouth
.




she
be
silent
.
she
turn
her
face
up
to
he
,
pale
under
the
wisps
and


patch
of
light
that
trail
in
like
moonshine
through
a
foliage
.
she


eye
be
gleam
ripple
in
the
white
lake
of
her
face
;
the
shadow
of


her
hair
border
the
brow
with
a
persuasive
unintimate
dusk
.
no
love


be
there
,
surely
;
nor
the
imprint
of
any
love
.
her
beauty
be
cool
as


this
damp
breeze
,
as
the
moist
softness
of
her
own
lip
.




"
you
be
such
a
swan
in
this
light
,
"
he
whisper
after
a
moment
.
there


be
silence
as
murmurous
as
sound
.
there
be
pause
that
seem
about


to
shatter
and
be
only
to
be
snatch
back
to
oblivion
by
the


tighten
of
his
arm
about
she
and
the
sense
that
she
be
rest


there
as
a
catch
,
gossamer
feather
,
drift
in
out
of
the
dark
.
Anthony


laugh
,
noiselessly
and
exultantly
,
turn
his
face
up
and
away
from


she
,
half
in
an
overpower
rush
of
triumph
,
half
lest
her
sight
of
he


should
spoil
the
splendid
immobility
of
her
expression
.
such
a
kiss
--
it


be
a
flower
hold
against
the
face
,
never
to
be
describe
,
scarcely
to


be
remember
;
as
though
her
beauty
be
give
off
emanation
of
itself


which
settle
transiently
and
already
dissolve
upon
his
heart
.




...
the
building
fall
away
in
melted
shadow
;
this
be
the
Park
now
,


and
after
a
long
while
the
great
white
ghost
of
the
Metropolitan
Museum


move
majestically
past
,
echo
sonorously
to
the
rush
of
the
cab

"
why

"




her
eye
appear
to
regard
he
out
of
many
thousand
year
:
all
emotion


she
might
have
feel
,
all
word
she
might
have
utter
,
would
have
seem


inadequate
beside
the
adequacy
of
her
silence
,
ineloquent
against
the


eloquence
of
her
beauty
--
and
of
her
body
,
close
to

and
cool

up
with
roguishness
extraordinary

then
follow
an
incident
that
though
slight
in
itself
Anthony
have
cause


to
reflect
on
many
year
afterward

Joseph

lean
well
back


in

chair

with
a
peculiar
glance
,
in
which
several


emotion
be
curiously
and
inextricably
mingle
.
he
do
not
greet


gloria
except
by
rise
,
and
he
immediately
resume
a
conversation
with


Richard
Caramel
about
the
influence
of
literature
on
the


move
picture
.






MAGIC




the
stark
and
unexpected
miracle
of
a
night
fade
out
with
the
linger


death
of
the
last
star
and
the
premature
birth
of
the
first
newsboy
.


the
flame
retreat
to
some
remote
and
platonic
fire
;
the
white
heat
have


go
from
the
iron
and
the
glow
from
the
coal
.




along
the
shelf
of
Anthony
's
library
,
fill
a
wall
amply
,
creep
a


chill
and
insolent
pencil
of
sunlight

with
frigid
disapproval


thérèse
of
France
and
Ann
the
Superwoman

then
down
a
shelf
and
into
the


year
,

pityingly
on
the
over
-
invoke
shade
of
Helen
,
Thaïs
,


Salome
,
and
Cleopatra
.




Anthony
,
shave
and
bathe
,
sit
in
his
most
deeply
cushioned
chair
and


watch
it
until
at
the
steady
rising
of
the
sun
it
lie
glint
for
a


moment
on
the
silk
end
of
the
rug
--
and
go
out
.




it
be
ten
o'clock
.
the
Sunday
Times
,
scatter
about
his
foot
,


proclaim
by
rotogravure
and
editorial
,
by
social
revelation
and


sporting
sheet
,
that
the
world
have
be
tremendously
engross
during


the
past
week
in
the
business
of
move
toward
some
splendid
if
somewhat


indeterminate
goal
.
for
his
part
Anthony
have
be
once
to
his


grandfather
's
,
twice
to
his
broker
's
,
and
three
time
to
his


tailor's
--
and
in
the
last
hour
of
the
week
's
last
day
he
have
kiss
a


very
beautiful
and
charming
girl
.




when
he
reach
home
his
imagination
have
be
teem
with
high
pitch
,


unfamiliar
dream
.
there
be
suddenly
no
question
on
his
mind
,
no


eternal
problem
for
a
solution
and
resolution
.
he
have
experience
an


emotion
that
be
neither
mental
nor
physical
,
nor
merely
a
mixture
of


the
two
,
and
the
love
of
life
absorb
he
for
the
present
to
the


exclusion
of
all
else
.
he
be
content
to
let
the
experiment
remain


isolated
and
unique
.
almost
impersonally
he
be
convinced
that
no
woman


he
have
ever
meet
compare
in
any
way
with
Gloria
.
she
be
deeply
herself
;


she
be
immeasurably
sincere
--
of
these
thing
he
be
certain
.
beside
she


the
two
dozen
schoolgirl
and
debutante
,
young
married
woman
and
waif


and
stray
whom
he
have
know
be
so
many
female
,
in
the
word
's
most


contemptuous
sense
,
breeder
and
bearer
,
exude
still
that
faintly


odorous
atmosphere
of
the
cave
and
the
nursery
.




so
far
as
he
could
see
,
she
have
neither
submit
to
any
will
of
his
nor


caress
his
vanity
--
except
as
her
pleasure
in
his
company
be
a
caress
.


indeed
he
have
no
reason
for
think
she
have
give
he
aught
that
she


do
not
give
to
other
.
this
be
as
it
should
be
.
the
idea
of
an


entanglement
grow
out
of
the
evening
be
as
remote
as
it
would
have


be
repugnant
.
and
she
have
disclaim
and
bury
the
incident
with
a


decisive
untruth
.
here
be
two
young
people
with
fancy
enough
to


distinguish
a
game
from
its
reality
--
who
by
the
very
casualness
with


which
they
meet
and
pass
on
would
proclaim
themselves
unharmed
.




having
decide
this
he
go
to
the
phone
and
call
up
the
Plaza
Hotel
.




Gloria
be
out
.
her
mother
know
neither
where
she
have
go
nor
when
she


would
return
.




it
be
somehow
at
this
point
that
the
first
wrongness
in
the
case


assert
itself
.
there
be
an
element
of
callousness
,
almost
of


indecency
,
in
Gloria
's
absence
from
home
.
he
suspect
that
by
go
out


she
have
intrigue
he
into
a
disadvantage
.
return
she
would
find
his


name
,
and
smile
.
most
discreetly
!
he
should
have
wait
a
few
hour
in


order
to
drive
home
the
utter
inconsequence
with
which
he
regard
the


incident
.
what
an
asinine
blunder
!
she
would
think
he
consider
himself


particularly
favor
.
she
would
think
he
be
react
with
the
most


inept
intimacy
to
a
quite
trivial
episode
.




he
remember
that
during
the
previous
month
his
janitor
,
to
whom
he
have


deliver
a
rather
muddled
lecture
on
the
"
brother
-
hoove
man
,
"
have
come


up
next
day
and
,
on
the
basis
of
what
have
happen
the
night
before
,


seat
himself
in
the
window
seat
for
a
cordial
and
chatty
half
-
hour
.


Anthony
wonder
in
horror
if
Gloria
would
regard
he
as
he
have
regard


that
man
.
he
--
Anthony
Patch
!
Horror
!




it
never
occur
to
he
that
he
be
a
passive
thing
,
act
upon
by
an


influence
above
and
beyond
Gloria
,
that
he
be
merely
the
sensitive


plate
on
which
the
photograph
be
make
.
some
gargantuan
photographer
have


focusse
the
camera
on
Gloria
and
_
snap_!--the
poor
plate
could
but


develop
,
confine
like
all
thing
to
its
nature
.




but
Anthony
,
lie
upon
his
couch
and
stare
at
the
orange
lamp
,
pass


his
thin
finger
incessantly
through
his
dark
hair
and
make
new
symbol


for
the
hour
.
she
be
in
a
shop
now
,
it
seem
,
move
lithely
among


the
velvet
and
the
fur
,
her
own
dress
make
,
as
she
walk
,
a


debonair
rustle
in
that
world
of
silken
rustle
and
cool
soprano


laughter
and
scent
of
many
slay
but
live
flower
.
the
Minnies
and


pearl
and
jewel
and
jenny
would
gather
round
she
like
courtier
,


bear
wispy
frailty
of
Georgette
crepe
,
delicate
chiffon
to
echo
she


cheek
in
faint
pastel
,
milky
lace
to
rest
in
pale
disarray
against
she


neck
--
damask
be
use
but
to
cover
priest
and
divan
in
these
day
,
and


cloth
of
Samarand
be
remember
only
by
the
romantic
poet
.




she
would
go
elsewhere
after
a
while
,
tilt
her
head
a
hundred
way


under
a
hundred
bonnet
,
seek
in
vain
for
mock
cherry
to
match
she


lip
or
plume
that
be
graceful
as
her
own
supple
body
.




noon
would
come
--
she
would
hurry
along
Fifth
Avenue
,
a
Nordic
Ganymede
,


her
fur
coat
swinge
fashionably
with
her
step
,
her
cheek
red
by
a


stroke
of
the
wind
's
brush
,
her
breath
a
delightful
mist
upon
the


brace
air
--
and
the
door
of
the
Ritz
would
revolve
,
the
crowd
would


divide
,
fifty
masculine
eye
would
start
,
stare
,
as
she
give
back


forget
dream
to
the
husband
of
many
obese
and
comic
woman
.




one
o'clock
.
with
her
fork
she
would
tantalize
the
heart
of
an
adoring


artichoke
,
while
her
escort
serve
himself
up
in
the
thick
,
dripping


sentence
of
an
enrapture
man
.




four
o'clock
:
her
little
foot
move
to
melody
,
her
face
distinct
in
the


crowd
,
her
partner
happy
as
a
petted
puppy
and
mad
as
the
immemorial


hatter
....
then
--
then
night
would
come
drift
down
and
perhaps
another


damp
.
the
sign
would
spill
their
light
into
the
street
.
who
know
?
no


wise
than
he
,
they
haply
seek
to
recapture
that
picture
do
in
cream


and
shadow
they
have
see
on
the
hush
Avenue
the
night
before
.
and
they


might
,
ah
,
they
might
!
a
thousand
taxi
would
yawn
at
a
thousand


corner
,
and
only
to
he
be
that
kiss

perfume
,
irresistible
and
sweet
.




afterward
,
neither
the
next
day
nor
after
many
year
,
could
he
remember


the
important
thing
of
that
afternoon
.
have
she
be
move
?
in
his
arm


have
she
speak
a
little
--
or
at
all
?
what
measure
of
enjoyment
have
she


take
in
his
kiss
?
and
have
she
at
any
time
lose
herself
ever


so
little
?




oh
,
for
he
there
be
no
doubt
.
he
have
rise
and
pace
the
floor
in


sheer
ecstasy
.
that
such
a
girl
should
be
;
should
poise
curl
in
a


corner
of
the
couch
like
a
swallow
newly
land
from
a
clean
swift


flight
,
watch
he
with
inscrutable
eye
.
he
would
stop
his
pacing


and
,
half
shy
each
time
at
first
,
drop
his
arm
around
she
and
find


her
kiss
.




she
be
fascinating
,
he
tell
she
.
he
have
never
meet
any
one
like
she


before
.
he
beseech
her
jauntily
but
earnestly
to
send
he
away
;
he


do
n't
want
to
fall
in
love
.
he
be
n't
come
to
see
she
any


more
--
already
she
have
haunt
too
many
of
his
way
.




what
delicious
romance
!
his
true
reaction
be
neither
fear
nor


sorrow
--
only
this
deep
delight
in
be
with
she
that
color
the


banality
of
his
word
and
make
the
mawkish
seem
sad
and
the
posturing


seem
wise
.
he
_
would
_
come
back
--
eternally
.
he
should
have
know
!




"
this
be
all
.
it
be
be
very
rare
to
have
know
you
,
very
strange
and


wonderful
.
but
this
would
n't
do
--
and
would
n't
last
.
"
as
he
speak
there


be
in
his
heart
that
tremulousness
that
we
take
for
sincerity
in


ourselves
.




afterward
he
remember
one
reply
of
hers
to
something
he
have
ask
she
.


he
remember
it
in
this
form
--
perhaps
he
have
unconsciously
arrange
and


polish
it
:




"
a
woman
should
be
able
to
kiss
a
man
beautifully
and
romantically


without
any
desire
to
be
either
his
wife
or
his
mistress
.
"




as
always
when
he
be
with
she
she
seem
to
grow
gradually
old
until


at
the
end
rumination
too
deep
for
word
would
be
winter
in


her
eye
.




an
hour
pass
,
and
the
fire
leap
up
in
little
ecstasy
as
though
its


fade
life
be
sweet
.
it
be
five
now
,
and
the
clock
over
the
mantel


become
articulate
in
sound
.
then
as
if
a
brutish
sensibility
in
he
be

by
those
thin
,
tinny

,
Anthony
pull
she
quickly
to
her
foot
and
hold


her
helpless
,
without
breath
,
in
a
kiss
that
be
neither
a
game
nor


a
tribute
.




her
arm
fall
to
her
side

in
an
instant

gaze
straight
before

a
frown

gather
between

Anthony
sink
down
beside

and
close
his

over

he
be
aware
of
a
certain
irremediable
lack
of
originality
in
his


remark

indeed
he
feel
that
the

she

PANIC




the
man
have
have
the
hard
blow
of
his
life
.
he
know
at
last
what
he


want
,
but
in
find
it
out
it
seem
that
he
have
put
it
forever


beyond
his
grasp
.
he
reach
home
in
misery
,
drop
into
an
armchair


without
even
remove
his
overcoat
,
and
sit
there
for
over
an
hour
,
his


mind
race
the
path
of
fruitless
and
wretched
self
-
absorption
.
she
have


send
he
away
!
that
be
the
reiterated
burden
of
his
despair
.
instead
of


seize
the
girl
and
hold
she
by
sheer
strength
until
she
become


passive
to
his
desire
,
instead
of
beat
down
her
will
by
the
force
of


his
own
,
he
have
walk
,
defeat
and
powerless
,
from
her
door
,
with
the


corner
of
his
mouth
droop
and
what
force
there
might
have
be
in


his
grief
and
rage
hide
behind
the
manner
of
a
whip
schoolboy
.
at


one
minute
she
have
like
he
tremendously
--
ah
,
she
have
nearly
love
he
.


in
the
next
he
have
become
a
thing
of
indifference
to
she
,
an
insolent


and
efficiently
humiliate
man
.




he
have
no
great
self
-
reproach
--
some
,
of
course
,
but
there
be
other


thing
dominant
in
he
now
,
far
more
urgent
.
he
be
not
so
much
in
love


with
Gloria
as
mad
for
she
.
unless
he
could
have
she
near
he
again
,


kiss
she
,
hold
she
close
and
acquiescent
,
he
want
nothing
more
from


life
.
by
her
three
minute
of
utter
unwavering
indifference
the
girl
have


lift
herself
from
a
high
but
somehow
casual
position
in
his
mind
,
to


be
instead
his
complete
preoccupation
.
however
much
his
wild
thought


varied
between
a
passionate
desire
for
her
kiss
and
an
equally


passionate
craving
to
hurt
and
mar
she
,
the
residue
of
his
mind
crave


in
fine
fashion
to
possess
the
triumphant
soul
that
have
shine
through


those
three
minute
.
she
be
beautiful
--
but
especially
she
be
without


mercy
.
he
must
own
that
strength
that
could
send
he
away
.




at
present
no
such
analysis
be
possible
to
Anthony
.
his
clarity
of


mind
,
all
those
endless
resource
which
he
think
his
irony
have
bring


he
be
sweep
aside
.
not
only
for
that
night
but
for
the
day
and
week


that
follow
his
book
be
to
be
but
furniture
and
his
friend
only


people
who
live
and
walk
in
a
nebulous
outer
world
from
which
he
be


try
to
escape
--
that
world
be
cold
and
full
of
bleak
wind
,
and
for
a


little
while
he
have
see
into
a
warm
house
where
fire
shine
.




about
midnight
he
begin
to

go
down
into


fifty

it
be
so
cold

the
moisture
freeze
on
his
lash
and
in
the
corner
of
his
lip
.


everywhere
dreariness
have
come
down
from
the

upon
the

cheerless

along

Anthony
turn
over
toward
Sixth

again
,
pile
a
sort
of
terror
upon
the
ache
and


yearning
.
he
have
lose
she
.
it
be
true
--
no
deny
it
,
no
soften
it
.


but
a
new
idea
have
sear
his
sky
--
what
of
Bloeckman
!
what
would
happen


now
?
there
be
a
wealthy
man
,
middle
-
aged
enough
to
be
tolerant
with
a


beautiful
wife
,
to
baby
her
whim
and
indulge
her
unreason
,
to
wear
she


as
she
perhaps
wish
to
be
wear
--
a
bright
flower
in
his
button
-
hole
,


safe
and
secure
from
the
thing
she
fear
.
he
feel
that
she
have
be


play
with
the
idea
of
marry
Bloeckman
,
and
it
be
well
possible


that
this
disappointment
in
Anthony
might
throw
she
on
sudden
impulse


into
Bloeckman
's
arm
.




the
idea
drive
he
childishly
frantic
.
he
want
to
kill
Bloeckman
and


make
he
suffer
for
his
hideous
presumption
.
he
be
say
this
over
and


over
to
himself
with
his
tooth
tight
shut
,
and
a
perfect
orgy
of
hate


and
fright
in
his
eye
.




but
,
behind
this
obscene
jealousy
,
Anthony
be
in
love
at
last
,


profoundly
and
truly
in
love
,
as
the
word
go
between
man
and
woman
.




his
coffee
appear
at
his
elbow
and
give
off
for
a
certain
time
a


gradually
diminish
wisp
of
steam
.
the
night
manager
,
seat
at
his


desk
,
glance
at
the
motionless
figure
alone
at
the
last
table
,
and
then


with
a
sigh
move
down
upon
he
just
as
the
hour
hand
cross
the
figure


three
on
the
big
clock
.






wisdom




after
another
day
the
turmoil
subside
and
Anthony
begin
to
exercise
a


measure
of
reason
.
he
be
in
love
--
he
cry
it
passionately
to
himself
.


the
thing
that
a
week
before
would
have
seem
insuperable
obstacle
,


his
limited
income
,
his
desire
to
be
irresponsible
and
independent
,
have


in
this
forty
hour
become
the
mere
chaff
before
the
wind
of
his


infatuation
.
if
he
do
not
marry
she
his
life
would
be
a
feeble
parody


on
his
own
adolescence
.
to
be
able
to
face
people
and
to
endure
the


constant
reminder
of
Gloria
that
all
existence
have
become
,
it
be


necessary
for
he
to
have
hope
.
so
he
build
hope
desperately
and


tenaciously
out
of
the
stuff
of
his
dream
,
a
hope
flimsy
enough
,
to
be


sure
,
a
hope
that
be
crack
and
dissipate
a
dozen
time
a
day
,
a
hope


mother
by
mockery
,
but
,
nevertheless
,
a
hope
that
would
be
brawn
and


sinew
to
his
self
-
respect
.




out
of
this
develop
a
spark
of
wisdom
,
a
true
perception
of
his
own


from
out
the
effortless
past
.




"
memory
be
short
,
"
he
think
.




so
very
short
.
at
the
crucial
point
the
Trust
President
be
on
the
stand
,


a
potential
criminal
needing
but
one
push
to
be
a
jailbird
,
scorn
by


the
upright
for
league
around
.
let
he
be
acquit
--
and
in
a
year
all


be
forget
.
"
yes
,
he
do
have
some
trouble
once
,
just
a
technicality
,


I
believe
.
"
oh
,
memory
be
very
short
!




Anthony
have
see
Gloria
altogether
about
a
dozen
time
,
say
two
dozen


hour
.
supposing
he
leave
she
alone
for
a
month
,
make
no
attempt
to
see


she
or
speak
to
she
,
and
avoid
every
place
where
she
might
possibly


be
.
be
n't
it
possible
,
the
more
possible
because
she
have
never
love


he
,
that
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
rush
of
event
would
efface
his


personality
from
her
conscious
mind
,
and
with
his
personality
his


offense
and
humiliation
?
she
would
forget
,
for
there
would
be
other
man
.


he
wince
.
the
implication
strike
out
at
he
--
other
man
.
two


month
--
God
!
well
three
week
,
two
weeks----




he
think
this
the
second
evening
after
the
catastrophe
when
he
be


undressing
,
and
at
this
point
he
throw
himself
down
on
the
bed
and
lie


there
,
tremble
very
slightly
and
look
at
the
top
of
the
canopy
.




two
week
--
that
be
bad
than
no
time
at
all
.
in
two
week
he
would


approach
she
much
as
he
would
have
to
now
,
without
personality
or


confidence
--
remain
still
the
man
who
have
go
too
far
and
then
for
a


period
that
in
time
be
but
a
moment
but
in
fact
an
eternity
,
whine
.


no
,
two
week
be
too
short
a
time
.
whatever
poignancy
there
have
be


for
she
in
that
afternoon
must
have
time
to
dull
.
he
must
give
she
a


period
when
the
incident
should
fade
,
and
then
a
new
period
when
she


should
gradually
begin
to
think
of
he
,
no
matter
how
dimly
,
with
a
true


perspective
that
would
remember
his
pleasantness
as
well
as
his


humiliation
.




he
fix
,
finally
,
on
six
week
as
approximately
the
interval
good


suit
to
his
purpose
,
and
on
a
desk
calendar
he
mark
the
day
off
,


find
that
it
would
fall
on
the
ninth
of
April
.
very
well
,
on
that
day


he
would
phone
and
ask
she
if
he
might
call
.
until
then
--
silence
.




after
his
decision
a
gradual
improvement
be
manifest
.
he
have
take
at


least
a
step
in
the
direction
to
which
hope
point
,
and
he
realize


that
the
less
he
brood
upon
she
the
well
he
would
be
able
to
give


the
desire
impression
when
they
meet
.




in
another
hour
he
fall
into
a
deep
sleep
.






the
interval




nevertheless
,
though
,
as
the
day
pass
,
the
glory
of
her
hair
dim


perceptibly
for
he
and
in
a
year
of
separation
might
have
depart


completely
,
the
six
week
hold
many
abominable
day
.
he
dread
the


sight
of
Dick
and
Maury
,
imagine
wildly
that
they
know
all
--
but
when


the
three
meet
it
be
Richard
Caramel
and
not
Anthony
who
be
the
centre


of
attention
;
"
the
Demon
Lover
"
have
be
accept
for
immediate


publication
.
Anthony
feel
that
from
now
on
he
move
apart
.
he
no
long


crave
the
warmth
and
security
of
Maury
's
society
which
have
cheer
he


no
far
back
than
November
.
only
Gloria
could
give
that
now
and
no


one
else
ever
again
.
so
Dick
's
success
rejoice
he
only
casually
and


worry
he
not
a
little
.
it
mean
that
the
world
be
go


ahead
--

and
reading
and
publishing
--
and
live
.
and
he
want
the


world
to
wait
motionless
and
breathless
for
six
week
--
while


Gloria

two
encounter




his
great
satisfaction
be
in

to
dinner
and
the
theatre
and
entertain
she
several
time
in

that
worry
over

to
the
utmost
for
its
short
moment

to
Geraldine

in


definite
pigeonhole
:
a
kiss

one
thing
,
anything
far
be
quite


another
;
a
kiss
be
all
right
;
the
other
thing
be
"
bad
.
"




when
half
the
interval

up
two

occur
on
successive
day


that
upset
his
increase
calm
and
cause
a
temporary
relapse
.




the
first

when
it
be
over

down
a
column
of
the
Sun
three
time
in
succession
without

a
rectangular
world


of
their

they
inspire
the

anything

often
he
would

trace
these
portentous


reticence

some
physical
discomfort

a
stormy
note

Anthony
,
understand
that
Gloria

her
strong
appeal

judge
how

with
remote

the

.
and
there
be
something
beyond
that
;

there
be
the


union
of

into
his
high

walled
room

,

,
that


evanescent
and
dissolving
sound

up
and


call
back
again
,
like

it
into
the
air
.
all
the
city
be


play
with
this
sound
out
there
in
the
blue
summer
dark
,
throw
it


up
and
call
it
back

a
little
while
,
life
would
be


beautiful
as
a

happiness

it
give
love

its
own
survival
.
it
could
do
no
more
.




it
be
then
that
a
new
note
separate
itself
jarringly
from
the
soft


cry
of
the
night
.
it
be
a
noise
from
an
areaway
within
a
hundred


foot
from
his
rear
window
,
the
noise
of
a
woman
's
laughter
.
it
begin


low
,
incessant
and
whine
--
some
servant
-
maid
with
her
fellow
,
he


think
--
and
then
it
grow
in
volume
and
become
hysterical
,
until
it


remind
he
of
a
girl
he
have
see
overcome
with
nervous
laughter
at
a


vaudeville
performance
.
then
it
sink
,
recede
,
only
to
rise
again
and


include
word
--
a
coarse
joke
,
some
bit
of
obscure
horseplay
he
could
not


distinguish
.
it
would
break
off
for
a
moment
and
he
would
just
catch
the


low
rumble
of
a
man
's
voice
,
then
begin
again
--
interminably
;
at
first


annoying
,
then
strangely
terrible
.
he
shiver
,
and
get
up
out
of


bed
go
to
the
window
.
it
have
reach
a
high
point
,
tense
and
stifle
,


almost
the
quality
of
a
scream
--
then
it
cease
and
leave
behind
it
a


silence
empty
and
menacing
as
the
great
silence
overhead
.
Anthony


stand
by
the
window
a
moment
long
before
he
return
to
his
bed
.
he


find
himself
upset
and
shake
.
try
as
he
might
to
strangle
his


reaction
,
some
animal
quality
in
that
unrestrained
laughter
have
grasp


at
his
imagination
,
and
for
the
first
time
in
four
month
arouse
his


old
aversion
and
horror
toward
all
the
business
of
life
.
the
room
have


grow
smothery
.
he
want
to
be
out
in
some
cool
and
bitter
breeze
,


mile
above
the
city
,
and
to
live
serene
and
detach
back
in
the


corner
of
his
mind
.
life
be
that
sound
out
there
,
that
ghastly


reiterate
female
sound
.




"

he
cry
,
draw
in
his
breath
sharply
.




bury
his
face
in
the
pillow
he
try
in
vain
to
concentrate
upon
the


detail
of
the
next
day
.






morning




in
the
gray
light
he
find
that
it
be
only
five
o'clock
.
he
regret


nervously
that
he
have
awaken
so
early
--
he
would
appear
fag
at
the


wedding
.
he
envy
Gloria
who
could
hide
her
fatigue
with
careful


pigmentation
.




in
his
bathroom
he
contemplate
himself
in
the
mirror
and
see
that
he


be
unusually
white
--
half
a
dozen
small
imperfection
stand
out
against


the
morning
pallor
of
his
complexion
,
and
overnight
he
have
grow
the


faint
stubble
of
a
beard
--
the
general
effect
,
he
fancy
,
be


unprepossesse
,
haggard
,
half
unwell
.




on
his
dressing
table
be
spread
a
number
of
article
which
he
tell


over
carefully
with
suddenly
fumble
finger

their
ticket
to


California

he
must
not
forget
to
give
to


Maury
,
and
,
most
important
of
all
,
the
ring
.
it
be
of
platinum
set


around
with

many


thing

pay
for
all

it
be

a
day

Anthony


discover
that
he
could
sit
again
late
into

evening

talk
with

of
those
tremendous
abstraction
that

the

of

they
clung
to
what
remain

love
linger

by
way
of
long
conversation
at
night
into
those
stark


hour
when
the
mind
thin
and
sharpen
and
the
borrowing
from
dream


become
the
stuff
of
all
life
,
by
way
of
deep
and
intimate
kindness


they
develop
toward
each
other
,
by
way
of
their
laugh
at
the
same


absurdity
and
think
the
same
thing
noble
and
the
same
thing
sad
.




it
be
,
first
of
all
,
a
time
of
discovery
.
the
thing
they
find
in
each


other
be
so
diverse
,
so
intermixed
and
,
moreover
,
so
sugar
with
love


as
to
seem
at
the
time
not
so
much
discovery
as
isolated
phenomenon
--
to


be
allow
for

to
be

Anthony
find
that
he
be

with
a
girl
of
tremendous
nervous
tension
and
of
the
most
high
-
handed


selfishness
.
Gloria
know
within
a
month
that
her
husband
be
an
utter


coward
toward
any
one
of
a
million
phantasm
create
by
his
imagination
.


her
perception
be
intermittent
,
for
this
cowardice
spring
out
,
become


almost
obscenely
evident
,
then
fade
and
vanish
as
though
it
have
be


only
a
creation
of
her
own
mind
.
her
reaction
to
it
be
not
those


attribute
to
her
sex

it
rouse
she
neither
to
disgust
nor
to
a


premature
feeling
of
motherhood
.
herself
almost
completely
without


physical
fear
,
she
be
unable
to
understand
,
and
so
she
make
the
most
of


what
she
feel
to
be
his
fear
's
redeem
feature
,
which
be
that
though


he
be
a
coward
under
a
shock
and
a
coward
under
a
strain
--
when
his


imagination
be
give
play
--
he
have
yet
a
sort
of
dash
recklessness


that
move
she
on
its
brief
occasion
almost
to
admiration
,
and
a
pride


that
usually
steady
he
when
he
think
he
be
observe
.




the
trait
first
show
itself
in
a
dozen
incident
of
little
more
than


nervousness
--
his
warning
to
a
taxi
-
driver
against
fast
driving
,
in


Chicago
;
his
refusal
to
take
she
to
a
certain
tough
café
she
have
always


wish
to
visit
;
these
of
course
admit
the
conventional


interpretation

that
it
be

she

have

;
nevertheless
,

culminative
weight

something
that

amusement

to
Gloria
it

never
quite
a
jest

it
be
,
at
first

keen
disappointment

one
of
the
time

the
management
of

hot
water

duty

so

that
much
pressure

by
this
much
yielding

that
much


force

arrogant


consciousness

a
brilliant
curtain
across
his


doorway

shut
out
the
light
of
the
sun
.
in
those
first
year
what


he
believe
bore
invariably
the
stamp
of
Gloria
;
he
see
the
sun
always


through
the
pattern
of
the
curtain
.




it
be
a
sort
of
lassitude
that
bring
they
back
to
Marietta
for


another
summer
.
through
a
golden
enervate
spring
they
have
loiter
,


restive
and
lazily
extravagant
,
along
the
California
coast
,
join


other
party
intermittently
and
drift
from
Pasadena
to
Coronado
,


from
Coronado
to
Santa
Barbara
,
with
no
purpose
more
apparent
than


Gloria
's
desire
to
dance
by
different
music
or
catch
some
infinitesimal


variant
among
the
change
color
of
the
sea
.
out
of
the
Pacific
there


rise
to
greet
they
savage
rockland
and
equally
barbaric
hostelry


build
that
at
tea
-
time
one
might
drowse
into
a
languid
wicker
bazaar


glorify
by
the
polo
costume
of
Southhampton
and
Lake
Forest
and


Newport
and
Palm
Beach
.
and
,
as
the
wave
meet
and
splash
and
glitter


in
the
most
placid
of
the
bay
,
so
they
join
this
group
and
that
,
and


with
they
shift
station
,
murmur
ever
of
those
strange


unsubstantial
gaiety
in
wait
just
over
the
next
green
and


fruitful
valley
.




a
simple
healthy
leisure
class
it
be
--
the
good
of
the
man
not


unpleasantly
undergraduate
--
they
seem
to
be
on
a
perpetual
candidate


list
for
some
etherealized
"
Porcellian
"
or
"
Skull
and
Bones
"
extend


out
indefinitely
into
the
world
;
the
woman
,
of
more
than
average
beauty
,


fragilely
athletic
,
somewhat
idiotic
as
hostess
but
charming
and


infinitely
decorative
as
guest
.
sedately
and
gracefully
they
dance
the


step
of
their
selection
in
the
balmy
tea
hour
,
accomplish
with
a


certain
dignity
the
movement
so
horribly
burlesque
by
clerk
and
chorus


girl
the
country
over
.
it
seem
ironic
that
in
this
lone
and


discredit
offspring
of
the
art
Americans
should
excel
,


unquestionably
.




having
dance
and
splash
through
a
lavish
spring
,
Anthony
and
Gloria


find
that
they
have
spend
too
much
money
and
for
this
must
go
into


retirement
for
a
certain
period
.
there
be
Anthony
's
"
work
,
"
they
say
.


almost
before
they
know
it
they
be
back
in
the
gray

more
aware


now
that

sleep
there
,

sit
upon

the


gray

green
field

the
black
bulk
of

it
be
the

only
under


the

of
several
high

ball

faintly
,
almost
imperceptibly
,


apathetic
toward

be
twenty

four
in
August


and
be
in
an
attractive
but
sincere
panic
about
it

to


thirty

she
be
less
in
love
with
Anthony
her
sense
of
the
flight


of
time
would
have
express
itself
in
a
reawaken
interest
in
other


man
,
in
a
deliberate
intention
of
extract
a
transient
gleam
of


romance
from
every
potential
lover
who
glance
at
she
with
lower
brow


over
a
shine
dinner
table
.
she
say
to
Anthony
one
day
:




"
how
I
feel

that
if
I
want
anything
I
'd
take
it
.
that
be
what
I
've


always
think
all
my
life
.
but
it
happen
that
I
want
you
,
and
so
I


just
have
n't
room
for
any
other
desire
.
"




they
be
bind
eastward
through
a
parched
and
lifeless
Indiana
,
and
she


have
look
up
from
one
of
her
beloved
move
picture
magazine
to
find
a


casual
conversation
suddenly
turn
grave
.




Anthony
frown
out
the
car
window
.
as
the
track
cross
a
country
road


a
farmer
appear
momentarily
in
his
wagon
;
he
be
chew
on
a
straw


and
be
apparently
the
same
farmer
they
have
pass
a
dozen
time
before
,


sit
in
silent
and
malignant
symbolism
.
as
Anthony
turn
to
Gloria


his
frown
intensify
.




"
you
worry
I

;
"
I
can
imagine

thing
I
want
.
my
way
be
not

to
want
nobody

you

"




"
yet
when
I

you
just
happen
to
take
a
fancy
to
some


one--
"




"
oh
,
do

exclaim
.
"
there
'd
be

emphatically
close

in
any
one
's
else

she


definitely
enjoy
he
--
she
love
he
.
so
the
summer
begin
very
much
as


have
the
one
before
.




there
be
,
however
,
one
radical
change
in
ménage
.
the
icy
-
hearted


Scandinavian
,
whose
austere
cooking
and
sardonic
manner
of
wait
on


table
have
so
depress
Gloria
,
give
way
to
an
exceedingly
efficient


Japanese
whose
name
be
Tanalahaka
,
but
who
confess
that
he
heed
any


summon
which
include
the
dissyllable
"
Tana
.
"




Tana
be
unusually
small
even
for
a
Japanese
,
and
display
a
somewhat


naïve
conception
of
himself
as
a
man
of
the
world
.
on
the
day
of
his


arrival
from
"
R.
Gugimoniki
,
japanese
Reliable
Employment
Agency
,
"
he


call
Anthony
into
his
room
to
see
the
treasure
of
his
trunk
.
these


include
a
large
collection
of
japanese
post
card
,
which
he
be
all
for


explain
to
his
employer
at
once
,
individually
and
at
great
length
.


among
they
be
half
a
dozen
of
pornographic
intent
and
plainly
of


american
origin
,
though
the
maker
have
modestly
omit
both
their
name


and
the
form
for
mailing
.
he
next
bring
out
some
of
his
own


handiwork
--
a
pair
of
american
pant
,
which
he
have
make
himself
,
and
two


suit
of
solid
silk
underwear
.
he
inform
Anthony
confidentially
as
to


the
purpose
for
which
these
latter
be
reserve
.
the
next
exhibit
be
a


rather
good
copy
of
an
etching
of
Abraham
Lincoln
,
to
whose
face
he
have


give
an
unmistakable
japanese
cast
.
last
come
a
flute
;
he
have
make
it


himself
but
it
be
break
:
he
be
go
to
fix
it
soon
.




after
these
polite
formality
,
which
Anthony
conjecture
must
be
native


to
Japan
,
Tana
deliver
a
long
harangue
in
splinter
English
on
the


relation
of
master
and
servant
from
which
Anthony
gather
that
he
have


work
on
large
estate
but
have
always
quarrel
with
the
other


servant
because
they
be
not
honest
.
they
have
a
great
time
over
the


word
"
honest
,
"
and
in
fact
become
rather
irritated
with
each
other
,


because
Anthony
persist
stubbornly
that
Tana
be
try
to
say


"
hornet
,
"
and
even
go
to
the
extent
of
buzz
in
the
manner
of
a
bee


and
flap
his
arm
to
imitate
wing
.




after
three
-
quarter
of
an
hour
Anthony
be
release
with
the
warm


assurance
that
they
would
have
other
nice
chat
in
which
Tana
would
tell


"
how
we
do
in
my
countree
.
"




such
be
Tana
's
garrulous
première
in
the
gray
house
--
and
he
fulfil


its
promise
.
though
he
be
conscientious
and
honorable
,
he
be


unquestionably
a
terrific
bore
.
he
seem
unable
to
control
his
tongue
,


sometimes
continue
from
paragraph
to
paragraph
with
a
look
akin
to


pain
in
his
small
brown
eye
.




Sunday
and
Monday
afternoon
he
read
the
comic
section
of
the


newspaper
.
one
cartoon
which
contain
a
facetious
japanese
butler

he
claim
that
the
protagonist
,
who
to


Anthony
appear
clearly
oriental
,

really
an
american

the


difficulty
with
the
funny
paper

that
when
,

by
Anthony

he
have


spell
out
the
last
three
picture
and
assimilate
their
context
with
a


concentration
surely
adequate
for
Kant
's
"
Critique
,
"
he
have
entirely


forget
what
the
first
picture
be
about

in
the
middle

Anthony

Anthony

at

to

impervious

obtain
with
one
magnificent
effort
a

infinitely
desirable

at
his
reticent
wife
,
Anthony


determined
to
"
get
something
to
do
,
"
for
the
winter
at
any

.
he


want
to
please
his
grandfather
and
even
,
in
a
measure
,
to
see
how
he


like
it
himself
.
he
discover
during
several
tentative
semi

for
a

so

"
as
the
grandson
of
Adam
Patch


he
be
receive
everywhere
with
marked
courtesy
,
but
the
old
man
be
a


back
number
now
--
the
heyday
of
his
fame
as
first
an
"
oppressor
"
and
then


an
uplifter
of
the
people

be
during
the
twenty
year

his


retirement
.
Anthony
even
find
several
of
the
young
man
who
be
under


the
impression
that
Adam
Patch
have
be
dead
for
some
year
.




eventually
Anthony
go
to
his
grandfather
and
ask
his
advice
,
which


turn
out
to
be
that
he
should
enter
the
bond
business
as
a
salesman
,
a


tedious
suggestion
to
Anthony
,
but
one
that
in
the
end
he
determine
to


follow
.
sheer
money
in
deft
manipulation
have
fascination
under
all


circumstance
,
while
almost
any
side
of
manufacturing
would
be


insufferably
dull
.
he
consider
newspaper
work
but
decide
that
the


hour
be
not
order
for
a
married
man
.
and
he
linger
over
pleasant


fancy
of
himself
either
as
editor
of
a
brilliant
weekly
of
opinion
,
an


American
Mercure
de
France
,
or
as
scintillant
producer
of
satiric
comedy


and
parisian
musical
revue
.
however
,
the
approach
to
these
latter


guild
seem
to
be
guard
by
professional
secret

man
drift
into


they
by
the
devious
highway
of

it
be
palpably


impossible
to
get
on
a
magazine
unless
you
have
be
on
one
before

so
in
the

of
his

fully


conversant
with

in
a
labyrinthine
escape


into
the
darkness
of
Central

.
finally
Anthony

Gloria
have
pay
a


call
on
some
wild
young
married

inordinately
,
their


overwrought
nerve
respond
as
acutely
and
janglingly
to
mirth
as
to


depression
.




Gloria

at
the
splendid
color

doll
,

what

bring

be
sorry

loose
one
cry

honor


toward

to
seek

the

,


in
the
case
of
a

mean
that
she
must
be
either
simple
and


reproachless
or
,
if
otherwise
,
must
possess
a
certain
solidity

strength

always
intensely
sceptical
of
her
sex

her
judgment

now

the
question

whether

be
not
clean

by


uncleanliness
she
mean
a
variety
of
thing

a
lack
of
pride
,
a


slackness
in
fibre

,
most
of
all
,
the
unmistakable
aura
of


promiscuity

"

animality

the
cunning

sort
of
animality

a
man
be
different

and
I
suppose
that

why
one
of


the

those

give
she
frank


homage

unfaile
entertainment

often
with
a
flash
of
insight


she
tell
Anthony
that
some
one

consequently

well

customarily
demur

insist
that
the
accuse

a
"
good
one

he
find
that
his


judgment
be
more
fallible

hers

memorably

soul

it

possible
for
she
to
hate
Anthony
for
as


much
as
a
full
day
,
to
be
carelessly
incense
at
he
for
as
long
as
a


week
.
Recrimination
have
displace
affection
as
an
indulgence
,
almost
as


an
entertainment
,

there

night
when
they

new


element
.
Gloria
realize
that
Anthony
have
become
capable
of
utter


indifference
toward
she
,
a
temporary
indifference
,
more
than
half


lethargic
,
but
one
from
which
she
could
no
long
stir
he
by
a


whisper
word
,
or
a
certain
intimate
smile
.
there
be
day
when
she


caress
affect
he
as
a
sort
of
suffocation

she
be
conscious
of


these
thing
;
she
never
entirely
admit
they
to
herself
.




it
be
only
recently
that
she
perceive
that
in
spite
of
her
adoration


of
he
,
her
jealousy
,
her
servitude
,
her
pride
,
she
fundamentally


despise
he
--
and
her
contempt
blend
indistinguishably
with
her
other


emotion
....
all
this
be
her
love
--
the
vital
and
feminine
illusion
that


have
direct
itself
toward

one
April
night
,
many
month

a

wretchedly
and
sentimentally
absorb
in
her
memory
for
the
remainder
of


life
.
he
seldom
take
pleasure
in
an
entire
day
spend
alone
with


she
--
except
on
occasion
he
prefer
to
have
a
third
person
with
they
.


there
be
time
when
he
feel
that
if
he
be
not
leave
absolutely
alone


he
would
go
mad
--
there
be
a
few
time
when
he
definitely
hate
she
.
in


his
cup
he
be
capable
of
short
attraction
toward

that
liquor
have
become
a
practical
necessity
to
their
amusement

not
an


uncommon
phenomenon
in
the
british
aristocracy
of
a
hundred
year
ago
,


but
a
somewhat
alarming
one
in
a
civilization
steadily
become
more


temperate

more
circumspect

both

incomplete

unmistakable
,
of
her
ancient

this
admission

coincidental

several

by
a

of

of

dormant
in
his
heart

by

by
the


suggestion

as
by

correspondent

upon
which
his

almost
to
a

step

one
day
just
before

the

in
carelessly

over

tell
he
what
his
contemporary
have
be
about
in
this
six


year

Most
of
they

several
be
convert
the
heathen
of
China

America
to
a
nebulous


protestantism

,
he
find
,
be
work
constructively
at
job


that
be
neither
sinecure
nor
routine

out

school

as


a
man
with
idea
transcend
both
vulgar
timeliness
and

a
man

suspend
from
the


faculty
of
a

university
for

:
in
art
,

,

,
he
see
the
authentic

his
time

there
be
even
Severance
,
the
quarter

who


have
give
up
his
life
rather
neatly
and
gracefully
with
the
Foreign


legion
on
the
Aisne
.




he
lay
down
the
magazine
and
think
for
a
while
about
these
diverse


man
.
in
the
day
of
his
integrity
he
would
have
defend
his
attitude
to


the
last
--
an
Epicurus
in
Nirvana
,
he
would
have
cry
that
to
struggle


be
to
believe
,
to
believe
be
to
limit
.
he
would
as
soon
have
become
a


churchgoer
because
the
prospect
of
immortality
gratify
he
as
he
would


have
consider
enter
the
leather
business
because
the
intensity
of


the
competition
would
have
keep
he
from
unhappiness
.
but
at
present
he


have
no
such
delicate
scruple
.
this
autumn
,
as
his
twenty
-
ninth
year


begin
,
he
be
inclined
to
close
his
mind
to
many
thing
,
to
avoid
pry


deeply
into
motive
and
first
cause
,
and
mostly
to
long
passionately
for


security
from
the
world
and
from
himself
.
he
hate
to
be
alone
,
as
have


be
say
he
often
dread
be
alone
with
Gloria
.




because
of
the
chasm
which
his
grandfather
's
visit
have
open
before


he
,
and
the
consequent
revulsion
from
his
late
mode
of
life
,
it
be


inevitable
that
he
should
look
around
in
this
suddenly
hostile
city
for


the
friend
and
environment
that
have
once
seem
the
warm
and
most


secure
.
his
first
step
be
a
desperate
attempt
to
get
back
his
old


apartment
.




in
the
spring
of
1912
he
have
sign
a
four
-
year
lease
at
seventeen


hundred
a
year
,
with
an
option
of
renewal
.
this
lease
have
expire
the


previous
May.
when
he
have
first
rent
the
room
they
have
be
mere


potentiality
,
scarcely
to
be
discern
as
that
,
but
Anthony
have
see


into
these
potentiality
and
arrange
in
the
lease
that
he
and
the


landlord
should
each
spend
a
certain
amount
in
improvement
.
rent
have


go
up
in
the
past
four
year
,
and
last
spring
when
Anthony
have
waive


his
option
the
landlord
,
a
Mr.
Sohenberg
,
have
realize
that
he
could
get


a
much
big
price
for
what
be
now
a
prepossess
apartment
.


accordingly
,
when
Anthony
approach
he
on
the
subject
in
September
he


be
meet
with
Sohenberg
's
offer
of
a
three
-
year
lease
at
twenty
-
five


hundred
a
year
.
this
,
it
seem
to
Anthony
,
be
outrageous
.
it
mean


that
well
over
a
third
of
their
income
would
be
consume
in
rent
.
in


vain
he
argue
that
his
own
money
,
his
own
idea
on
the
repartitioning
,


have
make
the
room
attractive
.




in
vain
he
offer
two
thousand
dollar
--
twenty
-
two
hundred
,
though
they


could
ill
afford
it
:
Mr.
Sohenberg
be
obdurate
.
it
seem
that
two


other
gentleman
be
consider
it
;
just
that
sort
of
an
apartment
be


in
demand
for
the
moment
,
and
it
would
scarcely
be
business
to
_
give
_
it


to
Mr.
Patch
.
besides
,
though
he
have
never
mention
it
before
,
several


of
the
other
tenant
have
complain
of
noise
during
the
previous


winter

singing
and
dancing

at

at
a
frantic

from
some
invisible
source

his

the
first
time
in
more
than
three
year


he
be
to

long
than
a

away
from

the
finality
of


it
appeal
to
he
drearily
.
it

his
clean
and
lovely

they

,
at
the
most
practical
financial

:

to
have
three
hundred
and
seventy
-
five
dollar

--
not
too
much
consider
that
over
half
of
that
would
go
in


rent
--
and
he
be
take
fifty
to
supplement
his
pay
.
he
see
no
need
for


more
:
food
,

,
and
quarter

be

--
there
be
no


social
obligation
for
a

the
car
be
crowded
and
already
thick

that
need
cleaning
.
nevertheless
,
Anthony


greet
it
with
relief
.
he
have
vaguely
expect
that
the
trip
South


would
be
make
in
a
freight

,
in
one
end
of
which
would
stand
eight

often

rock
down
the

with
his
barrack

sling
at
his
shoulder


like
a
monstrous
blue
sausage
,
he
see
no
vacant
seat
,
but
after
a


moment
his
eye
fall
on
a
single
space
at
present
occupy
by
the
foot
of


a
short
swarthy
Sicilian
,

,

up
with


a
scowl

to

he
must
have
adopt
it


as
a
defense
against
this
entire
gigantic
equation

at
Anthony
's
sharp

he
very
slowly
lift
the
foot
as
though
they
be
a


breakable
package
,
and
place
they

some

this

Anthony
have
a
good
look
at

he
be
young
,
thin
,
already


fade
;
he
be
like
his
own
mustache
;
he
be
like
a
great
piece
of
shiny


straw
.
his
chin
recede
,
faintly
;
this
be
offset
by
a
magnificent
and


unconvincing
scowl
,
a
scowl
that
Anthony
be
to
connect
with
the
face


of
many
young
officer

Anthony

to
the
hazy
oxidation
which

to
roll
back
and
forth
in
opalescent
cloud
with
every
motion

the

the
conversation

lapse
between
the
two
impressive


visit
of
the
young
officer
,
now
revive
tepidly
;
the
man
across
the


aisle
begin
make
clumsy
experiment
with
their
straw
seat
'
capacity


for
comparative
comfort
;
two
card

,
half
-
heartedly
begin
,
soon
draw


several
spectator
to
sit
position
on
the
arm
of
seat
.
in
a
few


minute
Anthony
become
aware
of
a
persistently
obnoxious
sound
--
the


small
,
defiant
Sicilian
have
fall
audibly
asleep
.
it
be
wearisome
to


contemplate
that
animate
protoplasm
,
reasonable
by
courtesy
only
,
shut


up
in
a
car
by
an
incomprehensible
civilization
,
take
somewhere
,
to
do


a
vague
something
without
aim
or
significance
or
consequence
.
Anthony


sigh
,
open
a
newspaper
which
he
have
no
recollection
of
buying
,
and


begin
to
read
by
the
dim
yellow
light
.




ten
o'clock
bump
stuffily
into
eleven
;
the
hour
clog
and
catch


and
slow
down
.
amazingly
the
train
halt
along
the
dark
countryside
,


from
time
to
time
indulge
in
short
,
deceitful
movement
backward
or


forward
,
and
whistle
harsh
paean
into
the
high
October
night
.
have


read
his
newspaper
through
,
editorial
,

,

,
his
eye


fall
on
a
half
-
column
head
_
Shakespeareville
,
Kansas
_
.
it
seem
that


the
Shakespeareville
Chamber
of
Commerce
have
recently
hold
an


enthusiastic
debate
as
to
whether
the
american
soldier
should
be
know


as
"
Sammies
"
or
"
Battling
Christians
.
"
the
thought
gag
he
.
he


drop
the
newspaper
,
yawn
,
and
let
his
mind
drift
off
at
a
tangent
.


he
wonder
why
Gloria
have
be
late
.
it
seem
so
long
ago
already
--
he


have
a
pang
of
illusive
loneliness
.
he
try
to
imagine
from
what
angle


she
would
regard
her
new
position
,
what
place
in
her
consideration
he


would
continue
to
hold
.
the
thought
act
as
a
further
depressant
--
he


open
his
paper
and
begin
to
read
again
.




the
member
of
the
Chamber
of
Commerce
in
Shakespeareville
have
decide


upon
"
Liberty
Lads
.
"




for
two
night
and
two
day
they
rattle
southward
,
make
mysterious


inexplicable
stop
in
what
be
apparently
arid
waste
,
and
then
rush


through
large
city
with
a
pompous
air
of
hurry
.
the
whimsicality
of


this
train
foreshadow
for
Anthony
the
whimsicality
of
all
army


administration
.




in
the
arid
waste
they
be
serve
from
the
baggage
-
car
with
bean
and


bacon
that
at
first
he
be
unable
to
eat
--
he
dine
scantily
on
some
milk


chocolate
distribute
by
a
village
canteen
.
but
on
the
second
day
the


baggage
-
car
's
output
begin
to
appear
surprisingly
palatable
.
on
the


third
morning
the
rumor
be
pass
along
that
within
the
hour
they
would


arrive
at
their
destination
,
Camp
Hooker
.




it
have
become
intolerably
hot
in
the
car
,
and
the
man
be
all
in
shirt


sleeve
.
the
sun
come
in
through
the
window
,
a
tired
and
ancient
sun
,


yellow
as
parchment
and
stretch
out
of
shape
in
transit
.
it
try
to


enter
in
triumphant
square
and
produce
only
warped
splotch
--
but
it


be
appallingly
steady
;
so
much
so
that
it
disturb
Anthony
not
to
be


the
pivot
of
all
the
inconsequential
sawmill
and
tree
and
telegraph


pole

be
turn
around

so
fast
.
outside
it
play
its
heavy


tremolo
over
olive
road

fallow
cotton

field
,
back
of
which
run
a


ragged
line
of
wood

with
eminence
of
gray
rock
.
the
foreground


be
dot
sparsely
with
wretched
,
ill

patch
shanty
,
among
which


there
would
flash
by
,
now
and
then
,
a
speciman
of
the
languid
yokelry
of


South
Carolina
,
or
else
a
stroll
darky
with
sullen
and


bewildered
eye
.




then
the
wood
move
off
and
they
roll
into
a
broad
space
like
the


bake
top
of
a
gigantic
cake

with
an
infinity
of
tent

surface

the
train
come
to
an
uncertain


stop
,
and
the
sun
and
the
pole
and
the
tree
fade
,
and
his
universe


rock
itself
slowly
back
to
its
old
usualness
,
with
Anthony
Patch
in


the
centre

as
the
man
,
weary
and
perspiring
,
crowd
out
of
the
car
,
he


smell
that
unforgetable
aroma
that

in

be
so
swollen
that
the


last
hour
of
the
afternoon
be
an
acute
torture
.
for
the
first
time

his
life
he
could
throw
himself
down
on
his
cot
between
dinner
and


afternoon
drill
-
call
,
and
seem
to
sink
with
each
moment
deep
into
a


bottomless
bed
,
drop
off
immediately
to
sleep
,
while
the
noise
and


laughter
around
he
fade
to
a
pleasant
drone
of
drowsy
summer
sound
.
in


the
morning
he
awake
stiff
and
aching
,
hollow
as
a
ghost
,
and
hurry


forth
to
meet
the
other
ghostly
figure
who
swarm
in
the
wan
company


street
,
while
a
harsh
bugle
shriek
and
splutter
at
the


gray
heaven
.




he
be
in
a
skeleton
infantry
company
of
about
a
hundred
man
.
after
the


invariable
breakfast
of
fatty
bacon
,
cold
toast
,
and
cereal
,
the
entire


hundred
would
rush
for
the
latrine
,
which
,
however
well
-
police
,
seem


always
intolerable
,
like
the
lavatory
in
cheap
hotel
.
out
on
the


field
,
then
,
in
ragged
order
--
the
lame
man
on
his
left
grotesquely


mar
Anthony
's
listless
effort
to
keep
in
step
,
the
platoon


sergeant
either
show
off
violently
to
impress
the
officer
and


recruit
,
or
else
quietly
lurk
in
close
to
the
line
of
march
,


avoid
both
labor
and
unnecessary
visibility
.




when
they
reach
the
field
,
work
begin
immediately
--
they
peel
off


their
shirt
for
calisthenic
.
this
be
the
only
part
of
the
day
that


Anthony
enjoy
.
Lieutenant
Kretching
,
who
preside
at
the
antic
,
be


sinewy
and
muscular
,
and
Anthony
,
follow
his
movement
faithfully
,


with
a
feeling
that
he
be
do
something
of
positive
value
to
himself
.


the
other
officer
and
sergeant
walk
about
among
the
man
with
the


malice
of
schoolboy
,
group
here
and
there
around
some
unfortunate


who
lack
muscular
control
,
give
he
confused
instruction
and


command
.
when
they
discover
a
particularly
forlorn
,
ill
-
nourish


speciman
,
they
would
linger
the
full
half
-
hour
making
cut
remark


and
snicker
among
themselves
.




one
little
officer
name
Hopkins
,
who
have
be
a
sergeant
in
the
regular


army
,
be
particularly
annoying
.
he
take
the
war
as
a
gift
of
revenge


from
the
high
god
to
himself
,
and
the
constant
burden
of
his
harangue


be
that
these
rookie
do
not
appreciate
the
full
gravity
and


responsibility
of
"
the
service
.
"
he
consider
that
by
a
combination
of


foresight
and
dauntless
efficiency
he
have
raise
himself
to
his
current


magnificence
.
he
ape
the
particular
tyranny
of
every
officer
under


whom
he
have
serve
in
time
go
by
.
his
frown
be
freeze
on
his


brow
--
before
give
a
private
a
pass
to
go
to
town
he
would
ponderously


weigh
the
effect
of
such
an
absence
upon
the
company
,
the
army
,
and
the


welfare
of
the
military
profession
the
world
over
.




Lieutenant
Kretching
,
blond
,
dull
and
phlegmatic
,
introduce
Anthony


ponderously
to
the
problem
of
attention
,
right
face
,
about
face
,
and
at


ease
.
his
principal
defect
be
his
forgetfulness
.
he
often
keep
the


company
strain
and
ache
at
attention
for
five
minute
while
he


stand
out
in
front
and
explain
a
new
movement
--
as
a
result
only
the
man


in
the
centre
know
what
it
be
all
about
--
those
on
both
flank
have
be


too
emphatically
impressed
with
the
necessity
of
stare
straight
ahead
.




the
drill
continue
until
noon
.
it
consist
of
stress
a
succession


of
infinitely
remote
detail
,
and
though
Anthony
perceive
that
this
be


consistent
with
the
logic
of
war
,
it
none
the
less
irritated
he
.
that


the
same
faulty
blood
-
pressure
which
would
have
be
indecent
in
an


officer
do
not
interfere
with
the
duty
of
a
private
be
a


preposterous
incongruity
.
sometimes
,
after
listen
to
a
sustained


invective
concern
with
a
dull
and
,
on
the
face
of
it
,
absurd
subject


know
as
military
"
courtesy
,
"
he
suspect
that
the
dim
purpose
of
the


war
be
to
let
the
regular
army
officer
--
man
with
the
mentality
and


aspiration
of
schoolboy
--
have
their
fling
with
some
real
slaughter
.
he


be
be
grotesquely
sacrifice
to
the
twenty
-
year
patience
of


a
Hopkins
!




of
his
three
tent
-
mate

a
flat

faced
,
conscientious
objector
from


Tennessee
,
a
big
,
scared
Pole
,

the
disdainful
Celt

he
have
sit


beside
on
the
train
--
the
two
former
spend
the
evening
in
writing


eternal
letter
home
,

the
Irishman
sit
in
the
tent
door
whistle


over
and
over
to
himself
half
a
dozen
shrill
and
monotonous
bird
-
call
.


it
be
rather
to
avoid
an
hour
of
their
company
than
with
any
hope
of


diversion
that
,

moment

exotic

expect
in
the
North
from
actress
in
this
familiar
comedy
,


but
a
soft
,
low
rippling
,

the
overflow
from
some
subtle
joke
,
into


which

it
be
an
advantage

Anthony
's
affair
with
Dorothy
Raycroft
be
an
inevitable
result
of
his


increase
carelessness
about
himself
.
he
do
not
go
to
she
desire
to


possess
the
desirable
,
nor
do
he
fall
before
a
personality
more
vital
,


more
compelling
than
his
own
,
as
he
have
do
with
Gloria
four
year


before
.
he
merely
slide
into
the
matter
through
his
inability
to
make


definite
judgment
.
he
could
say
"
no
!
"
neither
to
man
nor
woman
;


borrower
and
temptress
alike
find
he
tender
-
minded
and
pliable
.
indeed


he
seldom
make
decision
at
all
,
and
when
he
do
they
be
but


half
-
hysterical
resolve
form
in
the
panic
of
some
aghast
and


irreparable
awakening
.




the
particular
weakness
he
indulge
on
this
occasion
be
his
need
of


excitement
and
stimulus
from
without
.
he
feel
that
for
the
first
time
in


four
year
he
could
express
and
interpret
himself
anew
.
the
girl


promise
rest
;
the
hour
in
her
company
each
evening
alleviate
the


morbid
and
inevitably
futile
pounding
of
his
imagination
.
he
have
become


a
coward
in
earnest
--
completely
the
slave
of
a
hundred
disorder
and


prowl
thought
which
be
release
by
the
collapse
of
the
authentic


devotion
to
Gloria
that
have
be
the
chief
jailer
of
his
insufficiency
.




on
that
first
night
,
as
they
stand
by
the
gate
,
he
kiss
Dorothy
and


make
an
engagement
to
meet
she
the
follow
Saturday
.
then
he
go
out


to
camp
,
and
with
the
light
burn
lawlessly
in
his
tent
,
he
write
a


long
letter
to
Gloria
,
a
glow
letter
,
full
of
the
sentimental
dark
,


full
of
the
remembered
breath
of
flower
,
full
of
a
true
and
exceed


tenderness
--
these
thing
he
have
learn
again
for
a
moment
in
a
kiss


give
and
take
under
a
rich
warm
moonlight
just
an
hour
before
.




when
Saturday
night
come
he
find
Dot
wait
at
the
entrance
of
the


Bijou
Moving
Picture
Theatre
.
she
be
dress
as
on
the
precede


Wednesday
in
her
lilac
gown
of
frail
organdy
,
but
it
have
evidently


be
wash
and
starch
since
then
,
for
it
be
fresh
and
unrumpled
.


Daylight
confirm
the
impression
he
have
receive
that
in
a
sketchy
,


faulty
way
she
be
lovely
.
she
be
clean
,
her
feature
be
small
,


irregular
,
but
eloquent
and
appropriate
to
each
other
.
she
be
a
dark
,


unenduring
little
flower
--
yet
he
think
he
detect
in
she
some
quality


of
spiritual
reticence
,
of
strength
draw
from
her
passive
acceptance
of


all
thing
.
in
this
he
be
mistaken
.




Dorothy
Raycroft
be
nineteen
.
her
father
have
keep
a
small
,
unprosperous


corner
store
,
and
she
have
graduate
from
high
school
in
the
low


fourth
of
her
class
two
day
before
he
die
.
at
high
school
she
have


enjoy
a
rather
unsavory
reputation
.
as
a
matter
of
fact
her
behavior


at
the
class
picnic
,
where
the
rumor
start
,
have
be
merely


indiscreet
--
she
have
retain
her
technical
purity
until
over
a
year


later
.
the
boy
have
be
a
clerk
in
a
store
on
Jackson
Street
,
and
on
the


day
after
the
incident
he
depart
unexpectedly
to
New
York
.
he
have
be


intend
to
leave
for
some
time
,
but
have
tarry
for
the
consummation


of
his
amorous
enterprise
.




after
a
while
she
confide
the
adventure
to
a
girl
friend
,
and
later
,
as


she
watch
her
friend
disappear
down
the
sleepy
street
of
dusty


sunshine
she
know
in
a
flash
of
intuition
that
her
story
be
go
out


into
the
world
.
yet
after
tell
it
she
feel
much
well
,
and
a
little


bitter
,
and
make
as
near
an
approach
to
character
as
she
be
capable
of


by
walk
in
another
direction
and
meet
another
man
with
the
honest


intention
of
gratify
herself
again
.
as
a
rule
thing
happen
to
Dot
.


she
be
not
weak
,
because
there
be
nothing
in
she
to
tell
she
she
be


be
weak
.
she
be
not
strong
,
because
she
never
know
that
some
of
the


thing
she
do
be
brave
.
she
neither
defy
nor
conform
nor


compromise
.




she
have
no
sense
of
humor
,
but
,
to
take
its
place
,
a
happy
disposition


that
make
she
laugh
at
the
proper
time
when
she
be
with
man
.
she
have


no
definite
intention
--
sometimes
she
regret
vaguely
that
she


reputation
preclude
what
chance
she
have
ever
have
for
security
.
there


have
be
no
open
discovery
:
her
mother
be
interested
only
in
start


she
off
on
time
each
morning
for
the
jewelry
store
where
she
earn


fourteen
dollar
a
week
.
but
some
of
the
boy
she
have
know
in
high


school
now
look
the
other
way
when
they
be
walk
with
"
nice


girl
,
"
and
these
incident
hurt
her
feeling
.
when
they
occur
she


go
home
and
cry
.




besides
the
Jackson
Street
clerk
there
have
be
two
other
man
,
of
whom


the
first
be
a
naval
officer
,
who
pass
through
town
during
the
early


day
of
the
war
.
he
have
stay
over
a
night
to
make
a
connection
,
and


be
lean
idly
against
one
of
the
pillar
of
the
Stonewall
Hotel
when


she
pass
by
.
he
remain
in
town
four
day
.
she
think
she
love


he
--
lavish
on
he
that
first
hysteria
of
passion
that
would
have
go


to
the
pusillanimous
clerk
.
the
naval
officer
's
uniform
--
there
be
few


of
they
in
those
day
--
have
make
the
magic
.
he
leave
with
vague
promise


on
his
lip
,
and
,
once
on
the
train
,
rejoice
that
he
have
not
tell
she


his
real
name
.




her
resultant
depression
have
throw
she
into
the
arm
of
Cyrus
Fielding
,


the
son
of
a
local
clothier
,
who
have
hail
she
from
his
roadster
one


day
as
she
pass
along
the
sidewalk
.
she
have
always
know
he
by
name
.


have
she
be
bear
to
a
high
stratum
he
would
have
know
she
before
.


she
have
descend
a
little
low
--
so
he
meet
she
after
all
.
after
a
month


he
have
go
away
to
training
-
camp
,
a
little
afraid
of
the
intimacy
,
a


little
relieved
in
perceive
that
she
have
not
care
deeply
for
he
,
and


that
she
be
not
the
sort
who
would
ever
make
trouble
.
dot
romanticize


this
affair
and
concede
to
her
vanity
that
the
war
have
take
these
man


away
from
she
.
she
tell
herself
that
she
could
have
marry
the
naval


officer
.
nevertheless
,
it
worry
she
that
within
eight
month
there
have


be
three
man
in
her
life
.
she
think
with
more
fear
than
wonder
in


her
heart
that
she
would
soon
be
like
those
"
bad
girl
"
on
Jackson


street
at
whom
she
and
her
gum
-
chew
,
giggle
friend
have
stare
with


fascinated
glance
three
year
before
.




for
a
while
she
attempt
to
be
more
careful
.
she
let
man
"
pick
she
up
"
;


she
let
they
kiss
she
,
and
even
allow
certain
other
liberty
to
be


force
upon
she
,
but
she
do
not
add
to
her
trio
.
after
several
month


the
strength
of
her
resolution
--
or
rather
the
poignant
expediency
of
she


fear
--
be
wear
away
.
she
grow
restless
drowsing
there
out
of
life
and


time
while
the
summer
month
fade
.
the
soldier
she
meet
be
either


obviously
below
she
or
,
less
obviously
,
above
she
--
in
which
case
they


desire
only
to
use
she
;
they
be
Yankees
,
harsh
and
ungracious
;
they


swarm
in
large
crowd
....
and
then
she
meet
Anthony
.




on
that
first
evening
he
have
be
little
more
than
a
pleasantly
unhappy


face
,
a
voice
,
the
mean
with
which
to
pass
an
hour
,
but
when
she
keep


her
engagement
with

on
Saturday
she

consideration

she
like
he
.
unknowingly
she
see
her
own
tragedy
mirror
in


his
face
.




again
they
go
to
the
movie
,
again
they
wander
along
the
shadowy
,


scented
street
,
hand
in
hand
this
time
,
speak
a
little
in
hush


voice
.
they
pass
through
the
gate
--
up
toward
the
little
porch--




"

nurse
the
astounding
delusion

he
be
astutely
"
slip

over
"

government

the


impressive
income
of
fifty

five

.
he
look
upon
it
as
a


gorgeous
joke
that
he
have
play
upon
the
dozen
who
have
bully
and


scorn
he
since
he
be
a
Georgia
country
boy
of
nineteen

at
present
there
be
but
two
lieutenant
--
Hopkins
and
the
popular


kretche
.
the
latter
be
consider
a
good
fellow
and
a
fine
leader

a
year
later

he
disappear
with
a
mess

of
eleven


hundred
dollar

,
like
so
many
leader
,
prove
exceedingly
difficult


to
follow
.




eventually
there
be
Captain
Dunning
,
god
of
this
brief

self

suffice
microcosm
.
he
be
a
reserve
officer
,
nervous
,
energetic

enthusiastic
.
this
latter
quality
,
indeed
,
often
take
material
form


and
be
visible
as
fine
froth
in
the
corner
of
his
mouth
.
like
most


executive
he
see
his
charge
strictly
from
the
front
,

to
his


hopeful
eye
his
command
seem
just
such
an
excellent
unit
as
such
an


excellent

for
all
his
anxiety

he
be

fall
foul
of
he
the
second


week
of
drill
.
the
captain
have
several
time
order
the
man
to
be


clean
-
shaven
when
they
fall
in
each
morning
.
one
day
there
be
disclose


an
alarming
breech
of
this
rule
,
surely
a
case
of
Teutonic


connivance
--
during
the
night
four
man
have
grow
hair
upon
their
face
.


the
fact
that
three
of
the
four
understand
a
minimum
of
English
make
a


practical
object
-
lesson
only
the
more
necessary
,
so
Captain
Dunning


resolutely
send
a
volunteer
barber
back
to
the
company
street
for
a


razor
.
Whereupon
for
the
safety
of
democracy
a
half
-
ounce
of
hair
be


scrape
dry
from
the
cheek
of
three
Italians
and
one
Pole
.




outside
the
world
of
the
company
there
appear
,
from
time
to
time
,
the


colonel
,
a
heavy
man
with
snarl
tooth
,
who
circumnavigate
the


battalion

field
upon
a
handsome
black
horse
.
he
be
a
West


pointer

,
mimetically
,
a
gentleman
.
he
have
a
dowdy
wife
and
a
dowdy


mind
,
and
spend
much
of
his
time
in
town
take
advantage
of
the
army
's


lately
exalt
social
position
.
last
of
all
be
the
general
,
who


traverse
the
road
of
the
camp
precede
by
his
flag
--
a
figure
so


austere
,
so
removed
,
so
magnificent
,
as
to
be
scarcely
comprehensible
.




December
.
cool
wind
at
night
now
,
and
damp
,
chilly
morning
on
the


drill
-
ground
.
as
the
heat
fade
,
Anthony
find
himself
increasingly


glad
to
be
alive
.
renew
strangely
through
his
body
,
he
worry
little


and
exist
in
the
present
with
a
sort
of
animal
content
.
it
be
not


that
Gloria
or
the
life
that
Gloria
represent
be
less
often
in
his


thought
--
it
be
simply
that
she
become
,
day
by
day
,
less
real
,
less


vivid
.
for
a
week
they
have
correspond
passionately
,
almost


hysterically
--
then
by
an
unwritten
agreement
they
have
cease
to
write


more
than
twice
,
and
then
once
,
a
week
.
she
be
bored
,
she
say
;
if
his


brigade
be
to
be
there
a
long
time
she
be
come
down
to
join
he
.
Mr.


Haight
be
go
to
be
able
to
submit
a
strong
brief
than
he
have


expect
,
but
doubt
that
the
appeal
case
would
come
up
until
late


spring
.
Muriel
be
in
the
city
do
Red
Cross
work
,
and
they
go
out


together
rather
often
.
what
would
Anthony
think
if
_
she
_
go
into
the


Red
Cross
?
trouble
be
she
have
hear
that
she
might
have
to
bathe


negro
in
alcohol
,
and
after
that
she
have
n't
feel
so
patriotic
.
the


city
be
full
of
soldier
and
she
'd
see
a
lot
of
boy
she
have
n't
lay


eye
on
for
year
....




Anthony
do
not
want
she
to
come
South
.
he
tell
himself
that
this
be


for
many
reason
--
he
need
a
rest
from
she
and
she
from
he
.
she
would


be
bore
beyond
measure
in
town
,
and
she
would
be
able
to
see
Anthony


for
only
a
few
hour
each
day
.
but
in
his
heart
he
fear
that
it
be


because
he
be
attract
to
Dorothy
.
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
live
in


terror
that
Gloria
should
learn
by
some
chance
or
intention
of
the


relation
he
have
form
.
by
the
end
of
a
fortnight
the
entanglement
begin


to
give
he
moment
of
misery
at
his
own
faithlessness
.
nevertheless
,
as


each
day
end
he
be
unable
to
withstand
the
lure
that
would
draw
he


irresistibly
out
of
his
tent
and
over
to
the
telephone
at
the
Y.M.C.A.

"




"
oh
,

funny--
"
for
an
instant
he
have
a
memory
of
five
year


before

of
Geraldine
.
Then--




"
I
'll
arrive
about
eight
.
"




at
seven
he
would
be
in
a
jitney
bind
for
the
city
,
where
hundred
of


little
southern
girl
be
wait
on
moonlit
porch
for
their
lover
.


he
would
be
excite
already
for
her
warm
retarded
kiss
,
for
the
amazed


quietude
of
the
glance
she
give
he
--
glance
near
to
worship
than
any


he
have
ever
inspire
.
Gloria
and
he
have
be
equal
,
give
without


thought
of
thank
or
obligation
.
to
this
girl
his
very
caress
be
an


inestimable
boon
.
cry
quietly
she
have
confess
to
he
that
he
be


not
the
first
man
in
her
life
;
there
have
be
one
other
--
he
gather


that
the
affair
have
no
soon
commence
than
it
have
be
over
.




indeed
,
so
far
as
she
be
concern
,
she
speak
the
truth
.
she
have


forget
the
clerk
,
the
naval
officer
,
the
clothier
's
son
,
forget


her
vividness
of
emotion
,
which
be
true
forgetting
.
she
know
that
in


some
opaque
and
shadowy
existence
some
one
have
take
she
--
it
be
as


though
it
have
occur
in
sleep
.




almost
every
night
Anthony
come
to
town
.
it
be
too
cool
now
for
the


porch
,
so
her
mother
surrender
to
they
the
tiny
sitting
room
,
with
its


dozen
of
cheaply
frame
chromos
,
its
yard
upon
yard
of
decorative


fringe
,
and
its
thick
atmosphere
of
several
decade
in
the
proximity
of


the
kitchen
.
they
would
build
a
fire
--
then
,
happily
,
inexhaustibly
,
she


would
go
about
the
business
of
love
.
each
evening
at
ten
she
would
walk


with
he
to
the
door
,
her
black
hair
in
disarray
,
her
face
pale
without


cosmetic
,
paler
still
under
the
whiteness
of
the
moon
.
as
a
rule
it


would
be
bright
and
silver
outside
;
now
and
then
there
be
a
slow
warm


rain
,
too
indolent
,
almost
,
to
reach
the
ground
.




"
say
you
love
I
,
"
she
would
whisper
.




"
why
,
of
course
,
you
sweet
baby
.
"




"
be
I
a
baby
?
"
this
almost
wistfully
.




"
just
a
little
baby
.
"




she
know
vaguely
of
Gloria
.
it
give
her
pain
to
think
of
it
,
so
she


imagine
she
to
be
haughty
and
proud
and
cold
.
she
have
decide
that


Gloria
must
be
old
than
Anthony
,
and
that
there
be
no
love
between


husband
and
wife
.
sometimes
she
let
herself
dream
that
after
the
war


Anthony
would
get
a
divorce
and
they
would
be
marry
--
but
she
never


mention
this
to
Anthony
,
she
scarcely
know
why
.
she
share
his


company
's
idea
that
he
be

though
the
conversation
amuse
Anthony

it
do
generate
the
idea
that


life
would
be
more
amusing
as
a
sergeant

,
should
he
find
a
less

medical

as
an

he
be
little
interested
in


the
work

seem
to
belie
the

gallantry

he
marvel
at
how
quickly
the
system
have


grasp
he
.
he
be
a
soldier
--
all

the

it
occur
to
he
that

strongly
accentuate

as

divide
man
into
two

in

the
previous
autumn
until
he
begin


to
feel
a
drowsy
attachment
for
this
South
--
a
South
,
it
seem
,
more
of


algier
than

with
faded
aspiration

back
over


innumerable
generation
to
some
warm
,
primitive
Nirvana

to

the
uneventful
passage

Dorothy

undertone

evasion


of
all

the
pleasurable
minutiae

her
violet
eye
would


remain

reckless
,
she


bask
like
a

in

sun

wonder
what
the

spiritless


mother

moment

cynicism


she
ever
guess

.




on
Sunday
afternoon
they
walk
along
the
countryside
,
rest
at


interval
on
the
dry
moss
in
the

crystalline
and
cool
,
oblivious
to
the
intoxicate
heat


that
wait
outside
;
here
he
would
talk
,
intermittently
,
in
a
sleepy


monologue
,
in
a
conversation
of
no
significance
,
of
no
reply
.




July
came
scorch
down
.
Captain
Dunning
be
order

he

Little
Baptiste
have
never

anything

.
his
fear
make


matter
worse

he
reappear
in
the
orderly

one
day
and
tell

kick
at

he
say
;
he
be
no
good
at
the
work
.
finally
he


fall
on
his
knee
and
besought
Captain
Dunning
,
in
a
mixture
of
break


english
and
scriptural
italian
,
to
get

out

Captain

the

burst
out

and
tell
Baptiste
he
would
do
what
he
could
.
but
when
he
think
it
over


he
decide
that
he
could
n't
spare
a
well
man
.
little
Baptiste
go


from
bad
to
bad
.
the
horse
seem
to
divine
his
fear
and
take
every


advantage
of
it

two

angrily

have
to

up

in
this


last
fortnight
he
have
become
increasingly
aware
that
there
be


something
amiss

she
have
not
answer

he
have
wire
again

when
he


receive
no
word
he
imagine
that
she
might
be
out

but
it


occur
and
recur
to
he
that
she
be
not
out
of
town

a
series


of
distraught
imagining

to
plague

.
suppose
Gloria
,
bore


and
restless
,
have
find
some
one
,
even
as
he
have
.
the
thought
terrify


he
with
its
possibility
--
it
be
chiefly
because
he
have
be
so
sure
of


her
personal
integrity
that
he
have
consider
she
so
sparingly
during


the
year
.
and
now
,
as
a
doubt
be
bear
,
the
old
anger
,
the
rage
of


possession

swarm
back

thousandfold

what
more
natural
than
that
she


should
be
in

again

he
remember
the
Gloria
who
promise
that
should
she
ever
want


anything
,
she
would
take
it
,
insist
that
since
she
would
act
entirely


for
her
own
satisfaction
she
could
go
through
such
an
affair


unsmirche

it
be
only
the
effect
on
a
person
's
mind
that
count
,


anyhow
,
she
say
,
and
her
reaction
would
be
the
masculine
one
,
of


satiation
and
faint
dislike
.




but
that
have
be
when
they
be
first
married
.
later
,
with
the


discovery
that
she
could
be
jealous
of
Anthony
,
she
have
,
outwardly
at


least
,
change
her
mind
.
there
be
no
other
man
in
the
world
for
she
.


this
he
have
know
only
too
surely
.
perceive
that
a
certain


fastidiousness
would
restrain
she

he
have
grow
lax
in
preserve
the


completeness
of
her
love

,

all

rush
these
intolerable
thing
--
only
Anthony
could


know
what
a
state
of
blackness
there
would
be
if
the
bad
of
he
could


roam
his
consciousness
unchecked
.




the
heat
of
the
day
have
change
,
somehow
,
until
it
be
a
burnish


darkness
crush
down
upon
a
devastated
land
.
over
his
head
the
blue


circle
of
ominous
uncharted
sun
,
of
unnumbered
centre
of
fire
,


revolve
interminably
before
his
eye
as
though
he
be
lie
constantly


expose
to
the
hot
light
and
in
a
state
of
feverish
coma
.
at
seven
in


the
morning
something
phantasmal
,
something
almost
absurdly
unreal
that


he
know
be
his
mortal
body
,
go
out
with
seven
other
prisoner
and
two


guard
to
work
on
the
camp
road
.
one
day
they
load
and
unload


quantity
of
gravel
,
spread
it
,
rake
it
--
the
next
day
they
work
with


huge
barrel
of
red
-
hot
tar
,
flood
the
gravel
with
black
,
shine


pool
of
molten
heat
.
at
night
,
lock
up
in
the
guard
-
house
,
he
would


lie
without
thought
,
without
courage
to
compass
thought
,
stare
at
the


irregular
beam
of
the
ceiling
overhead
until
about
three
o'clock
,
when


he
would
slip
into
a
break
,
troubled
sleep
.




during
the
work
hour
he
labor
with
uneasy
haste
,
attempt
,
as
the


day
bore
toward
the
sultry
Mississippi
sunset
,
to
tire
himself


physically
so
that
in
the
evening
he
might
sleep
deeply
from
utter


exhaustion
....
then
one
afternoon
in
the
second
week
he
have
a
feeling


that
two
eye
be
watch
he
from
a
place
a
few
foot
beyond
one
of


the
guard
.
this
arouse
he
to
a
sort
of
terror
.
he
turn
his
back
on


the
eye
and
shovel
feverishly
,
until
it
become
necessary
for
he
to


face
about
and
go
for
more
gravel
.
then
they
enter
his
vision
again
,


and
his
already
taut
nerve
tighten
up
to
the
breaking
-
point
.
the
eye


be
leer
at
he
.
out
of
a
hot
silence
he
hear
his
name
call
in
a


tragic
voice
,
and
the
earth
tip
absurdly
back
and
forth
to
a
babel
of


shout
and
confusion
.




when
next
he
become
conscious
he
be
back
in
the
guard
-
house
,
and
the


other
prisoner
be
throw
he
curious
glance
.
the
eye
return
no


more
.
it
be
many
day
before
he
realize
that
the
voice
must
have
be


Dot
's
,
that
she
have
call
out
to
he
and
make
some
sort
of
disturbance
.


he
decide
this
just
previous
to
the
expiration
of
his
sentence
,
when


the
cloud
that
oppress
he
have
lift
,
leave
he
in
a
deep
,


dispirit
lethargy

fearsome

he

from

an

he
let

into
a

hinterland

when
the
regiment
reach
Camp
Mills
,
Long
Island
,
Anthony
's
single
idea


be
to
get
into
the
city
and
see
Gloria
as
soon
as
possible
.
it
be
now


evident
that
an
armistice
would
be
sign
within
the
week
,
but
rumor
have


it
that
in
any
case
troop
would
continue
to
be
ship
to
France
until


the
last
moment

Anthony
be
appal
at
the
notion
of
the
long
voyage
,


of
a
tedious
debarkation
at
a
french
port
,
and
of
be
keep
abroad
for


a
year
,
possibly
,
to
replace
the
troop
who
have
see
actual
fighting
.




his
intention
have
be
to
obtain
a
two
-
day
furlough
,
but
Camp
Mills


prove
to
be
under
a
strict
influenza
quarantine
--
it
be
impossible
for


even
an
officer
to
leave
except
on
official
business
.
for
a
private
it


be
out
of
the
question
.




the
camp
itself
be
a
dreary
muddle
,
cold
,
wind

sweep
,
and
filthy
,
with


the
accumulate
dirt
incident
to
the
passage

division

train
come
in

seven
one
night

in
line
until


one
while
a
military
tangle
be
straighten
out
somewhere
ahead
.


officer
run
up
and
down
ceaselessly
,
call
order
and
make
a
great


uproar
.
it
turn
out
that
the
trouble
be
due
to
the
colonel
,
who
be


in
a
righteous
temper
because
he
be
a
West
Pointer
,
and
the
war
be


go
to
stop
before
he
could
get
overseas

have
the
militant
government


realize
the
number
of
broken
heart
among
the
old
West
Pointers


during
that
week
,
they
would
indubitably
have
prolong
the
slaughter


another
month
.
the
thing
be
pitiable
!




gaze
out
at

expanse

for
mile
over
a

slush
and
snow

Anthony
see
the
impracticability
of


trudge
to
a
telephone
that
night
.

would
call
she
at
the
first


opportunity
in

morning

arouse
in
the
chill
and
bitter
dawn
he
stand
at
reveille
and
listen


to
a
passionate
harangue
from
Captain
Dunning
:




"
you
man
may
think
the
war
be
over
.
well
,
let
I
tell
you
,
it
be
n't
!


those
fellow
be
n't
go
to
sign
the
armistice
.
it
be
another
trick
,


and
we
'd
be
crazy
to
let
anything
slacken
up
here
in
the
company
,


because
,
let
I
tell
you
,
we
be
go
to
sail
from
here
within
a
week
,


and
when
we
do
we
be
go
to
see
some
real
fighting
.
"
he
pause
that


they
might
get
the
full
effect
of
his
pronouncement
.
and
then
:
"
if
you


think
the
war
be
over
,
just
talk
to
any
one
who
be
be
in
it
and
see
if


_
they
_
think
the
Germans
be
all
in
.
they
do
n't
.
nobody
do
.
I
've


talk
to
the
people
that
_
know
_
,
and
they
say
there
'll
be
,
anyways
,
a


year
long
of
war
.
_
they
_
do
n't
think
it
be
over
.
so
you
man
well
not


get
any
foolish
idea
that
it
be
.
"




doubly
stress
this
final
admonition
,
he
order
the
company


dismiss
.




at
noon
Anthony
set
off
at
a
run
for
the
near
canteen
telephone
.
as


he
approach
what
correspond
to
the
down
-
town
of
the
camp
,
he
notice


that
many
other
soldier
be
run
also
,
that
a
man
near
he
have


suddenly
leap
into
the
air
and
click
his
heel
together
.
the


tendency
to
run
become
general
,
and
from
little
excited
group
here
and


there
come
the
sound
of
cheer
.
he
stop
and
listen
--
over
the


cold
country
whistle
be
blow
and
the
chime
of
the
Garden
City


church
break
suddenly
into
reverberatory
sound
.




Anthony
begin
to
run
again
.
the
cry
be
clear
and
distinct
now
as


they
rise
with
cloud
of
frost
breath
into
the
chilly
air
:

ARMISTICE

evening
in
the
opaque
gloom
of
six
o'clock
Anthony
slip
between


two
freight
-
car
,
and
once
over
the
railroad
,
follow
the
track
along


to
Garden
City
,
where
he
catch
an
electric
train
for
New
York
.
he
stand


some
chance
of
apprehension
--
he
know
that
the
military
police
be
often


send
through
the
car
to
ask
for
pass
,
but
he
imagine
that
to
-
night


the
vigilance
would
be
relax
.
but
,
in
any
event
,
he
would
have
try


to
slip
through
,
for
he
have
be
unable
to
locate
Gloria
by
telephone
,


and
another
day
of
suspense
would
have
be
intolerable
.




after
inexplicable
stop
and
wait
that
remind
he
of
the
night
he
have


leave
New

over
a
year
before

they
draw
into
the
Pennsylvania


station
,
and
he
follow
the
familiar
way
to
the
taxi
-
stand
,
find
it


grotesque
and
oddly
stimulate
to
give
his
own
address
.




Broadway
be
a
riot
of
light
,
throng
as
he
have
never

a


carnival
crowd
which
sweep
its
glitter
way
through
scrap
of
paper

deep
on
the
sidewalk

face
in
which
be

under
the
white
glare
overhead

Anthony
pick


out
half
a
dozen
figure

a
drunken
sailor
,
tip
backward
and


support
by
two
other
gob

his
hat

shrieking
civilian

haired
girl


sit
cross
-
legged
and
meditative
on
top
of
a
parked
taxicab

here
surely


the
victory

come
in
time

climax

the

enough
for
poignancy

somewhere

just
about

this
change
be
kind

it
would
have
be
kind


still
have
everything
change

high

scented
room

alone

statuesque
within

without

as
in
her
virginal
and
colorful
past

inside

she
have
not
be
happy


with

for
over
a
year

recently
his
presence
have


be
no
more
than
what
it
would
awake
in
she
of
that
memorable
June
.
the


Anthony
of
late
,
irritable
,
weak
,
and
poor
,
could
do
no
less
than
make


her
irritable
in
turn

and
bore
with
everything
except
the
fact
that
in


a
highly
imaginative
and
eloquent
youth
they
have
come
together
in
an


ecstatic
revel
of
emotion
.
because
of
this
mutually
vivid
memory
she


would
have
do
more
for
Anthony
than
for
any
other
human
--
so
when
she


get
into
the
taxicab
she
weep
passionately
,
and
want
to
call
his

aloud

they
think

when
she
have
address
the
letter
she
go
to
her
twin
bed
and
lie
down


upon
it
,
clasp
Anthony
's
pillow
in
her
arm
as
though
by
sheer
force


of
emotion
she
could
metamorphize
it
into
his
warm
and
live
body
.
two


o'clock
see
her
dry
-
eyed
,
stare
with
steady
persistent
grief
into
the


darkness
,
remembering
,
remember
unmercifully
,
blame
herself
for
a


hundred
fancy
unkindness
,
make
a
likeness
of
Anthony
akin
to
some


martyr
and
transfigure
Christ
.
for
a
time
she
think
of
he
as
he
,


in
his
more
sentimental
moment
,
probably
think
of
himself
.




at
five
she
be
still
awake
.
a
mysterious
grinding
noise
that
go
on


every
morning
across
the
areaway
tell
she
the
hour
.
she
hear
an
alarm


clock
ring
,
and
see
a
light
make
a
yellow
square
on
an
illusory
blank


wall
opposite
.
with
the
half
-
form
resolution
of
follow
he
South


immediately
,
her
sorrow
grow
remote
and
unreal
,
and
move
off
from
she


as
the
dark
move
westward
.
she
fall
asleep
.




when
she
awake
the
sight
of
the
empty
bed
beside
she
bring
a
renewal


of
misery
,
dispel
shortly
,
however
,
by
the
inevitable
callousness
of


the
bright
morning
.
though
she
be
not
conscious
of
it
,
there
be
relief


in
eat
breakfast
without
Anthony
's
tired
and
worried
face
opposite


she
.
now
that
she
be
alone
she
lose
all
desire
to
complain
about
the


food
.
she
would
change
her
breakfast
,
she
think
--
have
a
lemonade
and


a
tomato
sandwich
instead
of
the
sempiternal
bacon
and
egg
and
toast
.




nevertheless
,
at
noon
when
she
have
call
up
several
of
she


acquaintance
,
include
the
martial
Muriel
,
and
find
each
one
engage


for
lunch
,
she
give
way
to
a
quiet
pity
for
herself
and
her
loneliness
.


curl
on
the
bed
with
pencil
and
paper
she
write
Anthony


another
letter
.




late
in
the
afternoon
arrive
a
special
delivery
,
mail
from
some
small


New
Jersey
town
,
and
the
familiarity
of
the
phrasing
,
the
almost
audible


undertone
of
worry
and
discontent
,
be
so
familiar
that
they
comfort


she
.
who
know
?
perhaps
army
discipline
would
harden
Anthony
and
accustom


he
to
the
idea
of
work
.
she
have
immutable
faith
that
the
war
would
be


over
before
he
be
call
upon
to
fight
,
and
meanwhile
the
suit
would
be


win
,
and
they
could
begin
again
,
this
time
on
a
different
basis
.
the


first
thing
different
would
be
that
she
would
have
a
child
.
it
be


unbearable
that
she
should
be
so
utterly
alone
.




it
be
a
week
before
she
could
stay
in
the
apartment
with
the


probability
of
remain
dry
-
eyed
.
there
seem
little
in
the
city
that


be
amusing
.
Muriel
have
be
shift
to
a
hospital
in
New
Jersey
,
from


which
she
take
a
metropolitan
holiday
only
every
other
week
,
and
with


this
defection
Gloria
grow
to
realize
how
few
be
the
friend
she
have


make
in
all
these
year
of
New
York
.
the
man
she
know
be
in
the
army
.


"
man
she
knew"?--she
have
concede
vaguely
to
herself
that
all
the
man


who
have
ever
be
in
love
with
she
be
her
friend
.
each
one
of
they


have
at
a
certain
considerable
time
profess
to
value
her
favor
above


anything
in
life
.
but
now
--
where
be
they
?
at
least
two
be
dead
,
half


a
dozen
or
more
be
marry
,
the
rest
scatter
from
France
to
the


Philippines
.
she
wonder
whether
any
of
they
think
of
she
,
and
how


often
,
and
in
what
respect
.
Most
of
they
must
still
picture
the
little


girl
of
seventeen
or
so
,
the
adolescent
siren
of
nine
year
before
.




the
girl
,
too
,
be
go
far
afield
.
she
have
never
be
popular
in


school
.
she
have
be
too
beautiful
,
too
lazy
,
not
sufficiently
conscious


of
be
a
Farmover
girl
and
a
"
Future
Wife
and
Mother
"
in
perpetual


capital
letter
.
and
girl
who
have
never
be
kiss
hint
,
with


shocked
expression
on
their
plain
but
not
particularly
wholesome
face
,


that
Gloria
have
.
then
these
girl
have
go
east
or
west
or
south
,


married
and
become
"
people
,
"
prophesy
,
if
they
prophesy
about


Gloria
,
that
she
would
come
to
a
bad
end
--
not
know
that
no
ending


be
bad
,
and
that
they
,
like
she
,
be
by
no
means
the
mistress
of


their
destiny
.




Gloria
tell
over
to
herself
the
people
who
have
visit
they
in
the
gray


house
at
Marietta
.
it
have
seem
at
the
time
that
they
be
always


have
company
--
she
have
indulge
in
an
unspoken
conviction
that
each


guest
be
ever
afterward
slightly
indebted
to
she
.
they
owe
she
a
sort


of
moral
ten
dollar
apiece
,
and
should
she
ever
be
in
need
she
might
,


so
to
speak
,
borrow
from
they
this
visionary
currency
.
but
they
be


go
,
scatter
like
chaff
,
mysteriously
and
subtly
vanish
in
essence


or
in
fact
.




by
Christmas
,
Gloria
's
conviction
that
she
should
join
Anthony
have


return
,
no
long
as
a
sudden
emotion
,
but
as
a
recurrent
need
.
she


decide
to
write
he
word
of
she
come
,
but
postpone
the
announcement


upon
the
advice
of
Mr.

who
expect
almost
weekly

in
February
she
have
an
experience
of
quite
a
different
sort
.
Tudor


Baird
,
an
ancient
flame
,
a
young
man
whom
at
one
time
she
have
fully


intend
to
marry
,
come
to
New
York
by
way
of
the
Aviation
Corps
,
and


call
upon
she
.
they
go
several
time
to
the
theatre
,
and
within
a


week
,
to
her
great
enjoyment
,
he
be
as
much
in
love
with
she
as
ever
.


quite
deliberately
she
bring
it
about
,
realize
too
late
that
she
have


do
a
mischief
.
he
reach
the
point
of
sit
with
she
in
miserable


silence
whenever
they
go
out
together
.




a
Scroll

he
possess
the
correct
reticence
of
a


"
good
egg
,
"
the
correct
notion
of
chivalry
and
_
noblesse
oblige_--and
,


of
course
but
unfortunately
,
the
correct
bias
and
the
correct
lack
of


idea
--
all
those
trait
which
Anthony
have
teach
she
to
despise
,
but


which
,
nevertheless
,
she
rather
admire
.
unlike
the
majority
of
his


type
,
she
find
that
he
be
not
a
bore
.
he
be
handsome
,
witty
in
a


light
way
,
and
when
she
be
with
he
she
feel
that
because
of
some


quality
he
possess
--
call
it
stupidity
,
loyalty
,
sentimentality
,
or


something
not
quite
as
definite
as
any
of
the
three
--
he
would
have
do


anything
in
his
power
to
please
she
.




he
tell
she
this

correctly

with
a
ponderous


manliness
that

not
at
all
she
grow


sorry
for
he

sentimentally
one
night

when
Mr.

tell
she
that
the
trial
would
not
take
place
until


autumn
she
decide
that
without
tell
Anthony
she
would
go
into
the


movie
.
when
he
see
she
successful
,
both
histrionically
and
financially
,


when
he
see
that
she
could
have
her
will
of
Joseph
Bloeckman
,
yield


nothing
in
return
,
he
would
lose
his
silly
prejudice
.
she
lie
awake


half
one
night
plan
her
career
and
enjoy
her
success
in


anticipation

the
next
morning
she
call
up

Mr.

but
the
idea
have
grip
she
so
strongly
this
time
that
she
decide
to


go
the
round
of
the
move
picture
employment
agency
.
as
so
often
have


be
the
case
,
her
sense
of
smell
work
against
her
good
intention
.


the
employment
agency
smell
as
though
it
have
be
dead
a
very
long
time
.


she
wait
five
minute
inspect
she
unprepossessing
competitor
--
then


she
walk
briskly
out
into
the
farth
recess
of
Central
Park
and


remain
so
long
that
she
catch
a
cold
.
she
be
try
to
air
the


employment
agency
out
of
her
walking
suit
.




in
the
spring
she
begin
to
gather
from
Anthony
's
letter
--
not
from
any


one
in
particular
but
from
their
culminative
effect
--
that
he
do
not


want
she
to
come
south
.
curiously
repeat
excuse
that
seem
to
haunt


he
by
their
very
insufficiency
occur
with
freudian
regularity
.
he


set
they
down
in
each
letter
as
though
he
fear
he
have
forget
they


the
last
time
,
as
though
it
be
desperately
necessary
to
impress
she


with
they
.
and
the
dilution
of
his
letter
with
affectionate


diminutive
begin
to
be
mechanical
and
unspontaneous
--
almost
as
though
,


having
complete
the
letter
,
he
have
look
it
over
and
literally
stick


they
in
,
like
epigram
in
an
Oscar
Wilde
play
.
she
jump
to
the


solution
,
reject
it
,
be
angry
and
depress
by
turn
--
finally
she


shut
her
mind
to
it
proudly
,
and
allow
an
increase
coolness
to
creep


into
her
end
of
the
correspondence
.




of
late
she
have
find
a
good
deal
to
occupy
her
attention
.
several


aviator
whom
she
have
meet
through
Tudor
Baird
come
into
New
York
to
see


she
and
two
other
ancient
beaux

up

station
at
Camp
Dix
.
as


these
man
be
order
overseas
they
,
so
to
speak
,
hand
she
down
to


their
friend
.
but
after
another
rather
disagreeable
experience
with
a


potential
Captain
Collins
she
make
it
plain
that
when
any
one
be


introduce
to
she
he
should
be
under
no
misapprehension
as
to
she


status
and
personal
intention
.




when
summer
come
she
learn
,
like
Anthony
,
to
watch
the
officer
'


casualty
list
,
take
a
sort
of
melancholy
pleasure
in
hearing
of
the


death
of
some
one
with
whom
she
have
once
dance
a
german
and
in


identify
by
name
the
young
brother
of
former
suitor
--
think
,
as


the
drive
toward
Paris
progress
,
that
here
at
length
go
the
world
to


inevitable
and
well
-
merit
destruction
.




she
be
twenty
-
seven
.
her
birthday
flee
by
scarcely
notice
.
year


before
it
have
frighten
she
when
she
become
twenty
,
to
some
extent
when


she
reach
twenty
-
six
--
but
now
she
look
in
the
glass
with
calm


self
-
approval
see
the
british
freshness
of
her
complexion
and
she


figure
boyish
and
slim
as
of
old
.




she
try
not
to
think
of
Anthony
.
it
be
as
though
she
be
write
to


a
stranger
.
she
tell
her
friend
that
he
have
be
make
a
corporal
and


be
annoy
when
they
be
politely
unimpressed
.
one
night
she
weep


because
she
be
sorry
for
he
--
have
he
be
even
slightly
responsive
she


would
have
go
to
he
without
hesitation
on
the
first
train
--
whatever
he


be
do
he
need
to
be
take
care
of
spiritually
,
and
she
feel
that


now
she
would
be
able
to
do
even
that
.
recently
,
without
his
continual


drain
upon
her
moral
strength
she
find
herself
wonderfully
revive
.


before
he
leave
she
have
be
incline
through
sheer
association
to
brood


on
her
waste
opportunity
--
now
she
return
to
her
normal
state
of


mind
,
strong
,
disdainful
,
exist
each
day
for
each
day
's
worth
.
she


buy
a
doll
and
dress
it
;
one
week
she
weep
over
"
Ethan
Frome
"
;
the


next
she
revel
in
some
novel
of
Galsworthy
's
,
whom
she
like
for
his


power
of
recreate
,
by
spring
in
darkness
,
that
illusion
of
young


romantic
love
to
which
woman
look
forever
forward
and
forever
back
.




in
October
Anthony
's
letter
multiply
,
become
almost
frantic
--
then


suddenly
cease
.
for
a
worried
month
it
need
all
her
power
of
control


to
refrain
from

immediately
for

then
a
telegram


tell
she
that

be
in
the
hospital
and
that
she
could
expect

ten
day

like
a
figure
in
a
dream
he
come
back
into


her
life
across
the
ballroom
on
that
November

piece
of

they
be
all

what
swagger
they
could

as
they
rumble
on
toward

uneasy
lest
he
should
find


dot

the
station
.
to
his
relief
he
neither

nor
hear
anything
of

give
tolerant
,
almost
sentimental
,

for

to

change

after
that
reflowering
of
tenderness

each
of
they
have
return
into
some
solitary
dream

at
the

it

some
shameful

way

with
the

two
strong
whisky

bring


himself
up

another
attempt

he
walk
into

shop

when


he
mention
his
business
the
plumber
begin
pull
on
his
coat
in
a


great
hurry

gruffly
announce
that

to
go
to

Anthony


remark
politely
that
it
be
futile
to
try
to
sell
a
man
anything
when


he
be
hungry
,
and
the
plumber
heartily
agree
.




this
episode
encourage
Anthony
;
he
try
to
think
that
have
the
plumber


not
be
bind
for
lunch
he
would
at
least
have
listen
.




pass
by
a
few
glitter
and
formidable
bazaar
he
enter
a
grocery


store
.
a
talkative
proprietor
tell
he
that
before
buy
any
stock
he


be
go
to
see
how
the
armistice
affect
the
market
.
to
Anthony
this


seem
almost
unfair
.
in
Mr.
Carleton
's
salesman
's
Utopia
the
only


reason
prospective
buyer
ever
give
for
not
purchase
stock
be
that


they
doubt
it
to
be
a
promising
investment
.
obviously
a
man
in
that


state
be
almost
ludicrously
easy
game
,
to
be
bring
down
merely
by
the


judicious
application
of
the
correct
selling
point
.

these
man
--
why
,


actually
they
be
n't
consider
buy
anything
at
all

Anthony
take
several
more
drink
before
he
approach
his
fourth
man
,
a


real
-
estate
agent
;
nevertheless
,
he
be
floor
with
a
coup
as
decisive


as
a
syllogism
.
the
real
-
estate
agent
say
that
he
have
three
brother
in


the
investment
business
.
view
himself
as
a
breaker
-
up
of
home


Anthony
apologize
and
go
out
.




after
another
drink
he
conceive
the
brilliant
plan
of
sell
the
stock


to
the
bartender
along
Lexington
Avenue
.
this
occupy
several
hour
,


for
it
be
necessary
to
take
a
few
drink
in
each
place
in
order
to
get


the
proprietor
in
the
proper
frame
of
mind
to
talk
business
.
but
the


bartender
one
and
all
contend
that
if
they
have
any
money
to
buy
bond


they
would
not
be
bartender
.
it
be
as
though
they
have
all
convene
and


decide
upon
that
rejoinder
.
as
he
approach
a
dark
and
soggy
five


o'clock
he
find
that
they
be
develop
a
still
more
annoying


tendency
to
turn
he
off
with
a
jest
.




at
five
,
then
,
with
a
tremendous
effort
at
concentration
he
decide
that


he
must
put
more
variety
into
his
canvassing
.
he
select
a
medium
-
sized


delicatessen
store
,
and
go
in
.
he
feel
,
illuminatingly
,
that
the
thing


to
do
be
to
cast
a
spell
not
only
over
the
storekeeper
but
over
all
the


customer
as
well
--
and
perhaps
through
the
psychology
of
the
herd


instinct
they
would
buy
as
an
astounded
and
immediately
convince

"




with
this
Anthony
turn
,
bow
gravely
to
his
late
auditor
,
and


wabble
from
the
store
.
he
find
a
taxicab
at
the
corner
and
ride
home


to
the
apartment
.
there
he
fall
sound
asleep
on
the
sofa
,
and
so
Gloria


find
he
,
his
breath
fill
the
air
with
an
unpleasant
pungency
,
his


hand
still
clutch
his
open
brief
case
.




except
when
Anthony
be
drink
,
his
range
of
sensation
have
become
less


than
that
of
a
healthy
old
man
and
when
prohibition
come
in
July
he


find
that
,
among
those
who
could
afford
it
,
there
be
more
drinking


than
ever
before
.
one
's
host
now
bring
out
a
bottle
upon
the
slight


pretext
.
the
tendency
to
display
liquor
be
a
manifestation
of
the
same


instinct
that
lead
a
man
to
deck
his
wife
with
jewel
.
to
have
liquor
be


a
boast
,
almost
a
badge
of
respectability
.




in
the
morning
Anthony
awake
tired
,
nervous
,
and
worried
.
halcyon


summer
twilight
and
the
purple
chill
of
morning
alike
leave
he


unresponsive
.
only
for
a
brief
moment
every
day
in
the
warmth
and


renew
life
of
a
first
high
-
ball
do
his
mind
turn
to
those
opalescent


dream
of
future
pleasure
--
the
mutual
heritage
of
the
happy
and
the


damn
.
but
this
be
only
for
a
little
while
.
as
he
grow
drunker
the


dream
fade
and
he
become
a
confused
spectre
,
move
in
odd
cranny
of


his
own
mind
,
full
of
unexpected
device
,
harshly
contemptuous
at
good


and
reach
sodden
and
dispirited
depth
.
one
night
in
June
he
have


quarrel
violently
with
Maury
over
a
matter
of
the
utmost
triviality
.


he
remember
dimly
next
morning
that
it
have
be
about
a
broken
pint


bottle
of
champagne
.
Maury
have
tell
he
to
sober
up
and
Anthony
's


feeling
have
be
hurt
,
so
with
an
attempt
gesture
of
dignity
he
have


rise
from
the
table
and
seize
Gloria
's
arm
half
lead
,
half
shame
she


into
a
taxicab
outside
,
leave
Maury
with
three
dinner
order
and


ticket
for
the
opera
.




this
sort
of
semi
-
tragic
fiasco
have
become
so
usual
that
when
they


occur
he
be
no
long
stir
into
make
amend
.
if
Gloria


protest
--
and
of
late
she
be
more
likely
to
sink
into
contemptuous


silence
--
he
would
either
engage
in
a
bitter
defense
of
himself
or
else


stalk
dismally
from
the
apartment
.
never
since
the
incident
on
the


station
platform
at
Redgate
have
he
lay
his
hand
on
she
in
anger
--
though


he
be
withhold
often
only
by
some
instinct
that
itself
make
he
tremble


with
rage
.
just
as
he
still
care
more
for
she
than
for
any
other


creature
,
so
do
he
more
intensely
and
frequently
hate
she
.




so
far
,
the
judge
of
the
Appellate
Division
have
fail
to
hand
down
a


decision
,
but
after
another
postponement
they
finally
affirm
the


decree
of
the
low
court
--
two
justice
dissent
.
a
notice
of
appeal


be
serve
upon
Edward
Shuttleworth
.
the
case
be
go
to
the
court
of


last
resort
,
and
they
be
in
for
another
interminable
wait
.
six
month
,


perhaps
a
year
.
it
have
grow
enormously
unreal
to
they
,
remote
and


uncertain
as
heaven
.




throughout
the
previous
winter
one
small
matter
have
be
a
subtle
and


omnipresent
irritant
--
the
question
of
Gloria
's
gray
fur
coat
.
at
that


time
woman
envelop
in
long
squirrel
wrap
could
be
see
every
few


yard
along
Fifth
Avenue
.
the
woman
be
convert
to
the
shape
of
top
.


they
seem
porcine
and
obscene
;
they
resemble
keep
woman
in
the


conceal
richness
,
the
feminine
animality
of
the
garment
.
yet
--
Gloria


want
a
gray
squirrel
coat
.




discuss
the
matter
--
or
,
rather
,
argue
it
,
for
even
more
than
in
the


first
year
of
their
marriage
do
every
discussion
take
the
form
of


bitter
debate
full
of
such
phrase
as
"
most
certainly
,
"
"
utterly


outrageous
,
"
"
it
be
so
,
nevertheless
,
"
and
the
ultra
-
emphatic


"
regardless"--they
conclude
that
they
could
not
afford
it
.
and
so


gradually
it
begin
to
stand
as
a
symbol
of
their
grow


financial
anxiety
.




to
Gloria
the
shrinkage
of
their
income
be
a
remarkable
phenomenon
,


without
explanation
or
precedent
--
that
it
could
happen
at
all
within
the


space
of
five
year
seem
almost
an
intend
cruelty
,
conceived
and


execute
by
a
sardonic
God
.
when
they
be
marry
seventy
-
five
hundred


a
year
have
seem
ample
for
a
young
couple
,
especially
when
augment
by


the
expectation
of
many
million
.
Gloria
have
fail
to
realize
that
it


be
decrease
not
only
in
amount
but
in
purchase
power
until
the


payment
of
Mr.
Haight
's
retain
fee
of
fifteen
thousand
dollar
make


the
fact
suddenly
and
startlingly
obvious
.
when
Anthony
be
draft
they


have
calculate
their
income
at
over
four
hundred
a
month
,
with
the


dollar
even
then
decrease
in
value
,
but
on
his
return
to
New
York
they


discover
an
even
more
alarming
condition
of
affair
.
they
be


receive
only
forty
-
five
hundred
a
year
from
their
investment
.
and


though
the
suit
over
the
will
move
ahead
of
they
like
a
persistent


mirage
and
the
financial
danger
-
mark
loom
up
in
the
near
distance
they


find
,
nevertheless
,
that
live
within
their
income
be
impossible
.




so
Gloria
go
without
the
squirrel
coat
and
every
day
upon
Fifth
Avenue


she
be
a
little
conscious
of
her
well
-
wear
,
half
-
length
leopard
skin
,


now
hopelessly
old
-
fashioned
.
every
other
month
they
sell
a
bond
,
yet


when
the
bill
be
pay
it
leave
only
enough
to
be
gulp
down
hungrily


by
their
current
expense
.
Anthony
's
calculation
show
that
their


capital
would
last
about
seven
year
long
.
so
Gloria
's
heart
be
very


bitter
,
for
in
one
week
,
on
a
prolong
hysterical
party
during
which


Anthony
whimsically
divest
himself
of
coat
,
vest
,
and
shirt
in
a


theatre
and
be
assist
out
by
a
posse
of
usher
,
they
spend
twice
what


the
gray
squirrel
coat
would
have
cost
.




it
be
November
,
indian
summer
rather
,
and
a
warm
,
warm
night
--
which
be


unnecessary
,
for
the
work
of
the
summer
be
do
.
Babe
Ruth
have
smash


the
home
-
run
record
for
the
first
time
and
Jack
Dempsey
have
break
Jess


Willard
's
cheek
-
bone
out
in
Ohio
.
over
in
Europe
the
usual
number
of


child
have
swollen
stomach
from
starvation
,
and
the
diplomat
be
at


their
customary
business
of

the
world
safe
for
new

in
New

"
and
the
odd
on


Harvard

generally

at
five
to
three
.
peace
have
come
down
in


earnest
,
the
beginning
of
new
day
.




up
in
the
bedroom
of
the
apartment
on
fifty
-
seventh
Street
Gloria
lie


upon
her
bed
and
toss
from
side
to
side
,
sit
up
at
interval
to


throw
off
a
superfluous
cover
and
once
ask
Anthony
,
who
be
lie


awake
beside
she
,
to
bring
she
a
glass
of
ice
-
water
.
"
be
sure
and
put


ice
in
it
,
"
she
say
with
insistence
;
"
it
be
n't
cold
enough
the
way
it


come
from
the
faucet
.
"




look
through
the
frail
curtain
she
could
see
the
rounded
moon
over


the
roof
and
beyond
it
on
the
sky
the
yellow
glow
from
Times


Square
--
and
watch
the
two
incongruous
light
,
her
mind
work
over
an


emotion
,
or
rather
an
interwoven
complex
of
emotion
,
that
have
occupy


it
through
the
day
,
and
the
day
before
that
and
back
to
the
last
time


when
she
could
remember
having
think
clearly
and
consecutively
about


anything
--
which
must
have
be
while
Anthony
be
in
the
army
.




she
would
be
twenty
-
nine
in
February
.
the
month
assume
an
ominous
and


inescapable
significance
--
make
her
wonder
,
through
these
nebulous


half
-
fevere
hour
whether
after
all
she
have
not
waste
she
faintly


tired
beauty
,
whether
there
be
such
a
thing
as
use
for
any
quality


bound
by
a
harsh
and
inevitable
mortality
.




year
before
,
when
she
be
twenty
-
one
,
she
have
write
in
her
diary
:


"
beauty
be
only
to
be
admire
,
only
to
be
love
--
to
be
harvest


carefully
and
then
fling
at
a
choose
lover
like
a
gift
of
rose
.
it


seem
to
I
,
so
far
as
I
can
judge
clearly
at
all
,
that
my
beauty
should


be
use
like
that
....
"




and
now
,
all
this
November
day
,
all
this
desolate
day
,
under
a
sky
dirty


and
white
,
Gloria
have
be
think
that
perhaps
she
have
be
wrong
.
to


preserve
the
integrity
of
her
first
gift
she
have
look
no
more
for


love
.
when
the
first
flame
and
ecstasy
have
grow
dim
,
sink
down
,


depart
,
she
have
begin
preserve
--
what
?
it
puzzle
she
that
she
no


long
know
just
what
she
be
preserve
--
a
sentimental
memory
or
some


profound
and
fundamental
concept
of
honor
.
she
be
doubt
now
whether


there
have
be
any
moral
issue
involve
in
her
way
of
life
--
to
walk


unworried
and
unregretful
along
the
gay
of
all
possible
lane
and
to


keep
her
pride
by
be
always
herself
and
do
what
it
seem


beautiful
that
she
should
do
.
from
the
first
little
boy
in
an
Eton


collar
whose
"
girl
"
she
have
be
,
down
to
the
late
casual
man
whose


eye
have
grow
alert
and
appreciative
as
they
rest
upon
she
,
there
be


need
only
that
matchless
candor
she
could
throw
into
a
look
or
clothe


with
an
inconsequent
clause
--
for
she
have
talk
always
in
break


clause
--
to
weave
about
her
immeasurable
illusion
,
immeasurable


distance
,
immeasurable
light
.
to
create
soul
in
man
,
to
create
fine


happiness
and
fine
despair
she
must
remain
deeply
proud
--
proud
to
be


inviolate
,
proud
also
to
be
melt
,
to
be
passionate
and
possess
.




she
know
that
in
her
breast
she
have
never
want
child
.
the
reality
,


the
earthiness
,
the
intolerable
sentiment
of
child
-
bearing
,
the
menace


to
her
beauty
--
have
appal
she
.
she
want
to
exist
only
as
a
conscious


flower
,
prolong
and
preserve
itself
.
her
sentimentality
could
cling


fiercely
to
her
own
illusion
,
but
her
ironic
soul
whisper
that


motherhood
be
also
the
privilege
of
the
female
baboon
.
so
her
dream


be
of
ghostly
child
only
--
the
early
,
the
perfect
symbol
of
she


early
and
perfect
love
for
Anthony
.




in
the
end
then
,
her
beauty
be
all
that
never
fail
she
.
she
have
never


see
beauty
like
her
own
.
what
it
mean
ethically
or
aesthetically
fade


before
the
gorgeous
concreteness

Gloria
shudder
suddenly
as
a
river
siren
came
moan
over
the
dusky


roof
,
and
lean
back
in
till
the
ghostly
curtain
fall
from
she


shoulder
,
she
turn
on
the
electric
lamp

it
be
grow
late
.
she
know


there
be
some
change
in
her
purse
,
and
she
consider
whether
she
would


go
down
and
have
some
coffee
and
roll
where
the
liberated
subway
make
a


roar
cave
of
Manhattan
Street
or
eat
the
devil
ham
and
bread
in


the
kitchen
.
her
purse
decide
for
she
.
it
contain
a
nickel
and


two
penny
.




after
an
hour
the
silence
of
the
room
have
grow
unbearable
,
and
she


find
that
her
eye
be
wander
from
her
magazine
to
the
ceiling
,


toward
which
she
stare
without
thought
.
suddenly
she
stand
up
,


hesitate
for
a
moment
,
bite
at
her
finger
--
then
she
go
to
the


pantry
,
take
down
a
bottle
of
whiskey
from
the
shelf
and
pour
herself


a
drink
.
she
fill
up
the
glass
with
ginger
ale
,
and
return
to
she


chair
finish
an
article
in
the
magazine
.
it
concern
the
last


revolutionary
widow
,
who
,
when
a
young
girl
,
have
marry
an
ancient


veteran
of
the
Continental
Army
and
who
have
die
in
1906
.
it
seem


strange
and
oddly
romantic
to
Gloria
that
she
and
this
woman
have
be


contemporary
.




she
turn
a
page
and
learn
that
a
candidate
for
Congress
be
be


accuse
of
atheism
by
an
opponent
.
Gloria
's
surprise
vanish
when
she


find
that
the
charge
be
false
.
the
candidate
have
merely
deny
the


miracle
of
the
loaf
and
fish
.
he
admit
,
under
pressure
,
that
he


give
full
credence
to
the
stroll
upon
the
water
.




finish
her
first
drink
,
Gloria
get
herself
a
second
.
after
slip


on
a
negligée
and
make
herself
comfortable
on
the
lounge
,
she
become


conscious
that
she
be
miserable
and
that
the
tear
be
roll
down


her
cheek
.
she
wonder
if
they
be
tear
of
self
-
pity
,
and
try


resolutely
not
to
cry
,
but
this
existence
without
hope
,
without


happiness
,
oppress
she
,
and
she
keep
shake
her
head
from
side
to


side
,
her
mouth
draw
down
tremulously
in
the
corner
,
as
though
she


be
deny
an
assertion
make
by
some
one
,
somewhere
.
she
do
not
know


that
this
gesture
of
hers
be
year
old
than
history
,
that
,
for
a


hundred
generation
of
man
,
intolerable
and
persistent
grief
have
offer


that
gesture
,
of
denial
,
of
protest
,
of
bewilderment
,
to
something
more


profound
,
more
powerful
than
the
God
make
in
the
image
of
man
,
and


before
which
that
God
,
do
he
exist
,
would
be
equally
impotent
.
it
be
a


truth
set
at
the
heart
of
tragedy
that
this
force
never
explain
,
never


answer
--
this
force
intangible
as
air
,
more
definite
than
death

a
series
of

in
a
railroad
accident

he

phrase
about

woman

the
most
rococo
happening
in
a
life
that

be


more
than
usually
eventful
,
be
when
he
get
down
to
the
detailed


discussion
of
his
most
animal
existence
:
he
know
,
to
a
subtlety
,
the


food
,
the
liquor
,
and
the
woman
that
he
prefer
.




he
be
at
once
the
common
and
the
most
remarkable
product
of


civilization
.
he
be
nine
out
of
ten
people
that
one
pass
on
a
city


street
--
and
he
be
a
hairless
ape
with
two
dozen
trick
.
he
be
the
hero


of
a
thousand
romance
of
life
and
art
--
and
he
be
a
virtual
moron
,


perform
staidly
yet
absurdly
a
series
of
complicated
and
infinitely


astounding
epic
over
a
span
of
threescore
year
.




with
such
man
as
these
two
Anthony
Patch
drink
and
discuss
and
drank


and
argue
.
he
like
they
because
they
know
nothing
about
he
,
because


they
live
in
the
obvious
and
have
not
the
faint
conception
of
the


inevitable
continuity
of
life
.
they
sit
not
before
a
motion
picture
with


consecutive
reel
,
but
at
a
musty
old
-
fashioned
travelogue
with
all


value
stark
and
hence
all
implication
confuse
.
yet
they
themselves


be
not
confused
,
because
there
be
nothing
in
they
to
be


confused
--
they
change
phrase
from
month
to
month
as
they


change
necktie
.




Anthony
,
the
courteous
,
the
subtle
,
the
perspicacious
,
be
drunk
each


day
--
in
Sammy
's
with
these
man
,
in
the
apartment
over
a
book
,
some
book


he
know
,
and
,
very
rarely
,
with
Gloria
,
who
,
in
his
eye
,
have
begin
to


develop
the
unmistakable
outline
of
a
quarrelsome
and
unreasonable


woman
.
she
be
not
the
Gloria
of
old
,
certainly
--
the
Gloria
who
,
have
she


be
sick
,
would
have
prefer
to
inflict
misery
upon
every
one
around


she
,
rather
than
confess
that
she
need
sympathy
or
assistance
.
she
be


not
above
whine
now
;
she
be
not
above
be
sorry
for
herself
.
each


night
when
she
prepare
for
bed
she
smear
her
face
with
some
new


unguent
which
she
hope
illogically
would
give
back
the
glow
and


freshness
to
her
vanish
beauty
.
when
Anthony
be
drunk
he
taunt
she


about
this
.
when
he
be
sober
he
be
polite
to
she
,
on
occasion
even


tender
;
he
seem
to
show
for
short
hour
a
trace
of
that
old
quality
of


understand
too
well
to
blame
--
that
quality
which
be
the
good
of
he


and
have
work
swiftly
and
ceaselessly
toward
his
ruin
.




but
he
hate
to
be
sober
.
it
make
he
conscious
of
the
people
around


he
,
of
that
air
of
struggle
,
of
greedy
ambition
,
of
hope
more
sordid


than
despair
,
of
incessant
passage
up
or
down
,
which
in
every
metropolis


be
most
in
evidence
through
the
unstable
middle
class
.
unable
to
live


with
the
rich
he
think
that
his
next
choice
would
have
be
to
live


with
the
very
poor
.
anything
be
well
than
this
cup
of
perspiration


and
tear
.




the
sense
of
the
enormous
panorama
of
life
,
never
strong
in
Anthony
,
have


become
dim
almost
to
extinction
.
at
long
interval
now
some
incident
,


some
gesture
of
Gloria
's
,
would
take
his
fancy
--
but
the
gray
veil
have


come
down
in
earnest
upon
he
.
as
he
grow
old
those
thing


fade
--
after
that
there
be
wine
.




there
be
a
kindliness
about
intoxication
--
there
be
that
indescribable


gloss
and
glamour
it
give
,
like
the
memory
of
ephemeral
and
fade


evening
.
after
a
few
high
-
ball
there
be
magic
in
the
tall
glowing


arabian
night
of
the
Bush
Terminal
Building
--
its
summit
a
peak
of
sheer


grandeur
,
gold
and
dream
against
the
inaccessible
sky
.
and
Wall


Street
,
the
crass
,
the
banal
--
again
it
be
the
triumph
of
gold
,
a


gorgeous
sentient
spectacle
;
it
be
where
the
great
king
keep
the
money


for
their
war
....




...
the
fruit
of
youth
or
of
the
grape
,
the
transitory
magic
of
the


brief
passage
from
darkness
to
darkness
--
the
old
illusion
that
truth
and


beauty
be
in
some
way
entwine
.




as
he
stand
in
front
of
Delmonico
's
light
a
cigarette
one
night
he


see
two
hansom
draw
up
close
to
the
curb
,
wait
for
a
chance
drunken


fare
.
the
outmoded
cab
be
wear
and
dirty
--
the
cracked
patent
leather


wrinkle
like
an
old
man
's
face
,
the
cushion
fade
to
a
brownish


lavender
;
the
very
horse
be
ancient
and
weary
,
and
so
be
the


white
-
haired
man
who
sit
aloft
,
crack
their
whip
with
a
grotesque


affectation
of
gallantry
.
a
relic
of
vanish
gaiety
!




Anthony
Patch
walk
away
in
a
sudden
fit
of
depression
,

the


bitterness
of
such
survival

there

"




just
after
nine
o'clock
Anthony
stagger
to
his
foot
and
,
bid
they


a
thick
good
night
,
walk
unsteadily
to
the
door
,
hand
Sammy
one
of


his
two
quarter
as
he
pass
out
.
once
in
the
street
he
hesitate


uncertainly
and
then
start
in
the
direction
of
Sixth
Avenue
,
where
he


remember
to
have
frequently
pass
several
loan
office
.
he
go
by
a


news
-
stand
and
two
drug
-
store
--
and
then
he
realize
that
he
be


stand
in
front
of
the
place
which
he
seek
,
and
that
it
be
shut
and


bar
.
unperturbed
he
continue
;
another
one
,
half
a
block
down
,
be


also
close
--
so
be
two
more
across
the
street
,
and
a
fifth
in
the


square
below
.
see
a
faint
light
in
the
last
one
,
he
begin
to
knock
on


the
glass
door
;
he
desist
only
when
a
watchman
appear
in
the
back
of


the
shop
and
motion
he
angrily
to
move
on
.
with
grow


discouragement
,
with
grow
befuddlement
,
he
cross
the
street
and


walk
back
toward
forty
-
third
.
on
the
corner
near
Sammy
's
he
pause


undecided
--
if
he
go
back
to
the
apartment
,
as
he
feel
his
body


require
,
he
would
lay
himself
open
to
bitter
reproach
;
yet
,
now
that


the
pawnshop
be
close
,
he
have
no
notion
where
to
get
the
money
.
he


decide
finally
that
he
might
ask
Parker
Allison
,
after
all
--
but
he


approach
Sammy
's
only
to
find
the
door
lock
and
the
light
out
.
he


look
at
his
watch
;
nine
-
thirty
.
he
begin
walk
.




ten
minute
later
he
stop
aimlessly
at
the
corner
of
forty
-
third


Street
and
Madison
Avenue
,
diagonally
across
from
the
bright
but
nearly


desert
entrance
to
the
Biltmore
Hotel
.
here
he
stand
for
a
moment
,
and


then
sit
down
heavily
on
a
damp
board
amid
some
debris
of
construction


work
.
he
rest
there
for
almost
half
an
hour
,
his
mind
a
shift


pattern
of
surface
thought
,
chiefest
among
which
be
that
he
must


obtain
some
money
and
get
home
before
he
become
too
sodden
to
find


his
way
.




then
,
glance
over
toward
the
Biltmore
,
he
see
a
man
stand
directly


under
the
overhead
glow
of
the
porte
-
cochère
lamp
beside
a
woman
in
an


ermine
coat
.
as
Anthony
watch
,
the
couple
move
forward
and
signal


to
a
taxi
.
Anthony
perceive
by
the
infallible
identification
that
lurk


in
the
walk
of
a
friend
that
it
be
Maury
Noble
.




he
rise
to
his
foot
.




"
Maury
!
"
he
shout
.




Maury
look
in
his
direction
,
then
turn
back
to
the
girl
just
as
the


taxi
come
up
into
place
.
with
the
chaotic
idea
of
borrow
ten
dollar
,


Anthony
begin
to
run
as
fast
as
he
could
across
Madison
Avenue
and
along


forty
-
third
Street
.




as
he
come
up
Maury
be
stand
beside
the
yawn
door
of
the
taxicab
.


his
companion
turn
and
look
curiously
at
Anthony
.




"
hello
,
Maury
!
"
he
say
,
hold
out
his
hand
.
"
how
be
you
?
"




"
fine
,
thank
you
.
"




their
hand
drop
and
Anthony
hesitate
.
Maury
make
no
move
to


introduce
he
,
but
only
stand
there
regard
he
with
an
inscrutable


feline
silence
.




"
I
want
to
see
you--
"
begin
Anthony
uncertainly
.
he
do
not
feel
that


he
could
ask
for
a
loan
with
the
girl
not
four
foot
away
,
so
he
break


off
and
make
a
perceptible
motion
of
his
head
as
if
to
beckon
Maury


to
one
side
.




"
I
be
in
rather
a
big
hurry
,
Anthony
.
"




"
I
know
--
but
can
you
,
can
you--
"
again
he
hesitate
.




"
I
'll
see
you
some
other
time
,
"
say
Maury
.
"
it
be
important
.
"




"
I
be
sorry
,
Anthony
.
"




before
Anthony
could
make
up
his
mind
to
blurt
out
his
request
,
Maury


have
turn
coolly
to
the
girl
,
help
she
into
the
car
and
,
with
a


polite
"
good
evening
,
"
step
in
after
she
.
as
he
nod
from
the


window
it
seem
to
Anthony
that
his
expression
have
not
change
by
a


shade
or
a
hair
.
then
with
a
fretful
clatter
the
taxi
move
off
,
and


Anthony
be
leave
stand
there
alone
under
the
light
.




Anthony
go
on
into
the
Biltmore
,
for
no
reason
in
particular
except


that
the
entrance
be
at
hand
,
and
ascend
the
wide
stair
find
a
seat


in
an
alcove
.
he
be
furiously
aware
that
he
have
be
snub
;
he
be
as


hurt
and
angry
as
it
be
possible
for
he
to
be
when
in
that
condition
.


nevertheless
,
he
be
stubbornly
preoccupy
with
the
necessity
of


obtain
some
money
before
he
go
home
,
and
once
again
he
tell
over
on


his
finger
the
acquaintance
he
might
conceivably
call
on
in
this


emergency
.
he
think
,
eventually
,
that
he
might
approach
Mr.
Howland
,


his
broker
,
at
his
home
.




after
a
long
wait
he
find
that
Mr.

be
out
.
he
return
to
the


operator
,
lean
over
her
desk
and
finger
his
quarter
as
though


loath
to
leave
unsatisfied
.




"

he
say
suddenly
.

"

"




scarcely
conscious
of
what
he
do
,
Anthony
look
up
Joseph
Bloeckman
in


the
telephone
directory
.
he
could
find
no
such
person
,
and
be
about
to


close
the
book
when
it
flash
into
his
mind
that
Gloria
have
mention
a


change

it
be
the
matter
of
a
minute

set
in
against

he
count
more
on
the
personal
attack
that
they
have


level
at

than
on
the
more
sheerly
legal
aspect
of

mimeographed


notice
urge
"
the
boy
"
in
condescendingly
colloquial
language
to
pay


the
due
of

American
Legion
.
he
throw
it
impatiently
into
the


waste
-
basket
and
sit
down
with
his
elbow
on
the
window
sill
,
look


down
blindly
into
the
sunny
street
.




Italy
--
if
the
verdict
be
in
their
favor
it
mean
Italy
.
the
word
have


become
a
sort
of
talisman
to
he
,
a
land
where
the
intolerable
anxiety


of
life
would
fall
away
like
an
old
garment
.
they
would
go
to
the


watering
-
place
first
and
among
the
bright
and
colorful
crowd
forget


the
gray
appendage
of
despair
.
marvellously
renew
,
he
would
walk


again
in
the
Piazza
di
Spanga
at
twilight
,
move
in
that
drift


flotsam
of
dark
woman
and
ragged
beggar
,
of
austere
,
barefoote
friar
.


the
thought
of
italian
woman
stir
he
faintly
--
when
his
purse
hang


heavy
again
even
romance
might
fly
back
to
perch
upon
it
--
the
romance
of


blue
canal
in
Venice
,
of
the
golden
green
hill
of
Fiesole
after
rain
,


and
of
woman
,
woman
who
change
,
dissolve
,
melt
into
other
woman
and


recede
from
his
life
,
but
who
be
always
beautiful
and
always
young
.




but
it
seem
to
he
that
there
should
be
a
difference
in
his
attitude
.


all
the
distress
that
he
have
ever
know
,
the
sorrow
and
the
pain
,
have


be
because
of
woman
.
it
be
something
that
in
different
way
they
do


to
he
,
unconsciously
,
almost
casually
--
perhaps
find
he


tender
-
minded
and
afraid
,
they
kill
the
thing
in
he
that
menace


their
absolute
sway
.




turn
about
from
the
window
he
face
his
reflection
in
the
mirror
,


contemplate
dejectedly
the
wan
,
pasty
face
,
the
eye
with
their


crisscross
of
line
like
shred
of
dry
blood
,
the
stooped
and
flabby


figure
whose
very
sag
be
a
document
in
lethargy
.
he
be
thirty


three
--
he
look
forty
.
well
,
thing
would
be
different
.




the
door
-
bell
rang
abruptly
and
he
start
as
though
he
have
be
deal
a


blow
.
recover
himself
,
he
go
into
the
hall
and

the
outer


door

before

into
the
living
room
,
comprehend
only
a
word


here
and
there
in
the
slow
flood
of
sentence
that
pour
from
she


steadily
,
one
after
the
other
,
in
a
persistent
monotone
.

decently
and
shabbily

pitiable
little
