of

the
sociable

thus


keep
out
the

whom
New

be
begin
to
dread
and


yet
be
draw
to

the
sentimental

its

so


problematic
a
quality
in

for
the
hearing
of

it
be
Madame
Nilsson
's
first
appearance
that
winter
,
and
what
the


daily
press
have
already
learn
to
describe
as
"

"
to
come
to


the
Opera
in
a
Brown

be
almost
as
honourable
a
way
of
arrive


as
in
one
's

carriage
;
and
departure
by
the
same
mean
have
the


immense
advantage
of
enable
one
(
with
a
playful
allusion
to


democratic
principle
)
to
scramble
into
the
first
Brown
conveyance
in


the
line
,
instead
of
wait

nose
of


one
's
own
coachman

.
 
it
be


one
of
the
great

stableman
's
most
masterly
intuition
to
have


discover
that
Americans
want
to
get
away
from
amusement
even
more


quickly
than
they
want
to
get
to
it
.




when
Newland
Archer
open
the
door
at
the
back
of
the
club
box
the


curtain
have
just
go
up
on
the
garden
scene
.
 
there
be
no
reason
why


the
young
man
should
not
have
come
early
,
for
he
have
dine
at
seven
,


alone
with
his
mother
and
sister
,
and
have
linger
afterward
over
a


cigar
in
the
gothic
library
with
glaze
black
-
walnut
bookcase
and


finial
-
top
chair
which
be
the
only
room
in
the
house
where
Mrs.


Archer
allow
smoking
.
 
but
,
in
the
first
place
,
New
York
be
a


metropolis
,
and
perfectly
aware
that
in
metropolis
it
be
"
not
the


thing
"
to
arrive
early
at
the
opera
;
and
what
be
or
be
not
"
the


thing
"
play
a
part
as
important
in
Newland
Archer
's
New
York
as
the


inscrutable
totem
terror
that
have
rule
the
destiny
of
his


forefather
thousand
of
year
ago
.




the
second
reason
for
his
delay
be
a
personal
one
.
 
he
have
dawdle


over
his
cigar
because
he
be
at
heart
a
dilettante
,
and
think
over


a
pleasure
to
come
often
give
he
a
subtler
satisfaction
than
its


realisation
.
 
this
be
especially
the
case
when
the
pleasure
be
a


delicate
one
,
as
his
pleasure
mostly
be
;
and
on
this
occasion
the


moment
he
look
forward
to
be
so
rare
and
exquisite
in
quality


that
--
well
,
if
he
have
time
his
arrival
in
accord
with
the
prima

he
could
not
have
enter
the
Academy
at
a
more


significant
moment
than
just

an


unalterable

have


probably
devote
more
time
than
any
one
else
to
the
study
of
this


intricate

fascinating

study
alone
could
not

have
only
to
look
at

,


from
the
slant
of
his
bald

the

patent

once

Lefferts

with
surprise
that
his


exclamation

occasion
by
the
entry
of
a
new
figure
into
old


Mrs.

it
be
that
of
a
slim
young
woman
,
a
little
less


tall
than
May

with
brown
hair
grow
in

curl
about

up
under

by
a

with
a
large


old

the

of
this
unusual
dress

seem


quite
unconscious

,
stand
a
moment
in


the
centre
of

discuss
with
Mrs.

the
propriety
of


take
the
latter
's
place
in
the
front

then
she


yield
with
a
slight
smile

seat
herself
in

with
Mrs.

in

law
,
Mrs.

the

the
whole
of
the

turn
instinctively
,

to
hear


what
the
old
man
have
to
say
;
for
old
Mr.
Jackson
be
as
great
an


authority
on
"
family
"
as
Lawrence
Lefferts

on
"
form
.
"
 
he
know
all


the
ramification
of
New
York
's
cousinship
;
and
could
not
only


elucidate
such
complicated
question
as
that
of
the
connection
between


the
Mingotts
(
through
the
Thorleys
)
with
the
Dallases
of
South


Carolina
,
and
that
of
the
relationship
of
the
elder
branch
of


Philadelphia
Thorleys
to
the
Albany
Chiverses
(
on
no
account
to
be


confuse
with
the
Manson
Chiverses
of
University
Place
)
,
but
could
also


enumerate
the
lead
characteristic
of
each
family
:
as
,
for
instance
,


the
fabulous
stinginess
of
the
young
line
of
Leffertses
(
the
Long


Island
one
)
;
or
the
fatal
tendency
of
the
Rushworths
to
make
foolish


match
;
or
the
insanity
recur
in
every
second
generation
of
the


Albany
Chiverses
,
with
whom
their
New
York
cousin
have
always
refuse


to
intermarry
--
with
the
disastrous
exception
of
poor
Medora
Manson
,


who
,
as
everybody
know
...
but
then
her
mother
be
a
Rushworth
.




in
addition
to
this
forest
of
family
tree
,
Mr.
Sillerton
Jackson


carry
between
his
narrow
hollow
temple
,
and
under
his
soft
thatch
of


silver
hair
,
a
register
of
most
of
the
scandal
and
mystery
that
have


smoulder
under
the
unruffled
surface
of
New
York
society
within
the


last
fifty
year
.
 
so
far
indeed
do
his
information
extend
,
and
so


acutely
retentive
be
his
memory
,
that
he
be
suppose
to
be
the
only


man
who
could
have
tell
you
who
Julius
Beaufort
,
the
banker
,
really


be
,
and
what
have
become
of
handsome
Bob
Spicer
,
old
Mrs.
Manson


Mingott
's
father
,
who
have
disappear
so
mysteriously
(
with
a
large
sum


of
trust
money
)
less
than
a
year
after
his
marriage
,
on
the
very
day


that
a
beautiful
spanish
dancer
who
have
be
delight

audience
in
the
old
Opera

house

but
these
mystery
,
and
many
other
,

closely
lock
in
Mr.


Jackson
's
breast

for
not
only
do
his
keen
sense
of
honour
forbid
his


repeat
anything
privately
imparted
,
but
he
be
fully
aware
that
his


reputation
for
discretion
increase
his
opportunity
of
find
out


what
he
want
to
know
.




the
club
box
,
therefore
,
wait
in
visible
suspense
while
Mr.
Sillerton


Jackson
hand
back
Lawrence
Lefferts
's
opera
-
glass
.
 
for
a
moment

silently
scrutinise
the
attentive
group
out
of
his
filmy
blue
eye


overhang
by
old
veined
lid
;
then
he
give
his
moustache
a
thoughtful


twist
,
and
say
simply
:
 
"
I
do
n't
think
the
Mingotts

have
try


it
on
.

II
.




Newland
Archer
,
during
this
brief
episode
,
have
be
throw
into
a


strange
state
of
embarrassment
.




it
be
annoying
that
the
box
which
be
thus
attract
the
undivided


attention
of
masculine
New
York
should
be
that
in
which
his
betrothed


be
seat
between
her
mother
and
aunt
;
and
for
a
moment
he
could
not


identify
the
lady
in
the
Empire
dress
,
nor
imagine
why
her
presence


create
such
excitement
among
the
initiate
.
 
then
light
dawn
on
he
,


and
with
it
come
a
momentary
rush
of
indignation
.
 
no
,
indeed
;
no
one


would
have
think
the
Mingotts
would
have
try
it
on
!




but
they
have
;
they
undoubtedly
have
;
for
the
low
-
toned
comment
behind


he
leave
no
doubt
in
Archer
's
mind
that
the
young
woman
be
May


Welland
's
cousin
,
the
cousin
always
refer
to
in
the
family
as
"
poor


Ellen
Olenska
.
"
 
Archer
know
that
she
have
suddenly
arrive
from
Europe


a
day
or
two
previously
;
he
have
even
hear
from
Miss
Welland
(
not


disapprovingly
)
that
she
have
be
to
see
poor
Ellen
,
who
be
stay


with
old
Mrs.
Mingott
.
 
Archer
entirely
approve
of
family
solidarity
,


and
one
of
the
quality
he
most
admire
in
the
Mingotts
be
their


resolute
championship
of
the
few
black
sheep
that
their
blameless
stock


have
produce
.
 
there
be
nothing
mean
or
ungenerous
in
the
young
man
's


heart
,
and
he
be
glad
that
his
future
wife
should
not
be
restrain
by


false
prudery
from
be
kind
(
in
private
)
to
her
unhappy
cousin
;
but


to
receive
Countess
Olenska
in
the
family
circle
be
a
different
thing


from
produce
she
in
public
,
at
the
Opera
of
all
place
,

in

the

do
not
think
the
Mingotts

have

it
on

know
,
of
course
,
that
whatever
man
dare
(

Fifth

limit
)
that
old
Mrs.

Mingott
,
the
Matriarch
of
the
line

would


dare

he
have
always
admire
the
high

mighty
old
lady
,

,
in

ally
herself
with

put
the

her
audacity

Old

every

agree
that

never

beauty

a
gift
which
,
in
the
eye
of
New

justify
every
success

excuse
a
certain
number
of
failing

people
say
that
,

have
win
she


way
to
success
by
strength

a
kind
of


haughty
effrontery
that
be
somehow
justify
by
the
extreme
decency


and
dignity
of
her
private
life

Mr.

Mingott
have
die
when

eight

additional


caution

there
have
never

a
breath
on

the
only


respect

always
add
,

Mrs.

fortune

have
live
in
affluence
for
half
a
century

memory
of


her
early
strait
have
make
she
excessively
thrifty
,

though
,
when


she
buy
a
dress
or
a
piece
of
furniture
,
she
take
care
that
it


should
be
of
the
good

could
not
bring
herself
to
spend
much
on
the


transient
pleasure
of
the
table

therefore
,
for
totally
different


reason

her
food
be
as
poor
as
Mrs.

nothing

redeem
it

her
relative
consider
that
the
penury

table
discredit

they
have

inaugurate
the
custom
of
let
the


lady
take
their
cloak
off
in

that
,

Newland
Archer
,
as
become
a
young
man
of
his
position
,
stroll
in


somewhat
late
.
 
he
have
leave
his
overcoat
with
the
silk

a
while
in

on
the
threshold
of
the
crimson

Archer
be
distinctly
nervous
.
 
he
have
not
go
back
to
his
club
after


the
Opera
(
as
the
young
blood
usually
do
)
,
but
,
the
night
be
fine
,


have
walk
for
some
distance
up
Fifth
Avenue
before
turn
back
in
the


direction
of
the
Beauforts
'
house
.
 
he
be
definitely
afraid
that
the


Mingotts
might
be
go
too
far
;
that
,
in
fact
,
they
might
have
Granny


Mingott
's
order
to
bring
the
Countess
Olenska
to
the
ball
.




from
the
tone
of
the
club
box
he
have
perceive
how
grave
a
mistake
that


would
be
;
and
,
though
he
be
more
than
ever
determine
to
"
see
the


thing
through
,
"
he
feel
less
chivalrously
eager
to
champion
his


betroth
's
cousin
than
before
their
brief
talk
at
the
Opera
.




wander
on
to
the
bouton
d'or
drawing

room
(
where
Beaufort
have
have


the
audacity
to

Couples

and
ornament
of
the
young

on
the


glitter
of
highly
glaze

and
fresh
glace
glove
.




Miss
Welland
,
evidently
about
to
join
the
dancer
,
hang
on
the


threshold
,
her
lily
-
of
-
the

valley
in
her
hand
(
she
carry
no
other


bouquet
)
,
her
face
a
little
pale
,
her
eye
burn
with
a
candid


excitement
.
 
a
group
of
young
man
and
girl
be
gather
about
she
,


and
there
be
much
hand
-
clasping
,
laughing
and
pleasantry
on
which
Mrs.


Welland
,
stand
slightly
apart
,
shed
the
beam
of
a
qualified


approval
.
 
it
be
evident
that
Miss
Welland
be
in
the
act
of


announce
her
engagement
,
while
her
mother
affect
the
air
of


parental
reluctance
consider
suitable
to
the
occasion
.




Archer
pause
a
moment
.
 
it
be
at
his
express
wish
that
the


announcement
have
be
make
,
and
yet
it
be
not
thus
that
he
would
have


wish
to
have
his
happiness
know
.
 
to
proclaim
it
in
the
heat
and


noise
of
a
crowded
ball
-
room
be
to
rob
it
of
the
fine
bloom
of
privacy


which
should
belong
to
thing
nearest
the
heart
.
 
his
joy
be
so
deep


that
this
blurring
of
the
surface
leave
its
essence
untouched
;
but
he


would
have
like
to
keep
the
surface
pure
too
.
 
it
be
something
of
a


satisfaction
to
find
that
may
Welland
share
this
feeling
.
 
her
eye


flee
to
his
beseechingly
,
and
their
look
say
:
 
"
remember
,

this

it
be
right

"




no
appeal
could
have
find
a
more
immediate
response
in
Archer
's


breast
;
but
he
wish
that
the
necessity
of
their
action
have
be


represent
by
some
ideal
reason
,
and
not
simply
by
poor
Ellen
Olenska
.


the
group
about
Miss
Welland
make
way
for
he
with
significant
smile
,


and
after
take
his
share
of
the
felicitation
he
draw
his
betrothed


into
the
middle
of
the
ball

and
put
his
arm
about
her
waist
.




"

he
say
,
smile
into
her
candid
eye
,
as


they
float
away
on
the
soft
wave
of
the
Blue
Danube
.




she
make
no
answer
.
 
her
lip
tremble
into
a
smile
,
but
the
eye


remain
distant
and
serious
,
as
if
bent
on
some
ineffable
vision
.


"

over

as
become
an
affianced

into

the
young

his
time
call
on


married
woman

but
I
daresay
in
the
set
she
be
live
in
they
do

they


never
do
anything
else

"
and
,
in
spite
of
the
cosmopolitan
view
on


which
he
pride
himself
,
he
thank
heaven
that
he

a
New

himself
with

the
next
evening
old
Mr.
Sillerton
Jackson
come
to
dine
with
the


archer
.




Mrs.
Archer
be
a
shy
woman
and
shrink
from
society
;
but
she
like
to


be
well
-
inform
as
to
its
doing
.
 
her
old
friend
Mr.
Sillerton


Jackson
apply
to
the
investigation
of
his
friend
'
affair
the


patience
of
a
collector
and
the
science
of
a
naturalist
;
and
his


sister
,
Miss
Sophy
Jackson
,
who
live
with
he
,
and
be
entertain
by


all
the
people

could
not

she
much

seek

after
brother

bring
home
bit
of
minor
gossip
that
fill
out
usefully
the
gap
in


his
picture

therefore
,
whenever
anything
happen
that
Mrs.
Archer
want
to
know


about
,
she
ask
Mr.

to
dine
;
and
as
she
honour
few
people


with
her
invitation
,
and
as
she
and
her
daughter
Janey
be
an


excellent
audience
,
Mr.
Jackson
usually
come
himself
instead
of

his
sister
.
 
if
he
could
have
dictate
all
the
condition
,
he
would


have
choose
the
evening
when
Newland
be
out
;
not
because
the
young


man
be
uncongenial
to
he
(
the
two
get
on
capitally
at
their
club
)
but


because
the
old
anecdotist
sometimes
feel
,
on
Newland
's
part
,
a


tendency
to
weigh
his
evidence
that
the
lady
of
the
family
never


show

Mr.
Jackson
,
if
perfection
have
be
attainable
on
earth
,
would
also


have
ask
that
Mrs.
Archer
's
food
should
be
a
little
well
.

then

far
back
as
the
mind
of
man
could
travel

be

into
the
two
great
fundamental
group

the
Mingotts

look
down
on

from
Mrs.

Mr.

what


they
principally

stir
up

such

generosity

in

only
a


humbug
disguise
of

inexorable
convention
that
tie
thing


together

bind
people
down

the

it

absurd
to
speculate
what
his

what

his
duty
,

his

he

with
a

he
see
his

what
most
of
the
other

a

as

know
to
blush
indignantly

and
avert
her
gaze
,
when
some
one
allude
in
her
presence
to
the
fact


that
Julius

(
as

a

doubtful
origin

"




Archer
try
to
console
himself
with
the
thought
that
he
be
not
quite


such
an
ass
as
Larry
Lefferts
,
nor
may
such
a
simpleton
as
poor


Gertrude
;
but
the
difference
be
after
all
one
of
intelligence
and
not


of
standard
.
 
in
reality
they
all
live
in
a
kind
of
hieroglyphic


world
,
where
the
real
thing
be
never
say
or
do
or
even
think
,
but


only
represent
by
a
set
of
arbitrary
sign
;
as
when
Mrs.
Welland
,
who


know
exactly
why
Archer
have
press
she
to
announce
her
daughter
's


engagement
at
the
Beaufort
ball
(
and
have
indeed
expect
he
to
do
no


less

felt
oblige
to
simulate
reluctance
,
and
the
air
of
have


have
her
hand
force
,
quite
as
,
in
the
book
on
primitive

parent

the
result
,

course
,
be
that
the
young
girl
who
be
the
centre
of


this
elaborate
system
of
mystification
remain
the
more
inscrutable


for
her
very
frankness
and
assurance
.
 
she
be
frank
,
poor
darling
,


because
she
have
nothing
to
conceal
,
assure
because
she
know
of
nothing


to
be
on
her
guard
against
;
and
with
no
well
preparation
than
this
,


she
be
to
be
plunge
overnight
into
what
people
evasively
call
"
the


fact
of
life

"




the
young
man

sincerely

placidly
in
love

in
the


radiant
good
look
of
his
betrothed
,
in
her
health
,
her
horsemanship
,


her
grace
and
quickness
at
game

the
shy
interest
in
book
and


idea
that
she
be
begin
to
develop
under
his
guidance
.
 
(
she
have


advance
far
enough
to
join
he
in
ridicule
the
Idyls
of
the
King
,


but
not
to
feel
the
beauty
of
Ulysses
and
the
Lotus
Eaters
.
)
she
be


straightforward
,
loyal
and
brave
;
she
have
a
sense
of
humour
(
chiefly


prove
by
her
laugh
at
his
joke
)
;
and
he
suspect
,
in
the
depth


of
her
innocently
-
gaze
soul
,
a
glow
of
feeling
that
it
would
be
a
joy


to
waken
.
 
but
when
he
have
go
the
brief
round
of
she
he
return


discourage
by
the
thought
that
all
this
frankness
and
innocence
be


only
an
artificial
product
.
 
untrained
human
nature
be
not
frank
and


innocent
;
it
be
full
of
the
twist
and
defence
of
an
instinctive


guile
.
 
and
he
feel
himself
oppress
by
this
creation
of
factitious


purity
,
so
cunningly
manufacture
by
a
conspiracy
of
mother
and
aunt


and
grandmother
and
long
-
dead
ancestress
,
because
it
be
suppose
to


be
what
he
want
,
what
he
have
a
right
to
,
in
order
that
he
might


exercise
his
lordly
pleasure
in
smash
it
like
an
image
make
of
snow
.




there
be
a
certain
triteness
in
these
reflection
:
they
be
those


habitual
to
young
man
on
the
approach
of
their
wedding
day
.
 
but
they


be
generally
accompany
by
a
sense
of
compunction
and
self
-
abasement


of
which
Newland
Archer
feel
no
trace
.
 
he
could
not
deplore
(
as


Thackeray
's
hero
so
often
exasperate
he
by
do
)
that
he
have
not
a


blank
page
to
offer
his
bride
in
exchange
for
the
unblemished
one
she


be
to
give
to
he
.
 
he
could
not
get
away
from
the
fact
that
if
he
have


be
bring
up
as
she

they
would
have
be
no
more
fit
to
find


their
way
about
than
the
Babes

the
Wood
;
nor
could
he
,
for
all
his


anxious
cogitation
,
see
any
honest
reason
(
any
,
that
is
,
unconnected


with
his
own
momentary
pleasure
,

the
passion
of
masculine
vanity

why
his
bride
should
not
have
be
allow
the

freedom
of


experience
as
himself

such
question

at
such
an
hour
,

to
drift
through
his
mind
;

he

conscious
that
their
uncomfortable
persistence
and
precision


be
due
to
the
inopportune
arrival
of
the
Countess

the
very
moment
of
his
betrothal

a
moment
for
pure
thought


and
cloudless
hope

pitchfork
into
a
coil
of
scandal

raise


all
the
special

would
have

to
let

fate

on
his
;

no

;

when

poor

finally
die
in

for
some
time
no

of
they
;
then
news
come
of
Ellen
's
marriage
to
an
immensely
rich
polish


nobleman
of
legendary
fame
,
whom
she
have
meet
at
a
ball
at
the


Tuileries

and
who
be
say
to
have
princely
establishment
in
Paris

Nice

Florence
,
a
yacht

and
many
square
mile
of

she
disappear
in
a
kind
of
sulphurous
apotheosis
,


and
when
a
few
year
later
Medora
again
come
back
to
New
York
,
subdue
,


impoverished
,
mourn
a
third
husband

in
quest
of
a
still
small


house
,
people
wonder
that
her
rich
niece
have
not
be
able
to
do


something
for
she
.
 
then
come
the
news
that
Ellen
's
own
marriage
have


end
in
disaster
,

that
she
be
herself
return
home
to
seek
rest


and
oblivion
among
her
kinsfolk
.




these
thing
pass
through
Newland
Archer
's
mind
a
week
later
as
he


watch
the
Countess
Olenska
enter
the
van
der
Luyden
drawing
-
room
on


the
evening
of
the
momentous
dinner
.
 
the
occasion
be
a
solemn
one
,


and
he
wonder
a
little
nervously
how
she
would
carry
it
off
.
 
she


come
rather
late
,
one
hand
still
unglove
,
and
fasten
a
bracelet


about
her
wrist
;
yet
she
enter
without
any
appearance
of
haste
or


embarrassment
the
drawing
-
room
in
which
New
York
's
most
choose
company


be
somewhat
awfully
assemble
.




in
the
middle
of
the
room
she
pause
,
look
about
she
with
a
grave


mouth
and
smile
eye
;
and
in
that
instant
Newland
Archer
reject
the


general
verdict
on
her
look
.
 
it
be
true
that
her
early
radiance
be


go
.
 
the
red
cheek
have
pale
;
she
be
thin
,
worn
,
a
little


older
-
look
than
her
age
,
which
must
have
be
nearly
thirty
.
 
but


there
be
about
she
the
mysterious
authority
of
beauty
,
a
sureness
in


the
carriage
of
the
head
,
the
movement
of
the
eye
,
which
,
without


be
in
the
least
theatrical
,
strike
his
as
highly
train
and
full
of


a
conscious
power
.
 
at
the
same
time
she
be
simple
in
manner
than


most
of
the
lady
present
,
and
many
people
(
as
he
hear
afterward
from


Janey
)
be
disappoint
that
her
appearance
be
not
more


"
stylish"--for
stylishness
be
what
New
York
most
value
.
 
it
be
,


perhaps
,
Archer
reflect
,
because
her
early
vivacity
have
disappear
;


because
she
be
so
quiet
--
quiet
in
her
movement
,
her
voice
,
and
the


tone
of
her
low
-
pitch
voice
.
 
New
York
have
expect
something
a
good


deal
more
reasonant
in
a
young
woman
with
such
a
history
.




the
dinner
be
a
somewhat
formidable
business
.
 
dine
with
the
van
der


Luydens
be
at
good
no
light
matter
,
and
dine
there
with
a
Duke
who


be
their
cousin
be
almost
a
religious
solemnity
.
 
it
please
Archer


to
think
that
only
an
old
New
Yorker
could
perceive
the
shade
of


difference
(
to
New
York
)
between
be
merely
a
Duke
and
be
the
van


der
Luydens
'
Duke
.
 
New
York
take
stray
nobleman
calmly
,
and
even


(
except
in
the
Struthers
set
)
with
a
certain
distrustful
hauteur
;
but


when
they
present
such
credential
as
these
they
be
receive
with


an
old
-
fashioned
cordiality
that
they
would
have
be
greatly
mistaken


in
ascribe
solely
to
their
standing
in
Debrett
.
 
it
be
for
just
such


distinction
that
the
young
man
cherish
his
old
New
York
even
while


he
smile
at
it
.




the
van
der
Luydens
have
do
their
good
to
emphasise
the
importance
of


the
occasion
.
 
the
du
Lac
Sevres
and
the
Trevenna
George
II
plate
be


out
;
so
be
the
van
der
Luyden
"
Lowestoft
"
(
East
India
Company
)
and
the


Dagonet
Crown
Derby
.
 
Mrs.
van
der
Luyden
look
more
than
ever
like
a


Cabanel
,
and
Mrs.
Archer
,
in
her
grandmother
's
seed
-
pearl
and


emerald
,
remind
her
son
of
an
Isabey
miniature
.
 
all
the
lady
have


on
their
handsome
jewel
,
but
it
be
characteristic
of
the
house
and


the
occasion
that
these
be
mostly
in
rather
heavy
old
-
fashioned


setting
;
and
old
Miss
Lanning
,
who
have
be
persuade
to
come
,


actually
wear
her
mother
's
cameo
and
a
spanish
blonde
shawl
.




the
Countess
Olenska
be
the
only
young
woman
at
the
dinner
;
yet
,
as


Archer
scan
the
smooth
plump
elderly
face
between
their
diamond


necklace
and
tower
ostrich
feather
,
they
strike
he
as
curiously


immature
compare
with
hers
.
 
it
frighten
he
to
think
what
must
have


go
to
the
making
of
her
eye
.




the
Duke
of
St.
Austrey
,
who
sit
at
his
hostess
's
right
,
be
naturally


the
chief
figure
of
the
evening
.
 
but
if
the
Countess
Olenska
be
less


conspicuous
than
have
be
hope
,
the
Duke
be
almost
invisible
.
 
be


a
well
-
breed
man
he
have
not
(
like
another
recent
ducal
visitor
)
come
to


the
dinner
in
a
shooting
-
jacket
;
but
his
evening
clothe
be
so
shabby


and
baggy
,
and
he
wear
they
with
such
an
air
of
their
be
homespun
,


that
(
with
his
stoop
way
of
sitting
,
and
the
vast
beard
spread


over
his
shirt
-
front
)
he
hardly
give
the
appearance
of
be
in
dinner


attire
.
 
he
be
short
,
round
-
shoulder
,
sunburnt
,
with
a
thick
nose
,


small
eye
and
a
sociable
smile
;
but
he
seldom
speak
,
and
when
he
do


it
be
in
such
low
tone
that
,
despite
the
frequent
silence
of


expectation
about
the
table
,
his
remark
be
lose
to
all
but
his


neighbour
.




when
the
man
join
the
lady
after
dinner
the
Duke
go
straight
up


to
the
Countess
Olenska
,
and
they
sit
down
in
a
corner
and
plunge
into


animate
talk
.
 
neither
seem
aware
that
the
Duke
should
first
have


pay
his
respect
to
Mrs.
Lovell
Mingott
and
Mrs.
Headly
Chivers
,
and


the
Countess
have
converse
with
that
amiable
hypochondriac
,
Mr.
Urban


dagonet
of
Washington
Square
,
who
,
in
order
to
have
the
pleasure
of


meet
she
,
have
break
through
his
fix
rule
of
not
dine
out


between
January
and
April
.
 
the
two
chat
together
for
nearly
twenty


minute
;
then
the
Countess
rise
and
,
walk
alone
across
the
wide


drawing
-
room
,
sit
down
at
Newland
Archer
's
side
.




it
be
not
the
custom
in
New
York
drawing
-
room
for
a
lady
to
get
up


and
walk
away
from
one
gentleman
in
order
to
seek
the
company
of


another
.
 
Etiquette
require
that
she
should
wait
,
immovable
as
an


idol
,
while
the
man
who
wish
to
converse
with
she
succeed
each


other
at
her
side
.
 
but
the
Countess
be
apparently
unaware
of
have


break
any
rule
;
she
sit
at
perfect
ease
in
a
corner
of
the
sofa
beside


Archer
,
and
look
at
he
with
the
kind
eye
.




"
I
want
you
to
talk
to
I
about
May
,
"
she
say
.




instead
of
answer
she
he
ask
:
 
"
you
know
the
Duke
before
?
"




"
oh
,
yes
--
we
use
to
see
he
every
winter
at
Nice
.
 
he
be
very
fond
of


gambling
--
he
use
to
come
to
the
house
a
great
deal
.
"
 
she
say
it
in


the
simple
manner
,
as
if
she
have
say
:
 
"
he
be
fond
of
wild
-
flower
"
;


and
after
a
moment
she
add
candidly
:
 
"
I
think
he
be
the
dull
man
I


ever
meet
.
"




this
please
her
companion
so
much
that
he
forget
the
slight
shock
she


previous
remark
have
cause
he
.
 
it
be
undeniably
exciting
to
meet
a


lady
who
find

nocturnal
stroll

the

have
ask
himself
,
with
a
little


shiver
,
if
the
humanity

more

as
Archer


muster
its
modest
front
he
say
to
himself
that
the
Polish
Count
must


have
rob
she
of
her
fortune
as
well
as
of
her
illusion

the
young
man

spend
an
unsatisfactory
day

he
have
lunch
with

afterward
to
carry
off
May

he


want
to
have
she
to
himself

to
tell
she
how
enchanting
she
have


look
the
night
before

how
proud
he
be
of
she
,
and
to
press
she


to
hasten
their
marriage
.
 
but
Mrs.
Welland
have
firmly
remind
he


that
the
round
of
family
visit
be
not
half
over
,
and
,
when
he
hint


at
advance
the
date
of
the
wedding
,
have
raise
reproachful
eye
-
brow

sigh
out
:
 
"
twelve
dozen
of
everything

Archer
,
when
the
afternoon
's
round
be
over
,
part
from


his
betrothed
with
the
feeling
that
he
have
be
show
off
like
a
wild


animal
cunningly
trap
.
 
he
suppose
that
his
reading
in


anthropology
cause
he
to
take
such
a
coarse
view
of
what
be
after


all
a
simple
and
natural
demonstration
of
family
feeling
;
but
when
he


remember
that
the
Wellands
do
not
expect
the
wedding
to
take
place


till
the
follow
autumn
,
and
picture
what
his
life
would
be
till


then
,
a
dampness
fall
upon
his
spirit
.




"
tomorrow
,

Mrs.

call
after
he
,
"
we
'll
do
the
Chiverses
and


the
dallas

and
he
perceive
that
she
be
go
through
their
two


family
alphabetically
,
and
that
they
be
only
in
the
first
quarter


of
the
alphabet
.




he
have
mean
to
tell
May
of
the
Countess
Olenska
's
request
--
she


command
,
rather
--
that
he
should
call
on
she
that
afternoon
;
but
in
the


brief
moment
when
they
be
alone
he
have
have
more
press
thing
to


say
.
 
besides
,
it
strike
he
as
a
little
absurd
to
allude
to
the


matter
.
 
he
know
that
May
most
particularly
want
he
to
be
kind
to


her
cousin
;
be
it
not
that
wish
which
have
hasten
the
announcement
of


their
engagement
?
 
it
give
he
an
odd
sensation
to
reflect
that
,
but


for
the
Countess
's
arrival
,
he
might
have
be
,
if
not
still
a
free


man
,
at
least
a
man
less
irrevocably
pledge
.
 
but
May
have
will
it


so
,
and
he
feel
himself
somehow
relieve
of
further
responsibility
--
and


therefore
at
liberty
,
if
he
choose
,
to
call
on
her
cousin
without


tell
she
.




as
he
stand
on
Madame
Olenska
's
threshold
curiosity
be
his
uppermost


feeling
.
 
he
be
puzzle
by
the
tone
in
which
she
have
summon
he
;
he


conclude
that
she
be
less
simple
than
she
seem
.




the
door
be
open
by
a
swarthy
foreign
-
look
maid
,
with
a
prominent


bosom
under
a
gay
neckerchief
,
whom
he
vaguely
fancy
to
be
sicilian
.


she
welcome
he
with
all
her
white
tooth
,
and
answer
his
enquiry


by
a
head
-
shake
of
incomprehension
lead
he
through
the
narrow
hall
into


a
low
firelit
drawing

room

the
room
be
empty
,
and
she
leave
he
,
for


an
appreciable
time
,
to
wonder
whether
she
have
go
to
find
she


mistress
,
or
whether
she
have
not
understand
what
he
be
there
for
,
and


think
it
might
be
to
wind
the
clock
--
of
which
he
perceive
that
the


only
visible
speciman
have
stop
.
 
he
know
that
the
southern
race


communicate
with
each
other
in
the
language
of
pantomime
,
and
be


mortify
to
find
her
shrug
and
smile
so
unintelligible
.
 
at
length


she
return
with
a
lamp
;
and
Archer
,
having
meanwhile
put
together
a


phrase
out
of
Dante
and
Petrarch
,
evoke
the
answer
:
"
La
signora
e


fuori
;
ma
verra
subito

;
which
he
take
to
mean
:
 
"
she
be
out

but
you
'll


soon
see
.
"




what
he
see
,
meanwhile
,
with
the
help
of
the
lamp
,
be
the
faded


shadowy
charm
of
a
room
unlike
any
room
he

Newland
Archer
pride
himself
on
his
knowledge
of
italian
art
.
 
his


boyhood
have
be
saturate
with
Ruskin
,
and
he
have
read
all
the
late


book
:
John
Addington
Symonds
,
Vernon
Lee
's
"
euphorion
,
"
the
essay
of


P.
G.
Hamerton
,
and
a
wonderful
new
volume
call
"
The
Renaissance
"
by


Walter
Pater
.
 
he
talk
easily
of
Botticelli
,
and
speak
of
Fra


Angelico
with
a
faint
condescension
.
 
but
these
picture
bewilder


he
,
for
they
be
like
nothing
that
he
be
accustomed
to
look
at
(
and


therefore
able
to
see
)
when
he
travel
in
Italy
;
and
perhaps
,
also
,


his
power
of
observation
be
impair
by
the
oddness
of
find


himself
in
this
strange
empty
house
,
where
apparently
no
one
expect


he
.
 
he
be
sorry
that
he
have
not
tell
May
Welland
of
Countess


Olenska
's
request
,
and
a
little
disturb
by
the
thought
that
his


betrothed
might
come
in
to
see
her
cousin
.
 
what
would
she
think
if
she


find
he
sit
there
with
the
air
of
intimacy
imply
by
wait


alone
in
the
dusk
at
a
lady
's
fireside
?




but
since
he
have
come
he
mean
to
wait
;
and
he
sink
into
a
chair
and


stretch
his
foot
to
the
log
.




it
be
odd
to
have
summon
he
in
that
way
,
and
then
forget
he
;


but
Archer
feel
more
curious
than
mortify
.
 
the
atmosphere
of
the


room
be
so
different
from
any
he
have
ever
breathe
that


self

consciousness
vanish
in
the
sense
of
adventure
.
 
he

be


before

hang
with
red
damask
,
with
picture
"
of
the


italian
school

;
what
strike
he
be
the
way
in
which
Medora
Manson

with
its
blighted
background
of

by
a
turn

the

the
skilful

transform
into
something
intimate
,
"
foreign
,
"


subtly
suggestive
of
old
romantic
scene
and
sentiment
.
 
he
try
to


analyse
the
trick
,
to
find
a
clue
to
it
in
the
way
the
chair
and


table
be
group
,
in
the
fact
that
only
two
Jacqueminot
rose
(
of


which
nobody
ever
buy
less
than
a
dozen

have
be
place
in
the


slend
vase
at
his
elbow
,
and
in
the
vague
pervading
perfume
that
be


not
what
one
put
on
handkerchief
,
but
rather
like
the
scent
of
some


far
-
off
bazaar
,
a
smell
make
up
of
turkish
coffee
and
ambergris
and


dry
rose
.




his
mind
wander
away
to
the
question
of
what
May
's
drawing

would


look
like
.
 
he
know
that
Mr.

the

the

in
a
ghastly

the

hue

a

Archer
would
have
like
to
travel
,
to


put
off
the
housing
question
;
but
,
though
the
Wellands
approve
of
an


extend
european
honeymoon
(
perhaps
even
a
winter
in
Egypt

,
they
be


firm
as
to
the
need
of
a
house

the

man


feel
that
his
fate

for
the
rest

would
go
up


every
evening
between
the
cast

iron
railing
of
that
greenish

yellow


doorstep

pass
through
a
pompeian
vestibule
into
a
hall
with
a


wainscote
of
varnish
yellow
wood

beyond

his
imagination

not

want
anything


different

of
the
young
man
of
his
age
have
be


through
,
and
emerge
from
with
calm
conscience
and
an
undisturbed


belief
in
the
abysmal
distinction
between
the
woman
one
love
and


respected
and
those
one
enjoy
--
and
pity
.
 
in
this
view
they
be


sedulously
abet
by
their
mother
,
aunt
and
other
elderly
female


relative
,
who
all
share
Mrs.
Archer
's
belief
that
when
"
such
thing


happen
"
it
be
undoubtedly
foolish
of
the
man
,
but
somehow
always


criminal
of
the
woman
.
 
all
the
elderly
lady
whom
Archer
know


regard
any
woman
who
love
imprudently
as
necessarily
unscrupulous


and
designing
,
and
mere
simple
-
minded
man
as
powerless
in
her
clutch
.


the
only
thing
to
do
be
to
persuade
he
,
as
early
as
possible
,
to


marry
a
nice
girl
,
and
then
trust
to
she
to
look
after
he
.




in
the
complicated
old
european
community
,
Archer
begin
to
guess
,


love
-
problem
might
be
less
simple
and
less
easily
classify
.
 
Rich


and
idle
and
ornamental
society
must
produce
many
more
such


situation
;
and
there
might
even
be
one
in
which
a
woman
naturally


sensitive
and
aloof
would
yet
,
from
the
force
of
circumstance
,
from


sheer
defencelessness
and
loneliness
,
be
draw
into
a
tie
inexcusable


by
conventional
standard
.




on
reach
home
he
write
a
line
to
the
Countess
Olenska
,
ask
at


what
hour
of
the
next
day
she
could
receive
he
,
and
despatch
it
by
a


messenger
-
boy
,
who
return
presently
with
a
word
to
the
effect
that


she
be
go
to
skuytercliff
the
next
morning
to
stay
over
Sunday
with


the
van
der
Luydens
,
but
that
he
would
find
she
alone
that
evening


after
dinner
.
 
the
note
be
write
on
a
rather
untidy
half

sheet
,


without

her
hand
be
firm
and
free

be
amused


at
the
idea
of
her
week
-
end
in
the
stately
solitude
of
Skuytercliff
,


but
immediately
afterward
feel
that
there
,

all

would


most
feel
the
chill

away

small

be
theirs

that


the

see
a

there
be
something
perverse

provocative


in
the
notion

fur
wear
in
the
evening
in

heated

in
the
combination

hat


under

unreserved
;
in


the
stall

people
smile
a
little
at
the
hackneyed


sentiment
and
clap

and
enjoy
the
play
as
much
as

there
be
one
episode
,
in
particular
,
that
hold
the
house
from
floor
to


ceiling
.
 
it
be
that
in
which
Harry
Montague
,
after
a
sad
,
almost


monosyllabic
scene
of
part
with
Miss
Dyas
,
bid
her
good
-
bye
,
and


turn
to
go
.
 
the
actress
,
who
be
stand
near
the
mantelpiece
and


look
down
into
the
fire
,
wear
a
gray
cashmere
dress
without


fashionable
looping
or
trimming
,
mould
to
her
tall
figure
and


flow
in
long
line
about
her
foot
.
 
around
her
neck
be
a
narrow


black
velvet
ribbon
with
the
end
fall
down
her
back
.




when
her
wooer
turn
from
she
she
rest
her
arm
against
the


mantel

shelf
and
bow
her
face
in
her
hand
.
 
on
the
threshold
he


pause
to
look
at
she
;
then
he
steal
back
,
lift
one
of
the
end
of


velvet
ribbon
,
kiss
it
,
and
leave
the
room
without
she
hear
he
or


change
her
attitude
.
 
and
on
this
silent
parting
the
curtain
fall
.




it
be
always
for
the
sake
of
that
particular
scene
that
Newland
Archer


go
to
see
"
the
Shaughraun
.
"
he
think
the
adieux
of
Montague
and
Ada


dyas
as
fine
as
anything
he
have
ever
see
Croisette
and
Bressant
do
in


Paris
,
or
Madge
Robertson
and
Kendal
in
London
;
in
its
reticence
,
its


dumb
sorrow
,
it
move
he
more
than
the
most
famous
histrionic


outpouring
.




on
the
evening
in
question
the
little
scene
acquire
an
add
poignancy


by
remind
he
--
he
could
not
have
say
why
--
of
his
leave
-
taking
from


Madame
Olenska
after
their
confidential
talk
a
week
or
ten
day
early
.




it
would
have
be
as
difficult
to
discover
any
resemblance
between
the


two
situation
as
between
the
appearance
of
the
person
concern
.


Newland
Archer
could
not
pretend
to
anything
approach
the
young


english
actor
's
romantic
good
look
,
and
Miss
Dyas
be
a
tall


red
-
haired
woman
of
monumental
build
whose
pale
and
pleasantly
ugly


face
be
utterly
unlike
Ellen
Olenska
's
vivid
countenance
.
 
nor
be


Archer
and
Madame
Olenska
two
lover
part
in
heart
-
break
silence
;


they
be
client
and
lawyer
separate
after
a
talk
which
have
give
the


lawyer
the
bad
possible
impression
of
the
client
's
case
.
 
Wherein
,


then
,
lie
the
resemblance
that
make
the
young
man
's
heart
beat
with
a


kind
of
retrospective
excitement
?
 
it
seem
to
be
in
Madame
Olenska
's


mysterious
faculty
of
suggest
tragic
and
move
possibility


outside
the
daily
run
of
experience
.
 
she
have
hardly
ever
say
a
word


to
he
to
produce
this
impression
,
but
it
be
a
part
of
she
,
either
a


projection
of
her
mysterious
and
outlandish
background
or
of
something


inherently
dramatic
,
passionate
and
unusual
in
herself
.
 
Archer
have


always
be
inclined
to
think
that
chance
and
circumstance
play
a


small
part
in
shape
people
's
lot
compare
with
their
innate
tendency


to
have
thing
happen
to
they
.
 
this
tendency
he
have
feel
from
the


first
in
Madame
Olenska
.
 
the
quiet
,
almost
passive
young
woman
strike


he
as
exactly
the
kind
of
person
to
whom
thing
be
bind
to
happen
,


no
matter
how
much
she
shrink
from
they
and
go
out
of
her
way
to


avoid
they
.
 
the
exciting
fact
be
she
having
live
in
an
atmosphere
so


thick
with
drama
that
her
own
tendency
to
provoke
it
have
apparently


pass
unperceived
.
 
it
be
precisely
the
odd
absence
of
surprise
in


she
that
give
he
the
sense
of
she
having
be
pluck
out
of
a
very


maelstrom
:
the
thing
she
take
for
grant
give
the
measure
of
those


she
have
rebel
against
.




Archer
have
leave
she
with
the
conviction
that
Count
Olenski
's
accusation


be
not
unfounded
.
 
the
mysterious
person
who
figure
in
his
wife
's


past
as
"
the
secretary
"
have
probably
not
be
unrewarded
for
his
share


in
her
escape
.
 
the
condition
from
which
she
have
flee
be


intolerable
,
past
speak
of
,
past
believe
:
she
be
young
,
she
be


frighten
,
she
be
desperate
--
what
more
natural
than
that
she
should


be
grateful
to
her
rescuer
?
 
the
pity
be
that
her
gratitude
put
she
,


in
the
law
's
eye
and
the
world
's
,
on
a
par
with
she
abominable


husband
.
 
Archer
have
make
she
understand
this
,
as
he
be
bind
to
do
;


he
have
also
make
she
understand
that
simplehearte
kindly
New
York
,
on


whose
large
charity
she
have
apparently
count
,
be
precisely
the


place
where
she
could
least
hope
for
indulgence
.




to
have
to
make
this
fact
plain
to
she
--
and
to
witness
she
resign


acceptance
of
it
--
have
be
intolerably
painful
to
he
.
 
he
feel
himself


draw
to
she
by
obscure
feeling
of
jealousy
and
pity
,
as
if
she


dumbly
-
confess
error
have
put
she
at
his
mercy
,
humble
yet
endear


she
.
 
he
be
glad
it
be
to
he
she
have
reveal
her
secret
,
rather


than
to
the
cold
scrutiny
of
Mr.
Letterblair
,
or
the
embarrassed
gaze


of
her
family
.
 
he
immediately
take
it
upon
himself
to
assure
they
both


that
she
have
give
up
her
idea
of
seek
a
divorce
,
base
she


decision
on
the
fact
that
she
have
understand
the
uselessness
of
the


proceed
;
and
with
infinite
relief
they
have
all
turn
their
eye


from
the
"
unpleasantness
"
she
have
spare
they
.




"
I
be
sure
Newland
would
manage
it
,
"
Mrs.
Welland
have
say
proudly
of


her
future
son
-
in
-
law
;
and
old
Mrs.
Mingott
,
who
have
summon
he
for
a


confidential
interview
,
have
congratulate
he
on
his
cleverness
,
and


add
impatiently
:
 
"
silly
goose
!
 
I
tell
she
myself
what
nonsense
it


be
.
 
want
to
pass
herself
off
as
Ellen
Mingott

an
old
maid
,


when
she
have
the
luck
to
be
a
married
woman
and
a
Countess
!
"




these
incident
have
make
the
memory
of
his
last
talk
with
Madame


Olenska
so
vivid
to
the
young
man
that
as
the
curtain
fall
on
the


parting
of
the
two
actor
his
eye
fill
with
tear
,
and
he
stand
up


to
leave
the
theatre
.




in
do
so
,
he
turn
to
the
side
of
the
house
behind

see
the


lady

to

now
their

as
Mrs.

recognise


he
at
the

she
languid
little
gesture
of


invitation

it

impossible
not

go
into
the
box
.




Beaufort

Lefferts
make
way
for

after
a
few
word
with
Mrs.

always
prefer
to
look
beautiful

seat
himself

undertone
about

of
this
circumstantial
narrative
,

which
Mrs.
Beaufort


listen
with
her
perfect
smile
,

her
head
at
just
the
right
angle


to
be

in
profile
from
the
stall

Madame

turn
and

in

low
voice

"

a
leap
of
surprise

have
call


only
twice
on
Madame

have

card
.
 
she
have
never
before
make


any
allusion
to
the
flower
,
and
he
suppose
she
have
never
think
of


he
as
the
sender
.
 
now
her
sudden
recognition
of
the
gift
,

she


associate
it
with
the
tender
leave

taking
on
the
stage

with
an
agitated
pleasure
.




"
I
be
think
of

go
to
leave

to
take
the

to
his
surprise
her
colour
rise
,
reluctantly

duskily
.
 
she
look


down
at
the
mother

of

pearl
opera
-
glass
in
her
smoothly
glove
hand
,


and
say
,
after
a
pause
:
"
what
do
you
do
while
May
be
away
?
"




"
I
stick
to
my
work
,
"
he
answer
,
faintly
annoy
by
the
question
.




in
obedience
to
a
long
-
establish
habit
,
the
Wellands
have
leave
the


previous
week
for
St.
Augustine
,
where
,
out
of
regard
for
the
suppose


susceptibility
of
Mr.
Welland
's
bronchial
tube
,
they
always
spend
the


latter
part
of
the
winter
.
 
Mr.
Welland
be
a
mild
and
silent
man
,
with


no
opinion
but
with
many
habit
.
 
with
these
habit
none
might


interfere
;
and
one
of
they
demand
that
his
wife
and
daughter
should


always
go
with
he
on
his
annual
journey
to
the
south
.
 
to
preserve
an


unbroken
domesticity
be
essential
to
his
peace
of
mind
;
he
would
not


have
know
where
his
hair
-
brush
be
,
or
how
to
provide
stamp
for


his
letter
,
if
Mrs.
Welland
have
not
be
there
to
tell
he
.




as
all
the
member
of
the
family
adore
each
other
,
and
as
Mr.
Welland


be
the
central
object
of
their
idolatry
,
it
never
occur
to
his
wife


and
may
to
let
he
go
to
St.
Augustine
alone
;
and
his
son
,
who
be


both
in
the
law
,
and
could
not
leave
New
York
during
the
winter
,
always


join
he
for
Easter
and
travel
back
with
he
.




it
be
impossible
for
Archer
to
discuss
the
necessity
of

the
reputation
of
the
Mingotts

largely
base
on
the
attack
of
pneumonia
which
Mr.


Welland
have
never
have
;

his
insistence
on
St.

be


therefore
inflexible

originally
,

have
be
intend
that
May
's


engagement
should
not

announce

her
return
from
Florida
,

the
fact
that
it
have
be
make
know
soon
could
not
be
expect
to


alter
Mr.
Welland
's
plan

Archer
would
have
like
to
join
the


traveller
and
have
a
few
week
of
sunshine
and
boat
with
his


betroth
;
but
he
too
be
bind
by
custom
and
convention
.
 
little


arduous
as
his
professional
duty
be
,
he
would
have
be
convict


of
frivolity
by
the
whole
Mingott
clan
if
he
have
suggest
ask
for
a


holiday
in
mid
-
winter
;
and
he
accept
May
's
departure
with
the


resignation
which
he
perceive
would
have
to
be
one
of
the
principal


constituent
of
married
life

stand
up
,

leave
the
box

only
the
day
before
he
have
receive
a
letter
from
May
Welland
in
which
,


with
characteristic
candour
,
she
have
ask
he
to
"
be
kind
to
Ellen

in


their
absence
.
 
"
she
like
you

you
so
much

and
you
know
,


though
she
do
n't
show
it
,
she
be
still
very
lonely
and
unhappy
.
 
I


do
n't
think
Granny
understand
she
,
or
uncle
Lovell
Mingott
either
;


they
really
think
she
be
much
worldly
and
fonder
of
society
than
she


be
.
 
and
I
can
quite
see
that
New
York
must
seem
dull
to
she
,
though


the
family
wo
n't
admit
it
.
 
I
think
she
be
be
use
to

her
want
anything

lot
of
dinner

clothe

I
can
see
that
you
be
almost
the
only
person
in
New
York


who
can
talk
to
she
about

really
care

"




his
wise
May

how
he
have
love
she
for
that
letter

he
have
not

to
act
on
it

he
be
too
busy
,

he
do
not

an
engaged

play
too
conspicuously
the
part
of
Madame


Olenska
's
champion

he
have
an
idea
that
she
know
how
to
take
care
of


herself
a
good
deal
well

the

their
opportunity

never


see

exchange
a
word
with
she
,
without
feel
that
,
after
all
,


May
's
ingenuousness
almost

have
once
notice
his
eye
turn
toward
the


beaufort
box
.
 
the
two
man
shake
hand
,

Winsett
propose
a
bock
at


a
little

around
the
corner
.
 
Archer
,

not

the
mood

the
kind
of

be
likely

there

decline


on
the
plea
that
he
have
work

do
at

along
together

slightly
annoyed

what

,


why

it
be
unlike

on
his
last
word

Ned
Winsett
have
those
flash
of
penetration
;
they
be
the
most


interesting
thing
about
he
,

always
make
Archer
wonder
why
they
have


allow
he
to
accept
failure
so
stolidly
at
an
age
when
most
man
be


still
struggle

Archer
have
know
that
Winsett
have
a

he
have
never


see
they

the
two

always
meet
at
the

at
some
haunt

journalist

people
,
such
as
the
restaurant
where
Winsett


have
propose
to
go
for
a
bock
.
 
he
have
give
Archer
to
understand
that


his
wife
be
an
invalid
;
which
might
be
true
of
the
poor
lady
,

might


merely
mean
that
she
be
lack
in
social
gift

in
evening
clothe
,


or
in
both
.
 
Winsett
himself
have
a
savage
abhorrence
of
social


observance
:
Archer
,
who
dress
in
the
evening
because
he
think
it


clean
and
more
comfortable
to
do
so
,
and
who
have
never
stop
to


consider
that
cleanliness
and
comfort
be
two
of
the
costly
item
in


a
modest
budget
,
regard
Winsett
's
attitude
as
part
of
the
boring


"
Bohemian
"
pose
that
always
make
fashionable
people
,
who
change
their


clothe
without
talk
about
it
,
and
be
not
forever
harp
on
the


number
of
servant
one

seem
so
much
simple
and
less


self
-
conscious
than
the
other
.
 
nevertheless
,
he
be
always
stimulate


by
Winsett
,
and
whenever
he
catch
sight
of
the
journalist
's
lean


bearded
face
and
melancholy
eye
he
would
rout
he
out
of
his
corner

carry
he
off
for
a
long
talk

not
a

the
sterile


bitterness
of
the
still
young
man

have

up

his

Archer
take
the
measure

little

still


less

make
their

exhilarate
,
their
exchange

you
be
free
and
you
be
well
-
off
.
 
why
do
n't
you
get
into


touch
?
 
there
be
only
one
way
to
do
it
:
to
go
into
politic

"




Archer
throw
his
head
back
and
laugh
.
 
there
one
see
at
a
flash
the


unbridgeable
difference
between
man
like
Winsett
and
the


other
--
Archer
's
kind
.
 
every
one
in
polite
circle
know
that
,
in


America
,
"
a
gentleman
could
n't
go
into
politic
.
"
 
but
,
since
he
could


hardly
put
it
in
that
way
to
Winsett
,
he
answer
evasively
:
"
look
at


the
career
of
the
honest
man
in
american
politic
!
 
they
do
n't
want
we
.
"




"
who
be
'
they
'
?
 
why
do
n't
you
all
get
together
and
be
'
they
'


yourself
?
"




Archer
's
laugh
linger
on
his
lip
in
a
slightly
condescend
smile
.


it
be
useless
to
prolong
the
discussion
:
everybody
know
the
melancholy


fate
of
the
few
gentleman
who
have
risk
their
clean
linen
in
municipal


or
state
politic
in
New
York
.
 
the
day
be
past
when
that
sort
of


thing
be
possible
:
the
country
be
in
possession
of
the
boss
and
the


emigrant
,
and
decent
people
have
to
fall
back
on
sport
or
culture
.




"
culture
!
 
yes
--
if
we
have
it
!
 
but
there
be
just
a
few
little
local


patch
,
die
out
here
and
there
for
lack
of
--
well
,
hoeing
and


cross
-
fertilise
:
the
last
remnant
of
the
old
european
tradition
that


your
forebear
bring
with
they
.
 
but
you
be
in
a
pitiful
little


minority
:
you
've
get
no
centre
,
no
competition
,
no
audience
.
 
you
be


like
the
picture
on
the
wall
of
a
deserted
house
:
 
'
the
Portrait
of
a


Gentleman
.
'
 
you
'll
never
amount
to
anything

any
of
you
,
till
you
roll


up
your
sleeve
and
get
right
down
into
the
muck
.
 
that
,
or
emigrate


...
God
!
 
if
I
could
emigrate
...
"




Archer
mentally
shrug
his
shoulder
and
turn
the
conversation
back


to
book
,
where
Winsett
,
if
uncertain
,
be
always
interesting
.


Emigrate
!
 
as
if
a
gentleman
could
abandon
his
own
country
!
 
one
could


no
more
do
that
than
one
could
roll
up
one
's
sleeve
and
go
down
into


the
muck
.
 
a
gentleman
simply
stay
at
home
and
abstain
.
 
but
you


could
n't
make
a
man
like
Winsett
see
that
;
and
that
be
why
the
New


york
of
literary
club
and
exotic
restaurant
,
though
a
first
shake


make
it
seem
more
of
a
kaleidoscope
,
turn
out
,
in
the
end
,
to
be
a


small
box
,
with
a
more
monotonous
pattern
,
than
the
assemble
atom


of
Fifth
Avenue
.






the
next
morning
Archer
scour
the
town
in
vain
for
more
yellow
rose
.


in
consequence
of
this
search
he
arrive
late
at
the
office
,
perceive


that
his
do
so
make
no
difference
whatever
to
any
one
,
and
be


fill
with
sudden
exasperation
at
the
elaborate
futility
of
his
life
.


why
should
he
not
be
,
at
that
moment
,
on
the
sand
of
St.
Augustine


with
May
Welland
?
 
no

by
his

number
of

sit
at

trivial
task

simply
read
the

.
 
though
it
be
suppose
to
be
proper
for
they
to
have
an


occupation
,
the
crude
fact
of

the

,

a
profession
,
be
account
a
more


gentlemanly
pursuit
than

but
none
of
these
young

have


much
hope
of
really
advance
in
his
profession
,

any
earnest
desire


to
do
so
;

over
many
of

the
green
mould
of
the
perfunctory
be


already
perceptibly
spread
.




it
make
Archer
shiver
to
think
that
it
might
be
spread
over
he
too
.


he
have
,
to
be
sure
,
other
taste

interest

he
spend
his

cultivate
the
"

may
speak
of

generally
try
to
"
keep
up
,
"
as
he
have
somewhat
wistfully
put
it
to


Madame
Olenska
.
 
but
once
he
be
married
,
what
would
become
of
this


narrow
margin
of
life
in
which
his
real
experience
be
live
?
 
he
have


see
enough
of
other
young
man
who
have
dream
his
dream
,
though


perhaps
less
ardently
,
and
who
have
gradually
sink
into
the
placid
and


luxurious
routine
of
their
elder
.




from
the
office
he
send
a
note
by
messenger
to
Madame
Olenska
,
ask


if
he
might
call
that
afternoon
,
and
beg
she
to
let
he
find
a


reply
at
his
club
;

at
the
club
he
find
nothing
,
nor
do
he
receive


any
letter
the
following
day
.
 
this
unexpected
silence
mortify
he


beyond
reason
,

though
the
next
morning
he
see
a
glorious
cluster
of


yellow
rose
behind
a
florist

window

he
leave
it
there
.
 
it
be


only
on
the
third
morning
that
he
receive
a
line
by
post
from
the


Countess
Olenska

to
his
surprise
it

the

have
promptly
retreat

why
do
she

the

his
first


think
be
of
some
dark
menace
from
abroad
;
then
he
reflect
that
he


do
not
know
her
epistolary
style
,
and
that
it
might
run
to
picturesque


exaggeration

Women
always
exaggerate
;

moreover
she
be
not


wholly
at
her
ease

she

"
Je
I

evadee--
"
put
in
that
way
,


the
opening
sentence
immediately
suggest
that
she
might
merely
have


want
to
escape
from
a
boring
round
of
engagement
;
which
be
very


likely
true
,
for
he
judge
she
to
be
capricious
,
and
easily
weary
of


the
pleasure
of
the
moment
.




it
amuse
he
to
think
of
the
van

'
having
carry
she
off


to
Skuytercliff
on
a
second

this
time
for
an
indefinite


period
.
 
the
door
of
Skuytercliff

rarely
and
grudgingly
open
to


visitor

chilly
week

end

the
most
ever
offer
to
the
few


thus
privilege
.
 
but
Archer
have
see
,

his

the


delicious

remember
M.

undiscouraged
attachment
to
the


young

distinct
disappointment

"
Hallo
,
Beaufort
--
this
way
!
 
Madame
Olenska
be
expect
you
,
"
he
say
.






during
his
journey
back
to
New
York
the
next
morning
,
Archer
relive


with
a
fatiguing
vividness
his
last
moment
at
Skuytercliff
.




beaufort
,
though
clearly
annoyed
at
find
he
with
Madame
Olenska
,


have
,
as
usual
,
carry
off
the
situation
high
-
handedly
.
 
his
way
of


ignore
people
whose
presence
inconvenience
he
actually
give
they
,


if
they
be
sensitive
to
it
,
a
feeling
of
invisibility
,
of


nonexistence
.
 
Archer
,
as
the
three
stroll
back
through
the
park
,
be


aware
of
this
odd
sense
of
disembodiment
;
and
humble
as
it
be
to
his


vanity
it
give
he
the
ghostly
advantage
of
observe
unobserved
.




Beaufort
have
enter
the
little
house
with
his
usual
easy
assurance
;


but
he
could
not
smile
away
the
vertical
line
between
his
eye
.
 
it
be


fairly
clear
that
Madame
Olenska
have
not
know
that
he
be
come
,


though
her
word
to
Archer
have
hint
at
the
possibility
;
at
any
rate
,


she
have
evidently
not
tell
he
where
she
be
go
when
she
leave
New


York
,
and
her
unexplained
departure
have
exasperate
he
.
 
the


ostensible
reason
of
his
appearance
be
the
discovery
,
the
very
night


before
,
of
a
"
perfect
little
house
,
"
not
in
the
market
,
which
be


really
just
the
thing
for
she
,
but
would
be
snap
up
instantly
if
she


do
n't
take
it
;
and
he
be
loud
in
mock
-
reproach
for
the
dance
she


have
lead
he
in
run
away
just
as
he
have
find
it
.




"
if
only
this
new
dodge
for
talk
along
a
wire
have
be
a
little
bit


near
perfection
I
might
have
tell
you
all
this
from
town
,
and
be


toast
my
toe
before
the
club
fire
at
this
minute
,
instead
of


tramp
after
you
through
the
snow
,
"
he
grumble
,
disguise
a
real


irritation
under
the
pretence
of
it
;
and
at
this
open
Madame
Olenska


twist
the
talk
away
to
the
fantastic
possibility
that
they
might
one


day
actually
converse
with
each
other
from
street
to
street
,
or


even
--
incredible
dream!--from
one
town
to
another
.
 
this
strike
from


all
three
allusion
to
Edgar
Poe
and
Jules
Verne
,
and
such
platitude


as
naturally
rise
to
the
lip
of
the
most
intelligent
when
they
be


talk
against
time
,
and
deal
with
a
new
invention
in
which
it


would
seem
ingenuous
to
believe
too
soon
;
and
the
question
of
the


telephone
carry
they
safely
back
to
the
big
house
.




Mrs.
van
der
Luyden
have
not
yet
return
;
and
Archer
take
his
leave
and


walk
off
to
fetch
the
cutter
,
while
Beaufort
follow
the
Countess


Olenska
indoor
.
 
it
be
probable
that
,
little
as
the
van
der
Luydens


encourage
unannounced
visit
,
he
could
count
on
be
ask
to
dine
,


and
send
back
to
the
station
to
catch
the
nine
o'clock
train
;
but
more


than
that
he
would
certainly
not
get
,
for
it
would
be
inconceivable
to


his
host
that
a
gentleman
travel
without
luggage
should
wish
to


spend
the
night
,
and
distasteful
to
they
to
propose
it
to
a
person
with


whom
they
be
on
term
of
such
limited
cordiality
as
Beaufort
.




Beaufort
know
all
this
,
and
must
have
foresee
it
;
and
his
take
the


long
journey
for
so
small
a
reward
give
the
measure
of
his
impatience
.


he
be
undeniably
in
pursuit
of
the
Countess
Olenska
;
and
Beaufort
have


only
one
object
in
view
in
his
pursuit
of
pretty
woman
.
 
his
dull
and


childless
home
have
long
since
pal
on
he
;
and
in
addition
to
more


permanent
consolation
he
be
always
in
quest
of
amorous
adventure
in


his
own
set
.
 
this
be
the
man
from
whom
Madame
Olenska
be
avowedly


fly
:
the
question
be
whether
she
have
flee
because
his
importunity


displease
she
,
or
because
she
do
not
wholly
trust
herself
to
resist


they
;
unless
,
indeed
,
all
her
talk
of
flight
have
be
a
blind
,
and
she


departure
no
more
than
a
manoeuvre
.




Archer
do
not
really
believe
this
.
 
little
as
he
have
actually
see
of


Madame
Olenska
,
he
be
begin
to
think
that
he
could
read
her
face
,


and
if
not
her
face
,
her
voice
;
and
both
have
betray
annoyance
,
and


even
dismay
,
at
Beaufort
's
sudden
appearance
.
 
but
,
after
all
,
if
this


be
the
case
,
be
it
not
bad
than
if
she
have
leave
New
York
for
the


express
purpose
of
meet
he
?
 
if
she
have
do
that
,
she
cease
to
be


an
object
of
interest
,
she
throw
in
her
lot
with
the
vulgarest
of


dissembler
:
a
woman
engage
in
a
love
affair
with
Beaufort
"
class
"


herself
irretrievably
.




no
,
it
be
bad
a
thousand
time
if
,
judge
Beaufort
,
and
probably


despise
he
,
she
be
yet
draw
to
he
by
all
that
give
he
an


advantage
over
the
other
man
about
she
:
his
habit
of
two
continent
and


two
society
,
his
familiar
association
with
artist
and
actor
and


people
generally
in
the
world
's
eye
,
and
his
careless
contempt
for


local
prejudice
.
 
Beaufort
be
vulgar
,
he
be
uneducated
,
he
be


purse
-
proud
;
but
the
circumstance
of
his
life
,
and
a
certain
native


shrewdness
,
make
he
well
worth
talk
to
than
many
man
,
morally
and


socially
his
better
,
whose
horizon
be
bound
by
the
Battery
and
the


Central
Park
.
 
how
should
any
one
come
from
a
wide
world
not
feel


the
difference
and
be
attract
by
it
?




Madame
Olenska
,
in
a
burst
of
irritation
,
have
say
to
Archer
that
he


and
she
do
not
talk
the
same
language
;
and
the
young
man
know
that
in


some
respect
this
be
true
.
 
but
Beaufort
understand
every
turn
of
she


dialect
,
and
speak
it
fluently
:
his
view
of
life
,
his
tone
,
his


attitude
,
be
merely
a
coarser
reflection
of
those
reveal
in
Count


Olenski
's
letter
.
 
this
might
seem
to
be
to
his
disadvantage
with
Count


Olenski
's
wife
;
but
Archer
be
too
intelligent
to
think
that
a
young


woman
like
Ellen
Olenska
would
necessarily
recoil
from
everything
that


remind
she
of
her
past
.
 
she
might
believe
herself
wholly
in
revolt


against
it
;
but
what
have
charm
she
in
it
would
still
charm
she
,
even


though
it
be
against
her
will
.




thus
,
with
a
painful
impartiality
,
do
the
young
man
make
out
the
case


for
Beaufort
,
and
for
Beaufort
's
victim
.
 
a
longing
to
enlighten
she


be
strong
in
he
;
and
there
be
moment
when
he
imagine
that
all
she


ask
be
to
be
enlighten
.




that
evening
he
unpack
his
book
from
London
.
 
the
box
be
full
of


thing
he
have
be
wait
for
impatiently
;
a
new
volume
of
Herbert


Spencer
,
another
collection
of
the
prolific
Alphonse
Daudet
's
brilliant


tale
,
and
a
novel
call
"
Middlemarch
,
"
as
to
which
there
have
lately


be
interesting
thing
say
in
the
review
.
 
he
have
decline
three


dinner
invitation
in
favour
of
this
feast
;
but
though
he
turn
the


page
with
the
sensuous
joy
of
the
book
-
lover
,
he
do
not
know
what
he


be
read
,
and
one
book
after
another
drop
from
his
hand
.


suddenly
,
among
they
,
he
light
on
a
small
volume
of
verse
which
he
have


order
because
the
name
have
attract
he
:
 
"
the
House
of
Life
.
"
 
he


take
it
up
,
and
find
himself
plunge
in
an
atmosphere
unlike
any
he


have
ever
breathe
in
book
;
so
warm
,
so
rich
,
and
yet
so
ineffably


tender
,
that
it
give
a
new
and
haunt
beauty
to
the
most
elementary


of
human
passion
.
 
all
through
the
night
he
pursue
through
those


enchant
page
the
vision
of
a
woman
who
have
the
face
of
Ellen


Olenska
;
but
when
he
wake
the
next
morning
,
and
look
out
at
the


brownstone
house
across
the
street
,
and
think
of
his
desk
in
Mr.


Letterblair
's
office
,
and
the
family
pew
in
Grace
Church

his
hour
in


the
park
of
Skuytercliff
become
as
far
outside
the
pale
of
probability


as
the
vision
of
the
night

over
the


coffee

at
breakfast

"
Newland

"
 
for
it
be
the
conviction
of
both
lady


that
,
under
the
iron
despotism
of
his
senior
partner

in
the

by
heavily

the
taste
of

he
hear
nothing

there
be
several

considerable
thought
to
each
one
during
the
watch
of
an
agitated


night

on

he
,
who
fancy
himself
so
scornful
of
arbitrary


restraint
,
have
be
afraid
to
break
away
from

of
what


people
might
think
of
his

her
first
exclamation
be
:
 
"
Newland

anything
happen

it


occur
to
he
that
it
would
have
be
more
"
feminine
"
if
she
have


instantly
read
in
his
eye
why
he
have
come
.
 
but
when
he
answer
:


"
yes

I
find
I
have
to
see
you
,
"
her
happy
blush
take
the
chill
from


her
surprise
,
and
he
see
how
easily
he
would
be
forgive
,
and
how
soon


even
Mr.
Letterblair
's
mild
disapproval
would
be
smile
away
by
a


tolerant
family

as
it
be
,
the
main
street
be
no
place
for
any
but
formal


greeting
,
and
Archer
long
to
be
alone
with
May
,
and
to
pour
out
all


his
tenderness
and
his
impatience
.
 
it
still
lack
an
hour
to
the
late


welland
breakfast
-
time
,
and
instead
of
ask
he
to
come
in
she


propose
that
they
should
walk
out
to
an
old
orange
-
garden
beyond
the


town
.
 
she
have
just
be
for
a
row
on
the
river
,
and
the
sun
that


net
the
little
wave
with
gold
seem
to
have
catch
she
in
its


mesh
.
 
across
the
warm
brown
of
her
cheek
her
blow
hair
glitter


like
silver
wire
;
and
her
eye
too
look
light
,
almost
pale
in
their


youthful
limpidity
.
 
as
she
walk
beside
Archer
with
her
long
swinge


gait
her
face
wear
the
vacant
serenity
of
a
young
marble
athlete
.




to
Archer
's
strained
nerve
the
vision
be
as
soothe
as
the
sight
of


the
blue
sky
and
the
lazy
river
.
 
they
sit
down
on
a
bench
under
the


orange
-
tree
and
he
put
his
arm
about
she
and
kiss
she
.
 
it
be
like


drink
at
a
cold
spring
with
the
sun
on
it
;
but
his
pressure
may
have


be
more
vehement
than
he
have
intend
,
for
the
blood
rise
to
her
face


and
she
draw
back
as
if
he
have
startle
she
.




"
what
be
it
?
"
he
ask
,

;

she
look
at
he
with
surprise
,


and
answer
:
 
"
nothing
.
"




a
slight
embarrassment
fall
on
they
,
and
her
hand
slip
out
of
his
.


it
be
the
only
time
that
he
have
kiss
she
on
the
lip
except
for


their
fugitive
embrace
in
the
Beaufort
conservatory
,
and
he
see
that


she
be
disturb
,
and
shake
out
of
her
cool
boyish
composure
.




"

I

,
cross
his
arm
under
his


tilt

back
head
,

push
his
hat
forward
to
screen
the
sun

dazzle
.


to
let
she
talk
about
familiar
and
simple
thing
be
the
easy
way
of


carry
on
his
own
independent
train
of
thought
;
and
he
sit
listen


to
her
simple
chronicle
of
swimming
,
sailing
and
riding
,
vary
by
an


occasional
dance
at
the
primitive
inn
when
a
man

no

all
this
keep
she
very
busy

she
have
not
have
time
to
do
more
than


look
at
the
little
vellum
book
that
Archer
have
send
she
the
week
before


(
the
"
sonnet
from
the
portuguese

by
heart
"
how


they

the
Good

because
it

he
that
Kate
Merry

never
even

presently
she
start
up
,
exclaim
that
they
would
be
late
for


breakfast
;
and
they

immense
expense

of
almost
insuperable
difficulty

to

tell
my

may
that
I

Mr.

be
as
much
surprised
as
their
daughter
by


the
young
man
's
sudden
arrival
;
but
it
have
occur
to
he
to
explain


that
he
have
feel
himself
on
the
verge
of
a
nasty
cold
,
and
this
seem


to
Mr.
Welland
an
all
-
sufficient
reason
for
abandon
any
duty

"

careful

have
be

at
the

instead
of
spend
her
winter
in
a


wilderness

an
old

make
his
cold
last

it
shed
an
ironic
light
on
the
situation


to
know
that
Mr.

indulgence
be
partly
due
to
the


satisfactory
way
in
which
his
brilliant
young
junior
partner
have


settle
the
troublesome
matter
of
the
Olenski

render

that
old
Mrs.
Manson
Mingott

be


particularly
pleased
;

one
day
when
May
have
go
for
a
drive

her
father
in

she
always
avoid

"
I
be
afraid
Ellen

ours

she
be
barely


eighteen
when
Medora
Manson
take
she
back
to
Europe

you
remember
the


excitement
when
she
appear
in
black
at
her
come

out
ball

another


of
Medora
's
fad
--
really
this
time
it
be
almost
prophetic
!
 
that
must


have
be
at
least
twelve
year
ago
;
and
since
then
Ellen
have
never


be
to
America

no
wonder
she
be
completely
europeanised
.
"




"
but
european
society
be
not
give
to
divorce

Countess
Olenska
think


she
would
be
conform
to
american
idea
in
ask
for
her
freedom

"


it
be
the
first
time
that
the
young
man
have
pronounce
her
name
since


he
have
leave
Skuytercliff

he
feel
the
colour
rise
to
his
cheek

Mrs.

smile
compassionately
.
 
"
that
be
just
like
the


extraordinary
thing
that
foreigner
invent
about
we

they

we


dine
at
two
o'clock

countenance
divorce

it

so
foolish

accept
our
hospitality

they
go
home
and
repeat
the

stupid
story

"




Archer
make
no
comment
on
this
,

Mrs.
Welland
continue
:
 
"
but
we
do


most
thoroughly
appreciate
your

Ellen

up
the

her
grandmother

uncle
Lovell

nothing

so
to
her
grandmother

an


unbounded
admiration
for
you
.
 
Poor
Ellen

she
be
always
a
wayward


child

I
wonder
what
her
fate
will
be

"
what
we

he
wonder
what
Mrs.

would
have
say
if
he
have
utter
the


word

merely

firm
placid

to
which
a
lifelong
mastery


over

a

a
Philadelphia

Baltimore
hotel

have
accept
with
an

alacrity

May
be
enchant
at
the
idea

go
to
the

childishly


amuse
at
the
vain
effort

the
eight
bridesmaid
to
discover
where


their
mysterious
retreat

it
be
think
"
very
english
"


to
have
a
country

house
lend
to
one
,

the
fact
give
a
last
touch
of


distinction
to
what
be
generally
concede
to
be
the
most
brilliant

purse
their

"
ah

which
be
manifestly
true
,

there
be
no
need
to

once
they
be
settle
in
their
compartment
,
and
the
train
,
shake
off


the
endless
wooden
suburb
,
have
push
out
into
the
pale
landscape
of


spring
,
talk
become
easy
than
Archer
have
expect
.
 
May
be
still
,
in


look
and
tone
,
the
simple
girl
of
yesterday
,
eager
to
compare
note


with
he
as
to
the
incident
of
the
wedding
,
and
discuss
they
as


impartially
as
a
bridesmaid
talk
it
all
over
with
an
usher
.
 
at


first
Archer
have
fancy
that
this
detachment
be
the
disguise
of
an


inward
tremor
;
but
her
clear
eye
reveal
only
the
most
tranquil


unawareness
.
 
she
be
alone
for
the
first
time
with
her
husband
;
but


her
husband
be
only
the
charming
comrade
of
yesterday
.
 
there
be
no


one
whom
she
like
as
much
,
no
one
whom
she
trust
as
completely
,
and


the
culminate
"
lark
"
of
the
whole
delightful
adventure
of
engagement


and
marriage
be
to
be
off
with
he
alone
on
a
journey
,
like
a
grownup


person
,
like
a
"
married
woman
,
"
in
fact
.




it
be
wonderful
that
--
as
he
have
learn
in
the
Mission
garden
at
St.


Augustine
--
such
depth
of
feeling
could
coexist
with
such
absence
of


imagination
.
 
but
he
remember
how
,
even
then
,
she
have
surprise
he


by
drop
back
to
inexpressive
girlishness
as
soon
as
her
conscience


have
be
ease
of
its
burden
;
and
he
see
that
she
would
probably
go


through
life
deal
to
the
good
of
her
ability
with
each
experience
as


it
come
,
but
never
anticipate
any
by
so
much
as
a
steal
glance
.




perhaps
that
faculty
of
unawareness
be
what
give
her
eye
their


transparency
,
and
her
face
the
look
of
represent
a
type
rather
than


a
person
;
as
if
she
might
have
be
choose
to
pose
for
a
Civic
Virtue


or
a
greek
goddess
.
 
the
blood
that
run
so
close
to
her
fair
skin
might


have
be
a
preserve
fluid
rather
than
a
ravaging
element
;
yet
her


look
of
indestructible
youthfulness
make
she
seem
neither
hard
nor


dull
,
but
only
primitive
and
pure
.
 
in
the
thick
of
this
meditation


Archer
suddenly
feel
himself
look
at
she
with
the
startled
gaze
of
a


stranger
,
and
plunge
into
a
reminiscence
of
the
wedding
-
breakfast
and


of
Granny
Mingott
's
immense
and
triumphant
pervasion
of
it
.




may
settle
down
to
frank
enjoyment
of
the
subject
.
 
"
I
be
surprised
,


though
--
weren't
you?--that
aunt
Medora

after

he
have
know
that
the
moment
must
come
soon
or
later
,

he
have


somewhat
imagine
that
by
force
of
willing

it
at

"

those
two

regard
it

as

an

opportunity

in

nothing
interested

the
theatre

the
shop

she
find
the
theatre
less
exciting
than
the
Paris
cafe
chantant


where
,
under
the
blossom
horse
-
chestnut
of
the
Champs

have
have
the

look
down

have
her

interpret


to

as
much
of
the
song
as
he
think
suitable
for
bridal
ear
.




Archer
have
revert
to
all
his
old
inherit
idea
about
marriage
.
 
it


be
less
trouble
to
conform
with
the
tradition
and
treat
May
exactly
as


all
his
friend
treat
their
wife
than
to
try
to
put
into
practice


the
theory
with
which
his
untrammelled
bachelorhood
have
dally
.


there
be
no
use
in
try
to
emancipate
a
wife
who
have
not
the
dim


notion
that
she
be
not
free
;
and
he
have
long
since
discover
that


May
's
only
use
of
the
liberty
she
suppose
herself
to
possess
would
be


to
lay
it
on
the
altar
of
her
wifely
adoration
.
 
her
innate
dignity


would
always
keep
she
from
make
the
gift
abjectly
;
and
a
day
might


even
come
(
as
it
once
have
)
when
she
would
find
strength
to
take
it


altogether
back
if
she
think
she
be
do
it
for
his
own
good
.
 
but


with
a
conception
of
marriage
so
uncomplicated
and
incurious
as
hers


such
a
crisis
could
be
bring
about
only
by
something
visibly


outrageous
in
his
own
conduct
;
and
the
fineness
of
her
feeling
for
he


make
that
unthinkable
.
 
whatever
happen
,
he
know
,
she
would
always
be


loyal
,
gallant
and
unresentful
;
and
that
pledge
he
to
the
practice
of


the
same
virtue
.




all
this
tend
to
draw
he
back
into
his
old
habit
of
mind
.
 
if
she


simplicity
have
be
the
simplicity
of
pettiness
he
would
have
chafe


and
rebel
;
but
since
the
line
of
her
character
,
though
so
few
,
be


on
the
same
fine
mould
as
her
face
,
she
become
the
tutelary
divinity
of


all
his
old
tradition
and
reverence
.




such
quality
be
scarcely
of
the
kind
to
enliven
foreign
travel
,


though
they
make
she
so
easy
and
pleasant
a
companion
;
but
he
see
at


once
how
they
would
fall
into
place
in
their
proper
setting
.
 
he
have
no


fear
of
be
oppress
by
they
,
for
his
artistic
and
intellectual
life


would
go
on
,
as
it
always
have
,
outside
the
domestic
circle
;
and
within


it
there
would
be
nothing
small
and
stifle
--
come
back
to
his
wife


would
never
be
like
enter
a
stuffy
room
after
a
tramp
in
the
open
.


and
when
they
have
child
the
vacant
corner
in
both
their
life
would


be
fill
.




all
these
thing
go
through
his
mind
during
their
long
slow
drive


from
Mayfair
to
South
Kensington
,
where
Mrs.
Carfry
and
her
sister


live
.
 
Archer
too
would
have
prefer
to
escape
their
friend
'


hospitality
:
in
conformity
with
the
family
tradition
he
have
always


travel
as
a
sight
-
seer
and
looker
-
on
,
affect
a
haughty


unconsciousness
of
the
presence
of
his
fellow
-
being
.
 
once
only
,
just


after
Harvard
,
he
have
spend
a
few
gay
week
at
Florence
with
a
band
of


queer
Europeanised
Americans
,
dance
all
night
with
title
lady
in


palace

and
gamble
half
the
day
with
the
rake
and
dandy
of
the


fashionable
club
;
but
it
have
all
seem
to
he
,
though
the
great
fun


in
the
world

as
unreal
as

these
queer
cosmopolitan
woman
,


deep
in
complicated
love

affair

they
appear
to
feel
the
need


of
retailing

every
one

who
be
the
subject

the

their


confidence

different
from
the

up


among

society
be
out

question

in
the
course
of
his
travel
no


other

show
any

voluminously
rustle

that
the
rosiness

the
token
of
an


extreme
and
infantile
shyness

,
the
dinner
be
a
languish


affair

Archer
notice
that
his
wife
's
way
of
show
herself
at
she


ease
with
foreigner
be
to
become
more
uncompromisingly
local
in

reference

that
,

her
loveliness
be
an
encouragement
to


admiration

her
conversation
be
a
chill
to
repartee

the
Vicar
soon


abandon
the
struggle
;
but
the
tutor
,
who
speak
the
most
fluent
and


accomplish
English
,
gallantly
continue
to
pour
it
out
to
she
until


the
lady
,
to
the
manifest
relief
of
all
concern
,
go
up
to
the


drawing

room

the
Vicar
,
after
a
glass
of
port
,
be
oblige
to
hurry
away
to
a


meeting

shy
nephew

an
invalid

pack


off

but
Archer
and
the
tutor
continue
to
sit
over
their
wine
,


and
suddenly
Archer
find
himself
talk
as
he
have
not
do
since
his


last
symposium
with
Ned
Winsett
.
 
the
Carfry

turn
out

be
threaten
with
consumption
,

have
have
to
leave
Harrow
for


Switzerland

he
have
spend
two
year
in
the
milder
air
of
Lake


Leman

a
bookish
youth

have
be
entrust
to
M.
Riviere
,
who


have
bring
he
back
to
England
,
and
be
to
remain
with
he
till
he


go
up
to
Oxford
the
follow
spring
;
and
M.
Riviere
add
with


simplicity
that
he
should
then
have
to
look
out
for
another
job
.




it
seem
impossible
,
Archer
think
,
that
he
should
be
long
without


one
,
so
varied
be
his
interest
and
so
many
his
gift
.
 
he
be
a
man


of
about
thirty
,
with
a
thin
ugly
face
(
May
would
certainly
have
call


he
common
-
look
)
to
which
the
play
of
his
idea
give
an
intense


expressiveness
;
but
there
be
nothing
frivolous
or
cheap
in
his


animation
.




his
father
,
who
have
die
young
,
have
fill
a
small
diplomatic
post
,
and


it
have
be
intend
that
the
son
should
follow
the
same
career
;
but
an


insatiable
taste
for
letter
have
throw
the
young
man
into
journalism
,


then
into
authorship
(
apparently
unsuccessful
)
,
and
at
length
--
after


other
experiment
and
vicissitude
which
he
spare
his
listener
--
into


tutor
english
youth
in
Switzerland
.
 
before
that
,
however
,
he
have


live
much
in
Paris
,
frequent
the
Goncourt
grenier
,
be
advise
by


maupassant
not
to
attempt
to
write
(
even
that
seem
to
Archer
a


dazzle
honour
!
)
,
and
have
often
talk
with
Merimee
in
his
mother
's


house
.
 
he
have
obviously
always
be
desperately
poor
and
anxious


(
have
a
mother
and
an
unmarried
sister
to
provide
for
)
,
and
it
be


apparent
that
his
literary
ambition
have
fail
.
 
his
situation
,
in


fact
,
seem
,
materially
speak
,
no
more
brilliant
than
Ned


Winsett
's
;
but
he
have
live
in
a
world
in
which
,
as
he
say
,
no
one
who


love
idea
need
hunger
mentally
.
 
as
it
be
precisely
of
that
love


that
poor
Winsett
be
starve
to
death
,
Archer
look
with
a
sort
of


vicarious
envy
at
this
eager
impecunious
young
man
who
have
fare
so


richly
in
his
poverty
.




"
you
see
,
Monsieur
,
it
be
worth
everything
,
be
n't
it
,
to
keep
one
's


intellectual
liberty
,
not
to
enslave
one
's
power
of
appreciation
,


one
's
critical
independence
?
 
it
be
because
of
that
that
I
abandon


journalism
,
and
take
to
so
much
duller
work
:
tutoring
and
private


secretaryship
.
 
there
be
a
good
deal
of
drudgery
,
of
course
;
but
one


preserve
one
's
moral
freedom
,
what
we
call
in
French
one
's
quant
a


soi
.
 
and
when
one
hear
good
talk
one
can
join
in
it
without


compromise
any
opinion
but
one
's
own
;
or
one
can
listen
,
and
answer


it
inwardly
.
 
ah
,
good
conversation
--
there
be
nothing
like
it
,
be
there
?


the
air
of
idea
be
the
only
air
worth
breathe
.
 
and
so
I
have
never


regret
give
up
either
diplomacy
or
journalism
--
two
different
form


of
the

self

abdication

fix
his
vivid
eye

another
cigarette
.

garret
for

n't
it

,
after


all
,
one
must
earn
enough
to
pay
for
the
garret

continue
to
stare
at

fear
to
give

from

it

home
to

the
extent
of
the
change

in

during
the
previous


winter

after
he

down

new

yellow

with
the
bow

window
and
the
pompeian

he
have
drop


back
with
relief
into
the
old
routine
of
the
office
,
and
the
renewal
of


this
daily
activity
have
serve
as
a
link
with
his
former
self
.
 
then


there
have
be
the
pleasurable
excitement
of
choose
a
showy
grey


stepper
for
May
's
brougham
(
the
Wellands

which
,
in

of
family
doubt

disapproval

have
be
carry

a


fairly
real

inevitable
sort
of

but
Newport
represent
the
escape
from
duty
into
an
atmosphere
of


unmitigated
holiday
-
making
.
 
Archer
have
try
to
persuade
May
to
spend


the
summer
on
a
remote
island
off
the
coast
of
Maine
(
call
,


appropriately
enough
,
Mount
Desert
)
,
where
a
few
hardy
Bostonians
and


Philadelphians
be
camp
in
"
native
"
cottage
,
and
whence
come


report
of
enchant
scenery
and
a
wild
,
almost
trapper
-
like
existence


amid
wood
and
water
.




but
the
Wellands
always
go
to
Newport
,
where
they
own
one
of
the


square
box
on
the
cliff
,
and
their
son
-
in
-
law
could
adduce
no
good


reason
why
he
and
May
should
not
join
they
there
.
 
as
Mrs.
Welland


rather
tartly
point
out
,
it
be
hardly
worth
while
for
May
to
have


wear
herself
out
try
on
summer
clothe
in
Paris
if
she
be
not
to
be


allow
to
wear
they
;
and
this
argument
be
of
a
kind
to
which
Archer


have
as
yet
find
no
answer
.




may
herself
could
not
understand
his
obscure
reluctance
to
fall
in
with


so
reasonable
and
pleasant
a
way
of
spend
the
summer
.
 
she
remind


he
that
he
have
always
like
Newport
in
his
bachelor
day
,
and
as
this


be
indisputable
he
could
only
profess
that
he
be
sure
he
be
go
to


like
it
well
than
ever
now
that
they
be
to
be
there
together
.
 
but


as
he
stand
on
the
Beaufort
verandah
and
look
out
on
the
brightly


people
lawn
it
come
home
to
he
with
a
shiver
that
he
be
not
go
to


like
it
at
all
.




it
be
not
May
's
fault
,
poor
dear
.
 
if
,
now
and
then
,
during
their


travel
,
they
have
fall
slightly
out
of
step
,
harmony
have
be


restore
by
their
return
to
the
condition
she
be
use
to
.
 
he
have


always
foresee
that
she
would
not
disappoint
he
;
and
he
have
be


right
.
 
he
have
marry
(
as
most
young
man
do
)
because
he
have
meet
a


perfectly
charming
girl
at
the
moment
when
a
series
of
rather
aimless


sentimental
adventure
be
end
in
premature
disgust
;
and
she
have


represent
peace
,
stability
,
comradeship
,
and
the
steadying
sense
of


an
unescapable
duty
.




he
could
not
say
that
he
have
be
mistake
in
his
choice
,
for
she
have


fulfil
all
that
he
have
expect
.
 
it
be
undoubtedly
gratify
to


be
the
husband
of
one
of
the
handsome
and
most
popular
young
marry


woman
in
New
York
,
especially
when
she
be
also
one
of
the


sweetest
-
temper
and
most
reasonable
of
wife
;
and
Archer
have
never


be
insensible
to
such
advantage
.
 
as
for
the
momentary
madness
which


have
fall
upon
he
on
the
eve
of
his
marriage
,
he
have
train
himself


to
regard
it
as
the
last
of
his
discard
experiment
.
 
the
idea
that


he
could
ever
,
in
his
sense
,
have
dream
of
marry
the
Countess


Olenska
have
become
almost
unthinkable
,
and
she
remain
in
his
memory


simply
as
the
most
plaintive
and
poignant
of
a
line
of
ghost
.




but
all
these
abstraction
and
elimination
make
of
his
mind
a
rather


empty
and
echo
place
,
and
he
suppose
that
be
one
of
the
reason


why
the
busy
animated
people
on
the
Beaufort
lawn
shock
he
as
if


they
have

queer
jerk

it

seem
suddenly
to
slam
a

this
break
of
continuity
must

I
always
say
to

beware
of


monotony
;
it
be
the
mother
of
all
the
deadly
sin

go
through
a
phase
of
exaltation

of
abhorrence
of
the

she
have
decline
all
invitation
to
stay
at


Newport

even
with
her

she
to
come

if
you
will
believe
it
!
 
the
life


she
lead
be
morbid
,
unnatural
.
 
ah
,
if
she
have
only
listen
to
I


when
it
be
still
possible
...
when
the
door

,
in
a
tone
that
gently
remind
her
husband

his


lack
of

it
be
a
cause

show
so
little
foresight

the
fortnight

have
pass
under
her
roof
,


when
she
enquire
how
he
mean
to
spend
his
afternoon

he
have
answer


paradoxically
:

have
to
go

a


long

once
venture
to


complain
to
her
daughter

may
answer
serenely
:
 
"
no
;

you
see


it
do

Mrs.

agree
,
as

allow
for
an


inherit
oddity
;

after
that

question

tacitly
drop
.




nevertheless
,
as
the
day
for
the
Sillerton
reception
approach
,
May


begin
to
show
a
natural
solicitude
for
his
welfare
,

to
suggest
a


tennis
match
at
the
Chiverses
'
,

a
sail
on
Julius
Beaufort
's
cutter
,


as
a
means
of
atone
for
her
temporary
desertion

and
she
be


not
reassure
till
Archer
say
that
he
think
of
hire
a
run

about

drive
up
the
island
to
a
stud

farm
to
look
at
a
second
horse
for


her
brougham

they
have
be
look
for
this
horse
for
some
time

the
suggestion
be
so
acceptable

May
glance
at
her
mother
as
if


to
say
:
 
"

see
he
know
how
to
plan
out
his
time

well

we
.
"




the
idea
of
the
stud

farm
and
the
brougham
horse
have
germinate
in


Archer
's
mind
on
the
very
day
when
the
Emerson
Sillerton
invitation
have


first
be
mention
;
but
he
have
keep
it
to
himself
as
if
there
be


something
clandestine
in
the
plan
,
and
discovery
might
prevent
its


execution
.
 
he
have
,
however
,
take
the
precaution
to
engage
in
advance


a
runabout
with
a
pair
of
old
livery
-
stable
trotter
that
could
still


do
their
eighteen
mile
on
level
road
;
and
at
two
o'clock
,
hastily


desert
the
luncheon
-
table
,
he
spring
into
the
light
carriage
and


drive
off
.




the
day
be
perfect
.
 
a
breeze
from
the
north
drive
little
puff
of


white
cloud
across
an
ultramarine
sky
,
with
a
bright
sea
run
under


it

Bellevue
Avenue
be
empty
at
that
hour
,

after
drop
the


stable

lad
at
the
corner
of
Mill
Street
Archer
turn
down
the
Old


Beach
Road
and
drive
across
Eastman
's
Beach
.




he
have
the
feeling
of
unexplained
excitement
with
which
,
on


half
-
holiday
at
school
,
he
use
to
start
off
into
the
unknown
.
 
take


his
pair
at
an
easy
gait
,
he
count
on
reach
the
stud
-
farm
,
which


be
not
far
beyond
Paradise
Rocks
,
before
three
o'clock
;
so
that
,
after


look
over
the
horse
(
and
try
he
if
he
seem
promise
)
he
would


still
have
four
golden
hour
to
dispose
of
.




as
soon
as
he
hear
of
the
Sillerton
's
party
he
have
say
to
himself


that
the
Marchioness
Manson
would
certainly
come
to
Newport
with
the


blenker
,
and
that
Madame
Olenska
might
again
take
the
opportunity
of


spend
the
day
with
her
grandmother
.
 
at
any
rate
,
the
Blenker


habitation
would
probably
be
desert
,
and
he
would
be
able
,
without


indiscretion
,
to
satisfy
a
vague
curiosity
concern
it
.
 
he
be
not


sure
that
he
want
to
see
the
Countess
Olenska
again
;
but
ever
since


he
have
look
at
she
from
the
path
above
the
bay
he
have
want
,


irrationally
and
indescribably
,
to
see
the
place
she
be
live
in
,
and


to
follow
the
movement
of
her
imagine
figure
as
he
have
watch
the


real
one
in
the
summer

house

the
longing
be
with
he
day
and
night
,


an
incessant
undefinable
craving
,
like
the
sudden
whim
of
a
sick
man


for
food
or
drink
once
taste
and
long
since
forget
.
 
he
could
not


see
beyond
the
craving
,
or
picture
what
it
might
lead
to
,
for
he
be


not
conscious
of
any
wish
to
speak
to
Madame
Olenska
or
to
hear
she


voice
.
 
he
simply
feel
that
if
he
could
carry
away
the
vision
of
the


spot
of
earth

walk
on
,

the
way
the
sky
and
sea
enclose
it
,


the
rest
of
the
world
might
seem
less
empty
.




when
he
reach
the
stud
-
farm
a
glance
show
he
that
the
horse
be


not
what
he
want
;

he
take
a
turn
behind
it
in
order
to


prove
to
himself
that
he
be
not
in
a
hurry
.

at
three
o'clock

out
the
rein
over
the

patch
of
lawn
before
it
have
relapse
into
a
hay
-
field
;
but
to
the
left


an
overgrown
box
-
garden
full
of
dahlia
and
rusty
rose
-
bush
encircle


a
ghostly
summer
-
house
of
trellis
-
work
that
have
once
be
white
,


surmount
by
a
wooden
Cupid
who
have
lose
his
bow
and
arrow
but


continue
to
take
ineffectual
aim
.




Archer
lean
for
a
while
against
the
gate
.
 
no
one
be
in
sight
,
and


not
a
sound
come
from
the
open
window
of
the
house
:
a
grizzle


Newfoundland
doze
before
the
door
seem
as
ineffectual
a
guardian
as


the
arrowless
Cupid
.
 
it
be
strange
to
think
that
this
place
of


silence
and
decay
be
the
home
of
the
turbulent
blenker
;
yet
Archer


be
sure
that
he
be
not
mistaken
.




for
a
long
time
he
stand
there
,
content
to
take
in
the
scene
,
and


gradually
fall
under
its
drowsy
spell
;
but
at
length
he
rouse


himself
to
the
sense
of
the
pass
time
.
 
should
he
look
his
fill
and


then
drive
away
?
 
he
stand
irresolute
,
wish
suddenly
to
see
the


inside
of
the
house
,
so
that
he
might
picture
the
room
that
Madame


Olenska
sit
in
.
 
there
be
nothing
to
prevent
his
walk
up
to
the


door
and
ring
the
bell
;
if
,
as
he
suppose
,
she
be
away
with
the


rest
of
the
party
,
he
could
easily
give
his
name
,
and
ask
permission
to


go
into
the
sitting
-
room
to
write
a
message
.




but
instead
,
he
cross
the
lawn
and
turn
toward
the
box
-
garden
.
 
as


he
enter
it
he
catch
sight
of
something
bright
-
coloured
in
the


summer
-
house
,
and
presently
make
it
out
to
be
a
pink
parasol
.
 
the


parasol
draw
he
like
a
magnet
:
he
be
sure
it
be
hers
.
 
he
go
into


the
summer
-
house
,
and
sit
down
on
the
rickety
seat
pick
up
the


silken
thing
and
look
at
its
carved
handle
,
which
be
make
of
some


rare
wood
that
give
out
an
aromatic
scent
.
 
Archer
lift
the
handle
to


his
lip
.




he
hear
a
rustle
of
skirt
against
the
box
,
and
sit
motionless
,


lean
on
the
parasol
handle
with
clasped
hand
,
and
let
the


rustle
come
near
without
lift
his
eye
.
 
he
have
always
know
that


this
must
happen
...




"
oh
,
Mr.
Archer

exclaim
a
loud
young
voice
;

up

the
Blenker

a
red
blotch

possess

announce

following
evening

it
have
always
be
understand


that
he
would
return
to
town
early
in
the
week
,

when
he
get
back


from
his
expedition
to
Portsmouth
a
letter
from
the
office
,
which
fate


have
conspicuously
place
on
a
corner
of
the
hall
table
,
suffice
to


justify
his
sudden
change
of
plan
.
 
he
be
even
ashamed
of
the
ease


with
which
the
whole
thing
have
be
do
:
it
remind
he
,
for
an


uncomfortable
moment
,
of
Lawrence
Lefferts
's
masterly
contrivance
for


secure
his
freedom
.
 
but
this
do
not
long
trouble
he
,
for
he
be


not
in
an
analytic
mood
.




after
breakfast
he
smoke
a
cigarette
and
glance
over
the
Commercial


Advertiser
.
 
while
he
be
thus
engage
two
or
three
man
he
know
come


in
,
and
the
usual
greeting
be
exchange
:
it
be
the
same
world
after


all
,
though
he
have
such
a
queer
sense
of
having
slip
through
the


mesh
of
time
and
space
.




he
look
at
his
watch

that
it

up

go
into
the
writing

room

write
a
few
line
,

order
a
messenger
to
take
a
cab
to
the
Parker
House
and
wait
for
the


answer
.
 
he
then
sit
down
behind
another
newspaper
and
try
to


calculate
how
long
it
would
take
a
cab
to
get
to
the
Parker
House
.




"

out

he
suddenly
hear
a
waiter
's
voice
at
his


elbow
;

he
stammer
:
 
"
out?--

as
if
it
be
a
word
in
a
strange


language

he
get
up
and
go
into
the
hall
.
 
it
must
be
a
mistake
:
she
could
not


be
out
at
that
hour
.
 
he
flush
with
anger
at
his
own
stupidity
:
why


have
he
not
send
the
note
as
soon
as
he

Archer
walk
away
a
few
step
,
stare


with
radiant
unseee
eye
at
the
passersby
,
who
,
in
their
turn
,
pause


to
stare
at
the
unwonted
sight
of
a
fashionably
-
dress
lady
write
a


note
on
her
knee
on
a
bench
in
the
Common

Madame
Olenska
slip
the
sheet
into
the
envelope
,
write
a
name
on
it
,


and
put
it
into
her
pocket
.
 
then
she
too
stand
up
.




they
walk
back
toward
Beacon
Street
,
and
near
the
club
Archer
catch


sight
of
the
plush

line
"
herdic
"
which
have
carry
his
note
to
the


Parker

whose
driver
be

from
this
effort
by
bathe


his
brow
at
the
corner

"
I

!
"
 
they
laugh
,
astonish
at
the
miracle
of
pick
up
a
public


conveyance
at
that
hour
,
and
in
that
unlikely
spot
,
in
a
city
where


cab
-
stand
be
still
a
"
foreign
"
novelty
.




Archer
,
look
at
his
watch
,
see
that
there
be
time
to
drive
to
the


Parker
House
before
go
to
the
steamboat
landing
.
 
they
rattle


through
the
hot
street
and
draw
up
at
the
door
of
the
hotel
.




Archer
hold
out
his
hand
for
the
letter
.
 
"
shall
I
take
it
in
?
"
he


ask
;
but
Madame
Olenska
,
shake
her
head
,
spring
out
and
disappear


through
the
glaze
door
.
 
it
be
barely
half
-
past
ten
;
but
what
if
the


emissary
,
impatient
for
her
reply
,
and
not
know
how
else
to
employ


his
time
,
be
already
seat
among
the
traveller
with
cool
drink


at
their
elbow
of
whom
Archer
have
catch
a
glimpse
as
she
go
in
?




he
wait
,
pace
up
and
down
before
the
herdic
.
 
a
sicilian
youth
with


eye
like
Nastasia
's
offer
to
shine
his
boot
,
and
an
irish
matron
to


sell
he
peach
;
and
every
few
moment
the
door
open
to
let
out
hot


man
with
straw
hat
tilt
far
back
,
who
glance
at
he
as
they
go


by
.
 
he
marvel
that
the
door
should
open
so
often
,
and
that
all
the


people
it
let
out
should
look
so
like
each
other
,
and
so
like
all
the


other
hot
man
who
,
at
that
hour
,
through
the
length
and
breadth
of
the


land
,
be
pass
continuously
in
and
out
of
the
swinge
door
of


hotel
.




and
then
,
suddenly
,
come
a
face
that
he
could
not
relate
to
the
other


face
.
 
he
catch
but
a
flash
of
it
,
for
his
pacing
have
carry
he
to


the
farth
point
of
his
beat
,
and
it
be
in
turn
back
to
the
hotel


that
he
see
,
in
a
group
of
typical
countenance
--
the
lank
and
weary
,


the
round
and
surprised
,
the
lantern
-
jaw
and
mild
--
this
other
face


that
be
so
many
more
thing
at
once
,
and
thing
so
different
.
 
it
be


that
of
a
young
man
,
pale
too
,
and
half
-
extinguish
by
the
heat
,
or


worry
,
or
both
,
but
somehow
,
quick
,
vivider
,
more
conscious
;
or


perhaps
seem
so
because
he
be
so
different
.
 
Archer
hang
a
moment


on
a
thin
thread
of
memory
,
but
it
snap
and
float
off
with
the


disappear
face
--
apparently
that
of
some
foreign
business
man
,


look
doubly
foreign
in
such
a
setting
.
 
he
vanish
in
the
stream
of


passersby
,
and
Archer
resume
his
patrol
.




he
do
not
care
to
be
see
watch
in
hand
within
view
of
the
hotel
,
and


his
unaided
reckoning
of
the
lapse
of
time
lead
he
to
conclude
that
,
if


Madame
Olenska
be
so
long
in
reappearing
,
it
could
only
be
because
she


have
meet
the
emissary
and
be
waylay
by
he
.
 
at
the
thought
Archer
's


apprehension
rise
to
anguish
.




"
if
she
do
n't
come
soon
I
'll
go
in
and
find
she
,
"
he
say
.




the
door
swing
open
again
and
she
be
at
his
side
.
 
they
get
into
the


herdic
,
and
as
it
drive
off
he
take
out
his
watch
and
see
that
she
have


be
absent
just
three
minute
.
 
in
the
clatter
of
loose
window
that


make
talk
impossible
they
bump
over
the
disjoint
cobblestone
to


the
wharf
.






seated
side
by
side
on
a
bench
of
the
half
-
empty
boat
they
find
that


they
have
hardly
anything
to
say
to
each
other
,
or
rather
that
what
they


have
to
say
communicate
itself
good
in
the
bless
silence
of
their


release
and
their
isolation
.




as
the
paddle
-
wheel
begin
to
turn
,
and
wharf
and
ship
to
recede


through
the
veil
of
heat
,
it
seem
to
Archer
that
everything
in
the


old
familiar
world
of
habit
be
recede
also
.
 
he
long
to
ask
Madame


Olenska
if
she
do
not
have
the
same
feeling
:
the
feeling
that
they


be
start
on
some
long
voyage
from
which
they
might
never
return
.


but
he
be
afraid
to
say
it
,
or
anything
else
that
might
disturb
the


delicate
balance
of
her
trust
in
he
.
 
in
reality
he
have
no
wish
to


betray
that
trust
.
 
there
have
be
day
and
night
when
the
memory
of


their
kiss
have
burn
and
burn
on
his
lip
;
the
day
before
even
,
on


the
drive
to
Portsmouth
,
the
thought
of
she
have
run
through
he
like


fire
;
but
now
that
she
be
beside
he
,
and
they
be
drift
forth


into
this
unknown
world
,
they
seem
to
have
reach
the
kind
of
deep


nearness
that
a
touch
may
sunder
.




as
the
boat
leave
the
harbour
and
turn
seaward
a
breeze
stir
about


they
and
the
bay
break
up
into
long
oily
undulation
,
then
into
ripple


tip
with
spray
.
 
the
fog
of
sultriness
still
hang
over
the
city
,
but


ahead
lie
a
fresh
world
of
ruffled
water
,
and
distant
promontory


with
light
-
house
in
the
sun
.
 
Madame
Olenska
,
lean
back
against
the


boat
-
rail
,
drink
in
the
coolness
between
parted
lip
.
 
she
have
wind
a


long
veil
about
her
hat
,
but
it
leave
her
face
uncover
,
and
Archer
be


strike
by
the
tranquil
gaiety
of
her
expression
.
 
she
seem
to
take


their
adventure
as
a
matter
of
course
,
and
to
be
neither
in
fear
of


unexpected
encounter
,
nor
(
what
be
bad
)
unduly
elated
by
their


possibility
.




in
the
bare
dining
-
room
of
the
inn
,
which
he
have
hope
they
would
have


to
themselves
,
they
find
a
strident
party
of
innocent
-
look
young


man
and
woman
--
school
-
teacher
on
a
holiday
,
the
landlord
tell


they
--
and
Archer
's
heart
sink
at
the
idea
of
have
to
talk
through


their
noise
.




"
this
be
hopeless
--
I'll
ask
for
a
private
room
,
"
he
say
;
and
Madame


Olenska
,
without
offer
any
objection
,
wait
while
he
go
in
search


of
it
.
 
the
room
open
on
a
long
wooden
verandah
,
with
the
sea
come


in
at
the
window
.
 
it
be
bare
and
cool
,
with
a
table
cover
with
a


coarse
checker
cloth
and
adorn
by
a
bottle
of
pickle
and
a


blueberry
pie
under
a
cage

more
guileless
-
look
cabinet


particulier
ever
offer
its
shelter
to
a
clandestine
couple
:
Archer


fancy
he
see
the
sense
of
its
reassurance
in
the
faintly
amused
smile


with
which
Madame
Olenska
sit
down
opposite
to
he
.
 
a
woman
who
have


run
away
from
her
husband
--
and
reputedly
with
another
man
--
be
likely


to
have
master
the
art
of
take
thing
for
grant
;
but
something
in


the
quality
of
her
composure
take
the
edge
from
his
irony
.
 
by
be
so


quiet
,
so
unsurprised
and
so
simple
she
have
manage
to
brush
away
the


convention
and
make
he
feel
that
to
seek
to
be
alone
be
the
natural


thing
for
two
old
friend
who
have
so
much
to
say
to
each
other

XXIV
.




they
lunch
slowly
and
meditatively
,
with
mute
interval
between


rush
of
talk
;
for
,
the
spell
once
break
,
they
have
much
to
say
,
and


yet
moment
when
say
become
the
mere
accompaniment
to
long
duologue


of
silence
.
 
Archer
keep
the
talk
from
his
own
affair
,
not
with


conscious
intention
but
because
he
do
not
want
to
miss
a
word
of
she


history
;
and
lean
on
the
table
,
her
chin
rest
on
her
clasp


hand
,
she
talk
to
he
of
the
year
and
a
half
since
they
have
meet
.




she
have
grow
tired
of
what
people
call
"
society
"
;
New
York
be
kind
,


it
be
almost
oppressively
hospitable
;
she
should
never
forget
the
way


in
which
it
have
welcome
she
back
;
but
after
the
first
flush
of
novelty


she
have
find
herself
,
as
she
phrase
it
,
too
"
different
"
to
care
for


the
thing
it
care
about

and
so
she
have
decide
to
try
Washington
,


where
one
be
suppose
to
meet
more
variety
of
people
and
of
opinion
.


and
on
the
whole
she
should
probably
settle
down
in
Washington
,
and


make
a
home
there
for
poor
Medora
,
who
have
wear
out
the
patience
of
all


her
other
relation
just
at
the
time
when
she
most
need
look
after


and
protect
from
matrimonial
peril
.




"

Dr.

you
afraid

you

Dr.
Carver

bye
at
the
Fall
River


station
,
and
he
have
turn
away
alone
,
the
conviction
remain
with
he


of
having
save
out
of
their
meeting
much
more
than
he
have
sacrifice
.




he
wander
back
to
the
club
,
and
go
and
sit
alone
in
the
deserted


library
,
turn
and
turn
over
in
his
thought
every
separate
second


of
their
hour
together
.
 
it
be
clear
to
he
,
and
it
grow
more
clear


under
close
scrutiny
,
that
if
she
should
finally
decide
on
return


to
Europe
--
return
to
her
husband
--
it
would
not
be
because
her
old


life
tempt
she
,
even
on
the
new
term
offer
.
 
no
:
she
would
go
only


if
she
feel
herself
become
a
temptation
to
Archer
,
a
temptation
to


fall
away
from
the
standard
they
have
both
set
up
.
 
her
choice
would
be


to
stay
near
he
as
long
as
he
do
not
ask
she
to
come
near
;
and
it


depend
on
himself
to
keep
she
just
there
,
safe
but
secluded
.




in
the
train
these
thought
be
still
with
he
.
 
they
enclose
he
in


a
kind
of
golden
haze
,
through
which
the
face
about
he
look
remote


and
indistinct
:
he
have
a
feeling
that
if
he
speak
to
his


fellow
-
traveller
they
would
not
understand
what
he
be
say
.
 
in


this
state
of
abstraction
he
find
himself
,
the
following
morning
,


wake
to
the
reality
of
a
stifle
September
day
in
New
York
.
 
the


heat
-
withered
face
in
the
long
train
stream
past
he
,
and
he


continue
to
stare
at
they
through
the
same
golden
blur
;
but
suddenly
,


as
he
leave
the
station
,
one
of
the
face
detach
itself
,
come
close


and
force
itself
upon
his
consciousness
.
 
it
be
,
as
he
instantly


recall
,
the
face
of
the
young
man
he
have
see
,
the
day
before
,


pass
out
of
the
Parker
House
,
and
have
note
as
not
conform
to


type
,
as
not
have
an
american
hotel
face
.




the
same
thing
strike
he
now
;
and
again
he
become
aware
of
a
dim
stir


of
former
association
.
 
the
young
man
stand
look
about
he
with
the


daze
air
of
the
foreigner
fling
upon
the
harsh
mercy
of
American


travel
;
then
he
advance
toward
Archer
,
lift
his
hat
,
and
say
in


English
:
 
"

,
Monsieur
,

meet
in
London

"




"

his
hand
with
curiosity


and
sympathy
.
 
"
so

do
get
here
,
after
all
?
"
he
exclaim
,
cast


a
wonder
eye
on
the
astute
and
haggard
little
countenance
of
young


Carfry
's
french
tutor
.




"

M.

with

.
 
"

for


long

he
stand

his
light


valise
in
one
neatly
glove
hand
,
and
gaze
anxiously
,
perplexedly
,


almost
appealingly
,
into
Archer
's
face
.




"
I
wonder
,
Monsieur
,
since
I
've
have
the
good
luck
to
run
across
you
,
if


I
might--
"




"

decent
restaurant
in
that
quarter
.
"




M.
Riviere
be
visibly
touch
and
surprised
.
 
"
you
be
too
kind
.

I


be
only
go
to
ask

tell
I
how
to
reach
some
sort
of


conveyance

the
young
man
,
after
a
just
perceptible
hesitation

,
with


profuse

a
tone

not
carry
complete
conviction

when
they
have
reach
the
comparative


reassurance
of
the
street

ask
if
he
might
call
that
afternoon
.

at
ease
in
the
midsummer
leisure
of
the
office
,
fix
an
hour


and

abruptly
:

in
Boston

"




the
statement
be
insignificant
enough
,
and
Archer
be
about
to
frame


an
assent
when
his
word

check
by
something
mysterious

visitor

out
a
low
murmur
of


confirmation
.




"
before

she

I
see
--
at
Count
Olenski
's
request
--
Mr.
Lovell


Mingott
,
with
whom
I
have
several
talk
before
go
to
Boston
.
 
I


understand
that
he
represent
his
mother
's
view
;
and
that
Mrs.
Manson


Mingott
's
influence
be
great
throughout
her
family
.
"




Archer
sit
silent
,
with
the
sense
of
cling
to
the
edge
of
a
slide


precipice
.
 
the
discovery
that
he
have
be
exclude
from
a
share
in


these
negotiation
,
and
even
from
the
knowledge
that
they
be
on
foot
,


cause
he
a
surprise
hardly
dull
by
the
acuter
wonder
of
what
he
be


learn
.
 
he
see
in
a
flash
that
if
the
family
have
cease
to
consult


he
it
be
because
some
deep
tribal
instinct
warn
they
that
he
be
no


long
on
their
side
;
and
he
recall
,
with
a
start
of
comprehension
,
a


remark
of
May
's
during
their
drive
home
from
Mrs.
Manson
Mingott
's
on


the
day
of
the
Archery
Meeting
:
 
"
perhaps
,
after
all
,
Ellen
would
be


happy
with
her
husband
.
"




even
in
the
tumult
of
new
discovery
Archer
remember
his
indignant


exclamation
,
and
the
fact
that
since
then
his
wife
have
never
name


Madame
Olenska
to
he
.
 
her
careless
allusion
have
no
doubt
be
the


straw
hold
up
to
see
which
way
the
wind
blow
;
the
result
have
be


report
to
the
family
,
and
thereafter
Archer
have
be
tacitly
omit


from
their
counsel
.
 
he
admire
the
tribal
discipline
which
make
May


bow
to
this
decision
.
 
she
would
not
have
do
so
,
he
know
,
have
she


conscience
protest
;
but
she
probably
share
the
family
view
that


Madame
Olenska
would
be
well
off
as
an
unhappy
wife
than
as
a


separate
one
,
and
that
there
be
no
use
in
discuss
the
case
with


Newland
,
who
have
an
awkward
way
of
suddenly
not
seem
to
take
the


most
fundamental
thing
for
grant
.




Archer
look
up

his
visitor

anxious
gaze

XXVII
.




Wall
Street
,
the
next
day
,
have
more
reassuring
report
of
Beaufort
's


situation
.
 
they
be
not
definite
,
but
they
be
hopeful
.
 
it
be


generally
understand
that
he
could
call
on
powerful
influence
in
case


of
emergency
,
and
that
he
have
do
so
with
success
;
and
that
evening
,


when
Mrs.
Beaufort
appear
at
the
Opera
wear
her
old
smile
and
a


new
emerald
necklace
,
society
draw
a
breath
of
relief
.




New
York
be
inexorable
in
its
condemnation
of
business
irregularity
.


so
far
there
have
be
no
exception
to
its
tacit
rule
that
those
who


break
the
law
of
probity
must
pay
;
and
every
one
be
aware
that
even


Beaufort
and
Beaufort
's
wife
would
be
offer
up
unflinchingly
to
this


principle
.
 
but
to
be
oblige
to
offer
they
up
would
be
not
only


painful
but
inconvenient
.
 
the
disappearance
of
the
Beauforts
would


leave
a
considerable
void
in
their
compact
little
circle
;
and
those
who


be
too
ignorant
or
too
careless
to
shudder
at
the
moral
catastrophe


bewail
in
advance
the
loss
of
the
good
ball
-
room
in
New
York
.




Archer
have
definitely
make
up
his
mind
to
go
to
Washington
.
 
he
be


wait
only
for
the
opening
of
the
law
-
suit
of
which
he
have
speak
to


may
,
so
that
its
date
might
coincide
with
that
of
his
visit
;
but
on
the


follow
Tuesday
he
learn
from
Mr.
Letterblair
that
the
case
might


be
postpone
for
several
week
.
 
nevertheless
,
he
go
home
that


afternoon
determine
in
any
event
to
leave
the
next
evening
.
 
the


chance
be
that
May
,
who
know
nothing
of
his
professional
life
,
and


have
never
show
any
interest
in
it
,
would
not
learn
of
the


postponement
,
should
it
take
place
,
nor
remember
the
name
of
the


litigant
if
they
be
mention
before
she
;
and
at
any
rate
he
could


no
long
put
off
see
Madame
Olenska
.
 
there
be
too
many
thing


that
he
must
say
to
she
.




on
the
Wednesday
morning
,
when
he
reach
his
office
,
Mr.
Letterblair


meet
he
with
a
troubled
face
.
 
Beaufort
,
after
all
,
have
not
manage
to


"
tide
over
"
;
but
by
set
afloat
the
rumour
that
he
have
do
so
he


have
reassure
his
depositor
,
and
heavy
payment
have
pour
into
the


bank
till
the
previous
evening
,
when
disturb
report
again
begin
to


predominate
.
 
in
consequence
,
a
run
on
the
bank
have
begin
,
and
its


door
be
likely
to
close
before
the
day
be
over
.
 
the
ugly
thing


be
be
say
of
Beaufort
's
dastardly
manoeuvre
,
and
his
failure


promise
to
be
one
of
the
most
discreditable
in
the
history
of
Wall


Street
.




the
extent
of
the
calamity
leave
Mr.

and


incapacitate
.
 
"
I
've
see
bad
thing
in
my
time

nothing
as
bad
as

how
can
any

,
at
that
time
,

obviously
distressed
,
in
complete


control
of
her
body

mulatto
maid
put
she

everything
straight
in

at
three
in
the
morning
the
bell
ring
again
,


and
the
two
servant
,
hasten
in
at
this
unwonted
summon
(
for
old


Catherine
usually
sleep
like
a
baby
)
,
have
find
their
mistress
sitting


up
against
her
pillow
with
a
crooked
smile
on
her
face
and
one
little


hand
hang
limp
from
its
huge
arm
.




the
stroke
have
clearly
be
a
slight
one
,

she
be
able
to


articulate
and
to
make
her
wish

soon
after

"
yes

it
would
be
more
become

countenance

to
talk
about

people

Mrs.

"




Archer
listen
unmoved
to
the
relentless
chorus
.
 
the
idea
of
absolute


financial
probity
as
the
first
law
of
a
gentleman
's
code
be
too
deeply


ingrain
in
he
for
sentimental
consideration
to
weaken
it
.
 
an


adventurer
like
Lemuel
Struthers
might
build
up
the
million
of
his


Shoe
Polish
on
any
number
of
shady
dealing
;

unblemishe
honesty


be
the
noblesse
oblige
of

financial
New
York
.
 
nor
do
Mrs.


Beaufort
's
fate
greatly
move
Archer

he
feel
,
no
doubt
,
more
sorry
for


she
than
her
indignant
relative
;

it
seem
to
he
that
the
tie


between
husband
and
wife
,
even
if
breakable
in
prosperity
,
should
be


indissoluble
in
misfortune

Mr.

place
be
at
her

not
at
his

Mrs.

's
cool
assumption
that
it


be
seem
almost
to

she
his
accomplice

woman
's
appeal
to
her

to
screen
her

's

the
one

their


slow
approach
to
the
wharf
among
slip
horse
,
laden
cart
,


vociferate
teamster
,
and
then
the
startling
quiet
of
the
ferry
-
boat
,


where
they
would
sit
side
by
side
under
the
snow
,
in
the
motionless


carriage
,
while
the
earth
seem
to
glide
away
under

roll
to


the
other
side
of
the
sun

it
be
incredible
,
the
number
of
thing
he


have
to
say
to
she
,
and
in
what
eloquent
order
they
be
form


themselves
on
his
lip
...




the
clanging
and
groaning
of
the
train
come
near
,
and
it
stagger


slowly
into
the
station
like
a
prey
-
laden
monster
into
its
lair
.


Archer
push
forward
,
elbow
through
the
crowd
,
and
stare
blindly


into
window
after
window
of
the
high
-
hung
carriage
.
 
and
then
,


suddenly
,
he
see
Madame
Olenska
's
pale
and
surprised
face
close
at


hand
,
and
have
again
the
mortified
sensation
of
having
forget
what


she
look
like
.




they
reach
each
other
,

her
arm
through


his
.

she
into
the


brougham
with
her
bag
,
and
have
afterward
the
vague
recollection
of


having
properly
reassure
she
about
her
grandmother
and
give
she
a


summary
of
the
Beaufort

by
the
softness
of

work
its
way
out


of
the
coil
about
the
station

a
long
silence

obscure
side

as
May
be
the
more


punctual
of
the
two
he
be

that

dress
he
have
hear
her
move


about
in
her
room
;
and
he
wonder
what
have
delay
she
.




he
have
fall
into
the
way
of
dwell
on
such
conjecture
as
a
means


of
tie
his
thought
fast
to
reality

sometimes
he
feel
as
if

find
the
clue

his
father

trifle

perhaps


even
Mr.

have
escape

have


conjure
up
all
the

of
domesticity

defend
himself
against

when
may
appear

her
fair

its
usual
accumulate
coil
;

her
face
,
in
contrast
,
be
wan


and
almost
fade
.
 
but
she
shine
on
he
with
her
usual
tenderness
,
and


her
eye
have
keep
the
blue
dazzle
of
the
day
before
.




"

she
ask
.
 
"

off

"
Ah--

she
say
;
and
a
moment
afterward
:
 
"
I
be
sorry

come

Granny's

unless
the

urgent
.
"




"
they
be
,

he
rejoin
,
surprised
at
her
insistence
.
 
"
besides
,
I


do
n't
see
why
I
should
have
go
to
your
grandmother

.
 
I
do
n't
know


you

there

she
turn
and
move
to
the
look
-
glass
above
the
mantel
-
piece
.
 
as


she
stand
there
,
lift
her
long
arm
to
fasten
a
puff
that
have
slip


from
its
place
in
her
intricate
hair
,
Archer
be
strike
by
something


languid
and
inelastic
in
her
attitude
,
and
wonder
if
the
deadly


monotony
of
their
life
have
lay
its
weight
on
she
also
.
 
then
he


remember
that
,
as
he
have
leave
the
house
that
morning
,
she
have
call


over
the
stair
that
she
would
meet
he
at
her
grandmother
be
so
that


they
might
drive
home
together
.
 
he
have
call
back
a
cheery
"
yes
!
"
and


then
,
absorb
in
other
vision
,
have
forget
his
promise
.
 
now
he
be


smitten
with
compunction
,
yet
irritated
that
so
trifle
an
omission


should
be
store
up
against
he
after
nearly
two
year
of
marriage
.
 
he


be
weary
of
live
in
a
perpetual
tepid
honeymoon
,
without
the


temperature
of
passion
yet
with
all
its
exaction
.
 
if
May
have
speak


out
her
grievance
(
he
suspect
she
of
many
)
he
might
have
laugh


they
away
;
but
she
be
train
to
conceal
imaginary
wound
under
a


spartan
smile
.




to
disguise
his
own
annoyance
he
ask
how
her
grandmother
be
,
and
she


answer
that
Mrs.
Mingott
be
still
improve
,
but
have
be
rather


disturb
by
the
last
news
about
the
Beauforts
.




"
what
news
?
"




"
it
seem
they
be
go
to
stay
in
New
York
.
 
I
believe
he
be
go
into


an
insurance
business
,
or
something
.
 
they
be
look
about
for
a
small


house
.
"




the
preposterousness
of
the
case
be
beyond
discussion
,
and
they
go


in
to
dinner
.
 
during
dinner
their
talk
move
in
its
usual
limited


circle
;
but
Archer
notice
that
his
wife
make
no
allusion
to
Madame


Olenska
,
nor
to
old
Catherine
's
reception
of
she
.
 
he
be
thankful
for


the
fact
,
yet
feel
it
to
be
vaguely
ominous
.




they
go
up
to
the
library
for
coffee
,
and
Archer
light
a
cigar
and
take


down
a
volume
of
Michelet
.
 
he
have
take
to
history
in
the
evening


since
May
have
show
a
tendency
to
ask
he
to
read
aloud
whenever
she


see
he
with
a
volume
of
poetry
:
not
that
he
dislike
the
sound
of
his


own
voice
,
but
because
he
could
always
foresee
her
comment
on
what
he


read
.
 
in
the
day
of
their
engagement
she
have
simply
(
as
he
now


perceive
)
echo
what
he
tell
she
;
but
since
he
have
cease
to
provide


she
with
opinion
she
have
begin
to
hazard
her
own
,
with
result


destructive
to
his
enjoyment
of
the
work
comment
on
.




see
that
he
have
choose
history
she
fetch
her
workbasket
,
draw
up


an
arm
-
chair
to
the
green
-
shade
student
lamp
,
and
uncover
a
cushion


she
be
embroider
for
his
sofa
.
 
she
be
not
a
clever
needle
-
woman
;


her
large
capable
hand
be
make
for
riding
,
rowing
and
open
-
air


activity
;
but
since
other
wife
embroider
cushion
for
their


husband
she
do
not
wish
to
omit
this
last
link
in
her
devotion
.




she
be
so
place
that
Archer
,
by
merely
raise
his
eye
,
could
see


her
bent
above
her
work
-
frame
,
her
ruffle
elbow
-
sleeve
slip
back


from
her
firm
round
arm
,
the
betrothal
sapphire
shine
on
her
left


hand
above
her
broad
gold
wedding
-
ring
,
and
the
right
hand
slowly
and


laboriously
stab
the
canvas
.
 
as
she
sit
thus
,
the
lamplight
full


on
her
clear
brow
,
he
say
to
himself
with
a
secret
dismay
that
he


would
always
know
the
thought
behind
it
,
that
never
,
in
all
the
year


to
come
,
would
she
surprise
he
by
an
unexpected
mood
,
by
a
new
idea
,
a


weakness
,
a
cruelty
or
an
emotion
.
 
she
have
spend
her
poetry
and


romance
on
their
short
courting
:
the
function
be
exhaust
because
the


need
be
past
.
 
now
she
be
simply
ripen
into
a
copy
of
her
mother
,


and
mysteriously
,
by
the
very
process
,
try
to
turn
he
into
a
Mr.


Welland
.
 
he

he
have
insist
that
the
library
curtain
should
draw
backward
and


forward
on
a
rod
,
so
that
they
might
be
close
in
the
evening
,
instead


of
remain
nail
to
a
gilt
cornice
,

immovably
loop
up
over


layer
of

he
pull
they
back
and


push
up
the
sash
,
lean
out
into
the
icy
night

the
mere
fact
of


not
look
at
May
,
seat
beside
his
table
,
under
his
lamp
,

a
whole

beyond
his
world

clear
his
brain
and
make
it
easy
to
breathe

after
he
have
lean
out
into
the
darkness
for
a
few
minute
he
hear


her

turn
back

and
suddenly
the
play
of
the
word
flash
up
a
wild
suggestion
.
 
what

there
,

that


warm
familiar
room

look
at

so
fascinating
and
overmaster
,
that
its
enormity
do
not


immediately
strike
he
.
 
he
simply
feel
that
chance
have
give
he
a
new


possibility
to
which
his
sick
soul
might
cling

glance
up
,

he
see
by
her
widen
eye
that
there
must
be


something
strange
in
his
own

she
remonstrate
;
and
with
a
sigh
he
bury
his
head


in
his
book
.




six
or
seven
day
pass
.
 
Archer
hear
nothing
from
Madame
Olenska
,


and
become
aware
that
her
name
would
not
be
mention
in
his
presence


by
any
member
of
the
family
.
 
he
do
not
try
to
see
she
;
to
do
so
while


she
be
at
old
Catherine
's
guard
bedside
would
have
be
almost


impossible
.
 
in
the
uncertainty
of
the
situation
he
let
himself
drift
,


conscious
,
somewhere
below
the
surface
of
his
thought
,
of
a
resolve


which
have
come
to
he
when
he
have
lean
out
from
his
library
window


into
the
icy
night
.
 
the
strength
of
that
resolve
make
it
easy
to
wait


and
make
no
sign
.




then
one
day
May
tell
he
that
Mrs.
Manson
Mingott
have
ask
to
see


he
.
 
there
be
nothing
surprising
in
the
request
,
for
the
old
lady
be


steadily
recover
,
and
she
have
always
openly
declare
that
she


prefer
Archer
to
any
of
her
other
grandson
-
in
-
law
.
 
may
give
the


message
with
evident
pleasure
:
she
be
proud
of
old
Catherine
's


appreciation
of
her
husband
.




there
be
a
moment
's
pause
,
and
then
Archer
feel
it
incumbent
on
he
to


say
:
 
"
all
right
.
 
shall
we
go
together
this
afternoon
?
"




his
wife
's
face
brighten
,
but
she
instantly
answer
:
"
oh
,
you
'd
much


well
go
alone
.
 
it
bore
granny
to
see
the
same
people
too
often
.
"




Archer
's
heart
be
beat
violently
when
he
ring
old
Mrs.
Mingott
's


bell
.
 
he
have
want
above
all
thing
to
go
alone
,
for
he
feel
sure
the


visit
would
give
he
the
chance
of
say
a
word
in
private
to
the


Countess
Olenska
.
 
he
have
determine
to
wait
till
the
chance
present


itself
naturally
;
and
here
it
be
,
and
here
he
be
on
the
doorstep
.


behind
the
door
,
behind
the
curtain
of
the
yellow
damask
room
next
to


the
hall
,
she
be
surely
await
he
;
in
another
moment
he
should
see


she
,
and
be
able
to
speak
to
she
before
she
lead
he
to
the
sick
-
room
.




he
want
only
to
put
one
question
:
after
that
his
course
would
be


clear
.
 
what
he
wish
to
ask
be
simply
the
date
of
her
return
to


Washington
;
and
that
question
she
could
hardly
refuse
to
answer
.




but
in
the
yellow
sitting
-
room
it
be
the
mulatto
maid
who
wait
.
 
her


white
tooth
shine
like
a
keyboard
,
she
push
back
the
slide
door


and
usher
he
into
old
Catherine
's
presence
.




the
old
woman
sit
in
a
vast
throne
-
like
arm
-
chair
near
her
bed
.
 
beside


she
be
a
mahogany
stand
bear
a
cast
bronze
lamp
with
an
engrave


globe
,
over
which
a
green
paper
shade
have
be
balance
.
 
there
be
not


a
book
or
a
newspaper
in
reach
,
nor
any
evidence
of
feminine


employment
:
conversation
have
always
be
Mrs.
Mingott
's
sole
pursuit
,


and
she
would
have
scorn
to
feign
an
interest
in
fancywork
.




Archer
see
no
trace
of
the
slight
distortion
leave
by
her
stroke
.
 
she


merely
look
paler
,
with
dark
shadow
in
the
fold
and
recess
of


her
obesity
;
and
,
in
the
fluted
mob
-
cap
tie
by
a
starch
bow
between


her
first
two
chin
,
and
the
muslin
kerchief
cross
over
her
billowing


purple
dressing
-
gown
,
she
seem
like
some
shrewd
and
kindly
ancestress


of
her
own
who
might
have
yield
too
freely
to
the
pleasure
of
the


table
.




she
hold
out
one
of
the
little
hand
that
nestle
in
a
hollow
of
she


huge
lap
like
pet
animal
,
and
call
to
the
maid
:
 
"
do
n't
let
in
any


one
else
.
 
if
my
daughter
call
,
say
I
be
asleep
.
"




the
maid
disappear
,
and
the
old
lady
turn
to
her
grandson
.




"
my
dear
,
be
I
perfectly
hideous
?
"
she
ask
gaily
,
launch
out
one


hand
in
search
of
the
fold
of
muslin
on
her
inaccessible
bosom
.
 
"
my


daughter
tell
I
it
do
n't
matter
at
my
age
--
as
if
hideousness
do
n't


matter
all
the
more
the
hard
it
get
to
conceal
!
"




"
my
dear
,
you
be
handsomer
than
ever
!
"
Archer
rejoin
in
the
same


tone
;
and
she
throw
back
her
head
and
laugh
.




"
ah
,
but
not
as
handsome
as
Ellen
!
"
she
jerk
out
,
twinkle
at
he


maliciously
;
and
before
he
could
answer
she
add
:
 
"
be
she
so
awfully


handsome
the
day
you
drive
she
up
from
the
ferry
?
"




he
laugh
,
and
she
continue
:
 
"
be
it
because
you
tell
she
so
that


she
have
to
put
you
out
on
the
way
?
 
in
my
youth
young
man
do
n't
desert


pretty
woman
unless
they
be
make
to
!
"
 
she
give
another
chuckle
,
and


interrupt
it
to
say
almost
querulously
:
 
"
it
be
a
pity
she
do
n't


marry
you
;
I
always
tell
she
so
.
 
it
would
have
spare
I
all
this


worry
.
 
but
who
ever
think
of
spare
their
grandmother
worry
?
"




Archer
wonder
if
her
illness
have
blur
her
faculty
;
but
suddenly


she
break
out
:
 
"
well
,
it
be
settle
,
anyhow
:
she
be
go
to
stay
with


I
,
whatever
the
rest
of
the
family
say
!
 
she
have
n't
be
here
five


minute
before
I
'd
have
go
down
on
my
knee
to
keep
she
--
if
only
,
for


the
last
twenty
year
,
I
'd
be
able
to
see
where
the
floor
be
!
"




Archer
listen
in
silence
,
and
she
go
on
:
 
"
they
'd
talk
I
over
,


as
no
doubt
you
know
:
persuade
I
,
Lovell
,
and
Letterblair
,
and


Augusta
Welland
,
and
all
the
rest
of
they
,
that
I
must
hold
out
and
cut


off
her
allowance
,
till
she
be
make
to
see
that
it
be
her
duty
to
go


back
to
Olenski
.
 
they
think
they
'd
convince
I
when
the
secretary
,


or
whatever
he
be
,
come
out
with
the
last
proposal
:
handsome


proposal
I
confess
they
be
.
 
after
all
,
marriage
be
marriage
,
and


money
's
money
--
both
useful
thing
in
their
way
...
and
I
do
n't
know


what
to
answer--
"
 
she
break
off
and
draw
a
long
breath
,
as
if
speak


have
become
an
effort
.
 
"
but
the
minute
I
lay
eye
on
she
,
I
say
:


'
you
sweet
bird
,
you
!
 
Shut
you
up
in
that
cage
again
?
 
never
!
'
 
and


now
it
be
settle
that
she
be
to
stay
here
and
nurse
her
granny
as
long


as
there
be
a
granny
to
nurse
.
 
it
be
not
a
gay
prospect
,
but
she
do
n't


mind
;
and
of
course
I
've
tell
Letterblair
that
she
be
to
be
give
she


proper
allowance
.
"




the
young
man
hear
she
with
vein
aglow
;
but
in
his
confusion
of
mind


he
hardly
know
whether
her
news
bring
joy
or
pain
.
 
he
have
so


definitely
decide
on
the
course
he
mean
to
pursue
that
for
the
moment


he
could
not
readjust
his
thought
.
 
but
gradually
there
steal
over
he


the
delicious
sense
of
difficulty
deferred
and
opportunity


miraculously
provide
.
 
if
Ellen
have
consent
to
come
and
live
with


her
grandmother
it
must
surely
be
because
she
have
recognise
the


impossibility
of
give
he
up
.
 
this
be
her
answer
to
his
final


appeal
of
the
other
day
:
if
she
would
not
take
the
extreme
step
he
have


urge
,
she
have
at
last
yield
to
half

XXXI
.




Archer
have
be
stun
by
old
Catherine
's
news
.
 
it
be
only
natural


that
Madame
Olenska
should
have
hasten
from
Washington
in
response
to


her
grandmother
's
summon
;
but
that
she
should
have
decide
to
remain


under
her
roof
--
especially
now
that
Mrs.
Mingott
have
almost
regain


her
health
--
be
less
easy
to
explain
.




Archer
be
sure
that
Madame
Olenska
's
decision
have
not
be
influence


by
the
change
in
her
financial
situation
.
 
he
know
the
exact
figure
of


the
small
income
which
her
husband
have
allow
she
at
their
separation
.


without
the
addition
of
her
grandmother
's
allowance
it
be
hardly


enough
to
live
on
,
in
any
sense
know
to
the
Mingott
vocabulary
;
and


now
that
Medora
Manson
,
who
share
her
life
,
have
be
ruin
,
such
a


pittance
would
barely
keep
the
two
woman
clothe
and
feed
.
 
yet
Archer


be
convince
that
Madame
Olenska
have
not
accept
her
grandmother
's


offer
from
interested
motive
.




she
have
the
heedless
generosity
and
the
spasmodic
extravagance
of


person
use
to
large
fortune
,
and
indifferent
to
money
;
but
she
could


go
without
many
thing
which
her
relation
consider
indispensable
,


and
Mrs.
Lovell
Mingott
and
Mrs.
Welland
have
often
be
hear
to


deplore
that
any
one
who
have
enjoy
the
cosmopolitan
luxury
of
Count


Olenski
's
establishment
should
care
so
little
about
"
how
thing
be


do
.
"
 
moreover
,
as
Archer
know
,
several
month
have
pass
since
she


allowance
have
be
cut
off
;
yet
in
the
interval
she
have
make
no
effort


to
regain
her
grandmother
's
favour
.
 
therefore
if
she
have
change
she


course
it
must
be
for
a
different
reason
.




he
do
not
have
far
to
seek
for
that
reason
.
 
on
the
way
from
the
ferry


she
have
tell
he
that
he
and
she
must
remain
apart
;
but
she
have
say
it


with
her
head
on
his
breast
.
 
he
know
that
there
be
no
calculated


coquetry
in
her
word
;
she
be
fight
her
fate
as
he
have
fight
his
,


and
cling
desperately
to
her
resolve
that
they
should
not
break


faith
with
the
people
who
trust
they
.
 
but
during
the
ten
day
which


have
elapse
since
her
return
to
New
York
she
have
perhaps
guess
from


his
silence
,
and
from
the
fact
of
his
make
no
attempt
to
see
she
,


that
he
be
meditate
a
decisive
step
,
a
step
from
which
there
be
no


turn
back
.
 
at
the
thought
,
a
sudden
fear
of
her
own
weakness
might


have
seize
she
,
and
she
might
have
feel
that
,
after
all
,
it
be
well


to
accept
the
compromise
usual
in
such
case
,
and
follow
the
line
of


least
resistance
.




an
hour
early
,
when
he
have
ring
Mrs.
Mingott
's
bell
,
Archer
have


fancy
that
his
path
be
clear
before
he
.
 
he
have
mean
to
have
a


word
alone
with
Madame
Olenska
,
and
fail
that
,
to
learn
from
she


grandmother
on
what
day
,
and
by
which
train
,
she
be
return
to


Washington
.
 
in
that
train
he
intend
to
join
she
,
and
travel
with
she


to
Washington
,
or
as
much
far
as
she
be
willing
to
go
.
 
his
own


fancy
incline
to
Japan
.
 
at
any
rate
she
would
understand
at
once


that
,
wherever
she
go
,
he
be
go
.
 
he
mean
to
leave
a
note
for


may
that
should
cut
off
any
other
alternative
.




he
have
fancy
himself
not
only
nerve
for
this
plunge
but
eager
to


take
it
;
yet
his
first
feeling
on
hear
that
the
course
of
event
be


change
have
be
one
of
relief
.
 
now
,
however
,
as
he
walk
home
from


Mrs.
Mingott
's
,
he
be
conscious
of
a
grow
distaste
for
what
lie


before
he
.
 
there
be
nothing
unknown
or
unfamiliar
in
the
path
he
be


presumably
to
tread
;
but
when
he
have
tread
it
before
it
be
as
a
free


man
,
who
be
accountable
to
no
one
for
his
action
,
and
could
lend


himself
with
an
amused
detachment
to
the
game
of
precaution
and


prevarication
,
concealment
and
compliance
,
that
the
part
require
.


this
procedure
be
call
"
protect
a
woman
's
honour
"
;
and
the
good


fiction
,
combine
with
the
after
-
dinner
talk
of
his
elder
,
have
long


since
initiate
he
into
every
detail
of
its
code
.




now
he
see
the
matter
in
a
new
light
,
and
his
part
in
it
seem


singularly
diminish
.
 
it
be
,
in
fact
,
that
which
,
with
a
secret


fatuity
,
he
have
watch
Mrs.
Thorley
Rushworth
play
toward
a
fond
and


unperceiving
husband
:
a
smile
,
bantering
,
humouring
,
watchful
and


incessant
lie
.
 
a
lie
by
day
,
a
lie
by
night
,
a
lie
in
every
touch
and


every
look
;
a
lie
in
every
caress
and
every
quarrel
;
a
lie
in
every


word
and
in
every
silence
.




it
be
easy
,
and
less
dastardly
on
the
whole
,
for
a
wife
to
play
such


a
part
toward
her
husband
.
 
a
woman
's
standard
of
truthfulness
be


tacitly
hold
to
be
low
:
she
be
the
subject
creature
,
and
verse
in


the
art
of
the
enslaved
.
 
then
she
could
always
plead
mood
and


nerve
,
and
the
right
not
to
be
hold
too
strictly
to
account
;
and
even


in
the
most
strait
-
lace
society
the
laugh
be
always
against
the


husband
.




but
in
Archer
's
little
world
no
one
laugh
at
a
wife
deceive
,
and
a


certain
measure
of
contempt
be
attach
to
man
who
continue
their


philander
after

they
be
not
to
be
sow
more
than

Archer
have
always
share
this
view

heart

despicable
.
 
but
to
love
Ellen
Olenska
be
not
to
become
a
man
like


leffert
:
for
the
first
time
Archer
find
himself
face
to
face
with
the


dread
argument
of
the
individual
case
.
 
Ellen
Olenska
be
like
no
other


woman
,
he
be
like
no
other
man
:
their
situation
,
therefore
,
resemble


no
one
else
's
,
and
they
be
answerable
to
no
tribunal
but
that
of


their
own
judgment
.




yes
,
but
in
ten
minute
more
he
would
be
mount
his
own
doorstep
;
and


there
be
May
,
and
habit
,
and
honour
,
and
all
the
old
decency
that


he
and
his
people
have
always
believe
in
...




at
his
corner
he
hesitate
,
and
then
walk
on
down
Fifth
Avenue
.




ahead
of
he
,
in
the
winter
night
,
loom
a
big
unlit
house
.
 
as
he


draw
near
he
think
how
often
he
have
see
it
blaze
with
light
,
its


step
awninge
and
carpet
,
and
carriage
wait
in
double
line
to


draw
up
at
the
curbstone
.
 
it
be
in
the
conservatory
that
stretch


its
dead
-
black
bulk
down
the
side
street
that
he
have
take
his
first


kiss
from
May
;
it
be
under
the
myriad
candle
of
the
ball
-
room
that
he


have
see
she
appear
,
tall
and
silver
-
shine
as
a
young
Diana
.




now
the
house
be
as
dark
as
the
grave
,
except
for
a
faint
flare
of
gas


in
the
basement
,
and
a
light
in
one
upstairs
room
where
the
blind
have


not
be
lower
.
 
as
Archer
reach
the
corner
he
see
that
the


carriage
standing
at
the
door
be
Mrs.
Manson
Mingott
's
.
 
what
an


opportunity
for
Sillerton
Jackson
,
if
he
should
chance
to
pass
!
 
Archer


have
be
greatly
move
by
old
Catherine
's
account
of
Madame
Olenska
's


attitude
toward
Mrs.
Beaufort
;
it
make
the
righteous
reprobation
of
New


York
seem
like
a
passing
by
on
the
other
side
.
 
but
he
know
well
enough


what
construction
the
club
and
drawing
-
room
would
put
on
Ellen


Olenska
's
visit
to
her
cousin
.




he
pause
and
look
up
at
the
light
window
.
 
no
doubt
the
two
woman


be
sit
together
in
that
room
:
Beaufort
have
probably
seek


consolation
elsewhere
.
 
there
be
even
rumour
that
he
have
leave
New


York
with
Fanny
Ring
;
but
Mrs.
Beaufort
's
attitude
make
the
report
seem


improbable
.




Archer
have
the
nocturnal
perspective
of
Fifth
Avenue
almost
to
himself
.


at
that
hour
most
people
be
indoor
,
dress
for
dinner
;
and
he
be


secretly
glad
that
Ellen
's
exit
be
likely
to
be
unobserved
.
 
as
the


think
pass
through
his
mind
the
door
open
,
and
she
come
out
.


behind
she
be
a
faint
light
,
such
as
might
have
be
carry
down
the


stair
to
show
she
the
way
.
 
she
turn
to
say
a
word
to
some
one
;
then


the
door
close
,
and
she
come
down
the
step
.




"
Ellen
,
"
he
say
in
a
low
voice
,
as
she
reach
the
pavement
.




she
stop
with
a
slight
start
,
and
just
then
he
see
two
young
man
of


fashionable
cut
approach
.
 
there
be
a
familiar
air
about
their


overcoat
and
the
way
their
smart
silk
muffler
be
fold
over
their


white
tie
;
and
he
wonder
how
youth
of
their
quality
happen
to
be


dine
out
so
early
.
 
then
he
remember
that
the
Reggie
Chiverses
,


whose
house
be
a
few
door
above
,
be
take
a
large
party
that


evening
to
see
Adelaide
Neilson
in
Romeo
and
Juliet
,
and
guess
that


the
two
be
of
the
number
.
 
they
pass
under
a
lamp
,
and
he


recognise
Lawrence
Lefferts
and
a
young
Chivers
.




a
mean
desire
not
to
have
Madame
Olenska
see
at
the
Beauforts
'
door


vanish
as
he
feel
the
penetrate
warmth
of
her
hand
.




"
I
shall
see
you
now

we
shall
be
together

he
break
out
,
hardly


know
what
he
say
.




"
ah
,
"
she
answer
,
"

"




while
he
watch
she
he
be
aware
that
Lefferts
and
Chivers
,
on


reach
the
farther
side
of
the
street
corner
,
have
discreetly
strike


away
across
Fifth
Avenue
.
 
it
be
the
kind
of
masculine
solidarity
that


he
himself
often
practise
;
now
he
sicken
at
their
connivance
.
 
do


she
really
imagine
that
he
and
she
could
live
like
this

and
if
not
,


what
else
do
she
imagine

"

I
must
see

he
say
,
in


a
voice
that
sound
almost
angry
to
his
own
ear
.




she
waver
,
and
move
toward
the
carriage
.




"

add
,

conscious
that

change
of
plan
require
some
explanation
.




"

stare
after

setting

giant


rose

pen

wiper
pansy
,
the

large
blonde
victim

the

small
brown
seducer

from

wander
to
the
point
of
the
horseshoe
where


may
sit
between
two
old
lady
,
just
as
,
on
that
former
evening
,
she


have
sit
between
Mrs.
Lovell
Mingott
and
her
newly

arrive
"
foreign
"


cousin
.
 
as
on
that
evening
,
she
be
all
in
white
;
and
Archer
,
who
have


not
notice
what
she
wear
,
recognise
the
blue
-
white
satin
and
old
lace


of
her
wedding
dress
.




it
be
the
custom
,
in
old
New
York
,
for
bride
to
appear
in
this
costly


garment
during
the
first
year
or
two
of
marriage
:
his
mother
,
he
know
,


keep
hers
in
tissue
paper
in
the
hope
that
Janey
might
some
day
wear


it
,
though
poor
Janey
be
reach
the
age
when
pearl
grey
poplin
and


no
bridesmaid
would
be
think
more
"
appropriate
.
"




it
strike
Archer
that
May
,
since
their
return
from
Europe
,
have
seldom


wear
her
bridal
satin
,
and
the
surprise
of
see
she
in
it
make
he


compare
her
appearance
with
that
of
the
young
girl
he
have
watch
with


such
blissful
anticipation
two
year
early
.




though
May
's
outline
be
slightly
heavy
,
as
her
goddesslike
build
have


foretold
,
her
athletic
erectness
of
carriage
,
and
the
girlish


transparency
of
her
expression
,
remain
unchanged
:
but
for
the
slight


languor
that
Archer
have
lately
notice
in
she
she
would
have
be
the


exact
image
of
the
girl
play
with
the
bouquet
of


lily
-
of
-
the
-
valley
on
her
betrothal
evening
.
 
the
fact
seem
an


additional
appeal
to
his
pity
:
such
innocence
be
as
move
as
the


trustful
clasp
of
a
child
.
 
then
he
remember
the
passionate


generosity
latent
under
that
incurious
calm
.
 
he
recall
her
glance
of


understanding
when
he
have
urge
that
their
engagement
should
be


announce
at
the
Beaufort
ball
;
he
hear
the
voice
in
which
she
have


say
,
in
the
Mission
garden
:
 
"
I
could
n't

an
uncontrollable
longing


seize
he
to
tell
she
the
truth
,
to
throw
himself
on
her
generosity

ask
for
the
freedom

have
once

it
be
,
as
Mrs.

smilingly
say
to
Mrs.

a
great
event


for
a
young
couple
to
give
their
first
big
dinner
.




the
Newland
Archers
,
since
they
have
set
up
their
household

have


receive
a
good
deal
of
company
in
an
informal
way
.
 
Archer
be
fond
of


have
three
or
four
friend
to
dine
,
and
may
welcome
they
with
the


beam
readiness
of
which
her
mother
have
set
she
the
example
in


conjugal
affair
.
 
her
husband
question
whether
,
if
leave
to
herself
,


she
would
ever
have
ask
any
one
to
the
house
;
but
he
have
long
give


up
try
to
disengage
her
real
self
from
the
shape
into
which


tradition
and
training
have
mould
she
.
 
it
be
expect
that
well
-
off


young
couple
in
New
York
should
do
a
good
deal
of
informal


entertaining
,
and
a
Welland
marry
to
an
Archer
be
doubly
pledge
to


the
tradition
.




but
a
big
dinner
,
with
a
hire
chef
and
two
borrow
footman
,
with


roman
punch
,
rose
from
Henderson

menu
on

edge

,
be


a
different
affair
,
and
not
to
be
lightly
undertake
.
 
as
Mrs.
Archer


remark
,
the
roman
punch
make
all
the
difference
;
not
in
itself
but
by


its
manifold
implication
--
since
it
signify
either
canvas
-
back
or


terrapin
,
two
soup
,
a
hot
and
a
cold
sweet
,
full
decolletage
with


short
sleeve
,
and
guest
of
a
proportionate
importance
.




it
be
always
an
interesting
occasion
when
a
young
pair
launch
their


first
invitation
in
the
third
person
,
and
their
summon
be
seldom


refuse
even
by
the
seasoned
and
seek
-
after
.
 
still
,
it
be


admittedly
a
triumph
that
the
van
der
Luydens
,
at
May
's
request
,
should


have
stay
over

be
present
at
her
farewell
dinner
for
the


Countess

to
the
praise
of

Mr.

be
thoughtfully


celebrate
.
 
through
it
all
he
be
dimly
aware
of
a
general
attitude


of
friendliness
toward
himself
,
as
if
the
guard
of
the
prisoner

where
they
presently
join
the
lady
,
he
meet


May

triumphant
eye

and
read
in
they
the
conviction
that
everything


have
"
go
off
"
beautifully
.
 
she
rise
from
Madame
Olenska

side

and


immediately
Mrs.

beckon
the
latter
to

the


gilt

Mrs.
Selfridge
Merry
bore
across
the
room


to
join
they
,
and
it
become
clear
to
Archer
that
here
also
a
conspiracy


of
rehabilitation
and
obliteration
be
go
on
.
 
the
silent


organisation
which
hold
his
little
world
together
be
determined
to
put


itself
on
record
as
never
for
a
moment
having
question
the
propriety


of
Madame
Olenska
's
conduct
,
or
the
completeness
of
Archer
's
domestic


felicity
.
 
all
these
amiable
and
inexorable
person
be
resolutely


engage
in
pretend
to
each
other
that
they
have
never
hear
of

suspect
,
or
even
conceive
possible
,
the
least
hint
to
the
contrary
;


and
from
this
tissue
of
elaborate
mutual
dissimulation
Archer
once
more


disengage
the
fact
that
New
York
believe
he
to
be
Madame
Olenska
's


lover
.
 
he
catch
the
glitter
of
victory
in
his
wife
's
eye
,
and
for


the
first
time
understand
that
she
share
the
belief
.
 
the
discovery


rouse
a
laughter
of
inner
devil
that
reverberate
through
all
his


effort
to
discuss
the
Martha
Washington
ball
with
Mrs.
Reggie
Chivers


and
little
Mrs.
Newland
;
and
so
the
evening
sweep
on
,
run
and


run
like
a
senseless
river
that
do
not
know
how
to
stop
.




at
length
he
see
that
Madame
Olenska
have
rise
and
be
say
good
-
bye
.


he
understand
that
in
a
moment
she
would
be
go
,
and
try
to
remember


what
he
have
say
to
she
at
dinner
;
but
he
could
not
recall
a
single


word
they
have
exchange
.




she
go
up
to
May
,
the
rest
of
the
company
make
a
circle
about
she


as
she
advance
.
 
the
two
young
woman
clasp
hand
;
then
may
bent


forward
and
kiss
her
cousin
.




"

our
hostess
be
much
the
handsomer
of
the
two

Archer
hear


reggie
Chivers
say
in
an
undertone
to
young
Mrs.
Newland
;
and
he


remember
Beaufort
's
coarse
sneer
at
May
's
ineffectual
beauty
.




a
moment
later
he
be
in
the
hall
,
put
Madame
Olenska
's
cloak
about


her
shoulder
.




through
all
his
confusion
of
mind
he
have
hold
fast
to
the
resolve
to


say
nothing
that
might
startle
or
disturb
she
.
 
convince
that
no
power


could
now
turn
he
from
his
purpose

have
find
strength
to
let

themselves
as
they
would
.
 
but
as
he
follow
Madame
Olenska
into


the
hall
he
think
with
a
sudden
hunger
of
be
for
a
moment
alone


with
she
at
the
door
of
her
carriage
.




"

break
to

,
with
a
blushing
circumlocution
that
would
have
cause
the
young


woman
of
the
new
generation
to
smile
,
the
news
that
she
be
to
have
a


child

and
there
their
eld

delicate
to
be
take
to


church
in
midwinter
,
have
be
christen
by
their
old
friend

Bishop


of

the
ample
magnificent
irreplaceable
Bishop
,
so
long
the


pride
and
ornament
of
his

there
Dallas
have
first
stagger


across
the
floor
shout
"
Dad

while
May

the
nurse
laugh
behind


the

there
their
second
child
,
Mary
(
who
be
so
like
her
mother

have
announce
her
engagement
to

there
Archer
have
kiss
she
through

before
they
go
down
to
the
motor

it
be
in
the

that
he
and
May
have
always
discuss
the
future


of
the
child
:
the
study
of
Dallas
and
his
young
brother
Bill
,


Mary
's
incurable
indifference
to
"
accomplishment
,
"
and
passion
for


sport
and
philanthropy
,
and
the
vague
leaning
toward

"
which
have


finally
land
the
restless

curious
Dallas

the
young
man
nowadays
be
emancipate
themselves
from
the
law
and


business
and
take
up
all
sort
of
new
thing
.
 
if
they
be
not


absorb
in
state
politic
or
municipal
reform
,
the
chance
be
that


they
be
go
in
for
central
american
archaeology
,
for
architecture


or
landscape

;
take
a

learn

prerevolutionary
building
of

own
country
,
study

adapt


georgian
type
,
and
protest
at
the
meaningless
use
of
the
word


"
colonial
.
"
 
nobody
nowadays
have
"

but
above
all
--
sometimes
Archer
put
it
above
all
--
it
be
in
that


library
that
the
Governor
of
New
York
,
come
down
from
Albany
one


evening
to
dine
and
spend
the
night
,
have
turn
to
his
host
,
and
say
,


bang
his
clenched
fist
on
the
table
and
gnash
his
eye

glass
:


"

you
be
the

"
man

you--
"
how
Archer
have
glow
at
the
phrase
!
 
how
eagerly
he


have
rise
up
at
the
call
!
 
it
be
an
echo
of
Ned
Winsett
's
old
appeal


to
roll
his
sleeve
up
and
get
down
into
the
muck
;
but
speak
by
a
man


who
set
the
example
of
the
gesture
,
and
whose
summon
to
follow
he
be


irresistible
.




Archer
,
as
he
look
back
,
be
not
sure
that
man
like
himself
be
what


his
country
need
,
at
least
in
the
active
service
to
which
Theodore


Roosevelt
have
point
;
in
fact
,
there
be
reason
to
think
it
do
not
,


for
after
a
year
in
the
State
Assembly
he
have
not
be
re
-
elect
,
and


have
drop
back
thankfully
into
obscure
if
useful
municipal
work
,
and


from
that
again
to
the
writing
of
occasional
article
in
one
of
the


reform
weekly
that
be
try
to
shake
the
country
out
of
its


apathy
.
 
it
be
little
enough
to
look
back
on
;
but
when
he
remember


to
what
the
young
man
of
his
generation
and
his
set
have
look


forward
--
the
narrow
groove
of
money
-
making
,
sport
and
society
to
which


their
vision
have
be
limit
--
even
his
small
contribution
to
the
new


state
of
thing
seem
to
count
,
as
each
brick
count
in
a
well
-
build


wall
.
 
he
have
do
little
in
public
life
;
he
would
always
be
by
nature


a
contemplative
and
a
dilettante
;
but
he
have
have
high
thing
to


contemplate
,
great
thing
to
delight
in
;
and
one
great
man
's
friendship


to
be
his
strength
and
pride
.




he
have
be
,
in
short
,
what
people
be
begin
to
call
"
a
good


citizen

take
account
of

People
say
:
 
"
ask
Archer
"
when
there
be
a


question
of
start
the
first
school
for
crippled
child
,


reorganise
the
Museum
of
Art
,
found
the
Grolier
Club
,
inaugurate


the
new
Library
,
or
get
up
a
new
society
of
chamber
music
.
 
his


day
be
full
,
and
they
be
fill
decently
.
 
he
suppose
it
be
all


a
man
ought
to
ask
.




something
he
know
he
have
miss
:
the
flower
of
life
.
 
but
he
think
of


it
now
as
a
thing
so
unattainable
and
improbable
that
to
have
repine


would
have
be
like
despair
because
one
have
not
draw
the
first


prize
in
a
lottery
.
 
there
be
a
hundred
million
ticket
in
his


lottery
,
and
there
be
only
one
prize
;
the
chance
have
be
too


decidedly
against
he
.
 
when
he
think
of
Ellen
Olenska
it
be


abstractly
,
serenely
,
as
one
might
think
of
some
imaginary
belove
in
a


book
or
a
picture
:
she
have
become
the
composite
vision
of
all
that
he


have
miss
.
 
that
vision
,
faint
and
tenuous
as
it
be
,
have
keep
he


from
thinking
of
other
woman
.
 
he
have
be
what
be
call
a
faithful


husband
;
and
when
May
have
suddenly
die
--
carry
off
by
the
infectious


pneumonia
through
which
she
have
nurse
their
young
child
--
he
have


honestly
mourn
she
.
 
their
long
year
together
have
show
he
that
it


do
not
so
much
matter
if
marriage
be
a
dull
duty
,
as
long
as
it
keep


the
dignity
of
a
duty
:
lapse
from
that
,
it
become
a
mere
battle
of


ugly
appetite
.
 
look
about
he
,
he
honour
his
own
past
,
and


mourn
for
it
.
 
after
all
,
there
be
good
in
the
old
way
.




his
eye
,
make
the
round
of
the
room
--
do
over
by
Dallas
with


english
mezzotint
,
Chippendale
cabinet
,
bit
of
choose
blue
-
and
-
white


and
pleasantly
shade
electric
lamp
--
come
back
to
the
old
Eastlake


writing
-
table
that
he
have
never
be
willing
to
banish
,
and
to
his


first
photograph
of
May
,
which
still
keep
its
place
beside
his
inkstand
.




there
she
be
,
tall
,
round
-
bosom
and
willowy
,
in
her
starch
muslin


and
flap
Leghorn
,
as
he
have
see
she
under
the
orange
-
tree
in
the


mission
garden
.
 
and
as
he
have
see
she
that
day
,
so
she
have
remain
;


never
quite
at
the
same
height
,
yet
never
far
below
it
:
generous
,


faithful
,
unwearied
;
but
so
lack
in
imagination
,
so
incapable
of


growth
,
that
the
world
of
her
youth
have
fall
into
piece
and
rebuild


itself
without
her
ever
be
conscious
of
the
change
.
 
this
hard


bright
blindness
have
keep
her
immediate
horizon
apparently
unaltered
.


her
incapacity
to
recognise
change
make
her
child
conceal
their


view
from
she
as
Archer
conceal
his
;
there
have
be
,
from
the
first
,


a
joint
pretence
of
sameness
,
a
kind
of
innocent
family
hypocrisy
,
in


which
father
and
child
have
unconsciously
collaborate
.
 
and
she
have


die
think
the
world
a
good
place
,
full
of
love
and
harmonious


household
like
her
own
,
and
resign
to
leave
it
because
she
be


convince
that
,
whatever
happen
,
Newland
would
continue
to
inculcate


in
Dallas
the
same
principle
and
prejudice
which
have
shape
his


parent
'
life
,
and
that
Dallas
in
turn
(
when
Newland
follow
she
)


would
transmit
the
sacred
trust
to
little
Bill
.
 
and
of
Mary
she
be


sure
as
of
her
own
self
.
 
so
,
having
snatch
little
bill
from
the


grave
,
and
give
her
life
in
the
effort
,
she
go
contentedly
to
she


place
in
the
Archer
vault
in
St.
 
Mark
's
,
where
Mrs.
Archer
already
lie


safe
from
the
terrifying
"
trend
"
which
her
daughter
-
in

law
have
never


even
become
aware
of

Opposite

waiste
,
flat

cheste
and


slightly
slouch
,
as
the
altered

Mary
Chivers
's


mighty
feat
of
athleticism
could
not
have

with
the


twenty

inch
waist
that
May
Archer
's
azure
sash

easily

the
difference

symbolic

the

be
as
closely


girt

be
no

conventional

off

Archer
rise
and
begin
to
pace
up

down
the


room

it
would

whatever
one
might

not

with

on
the
contrary
,
from
what
he
have

as
he


feel

draw
toward
his

daughter

in

,
it
be
tempting


to
seize
this
last
chance
of
be
alone
with
his
boy
.




there
be
no
reason
why
he
should
not
seize
it
,
except
the
profound
one


that
he
have
lose
the
habit
of
travel
.
 
may
have
dislike
to
move
except


for
valid
reason
,
such
as
take
the
child
to
the
sea

in
the


mountain
:
she
could
imagine
no
other
motive
for

thirty

ninth
Street

their
comfortable
quarter
at
the
Wellands
'
in


Newport
.
 
after
Dallas
have
take
his
degree
she
have
think
it
her
duty


to
travel
for
six
month
;
and
the
whole
family
have
make
the


old

fashioned
tour
through
England

Switzerland

Italy
.
 
their
time


be
limited
(
no
one
know
why

they
have
omit
France
.
 
Archer


remember
Dallas
's
wrath
at
be
ask
to
contemplate
Mont
Blanc


instead
of
Rheims
and
Chartres
.
 
but
Mary
and
Bill
want


mountain
-
climbing
,

have
already
yawn
their
way
in
Dallas
's
wake


through
the
english
cathedral
;
and
May
,
always
fair
to
her

have
insist
on
hold
the
balance
evenly
between
their
athletic
and


artistic
proclivity
.
 
she
have
indeed
propose
that
her
husband
should


go
to
Paris
for
a
fortnight
,
and
join
they
on
the
italian
lake
after


they
have
"
do
"
Switzerland
;
but
Archer
have
decline
.
 
"
we
'll
stick


together
,
"
he
say
;
and
May
's
face
have
brighten
at
his
set
such
a


good
example
to
Dallas
.




since
her
death
,
nearly
two
year
before
,
there
have
be
no
reason
for


his
continue
in
the
same
routine
.
 
his
child
have
urge
he
to


travel
:
Mary
Chivers
have
feel
sure
it
would
do
he
good
to
go
abroad


and
"
see
the
gallery
.
"
 
the
very
mysteriousness
of
such
a
cure
make


she
the
more
confident
of
its
efficacy
.
 
but
Archer
have
find
himself


hold
fast
by
habit
,
by
memory
,
by
a
sudden
startled
shrink
from


new
thing
.




now
,
as
he
review
his
past
,
he
see
into
what
a
deep
rut
he
have
sink
.


the
bad
of
do
one
's
duty
be
that
it
apparently
unfit
one
for


do
anything
else
.
 
at
least
that
be
the
view
that
the
man
of
his


generation
have
take
.
 
the
trenchant
division
between
right
and
wrong
,


honest
and
dishonest
,
respectable
and
the
reverse
,
have
leave
so
little


scope
for
the
unforeseen
.
 
there
be
moment
when
a
man
's
imagination
,


so
easily
subdue
to
what
it
live
in
,
suddenly
rise
above
its
daily


level
,
and
survey
the
long
winding
of
destiny
.
 
Archer
hang
there
and


wonder
....




what
be
leave
of
the
little
world
he
have
grow
up
in
,
and
whose


standard
have
bend
and
bind
he
?
 
he
remember
a
sneer
prophecy
of


poor
Lawrence
Lefferts
's
,
utter
year
ago
in
that
very
room
:
 
"
if


thing
go
on
at
this
rate
,
our
child
will
be
marry
Beaufort
's


bastard
.
"




it
be
just
what
Archer
's
eld
son
,
the
pride
of
his
life
,
be
do
;


and
nobody
wonder
or
reprove
.
 
even
the
boy
's
Aunt
Janey
,
who
still


look
so
exactly
as
she
use
to
in
her
elderly
youth

have
take

emerald

out

carry
they
with
her
own
twitch
hand
to
the
future
bride

Fanny

of

at
not
receive
a


"
set
"
from
a
Paris
jeweller
,
have
exclaim
at
their
old

fashioned


beauty
,
and
declare
that
when
she
wear
they
she
should
feel
like
an


isabey
miniature
.




Fanny
Beaufort
,
who
have
appear
in
New
York
at
eighteen
,
after
the


death
of
her
parent
,
have
win
its
heart
much
as
Madame
Olenska
have
win


it
thirty
year
early
;
only
instead

distrustful

take
she
joyfully
for

.
 
she
be
pretty
,
amusing


and

:
what
more
do
any
one
want
?
 
nobody
be
narrow

minded


enough
to
rake
up
against

the
half
-
forget
fact
of
her
father
's


past
and
her
own
origin
.
 
only
the
old
people
remember
so
obscure


an
incident
in
the
business
life
of
New

as
Beaufort
's
failure

the
fact
that
after
his

's
death
he
have
be
quietly
married
to
the


notorious
Fanny
Ring
,

have
leave
the
country
with
his
new
wife
,
and
a


little
girl
who
inherit
her
beauty
.
 
he
be
subsequently
hear
of
in


Constantinople
,
then
in
Russia
;
and
a
dozen
year
later
American


traveller
be
handsomely
entertain
by
he
in
Buenos
Ayres
,
where
he


represent
a
large
insurance
agency
.
 
he
and
his
wife
die
there
in


the
odour
of
prosperity
;
and
one
day
their
orphan
daughter
have


appear
in
New
York
in
charge
of
May
Archer
's
sister
-
in

law
,
Mrs.
Jack


Welland
,
whose
husband
have
be
appoint
the
girl
's
guardian
.
 
the


fact
throw
she
into
almost
cousinly
relationship
with
Newland
Archer
's


child
,
and
nobody
be
surprised
when
Dallas
's
engagement
be


announce
.




nothing
could
more
dearly
give
the
measure
of
the
distance
that
the


world
have
travel
.
 
People
nowadays
be
too
busy
--
busy
with
reform


and
"
movement
,
"
with
fad
and
fetish
and
frivolity
--
to
bother
much


about
their
neighbour
.
 
and
of
what
account
be
anybody
's
past
,
in
the


huge
kaleidoscope
where
all
the
social
atom
spin
around
on
the
same


plane
?




Newland
Archer
,
look
out
of
his
hotel
window
at
the
stately
gaiety


of
the
Paris
street
,
feel
his
heart
beat
with
the
confusion
and


eagerness
of
youth
.




it
be
long
since
it
have
thus
plunge
and
rear
under
his
widening


waistcoat
,
leave
he
,
the
next
minute
,
with
an
empty
breast
and
hot


temple
.
 
he
wonder
if
it
be
thus
that
his
son
's
conduct
itself
in


the
presence
of
Miss
Fanny
Beaufort
--
and
decide
that
it
be
not
.
 
"
it


function
as
actively
,
no
doubt
,
but
the
rhythm
be
different
,
"
he


reflect
,
recall
the
cool
composure
with
which
the
young
man
have


announce
his
engagement
,
and
take
for
grant
that
his
family
would


approve
.




"
the
difference
be
that
these
young
people
take
it
for
grant
that


they
be
go
to
get
whatever
they
want
,
and
that
we
almost
always
take


it
for
grant
that
we
should
n't
.
 
only
,
I
wonder
--
the
thing
one
be
so


certain
of
in
advance
:
can
it
ever
make
one
's
heart
beat
as
wildly
?
"




it
be
the
day
after
their
arrival
in
Paris
,
and
the
spring
sunshine

Archer
in
his
open
window
,
above
the
wide
silvery
prospect
of
the


Place
Vendome
.
 
one
of
the
thing
he
have
stipulate
--
almost
the
only


one
--
when
he
have
agree
to
come
abroad
with
Dallas
,
be
that
,
in
Paris
,


he
should
n't
be
make
to
go
to

of
the

Archer

often
enough
,
in
the
first
impatient
year
,
the


scene
of
his
return
to
Paris
;
then
the
personal
vision
have
fade
,
and


he
have
simply
try
to
see
the
city
as
the
setting
of
Madame
Olenska
's


life
.
 
sit
alone
at
night
in
his
library
,
after
the
household
have


go
to
bed
,
he
have
evoke
the
radiant
outbreak
of
spring
down
the


avenue
of
horse
-
chestnut
,
the
flower
and
statue
in
the
public


garden
,
the
whiff
of
lilac
from
the
flower

cart
,
the
majestic
roll


of
the
river
under
the
great
bridge

the
life
of
art
and
study

pleasure
that
fill
each
mighty
artery
to
burst

now
the
spectacle


be
before
he
in
its
glory

as
he
look
out
on
it
he
feel
shy

old

fashioned
,
inadequate

magnificent
fellow

down
cheerily

they
stand
for
a
while
look
out
in

continue

he
say
it
lightly
,
carelessly

as
he
might
have
impart
any
casual


item
of
information

such
as
the
hour
at

square
near
one
of
the


avenue
radiate
from
the
Invalides

he
have
picture
the
quarter


as
quiet
and
almost
obscure

the
central
splendour

some
queer
process

golden
light

illumination

nearly
thirty
year

her
life

strangely


little

be
spend

rich
atmosphere

dense

stimulating

association
throw
out
by
an
intensely
social
race
in
a


setting
of
immemorial
manner

suddenly
he
remember
the
young


frenchman
who
have
once
say
to
he
:

not

hear
of
he
,
for
nearly
thirty


year

and
that
fact
give
the
measure
of
his
ignorance
of
Madame


Olenska
's
existence
.
 
More
than
half
a
lifetime

they

the
long
interval
among
people

do
not
know

in
a
society

faintly
guess
at
,
in
condition
he
would
never
wholly


understand

during
that
time
he
have
be
live
with
his
youthful


memory
of
she

she
have
doubtless
have
other

more
tangible


companionship

perhaps
she
too
have
keep
her
memory
of
he
as
something


apart

but
if
she
have
,
it
must
have
be
like
a
relic
in
a
small
dim


chapel
,
where
there
be
not
time
to
pray
every
day

its
history

an
idea

from

Archer
's
shyness
do
not
shrink
;
and
they
stand


together
look
up
at
the
house
.




it
be
a
modern
building
,
without
distinctive
character
,
but

windowed

put
his
head
into
the
porter

lodge
,
and
come
back
to


say
:
 
"
the
fifth
.
 
it
must
be
the
one
with
the

"




Archer
remain
motionless
,
gaze
at
the
upper
window
as
if
the
end


of
their
pilgrimage
have
be
attain
.




"
I
say
,
you
know
,
it
be
nearly
six
,
"
his
son
at
length
remind
he
.




the
father
glance
away
at
an
empty
bench
under
the
tree
.




"
I
believe
I
'll
sit
there
a
moment
,
"
he
say
.




"
why
--
aren't
you
well
?
"
his
son
exclaim
.




"
oh
,
perfectly
.
 
but
I
should
like
you
,
please
,
to
go
up
without
I
.
"




Dallas
pause
before
he
,
visibly
bewildered
.
 
"
but
,
I
say
,
dad
:
do
you


mean
you
wo
n't
come
up
at
all
?
"




"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
say
Archer
slowly
.




"
if
you
do
n't
she
wo
n't
understand
.
"




"
go
,
my
boy
;
perhaps
I
shall
follow
you
.
"




Dallas
give
he
a
long
look
through
the
twilight
.




"
but
what
on
earth
shall
I
say
?
"




"
my
dear
fellow
,
do
n't
you
always
know
what
to
say
?
"
his
father


rejoin
with
a
smile
.




"
very
well
.
 
I
shall
say
you
be
old
-
fashioned
,
and
prefer
walk
up


the
five
flight
because
you
do
n't
like

.
"




his
father
smile
again
.
 
"
say
I
be
old

fashioned
:
that
be
enough
.
"




Dallas
look
at
he
again
,
and
then
,
with
an
incredulous
gesture
,


pass
out
of
sight
under
the
vaulted
doorway
.




Archer
sit
down
on
the
bench
and
continue
to
gaze
at
the
awninge


balcony
.
 
he
calculate
the
time
it
would
take
his
son
to
be
carry
up


in
the
lift
to
the
fifth
floor
,
to
ring
the
bell
,
and
be
admit
to


the
hall
,
and
then
usher
into
the
drawing
-
room
.
 
he
picture
Dallas


enter
that
room
with
his
quick
assured
step
and
his
delightful


smile
,
and
wonder
if
the
people
be
right
who
say
that
his
boy


"
take
after
he
.
"




then
he
try
to
see
the
person
already
in
the
room
--
for
probably
at


that
sociable
hour
there
would
be
more
than
one
--
and
among
they
a
dark


lady
,
pale
and
dark
,
who
would
look
up
quickly
,
half
rise
,
and
hold
out


a
long
thin
hand
with
three
ring
on
it
....
 
he
think
she
would
be


sit
in
a
sofa
-
corner
near
the
fire
,
with
azalea
bank
behind
she


on
a
table
.




"
it
be
more
real
to
I
here
than
if
I
go
up
,
"
he
suddenly
hear


himself
say
;
and
the
fear
lest
that
last
shadow
of
reality
should
lose


its
edge
keep
he
rooted
to
his
seat
as
the
minute
succeed
each


other
.




he
sit
for
a
long
time
on
the
bench
in
the
thickening
dusk
,
his
eye


never
turn
from
the
balcony
.
 
at
length
a
light
shine
through
the


window
,
and
a
moment
later
a
man
-
servant
come
out
on
the
balcony
,
draw


up
the
awning
,
and
close
the
shutter
.




at
that
,
as
if
it
have
be
the
signal
he
wait
for
,
Newland
Archer
get


up
slowly
and
walk
back
alone
to
his
hotel
.
