CHAPTER
I.




LEVITICAL
.






of
late
year
an
abundant
shower
of
curate
have
fall
upon
the
north
of


england
:
they
lie
very
thick
on
the
hill
;
every
parish
have
one
or
more


of
they
;
they
be
young
enough
to
be
very
active
,
and
ought
to
be
do


a
great
deal
of
good
.
but
not
of
late
year
be
we
about
to
speak
;
we


be
go
back
to
the
beginning
of
this
century
:
late
year
--
present


year
be
dusty
,
sunburnt
,
hot
,
arid
;
we
will
evade
the
noon
,
forget
it


in
siesta
,
pass
the
midday
in
slumber
,
and
dream
of
dawn
.




if
you
think
,
from
this
prelude
,
that
anything
like
a
romance
be


prepare
for
you
,
reader
,
you
never
be
more
mistaken
.
do
you


anticipate
sentiment
,
and
poetry
,
and
reverie
?
do
you
expect
passion
,


and
stimulus
,
and
melodrama
?
calm
your
expectation
;
reduce
they
to
a


lowly
standard
.
something
real
,
cool
,
and
solid
lie
before
you
;


something
unromantic
as
Monday
morning
,
when
all
who
have
work
wake
with


the
consciousness
that
they
must
rise
and
betake
themselves
thereto
.
it


be
not
positively
affirm
that
you
shall
not
have
a
taste
of
the


exciting
,
perhaps
towards
the
middle
and
close
of
the
meal
,
but
it
be


resolve
that
the
first
dish
set
upon
the
table
shall
be
one
that
a


catholic
--
ay
,
even
an
Anglo
-
Catholic
--
might
eat
on
Good
Friday
in


passion
Week
:
it
shall
be
cold
lentil
and
vinegar
without
oil
;
it
shall


be
unleavene
bread
with
bitter
herb
,
and
no
roast
lamb
.




of
late
year
,
I
say
,
an
abundant
shower
of
curate
have
fall
upon
the


north
of
England
;
but
in
eighteen
-
hundred
-
eleven
-
twelve
that
affluent


rain
have
not
descend
.
curate
be
scarce
then
:
there
be
no
Pastoral


aid
--
no
Additional
Curates
'
society
to
stretch
a
help
hand
to


wear
-
out
old
rector
and
incumbent
,
and
give
they
the
wherewithal
to


pay
a
vigorous
young
colleague
from
Oxford
or
Cambridge
.
the
present


successor
of
the
apostle
,
disciple
of
Dr.
Pusey
and
tool
of
the


Propaganda
,
be
at
that
time
be
hatch
under
cradle
-
blanket
,
or


undergo
regeneration
by
nursery
-
baptism
in
wash
-
hand
basin
.
you


could
not
have
guess
by
look
at
any
one
of
they
that
the


italian
-
iron
double
frill
of
its
net
-
cap
surround
the
brow
of
a


preordain
,
specially
-
sanctify
successor
of
St.
Paul
,
St.
Peter
,
or


St.
John
;
nor
could
you
have
foresee
in
the
fold
of
its
long


night
-
gown
the
white
surplice
in
which
it
be
hereafter
cruelly
to


exercise
the
soul
of
its
parishioner
,
and
strangely
to
nonplus
its


old
-
fashioned
vicar
by
flourish
aloft
in
a
pulpit
the
shirt
-
like


raiment
which
have
never
before
wave
higher
than
the
reading
-
desk
.




yet
even
in
those
day
of
scarcity
there
be
curate
:
the
precious


plant
be
rare
,
but
it
might
be
find
.
a
certain
favour
district
in


the
West
Riding
of
Yorkshire
could
boast
three
rod
of
Aaron
blossoming


within
a
circuit
of
twenty
mile
.
you
shall
see
they
,
reader
.
step
into


this
neat
garden
-
house
on
the
skirt
of
Whinbury
,
walk
forward
into
the


little
parlour
.
there
they
be
at
dinner
.
allow
I
to
introduce
they
to


you
:
Mr.
Donne
,
curate
of
Whinbury
;
Mr.
Malone
,
curate
of
Briarfield
;


Mr.
Sweeting
,
curate
of
Nunnely
.
these
be
Mr.
Donne
's
lodging
,
be


the
habitation
of
one
John
Gale
,
a
small
clothier
.
Mr.
Donne
have
kindly


invite
his
brother
to
regale
with
he
.
you
and
I
will
join
the
party
,


see
what
be
to
be
see
,
and
hear
what
be
to
be
hear
.
at
present
,


however
,
they
be
only
eat
;
and
while
they
eat
we
will
talk
aside
.




these
gentleman
be
in
the
bloom
of
youth
;
they
possess
all
the
activity


of
that
interesting
age
--
an
activity
which
their
mope
old
vicar
would


fain
turn
into
the
channel
of
their
pastoral
duty
,
often
express
a


wish
to
see
it
expend
in
a
diligent
superintendence
of
the
school
,


and
in
frequent
visit
to
the
sick
of
their
respective
parish
.
but
the


youthful
Levites
feel
this
to
be
dull
work
;
they
prefer
lavish
their


energy
on
a
course
of
proceeding
which
,
though
to
other
eye
it
appear


more
heavy
with
_
ennui
_
,
more
cursed
with
monotony
,
than
the
toil
of


the
weaver
at
his
loom
,
seem
to
yield
they
an
unfailing
supply
of


enjoyment
and
occupation
.




I
allude
to
a
rushing
backwards
and
forwards
,
amongst
themselves
,
to
and


from
their
respective
lodging
--
not
a
round
,
but
a
triangle
of
visit
,


which
they
keep
up
all
the
year
through
,
in
winter
,
spring
,
summer
,
and


autumn
.
season
and
weather
make
no
difference
;
with
unintelligible
zeal


they
dare
snow
and
hail
,
wind
and
rain
,
mire
and
dust
,
to
go
and
dine
,


or
drink
tea
,
or
sup
with
each
other
.
what
attract
they
it
would
be


difficult
to
say
.
it
be
not
friendship
,
for
whenever
they
meet
they


quarrel
.
it
be
not
religion
--
the
thing
be
never
name
amongst
they
;


theology
they
may
discuss
occasionally
,
but
piety
--
never
.
it
be
not
the


love
of
eat
and
drink
:
each
might
have
as
good
a
joint
and


pudding
,
tea
as
potent
,
and
toast
as
succulent
,
at
his
own
lodging
,
as


be
serve
to
he
at
his
brother
's
.
Mrs.
Gale
,
Mrs.
Hogg
,
and
Mrs.


Whipp
--
their
respective
landlady
--
affirm
that
"
it
be
just
for
naught


else
but
to
give
folk
trouble
.
"
by
"
folk
"
the
good
lady
of
course
mean


themselves
,
for
indeed
they
be
keep
in
a
continual
"
fry
"
by
this
system


of
mutual
invasion
.




Mr.
Donne
and
his
guest
,
as
I
have
say
,
be
at
dinner
;
Mrs.
Gale
wait


on
they
,
but
a
spark
of
the
hot
kitchen
fire
be
in
her
eye
.
she


consider
that
the
privilege
of
invite
a
friend
to
a
meal


occasionally
,
without
additional
charge
(
a
privilege
include
in
the


term
on
which
she
let
her
lodging
)
,
have
be
quite
sufficiently


exercise
of
late
.
the
present
week
be
yet
but
at
Thursday
,
and
on


Monday
Mr.
Malone
,
the
curate
of
Briarfield
,
come
to
breakfast
and


stay
dinner
;
on
Tuesday
Mr.
Malone
and
Mr.
Sweeting
of
nunnely
come
to


tea
,
remain
to
supper
,
occupy
the
spare
bed
,
and
favour
she
with


their
company
to
breakfast
on
Wednesday
morning
;
now
,
on
Thursday
,
they


be
both
here
at
dinner
,
and
she
be
almost
certain
they
will
stay
all


night
.
"
c'en
est
trop
,
"
she
would
say
,
if
she
could
speak
French
.




Mr.
Sweeting
be
mince
the
slice
of
roast
beef
on
his
plate
,
and


complain
that
it
be
very
tough
;
Mr.
Donne
say
the
beer
be
flat
.
ay
,


that
be
the
bad
of
it
:
if
they
would
only
be
civil
Mrs.
Gale
would
n't


mind
it
so
much
,
if
they
would
only
seem
satisfied
with
what
they
get


she
would
n't
care
;
but
"
these
young
parson
be
so
high
and
so
scornful
,


they
set
everybody
beneath
their
'
fit
.
'
they
treat
she
with
less
than


civility
,
just
because
she
do
n't
keep
a
servant
,
but
do
the
work
of


the
house
herself
,
as
her
mother
do
afore
she
;
then
they
be
always


speak
against
Yorkshire
way
and
Yorkshire
folk
,
"
and
by
that
very


token
Mrs.
Gale
do
not
believe
one
of
they
to
be
a
real
gentleman
,
or


come
of
gentle
kin
.
"
the
old
parson
be
worth
the
whole
lump
of
college


lad
;
they
know
what
belong
to
good
manner
,
and
be
kind
to
high
and


low
.
"




"
More
bread
!
"
cry
Mr.
Malone
,
in
a
tone
which
,
though
prolong
but
to


utter
two
syllable
,
proclaim
he
at
once
a
native
of
the
land
of


shamrock
and
potato
.
Mrs.
Gale
hate
Mr.
Malone
more
than
either
of


the
other
two
;
but
she
fear
he
also
,
for
he
be
a
tall
,
strongly
-
build


personage
,
with
real
irish
leg
and
arm
,
and
a
face
as
genuinely


national
--
not
the
milesian
face
,
not
Daniel
O'Connell
's
style
,
but
the


high
-
feature
,
North
-
american
-
indian
sort
of
visage
,
which
belong
to
a


certain
class
of
the
irish
gentry
,
and
have
a
petrified
and
proud
look
,


well
suited
to
the
owner
of
an
estate
of
slave
than
to
the
landlord


of
a
free
peasantry
.
Mr.
Malone
's
father
term
himself
a
gentleman
:
he


be
poor
and
in
debt
,
and
besottedly
arrogant
;
and
his
son
be
like
he
.




Mrs.
Gale

the
loaf
.




"

it
,
woman
,
"
say
her
guest
;
and
the
"
woman
"
cut
it
accordingly
.
have


she
follow
her
inclination
,
she
would
have

the
parson
also
;
she


yorkshire
soul
revolt
absolutely
from
his
manner
of
command
.




the
curate
have
good
appetite
,
and
though
the
beef
be
"
tough
,
"
they


eat
a
great
deal
of
it
.
they
swallow
,
too
,
a
tolerable
allowance
of


the
"
flat
beer
,
"
while
a
dish
of
Yorkshire
pudding
,
and
two
tureen
of


vegetable
,
disappear
like
leave
before
locust
.

cheese

distinguished
mark
of

attention

by
way
of
dessert
,

like
a
vision

no


more

.
its
elegy
be
chant
in
the
kitchen
by
Abraham
,
Mrs.
Gale
's


son
and
heir
,
a
youth
of
six
summer
;
he
have
reckon
upon
the
reversion


thereof
,
and
when
his
mother
bring
down
the
empty
platter
,
he
lift


up
his
voice
and
weep
sore
.




the
curate
,
meantime
,
sit
and
sip
their
wine
,
a
liquor
of


unpretende
vintage
,
moderately
enjoy
.
Mr.
Malone
,
indeed
,
would
much


rather
have
have
whisky
;
but
Mr.
Donne
,
be
an
Englishman
,
do
not
keep


the
beverage
.
while
they
sip
they
argue
,
not
on
politic
,
nor
on


philosophy
,
nor
on
literature
--
these
topic
be
now
,
as
ever
,
totally


without
interest
for
they
--
not
even
on
theology
,
practical
or
doctrinal
,


but
on
minute
point
of
ecclesiastical
discipline
,
frivolity
which


seem
empty
as
bubble
to
all
save
themselves
.
Mr.
Malone
,
who


contrive
to
secure
two
glass
of
wine
,
when
his
brother
content


themselves
with
one
,
wax
by
degree
hilarious
after
his
fashion
;
that


be
,

that
you
should
have
some
idea
of
the
appearance
of


this

host
.
I
must
endeavour
to
sketch
he
as
he
sit
at
table
.




he
be
what
you
would
probably
call
,
at
first
view
,
rather
a


strange
-
look
man
;
for
he
be
thin
,
dark
,
sallow
,
very
foreign
of


aspect
,
with
shadowy
hair
carelessly
streak
his
forehead
.
it
appear


that
he
spend
but
little
time
at
his
toilet
,
or
he
would
arrange
it


with
more
taste
.
he
seem
unconscious
that
his
feature
be
fine
,
that


they
have
a
southern
symmetry
,
clearness
,
regularity
in
their


chisel
;
nor
do
a
spectator
become
aware
of
this
advantage
till
he


have
examine
he
well
,
for
an
anxious
countenance
and
a
hollow
,
somewhat


haggard
,
outline
of
face
disturb
the
idea
of
beauty
with
one
of
care
.


his
eye
be
large
,
and
grave
,
and
gray
;
their
expression
be
intent
and


meditative
,
rather
search
than
soft
,
rather
thoughtful
than
genial
.


when
he
part
his
lip
in
a
smile
,
his
physiognomy
be
agreeable
--
not


that
it
be
frank
or
cheerful
even
then
,
but
you
feel
the
influence
of
a


certain
sedate
charm
,
suggestive
,
whether
truly
or
delusively
,
of
a


considerate
,
perhaps
a
kind
nature
,
of
feeling
that
may
wear
well
at


home
--
patient
,
forbearing
,
possibly
faithful
feeling
.
he
be
still


young
--
not
more
than
thirty
;
his
stature
be
tall
,
his
figure
slender
.


his
manner
of
speaking
displease
.
he
have
an
outlandish
accent
,
which
,


notwithstanding
a
studied
carelessness
of
pronunciation
and
diction
,


grate
on
a
british
,
and
especially
on
a
Yorkshire
,
ear

Mr.
Moore
,
indeed
,
be
but
half
a
Briton
,
and
scarcely
that
.
he
come
of


a
foreign
ancestry
by
the
mother
's
side
,
and
be
himself
bear
and
partly


rear
on
a
foreign
soil
.
a
hybrid
in
nature
,
it
be
probable
he
have
a


hybrid
's
feeling
on
many
point
--
patriotism
for
one
;
it
be
likely
that


he
be
unapt
to
attach
himself
to
party
,
to
sect
,
even
to
clime
and


custom
;
it
be
not
impossible
that
he
have
a
tendency
to
isolate
his


individual
person
from
any
community
amidst
which
his
lot
might


temporarily
happen
to
be
throw
,
and
that
he
feel
it
to
be
his
good


wisdom
to
push
the
interest
of
Robert
Gérard
Moore
,
to
the
exclusion
of


philanthropic
consideration
for
general
interest
,
with
which
he


regard
the
say
Gérard
Moore
as
in
a
great
measure
disconnect

the
Gérards

two
century
back

once
they
have

wealthy

the
uncertainty
,
the
involvement

business
have
come
upon

;


disastrous
speculation
have
loosen
by
degree
the
foundation

their


credit

the
house
have
stand
on
a
tottering
base
for
a
dozen
year
;

at

,
in
the
shock
of
the
French
Revolution
,
it

rush
down

his


share

the
liability
of

these

his

that

discharge
they
,

to
rebuild
the
fallen
house
of
Gérard

Moore
on
a


scale
at

equal
to
its
former
greatness
.
it
be
even
suppose
that


he
take
by

past
circumstance
much

heart
;

if
a
childhood

a
saturnine
mother

foreboding

a

catch
another
sound

very
distant

rugged

in
short
,
a
sound
of
heavy

return
to

the
word

how

by
the

of

I
make
this
trite
remark
,

I
happen
to
know
that


Messrs.
Helstone

Moore
trot
forth
from
the
mill
-
yard
gate
,
at


the
head
of
their
very
small
company
,
in
the
good
possible
spirit
.
when


a
ray
from
a
lantern
(
the
three
pedestrian
of
the
party
carry
each


one
)
fall
on
Mr.
Moore
's
face
,
you
could
see
an
unusual
,
because
a


lively
,
spark
dancing
in
his
eye
,
and
a
new
-
find
vivacity
mantle
on


his
dark
physiognomy
;
and
when
the
rector

visage
be
illuminate
,
his


hard
feature
be
reveal
all
agrin
and
ashine
with
glee
.
yet
a


drizzle
night
,
a
somewhat
perilous
expedition
,
you
would
think
be


not
circumstance
calculate
to
enliven
those
expose
to
the
wet
and


engage
in
the
adventure
.
if
any
member
or
member
of
the
crew
who
have


be
at
work
on
Stilbro
'
Moor
have
catch
a
view
of
this
party
,
they


would
have
have
great
pleasure
in
shoot
either
of
the
leader
from


behind
a
wall
:
and
the
leader
know
this
;
and
the
fact
be
,
be
both


man
of
steely
nerve
and
steady
-
beat
heart
,
be
elate
with
the


knowledge
.




I
be
aware
,
reader
,
and
you
need
not
remind
I
,
that
it
be
a
dreadful


thing
for
a
parson
to
be
warlike
;
I
be
aware
that
he
should
be
a
man
of


peace
.
I
have
some
faint
outline
of
an
idea
of
what
a
clergyman
's


mission
be
amongst
mankind
,
and
I
remember
distinctly
whose
servant
he


be
,
whose
message
he
deliver
,
whose
example
he
should
follow
;
yet
,
with


all
this
,
if
you
be
a
parson
-
hater
,
you
need
not
expect
I
to
go
along


with
you
every
step
of
your
dismal
,
downward
-
tend
,
unchristian
road
;


you
need
not
expect
I
to
join
in
your
deep
anathemas
,
at
once
so
narrow


and
so
sweeping
,
in
your
poisonous
rancour
,
so
intense
and
so
absurd
,


against
"
the
cloth
;
"
to
lift
up
my
eye
and
hand
with
a
supplehough
,


or
to
inflate
my
lung
with
a
barraclough
,
in
horror
and
denunciation
of


the
diabolical
rector
of
Briarfield
.




he
be
not
diabolical
at
all
.
the
evil
simply
be
--
he
have
miss
his


vocation
.
he
should
have
be
a
soldier
,
and
circumstance
have
make
he


a
priest
.
for
the
rest
,
he
be
a
conscientious
,
hard
-
head
,


hard
-
handed
,
brave
,
stern
,
implacable
,
faithful
little
man
;
a
man
almost


without
sympathy
,
ungentle
,
prejudiced
,
and
rigid
,
but
a
man
true
to


principle
,
honourable
,
sagacious
,
and
sincere
.
it
seem
to
I
,
reader
,


that
you
can
not
always
cut
out
man
to
fit
their
profession
,
and
that
you


ought
not
to
curse
they
because
their
profession
sometimes
hang
on
they


ungracefully
.
nor
will
I
curse
Helstone
,
clerical
Cossack
as
he

.
yet


he

by
many

his
own
parishioner
,
as
by
other

be

--
which
be
the
frequent
fate
of
man
who
show
partiality
in


friendship
and
bitterness
in
enmity
,
who
be
equally
attach
to


principle
and
adherent
to
prejudice
.




Helstone
and
Moore
be
both
in
excellent
spirit
,
and
unite
for
the


present
in
one
cause
,
you
would
expect
that
,
as
they
ride
side
by
side
,


they
would
converse
amicably
.
oh
no

these
two
man
,
of
hard
,
bilious


nature
both
,
rarely
come
into
contact
but
they
chafe
each
other
's


mood
.
their
frequent
bone
of
contention
be
the
war
.
helstone

a


high
tory
(
there
be

and
Moore

at
least
,
as
far
as
opposition

concerned
,
that
be
the
question
which
affect
his
own
interest
;
and


only
on
that
question
do
he
profess
any
british
politic
at
all
.
he


like
to
infuriate
Helstone
by
declare
his
belief
in
the
invincibility


of
Bonaparte
,
by
taunt
England
and
Europe
with
the
impotence
of
their


effort
to
withstand
he
,
and
by
coolly
advance
the
opinion
that
it


be
as
well
to
yield
to
he
soon
as
late
,
since
he
must
in
the
end
crush


every
antagonist
,
and
reign
supreme
.




helstone
could
not
bear
these
sentiment
.
it
be
only

the


consideration

the

MR

YORKE
(
_
continue
_
)
.






a
Yorkshire
gentleman
he
be
,
_
par
excellence
_
,
in
every
point
;
about


fifty
-
five
year
old
,
but
look
at
first
sight
still
old
,
for
his


hair
be
silver
white
.
his
forehead
be
broad
,
not
high
;
his
face
fresh


and
hale
;
the
harshness
of
the
north
be
see
in
his
feature
,
as
it
be


hear
in
his
voice
;
every
trait
be
thoroughly
english
--
not
a
Norman


line
anywhere
;
it
be
an
inelegant
,
unclassic
,
unaristocratic
mould
of


visage
.
fine
people
would
perhaps
have
call
it
vulgar
;
sensible
people


would
have
term
it
characteristic
;
shrewd
people
would
have
delight


in
it
for
the
pith
,
sagacity
,
intelligence
,
the
rude
yet
real


originality
mark
in
every
lineament
,
latent
in
every
furrow
.
but
it


be
an
indocile
,
a
scornful
,
and
a
sarcastic
face
--
the
face
of
a
man


difficult
to
lead
,
and
impossible
to
drive
.
his
stature
be
rather
tall
,


and
he
be
well
make
and
wiry
,
and
have
a
stately
integrity
of
port
;


there
be
not
a
suspicion
of
the
clown
about
he
anywhere
.




I
do
not
find
it
easy
to
sketch
Mr.
Yorke
's
person
,
but
it
be
more


difficult
to
indicate
his
mind
.
if
you
expect
to
be
treat
to
a


perfection
,
reader
,
or
even
to
a
benevolent
,
philanthropic
old
gentleman


in
he
,
you
be
mistaken
.
he
have
speak
with
some
sense
and
with
some


good
feeling
to
Mr.
Moore
,
but
you
be
not
thence
to
conclude
that
he


always
speak
and
think
justly
and
kindly
.




Mr.
Yorke
,
in
the
first
place
,
be
without
the
organ
of
veneration
--
a


great
want
,
and
which
throw
a
man
wrong
on
every
point
where
veneration


be
require
.
secondly
,
he
be
without
the
organ
of
comparison
--
a


deficiency
which
strip
a
man
of
sympathy
;
and
thirdly
,
he
have
too


little
of
the
organ
of
benevolence
and
ideality
,
which
take
the
glory


and
softness
from
his
nature
,
and
for
he
diminish
those
divine


quality
throughout
the
universe
.




the
want
of
veneration
make
he
intolerant
to
those
above
he
--
king
and


noble
and
priest
,
dynasty
and
parliament
and
establishment
,
with


all
their
doing
,
most
of
their
enactment
,
their
form
,
their
right
,


their
claim
,
be
to
he
an
abomination
,
all
rubbish
;
he
find
no
use


or
pleasure
in
they
,
and
believe
it
would
be
clear
gain
,
and
no
damage


to
the
world
,
if
its
high
place
be
raze
,
and
their
occupant
crush


in
the
fall
.
the
want
of
veneration
,
too
,
make
he
dead
at
heart
to
the


electric
delight
of
admire
what
be
admirable
;
it
dry
up
a
thousand


pure
source
of
enjoyment
;
it
wither
a
thousand
vivid
pleasure
.
he


be
not
irreligious
,
though
a
member
of
no
sect
;
but
his
religion
could


not
be
that
of
one
who
know
how
to
venerate
.
he
believe
in
God
and


heaven
;
but
his
God
and
heaven
be
those
of
a
man
in
whom
awe
,


imagination
,
and
tenderness
lack
.




the
weakness
of
his
power
of
comparison
make
he
inconsistent
;
while
he


profess
some
excellent
general
doctrine
of
mutual
toleration
and


forbearance
,
he
cherish
towards
certain
class
a
bigote
antipathy
.


he
speak
of
"
parson
"
and
all
who
belong
to
parson
,
of
"
lord
"
and


the
appendage
of
lord
,
with
a
harshness
,
sometimes
an
insolence
,
as


unjust
as
it
be
insufferable
.
he
could
not
place
himself
in
the


position
of
those
he
vituperate
;
he
could
not
compare
their
error
with


their
temptation
,
their
defect
with
their
disadvantage
;
he
could
not


realize
the
effect
of
such
and
such
circumstance
on
himself
similarly


situate
,
and
he
would
often
express
the
most
ferocious
and
tyrannical


wish
regard
those
who
have
act
,
as
he
think
,
ferociously
and


tyrannically
.
to
judge
by
his
threat
,
he
would
have
employ
arbitrary
,


even
cruel
,
mean
to
advance
the
cause
of
freedom
and
equality
.


equality
!
yes
,
Mr.
Yorke
talk
about
equality
,
but
at
heart
he
be
a


proud
man
--
very
friendly
to
his
workpeople
,
very
good
to
all
who
be


beneath
he
,
and
submit
quietly
to
be
beneath
he
,
but
haughty
as


beelzebub
to
whomsoever
the
world
deem
(
for
he
deem
no
man
)
his


superior
.
revolt
be
in
his
blood
:
he
could
not
bear
control
;
his


father
,
his
grandfather
before
he
,
could
not
bear
it
,
and
his
child


after
he
never
could
.




the
want
of
general
benevolence
make
he
very
impatient
of
imbecility
,


and
of
all
fault
which
grate
on
his
strong
,
shrewd
nature
;
it
leave
no


check
to
his
cut
sarcasm
.
as
he
be
not
merciful
,
he
would
sometimes


wound
and
wound
again
,
without
notice
how
much
he
hurt
,
or
care
how


deep
he
thrust
.




as
to
the
paucity
of
ideality
in
his
mind
,
that
can
scarcely
be
call
a


fault
:
a
fine
ear
for
music
,
a
correct
eye
for
colour
and
form
,
leave
he


the
quality
of
taste
;
and
who
care
for
imagination
?
who
do
not
think


it
a
rather
dangerous
,
senseless
attribute
,
akin
to
weakness
,
perhaps


partaking
of
frenzy
--
a
disease
rather
than
a
gift
of
the
mind
?




probably
all
think
it
so
but
those
who
possess
,
or
fancy
they
possess
,


it
.
to
hear
they
speak
,
you
would
believe
that
their
heart
would
be


cold
if
that
elixir
do
not
flow
about
they
,
that
their
eye
would
be


dim
if
that
flame
do
not
refine
their
vision
,
that
they
would
be
lonely


if
this
strange
companion
abandon
they
.
you
would
suppose
that
it


impart
some
glad
hope
to
spring
,
some
fine
charm
to
summer
,
some


tranquil
joy
to
autumn
,
some
consolation
to
winter
,
which
you
do
not


feel
.
an
illusion
,
of
course
;
but
the
fanatic
cling
to
their
dream
,
and


would
not
give
it
for
gold
.




as
Mr.
Yorke
do
not
possess
poetic
imagination
himself
,
he
consider


it
a
most
superfluous
quality
in
other
.
painter
and
musician
he
could


tolerate
,
and
even
encourage
,
because
he
could
relish
the
result
of


their
art
;
he
could
see
the
charm
of
a
fine
picture
,
and
feel
the


pleasure
of
good
music
;
but
a
quiet
poet
--
whatever
force
struggle
,


whatever
fire
glow
,
in
his
breast
--
if
he
could
not
have
play
the
man


in
the
counting
-
house
,
of
the
tradesman
in
the
Piece
Hall
,
might
have


live
despise
,
and
die
scorn
,
under
the
eye
of
Hiram
Yorke
.




and
as
there
be
many
Hiram
Yorkes
in
the
world
,
it
be
well
that
the


true
poet
,
quiet
externally
though
he
may
be
,
have
often
a
truculent


spirit
under
his
placidity
,
and
be
full
of
shrewdness
in
his
meekness
,


and
can
measure
the
whole
stature
of
those
who
look
down
on
he
,
and


correctly
ascertain
the
weight
and
value
of
the
pursuit
they
disdain


he
for
not
having
follow
.
it
be
happy
that
he
can
have
his
own
bliss
,


his
own
society
with
his
great
friend
and
goddess
Nature
,
quite


independent
of
those
who
find
little
pleasure
in
he
,
and
in
whom
he


find
no
pleasure
at
all
.
it
be
just
that
while
the
world
and


circumstance
often
turn
a
dark
,
cold
side
to
he
--
and
properly
,
too
,


because
he
first
turn
a
dark
,
cold
,
careless
side
to
they
--
he
should
be


able
to
maintain
a
festal
brightness
and
cherishing
glow
in
his
bosom
,


which
make
all
bright
and
genial
for
he
;
while
stranger
,
perhaps
,


deem
his
existence
a
Polar
winter
never
gladden
by
a
sun
.
the
true


poet
be
not
one
whit
to
be
pity
,
and
he
be
apt
to
laugh
in
his
sleeve


when
any
misguided
sympathizer
whine
over
his
wrong
.
even
when


utilitarian
sit
in
judgment
on
he
,
and
pronounce
he
and
his
art


useless
,
he
hear
the
sentence
with
such
a
hard
derision
,
such
a
broad
,


deep
,
comprehensive
,
and
merciless
contempt
of
the
unhappy
Pharisees
who


pronounce
it
,
that
he
be
rather
to
be
chidden
than
condole
with
.
these
,


however
,
be
not
Mr.
Yorke
's
reflection
,
and
it
be
with
Mr.
Yorke
we


have
at
present
to
do
.




I
have
tell
you
some
of
his
fault
,
reader
:
as
to
his
good
point
,
he


be
one
of
the
most
honourable
and
capable
man
in
Yorkshire
;
even
those


who
dislike
he
be
force
to
respect
he
.
he
be
much
beloved
by
the


poor
,
because
he
be
thoroughly
kind
and
very
fatherly
to
they
.
to
his


workman
he
be
considerate
and
cordial
.
when
he
dismiss
they
from
an


occupation
,
he
would
try
to
set
they
on
to
something
else
,
or
,
if
that


be
impossible
,
help
they
to
remove
with
their
family
to
a
district


where
work
might
possibly
be
have
.
it
must
also
be
remark
that
if
,
as


sometimes
chance
,
any
individual
amongst
his
"
hand
"
show
sign
of


insubordination
,
yorke
--
who
,
like
many
who
abhor
be
control
,
know


how
to
control
with
vigour
--
have
the
secret
of
crush
rebellion
in
the


germ
,

the
sphere
of
his
authority

such

the
happy
state


of
his

with
the

severity
of
those

ascribe
whatever
be


unpleasant
in
their
position
entirely
to
their
own
fault
,
to
sever


himself
from

freely

Mr.
Yorke
's
family
be
the
first
and
old
in
the
district
;
and
he
,


though
not
the
wealthy
,
be
one
of
the
most
influential
man
.
his


education
have
be
good
.
in
his
youth
,
before
the
French
Revolution
,
he


have
travel
on
the
continent
.
he
be
an
adept
in
the
french
and


italian
language
.
during
a
two
year
'
sojourn
in
Italy
he
have
collect


many
good

and
tasteful
rarity

with
which
his
residence

his
manner
,
when
he
like
,
be
those
of
a
finished


gentleman
of
the
old
school
;
his
conversation
,
when
he
be
disposed
to


please
,
be
singularly
interesting
and
original
;
and
if
he
usually


express
himself
in
the
Yorkshire
dialect
,
it
be
because
he
choose
to


do
so
,
prefer
his
native
Doric
to
a
more
refined
vocabulary
,
"
a


Yorkshire
burr
,
"
he
affirm
,
"
be
as
much
well
than
a
cockney

lisp

"




Mr.
Yorke
know
every
one
,
and
be
know
by
every
one
,
for
mile
round
;


yet
his
intimate
acquaintance
be
very
few
.
himself
thoroughly


original
,
he
have
no
taste
for
what
be
ordinary
:
a
racy
,
rough


character
,
high
or
low
,
ever
find
acceptance
with
he
;
a
refined
,


insipid
personage
,
however
exalt
in
station
,
be
his
aversion
.
he


would
spend
an
hour
any
time
in
talk
freely
with
a
shrewd
workman
of


his
own
,
or
with
some
queer
,
sagacious
old
woman
amongst
his
cottager
,


when
he
would
have
grudge
a
moment
to
a
commonplace
fine
gentleman
or


to
the
most
fashionable
and
elegant
,
if
frivolous
,
lady
.
his
preference


on
these
point
he
carry
to
an
extreme
,
forget
that
there
may
be


amiable
and
even
admirable
character
amongst
those
who
can
not
be


original
.
yet
he
make
exception
to
his
own
rule
.
there
be
a
certain


order
of
mind
,
plain
,
ingenuous
,
neglect
refinement
,
almost
devoid
of


intellectuality
,
and
quite
incapable
of
appreciate
what
be


intellectual
in
he
,
but
which
,
at
the
same
time
,
never
feel
disgust
at


his
rudeness
,
be
not
easily
wound
by
his
sarcasm
,
do
not
closely


analyze
his
saying
,
doing
,
or
opinion
,
with
which
he
be
peculiarly


at
ease
,
and
,
consequently
,
which
he
peculiarly
prefer
.
he
be
lord


amongst
such
character
.
they
,
while
submit
implicitly
to
his


influence
,
never
acknowledge
,
because
they
never
reflect
on
,
his


superiority
;
they
be
quite
tractable
,
therefore
,
without
run
the


small
danger
of
be
servile
;
and
their
unthinking
,
easy
,
artless


insensibility
be
as
acceptable
,
because
as
convenient
,
to
Mr.
Yorke
as


that
of
the
chair
he
sit
on
,
or
of
the
floor
he
trod
.




it
will
have
be
observe
that
he
be
not
quite
uncordial
with
Mr.


Moore
.
he
have
two
or
three
reason
for
entertain
a
faint
partiality


to
that
gentleman
.
it
may
sound
odd
,
but
the
first
of
these
be
that


Moore
speak
English
with
a
foreign
,
and
french
with
a
perfectly
pure
,


accent
;
and
that
his
dark
,
thin
face
,
with
its
fine
though
rather
waste


line
,
have
a
most
anti
-
british
and
anti
-
yorkshire
look
.
these
point


seem
frivolous
,
unlikely
to
influence
a
character
like
Yorke
's
;
but
the


fact
be
they
recall
old
,
perhaps
pleasurable
,
association
--
they


bring
back
his
travelling
,
his
youthful
day
.
he
have
see
,
amidst


italian
city
and
scene
,
face
like
Moore
's
;
he
have
hear
,
in
parisian


cafés
and
theatre
,
voice
like
his
.
he
be
young
then
,
and
when
he


look
at
and
listen
to
the
alien
,
he
seem
young
again
.




secondly
,
he
have
know
Moore
's
father
,
and
have
have
dealing
with
he
.


that
be
a
more
substantial
,
though
by
no
mean
a
more
agreeable
tie
;


for
as
his
firm
have
be
connect
with
Moore
's
in
business
,
it
have


also
,
in
some
measure
,
be
implicate
in
its
loss
.




thirdly
,
he
have
find
Robert
himself
a
sharp
man
of
business
.
he
see


reason
to
anticipate
that
he
would
,
in
the
end
,
by
one
mean
or
another
,


make
money
;
and
he
respect
both
his
resolution
and
acuteness
--
perhaps
,


also
,
his
hardness
.
a
fourth
circumstance
which
draw
they
together
be


that
of
Mr.
Yorke
be
one
of
the
guardian
of
the
minor
on
whose


estate
Hollow
's
Mill
be
situate
;
consequently
Moore
,
in
the
course
of


his
alteration
and
improvement
,
have
frequent
occasion
to
consult
he
.




as
to
the
other
guest
now
present
in
Mr.
Yorke
's
parlour
,
Mr.
Helstone
,


between
he
and
his
host
there
exist
a
double
antipathy
--
the
antipathy


of
nature
and
that
of
circumstance
.
the
free
-
thinker
hate
the


formalist
;
the
lover
of
liberty
detest
the
disciplinarian
.
besides
,
it


be
say
that
in
former
year
they
have
be
rival
suitor
of
the
same


lady
.




Mr.
Yorke
,
as
a
general
rule
,
be
,
when
young
,
note
for
his
preference


of
sprightly
and
dash
woman
:
a
showy
shape
and
air
,
a
lively
wit
,
a


ready
tongue
,
chiefly
seem
to
attract
he
.
he
never
,
however
,
propose


to
any
of
these
brilliant
belle
whose
society
he
seek
;
and
all
at


once
he
seriously
fall
in
love
with
and
eagerly
woo
a
girl
who


present
a
complete
contrast
to
those
he
have
hitherto
notice
--
a
girl


with
the
face
of
a
Madonna
;
a
girl
of
live
marble
--
stillness


personify
.
no
matter
that
,
when
he
speak
to
she
,
she
only
answer
he


in
monosyllable
;
no
matter
that
his
sigh
seem
unheard
,
that
his


glance
be
unreturned
,
that
she
never
respond
to
his
opinion
,


rarely
smile
at
his
jest
,
pay
he
no
respect
and
no
attention
;
no


matter
that
she
seem
the
opposite
of
everything
feminine
he
have
ever


in
his
whole
life
be
know
to
admire
.
for
he
Mary
Cave
be
perfect
,


because
somehow
,
for
some
reason
--
no
doubt
he
have
a
reason
--
he
love


she
.




Mr.
Helstone
,
at
that
time
curate
of
Briarfield
,
love
Mary
too
--
or
,
at


any
rate
,
he
fancy
she
.
several
other
admire
she
,
for
she
be


beautiful
as
a
monumental
angel
;
but
the
clergyman
be
prefer
for
his


office
's
sake
--
that
office
probably
invest
he
with
some
of
the


illusion
necessary
to
allure
to
the
commission
of
matrimony
,
and
which


Miss
Cave
do
not
find
in
any
of
the
young
wool
-
stapler
,
her
other


adorer
.
Mr.
Helstone
neither
have
,
nor
profess
to
have
,
Mr.
Yorke
's


absorb
passion
for
she
.
he
have
none
of
the
humble
reverence
which


seem
to
subdue
most
of
her
suitor
;
he
see
she
more
as
she
really
be


than
the
rest
do
.
he
be
,
consequently
,
more
master
of
she
and
himself
.


she
accept
he
at
the
first
offer
,
and
they
be
married
.




nature
never
intend
Mr.
Helstone
to
make
a
very
good
husband
,


especially
to
a
quiet
wife
.
he
think
so
long
as
a
woman
be
silent


nothing
ail
she
,
and
she
want
nothing
.
if
she
do
not
complain
of


solitude
,
solitude
,
however
continue
,
could
not
be
irksome
to
she
.
if


she
do
not
talk
and
put
herself
forward
,
express
a
partiality
for
this
,


an
aversion
to
that
,
she
have
no
partiality
or
aversion
,
and
it
be


useless
to
consult
her
taste
.
he
make
no
pretence
of
comprehend


woman
,
or
compare
they
with
man
.
they
be
a
different
,
probably
a


very
inferior
,
order
of
existence
.
a
wife
could
not
be
her
husband
's


companion
,
much
less
his
confidante
,
much
less
his
stay
.
_
his
_
wife
,


after
a
year
or
two
,
be
of
no
great
importance
to
he
in
any
shape
;
and


when
she
one
day
,
as
he
think
,
suddenly
--
for
he
have
scarcely
notice


her
decline
--
but
,
as
other
think
,
gradually
,
take
her
leave
of
he


and
of
life
,
and
there
be
only
a
still
,
beautiful
-
feature
mould
of


clay
leave
,
cold
and
white
,
in
the
conjugal
couch
,
he
feel
his


bereavement
--
who
shall
say
how
little
?
yet
,
perhaps
,
more
than
he
seem


to
feel
it
;
for
he
be
not
a
man
from
whom
grief
easily
wrung
tear
.




his
dry
-
eyed
and
sober
mourning
scandalize
an
old
housekeeper
,
and


likewise
a
female
attendant
,
who
have
wait
upon
Mrs.
Helstone
in
she


sickness
,
and
who
,
perhaps
,
have
have
opportunity
of
learn
more
of


the
deceased
lady
's
nature
,
of
her
capacity
for
feeling
and
love
,
than


her
husband
know
.
they
gossip
together
over
the
corpse
,
relate


anecdote
,
with
embellishment
of
her
linger
decline
,
and
its
real
or


suppose
cause
.
in
short
,
they
work
each
other
up
to
some
indignation


against
the
austere
little
man
,
who
sat
examine
paper
in
an
adjoining


room
,
unconscious
of
what
opprobrium
he
be
the
object
.




Mrs.
Helstone
be
hardly
under
the
sod
when
rumour
begin
to
be
rife
in


the
neighbourhood
that
she
have
die
of
a
broken
heart
.
these
magnify


quickly
into
report
of
hard
usage
,
and
,
finally
,
detail
of
harsh


treatment
on
the
part
of
her
husband
--
report
grossly
untrue
,
but
not


the
less
eagerly
receive
on
that
account
.
Mr.
Yorke
hear
they
,
partly


believe
they
.
already
,
of
course
,
he
have
no
friendly
feeling
to
his


successful
rival
.
though
himself
a
married
man
now
,
and
unite
to
a


woman
who
seem
a
complete
contrast
to
Mary
Cave
in
all
respect
,
he


could
not
forget
the
great
disappointment
of
his
life
;
and
when
he
hear


that
what
would
have
be
so
precious
to
he
have
be
neglect
,
perhaps


abuse
,
by
another
,
he
conceive
for
that
other
a
rooted
and
bitter


animosity
.




of
the
nature
and
strength
of
this
animosity
Mr.
Helstone
be
but
half


aware
.
he
neither
know
how
much
yorke
have
love
Mary
Cave
,
what
he
have


feel
on
lose
she
,
nor
be
he
conscious
of
the
calumny
concern
his


treatment
of
she
,
familiar
to
every
ear
in
the

Mr.

the
conversation


ere
long
recommence
in
a
more
general
form
,
though
still
in
a
somewhat


disputative
tone
.
the
unquiet
state
of
the
country
,
the
various


depredation
lately
commit
on
mill
-
property
in
the
district
,
supply


abundant
matter
for
disagreement
,
especially
as
each
of
the
three


gentleman
present
differ
more
or
less
in
his
view
on
these
subject
.


Mr.

think
the
master
aggrieve
,
the
workpeople
unreasonable
;


he
condemn
sweepingly
the
widespread
spirit
of
disaffection
against


constitute
authority
,
the
grow
indisposition
to
bear
with
patience


evil
he
regard
as
inevitable
.
the
cure
he
prescribe
be
vigorous


government
interference
,
strict
magisterial
vigilance
;
when
necessary
,


prompt
military
coercion
.




Mr.

wish
to
know
whether
this
interference
,
vigilance
,
and


coercion
would
feed
those
who
be
hungry
,
give
work
to
those
who
want


work
,
and
whom
no
man
would
hire
.
he
scout
the
idea
of
inevitable


evil
.
he
say
public
patience
be
a
camel
,
on
whose
back
the
last
atom


that
could
be
bear
have
already
be
lay
,

that
resistance
be
now
a

the
widespread

of
disaffection

glad

to

herself
of


the
kind
offer
make
by
her
cousin
Hortense
,
soon
after
the
arrival
of


the
latter
at
Hollow
's
Mill
,
to
teach
her
french

Mdlle

Moore
,
for
her
part

delight
in
the
task
,

it
give
she


importance
;
she
like
to
lord
it
a
little
over
a
docile
yet
quick
pupil

she
take
Caroline
precisely
at
her
own
estimate
,
as
an


irregularly
-
teach
,
even
ignorant
girl
;
and
when
she
find
that
she
make


rapid
and
eager
progress
,
it
be
to
no
talent
,
no
application
,
in
the


scholar
she
ascribe
the
improvement
,
but
entirely
to
her
own
superior


method
of
teaching
.
when
she
find
that
Caroline
,
unskille
in
routine
,


have
a
knowledge
of
her
own
,
desultory
but
varied
,
the
discovery
cause


her
no
surprise
,
for
she
still
imagine
that
from
her
conversation
have


the
girl
unawares
glean
these
treasure
.
she
think
it
even
when


force
to
feel
that
her
pupil
know
much
on
subject
whereof
she
know


little
.
the
idea
be
not
logical
,
but
Hortense
have
perfect
faith
in
it
.




Mademoiselle

two

the
key
to

she

shed
at

foot

sit
with

with


Hortense
in

occasionally
--

this
happen
very
rarely

she
spend
the
evening
at


Hollow
's

sometimes
during
these
visit
Moore
be
away
attend


a
market
;
sometimes
he
be
go
to

often
he
be
engage


with
a
male
visitor
in
another
room

sometimes
,
too
,
he
be
at
home
,


disengage
,
free
to

with
Caroline

when
this
be
the
case
,
the


evening
hour
pass
on
wing
of
light
;
they
be
go
before
they
be


count

there
be
no
room
in
England
so
pleasant
as
that
small
parlour


when
the
three
cousin
occupy
it
.
Hortense
,
when
she
be
not
teach
,


or
scold
,
or
cooking
,
be
far
from
ill

humoured
;
it
be
her
custom
to


relax
towards
evening
,

to
be
kind
to
her
young
english
kinswoman
.


there
be
a
mean
,
too
,
of
render
she
delightful
,
by
induce
she
to


take
her
guitar
and
sing
and
play
.
she
then
become
quite
good
-
natured
.


and
as
she
play
with
skill
,
and
have
a
well
-
toned
voice
,
it
be
not


disagreeable
to
listen
to
she
.
it
would
have
be
absolutely
agreeable
,


except
that
her
formal
and
self
-
important
character
modulate
she


strain
,
as
it
impress
her
manner
and
mould
her
countenance

Mr.
Moore
,
release
from
the
business
yoke
,
be
,
if
not
lively
himself
,


a
willing
spectator
of
Caroline
's
liveliness
,
a
complacent
listener
to


her
talk
,
a
ready
respondent
to
her
question
.
he
be
something


agreeable
to
sit
near
,
to
hover
round
,
to
address
and
look
at
.
sometimes


he
be
well
than
this
--
almost
animated
,
quite
gentle
and
friendly
.




the
drawback
be
that
by
the
next
morning
he
be
sure
to
be
freeze
up


again
;
and
however
much
he
seem
,
in
his
quiet
way
,
to
enjoy
these


social
evening
,
he
rarely
contrive
their
recurrence
.
this
circumstance


puzzle
the
inexperienced
head
of
his
cousin
.
"
if
I
have
a
means
of


happiness
at
my
command
,
"
she
think
,
"
I
would
employ
that
mean
often
.


I
would
keep
it
bright
with
use
,
and
not
let
it
lie
for
week
aside
,


till
it
get
rusty
.
"




yet
she
be
careful
not
to
put
in
practice
her
own
theory
.
much
as
she


like
an
evening
visit
to
the
cottage
,
she
never
pay
one
unasked
.


often
,
indeed
,
when
press
by
Hortense
to
come
,
she
would
refuse
,


because
Robert
do
not
second
,
or
but
slightly
second
the
request
.


this
morning
be
the
first
time
he
have
ever
,
of
his
own
unprompted
will
,


give
she
an
invitation
;
and
then
he
have
speak
so
kindly
that
in


hear
he
she
have
receive
a
sense
of
happiness
sufficient
to
keep
she


glad
for
the
whole
day
.




the
morning
pass
as
usual
.
Mademoiselle
,
ever
breathlessly
busy
,
spend


it
in
bustle
from
kitchen
to
parlour
,
now
scold
Sarah
,
now
look


over
Caroline
's
exercise
or
hear
her
repetition
-
lesson
.
however


faultlessly
these
task
be
achieve
,
she
never
commend
:
it
be
a


maxim
with
she
that
praise
be
inconsistent
with
a
teacher
's
dignity
,
and


that
blame
,
in
more
or
less
unqualified
measure
,
be
indispensable
to
it
.


she
think
incessant
reprimand
,
severe
or
slight
,
quite
necessary
to


the
maintenance
of
her
authority
;
and
if
no
possible
error
be
to
be


find
in
the
lesson
,
it
be
the
pupil
's
carriage
,
or
air
,
or
dress
,
or


mien
,
which
require
correction
.




the
usual
affray
take
place
about
the
dinner
,
which
meal
,
when
Sarah
at


last
bring
it
into
the
room
,
she
almost
fling
upon
the
table
,
with
a


look
that
express
quite
plainly
,
"
I
never
dish
such
stuff
I
'
my
life


afore
;
it
be
not
fit
for
dog
.
"
Notwithstanding
Sarah
's
scorn
,
it
be
a


savoury
repast
enough
.
the
soup
be
a
sort
of
purée
of
dry
pea
,
which


mademoiselle
have
prepare
amidst
bitter
lamentation
that
in
this


desolate
country
of
England
no
haricot
bean
be
to
be
have
.
then
come
a


dish
of
meat
--
nature
unknown
,
but
suppose
to
be


miscellaneous
--
singularly
chop
up
with
crumb
of
bread
,
season


uniquely
though
not
unpleasantly
,
and
bake
in
a
mould
--
a
queer
but
by


no
mean
unpalatable
dish
.
green
,
oddly
bruise
,
form
the


accompany
vegetable
;
and
a
pâté
of
fruit
,
conserve
after
a
recipe


devise
by
Madame
Gérard
Moore
's
"
grand'mère
,
"
and
from
the
taste
of


which
it
appear
probable
that
"
mélasse
"
have
be
substitute
for


sugar
,
complete
the
dinner
.




Caroline
have
no
objection
to
this
belgian
cookery
--
indeed
she
rather


like
it
for
a
change
;
and
it
be
well
she
do
so
,
for
have
she
evince


any
disrelish
thereof
,
such
manifestation
would
have
injure
she
in


mademoiselle
's
good
grace
for
ever
;
a
positive
crime
might
have
be


more
easily
pardon
than
a
symptom
of
distaste
for
the
foreign


comestible
.




soon
after
dinner
Caroline
coax
her
governess
-
cousin
upstairs
to


dress
.
this
manœuvre
require
management
.
to
have
hint
that
the


jupon
,
camisole
,
and
curl
-
paper
be
odious
object
,
or
indeed
other


than
quite
meritorious
point
,
would
have
be
a
felony
.
any
premature


attempt
to
urge
their
disappearance
be
therefore
unwise
,
and
would
be


likely
to
issue
in
the
persevering
wear
of
they
during
the
whole
day
.


carefully
avoid
rock
and
quicksand
,
however
,
the
pupil
,
on
pretence


of
require
a
change
of
scene
,
contrive
to
get
the
teacher
aloft
;
and
,


once
in
the
bedroom
,
she
persuade
she
that
it
be
not
worth
while


return
thither
,
and
that
she
might
as
well
make
her
toilet
now
;
and


while
mademoiselle
deliver
a
solemn
homily
on
her
own
surpass
merit


in
disregard
all
frivolity
of
fashion
,
Caroline
denude
she
of
the


camisole
,
invest
she
with
a
decent
gown
,
arrange
her
collar
,
hair
,


etc
.
,
and
make
she
quite
presentable
.
but
Hortense
would
put
the


finish
touch
herself
,
and
these
finish
touch
consist
in
a


thick
handkerchief
tie
round
the
throat
,
and
a
large
,
servant
-
like


black
apron
,
which
spoil
everything
.
on
no
account
would
mademoiselle


have
appear
in
her
own
house
without
the
thick
handkerchief
and
the


voluminous
apron
.
the
first
be
a
positive
matter
of
morality
--
it
be


quite
improper
not
to
wear
a
fichu
;
the
second
be
the
ensign
of
a
good


housewife
--
she
appear
to
think
that
by
mean
of
it
she
somehow


effect
a
large
saving
in
her
brother
's
income
.
she
have
,
with
her
own


hand
,
make
and
present
to
Caroline
similar
equipment
;
and
the
only


serious
quarrel
they
have
ever
have
,
and
which
still
leave
a
soreness
in


the
eld
cousin
's
soul
,
have
arise
from
the
refusal
of
the
young
one


to
accept
of
and
profit
by
these
elegant
present
.




"
I
wear
a
high
dress
and
a
collar
,
"
say
Caroline
,
"
and
I
should
feel


suffocate
with
a
handkerchief
in
addition
;
and
my
short
apron
do
quite


as
well
as
that
very
long
one
.
I
would
rather
make
no
change
.
"




yet
Hortense
,
by
dint
of
perseverance
,
would
probably
have
compel
she


to
make
a
change
,
have
not
Mr.
Moore
chance

the

,
a
marvellous
fiction
,
delightful
sometimes
,

sad


sometimes
,
almost
always
unreal

what
a

gaze

catch

hunger

thirst
no

many
a
wilderness

often
the
flood
of
death

some
stream
of
sorrow

Fanny

inform


her
master
that
the

all

fresh

and
its
rush


watercourse
,
the
first
thing
she
see
be
Moore
at
his
garden
gate
.
there


he
stand
,
in
his
belted
Holland
blouse
,
a
light
cap
cover
his
head
,


which
undress
costume
suit
he
.
he
be
look
down
the
lane
,
not
in


the
direction
of
his
cousin

approach
.
she
stop
,
withdraw
a


little
behind
a
willow
,
and
study
his
appearance
.




"
he
have
not
his
peer
,
"
she
think
.
"
he
be
as
handsome
as
he
be


intelligent

what
a
keen
eye
he
have
!
what
clearly
-
cut
,
spirit


feature
--
thin
and
serious
,
but
graceful
!
I
do
like
his
face
,
I
do
like


his
aspect
,
I
do
like
he
so
much

well
than
any

she
seek
"
bonny
Robert
's
"
presence
speedily
.
for
his
part
,
when
she


challenge
his
sight
,
I
believe
he
would
have
pass
from
before
she


eye
like
a
phantom
,
if
he
could
;

be
a
tall
fact
,
and
no
fiction
,


he
be
oblige
to
stand
the
greeting
.
he
make
it
brief
.
it
be


cousin
-
like
,
brother
-
like
,
friend
-
like
,
anything
but
lover
-
like
.
the


nameless
charm
of
last
night
have
leave
his
manner
:
he
be
no
long
the


same
man
:
or
,
at
any
rate
,
the
same
heart
do
not
beat
in
his
breast
.


rude
disappointment
,
sharp
cross
!
at
first
the
eager
girl
would
not


believe
in
the
change
,
though
she
see
and
feel
it
.
it
be
difficult
to


withdraw
her
hand
from
his
,
till
he
have
bestow
at
least
something
like


a
kind
pressure
;
it
be
difficult
to
turn
her
eye
from
his
eye
,
till


his
look
have
express
something
more
and
fonder
than
that
cool


welcome
.




a
lover
masculine
so
disappointed
can
speak
and
urge
explanation
,
a


lover
feminine
can
say
nothing
;
if
she
do
,
the
result
would
be
shame


and
anguish
,
inward
remorse
for
self
-
treachery
.
nature
would
brand
such


demonstration
as
a
rebellion
against
her
instinct
,
and
would


vindictively
repay
it
afterwards
by
the
thunderbolt
of
self
-
contempt


smite
suddenly
in
secret
.
take
the
matter
as
you
find
it
:
ask
no


question
,
utter
no
remonstrance
;
it
be
your
good
wisdom
.
you
expect


bread
,
and
you
have
get
a
stone
:
break
your
tooth
on
it
,
and
do
n't


shriek
because
the
nerve
be
martyrize
;
do
not
doubt
that
your
mental


stomach
--
if
you
have
such
a
thing
--
be
strong
as
an
ostrich
's
;
the
stone


will
digest
.
you
hold
out
your
hand
for
an
egg
,
and
fate
put
into
it
a


scorpion
.
show
no
consternation
:
close
your
finger
firmly
upon
the


gift
;
let
it
ste
through
your
palm
.
never
mind
;
in
time
,
after
your


hand
and
arm
have
swell
and
quiver
long
with
torture
,
the
squeeze


scorpion
will
die
,
and
you
will
have
learn
the
great
lesson
how
to


endure
without
a
sob
.
for
the
whole
remnant
of
your
life
,
if
you
survive


the
test
--
some
,
it
be
say
,
die
under
it
--
you
will
be
strong
,
wise
,


less
sensitive
.
this
you
be
not
aware
of
,
perhaps
,
at
the
time
,
and
so


can
not
borrow
courage
of
that
hope
.

the

a
placid
dissimulation

a


dissimulation
often
wear
an
easy
and
gay
mien
at
first
,
settle
down


to
sorrow
and
paleness
in
time
,
then
pass
away
,
and
leave
a


convenient
stoicism
,
not
the
less
fortifying
because
it
be
half
-
bitter
.




half
-
bitter
!
be
that
wrong
?
no
;
it
should
be
bitter
:
bitterness
be


strength

it

a
tonic
.
sweet
,
mild

acute

may
be
apathetic


exhaustion
after
the
rack
.
if

remain
,
it
will
be
rather
a


dangerous
energy

deadly

to
the
state
of

Robert
,
indeed
,
have
sometimes
seem
to
be
fond
of
she
;
but
why
?
because


she
have
make
herself
so
pleasing
to
he
,
he
could
not
,
in
spite
of
all


his
effort
,
help
testify
a
state
of
feel
his
judgment
do
not


approve
nor
his
will
sanction
.
he
be
about
to
withdraw
decidedly
from


intimate
communication
with
she

he
do
not
choose
to
have
his


affection
inextricably
entangled
,

to
be
draw

his
reason

he
believe
imprudent

what
be
she
to
do

to
give


way
to
her
feeling
,

to
vanquish
they

to
pursue
he

to
turn


upon

if
she
be
weak
,
she
will
try
the
first
expedient

will


lose
his
esteem

win
his
aversion

if
she
have
sense
,
she
will
be
she


own
governor
,
and
resolve
to
subdue
and
bring
under
guidance
the


disturb
realm
of
her
emotion
.
she
will
determine
to
look
on
life


steadily
,
as
it
be
;
to
begin
to

its
severe
truth
seriously

to
study
its
knotty
problem
closely

conscientiously

it
appear
she
have
a
little
sense

she
quit

quietly

without

without
the
alteration
of
a

the


evening
would
be

she
have
learn


her
mistake
this
morning

yet
she
could
not
settle
down

convince


that
no
chance
would
occur
to
recall
she
to
Hollow

to


bring

walk
up

just
at

,
when
she
little
expect
such
a
pleasure
;
and
this
have


happen
twice
after
he
have
treat
she
with
peculiar
reserve
;
and


though
he
rarely
talk
to
she
in
her
uncle
's
presence
,
he
have
look
at


she
relentingly
as
he
sit
opposite
her
work
-
table
during
his
stay
.
the


few
word
he
have
speak

she
be
comfort
;
his

her
good

now
,
he
might
come

False
Hope

she


open
her

nothing

suddenly
the

it
softly

once
the
most
trite

perverse
that

abuse
of
the
people
of
Briarfield
;
of
the
native


of
Yorkshire
generally
;
complaint
of
the
want

high
society

of
the


backward
state
of
civilization

conduct

their


better

silly
ridicule

very

an

his
somewhat
underbred


manner

aspect
fail
to
bear
out

such
a

prater

when

up

a
certain
pitch

something

it

no
proof
of


refinement
to
be
ever
scold
other
for
vulgarity
,
and
no
sign
of
a


good
pastor
to
be
eternally
censure
his
flock
.
she
would
ask
he
what


he
have
enter
the
church
for
,

he
complain
there
be
only


cottage

visit

as
a
doll
,
a
child
,
a
plaything
;
she


expect
to
be
bent
to
like
a
queen
.




Hannah
,
on
the
contrary
,
demand
no
respect
,
only
flattery
.
if
she


admirer
only
_
tell
_
she
that
she
be
an
angel
,
she
would
let
they


_
treat
_
she
like
an
idiot
.
so
very
credulous
and
frivolous
be
she
,
so


very
silly
do
she
become
when
besiege
with
attention
,
flattered
and


admire
to
the
proper
degree
,
that
there
be
moment
when
helstone


actually
felt
tempt
to
commit
matrimony
a
second
time
,
and
to
try
the


experiment
of
take
she
for
his
second
helpmeet
;
but
fortunately
the


salutary
recollection
of
the
_
ennuis
_
of
his
first
marriage
,
the


impression
still
leave
on
he
of
the
weight
of
the
millstone
he
have
once


wear
round
his
neck
,
the
fixity
of
his
feeling
respect
the


insufferable
evil
of
conjugal
existence
,
operate
as
a
check
to
his


tenderness
,
suppress
the
sigh
heave
his
old
iron
lung
,
and


restrain
he
from
whispering
to
Hannah
proposal
it
would
have
be


high
fun
and
great
satisfaction
to
she
to
hear
.




it
be
probable
she
would
have
marry
he
if
he
have
ask
she
;
she


parent
would
have
quite
approve
the
match
.
to
they
his
fifty
-
five


year
,
his
bend
-
leather
heart
,
could
have
present
no
obstacle
;
and
as


he
be
a
rector
,
hold
an
excellent
living
,
occupy
a
good
house
,
and


be
suppose
even
to
have
private
property
(
though
in
that
the
world
be


mistaken
;
every
penny
of
the
£
5,000
inherit
by
he
from
his
father
have


be
devoted
to
the
building
and
endowing
of
a
new
church
at
his
native


village
in
Lancashire
--
for
he
could
show
a
lordly
munificence
when
he


pleased
,
and
if
the
end
be
to
his
liking
,
never
hesitate
about
make


a
grand
sacrifice
to
attain
it)--her
parent
,
I
say
,
would
have


deliver
Hannah
over
to
his
lovingkindness
and
his
tender
mercy


without
one
scruple
;
and
the
second
Mrs.
Helstone
,
invert
the
natural


order
of
insect
existence
,
would
have
flutter
through
the
honeymoon
a


bright
,
admired
butterfly
,
and
crawl
the
rest
of
her
day
a
sordid
,


trample
worm
.




little
Mr.
Sweeting
,
seat
between
Mrs.
Sykes
and
Miss
Mary
,
both
of


whom
be
very
kind
to
he
,
and
have
a
dish
of
tart
before
he
,
and


marmalade
and
crumpet
upon
his
plate
,
look
and
feel
more
content
than


any
monarch
.
he
be
fond
of
all
the
Misses
Sykes
;
they
be
all
fond
of


he
.
he
think
they
magnificent
girl
,
quite
proper
to
mate
with
one
of


his
inch
.
if
he
have
a
cause
of
regret
at
this
blissful
moment
,
it
be


that
Miss
Dora
happen
to
be
absent
--
Dora
be
the
one
whom
he


secretly
hope
one
day
to
call
Mrs.
David
Sweeting
,
with
whom
he
dream


of
take
stately
walk
,
lead
she
like
an
empress
through
the
village


of
nunnely
;
and
an
empress
she
would
have
be
,
if
size
could
make
an


empress
.
she
be
vast
,
ponderous
.
see
from
behind
,
she
have
the
air
of
a


very
stout
lady
of
forty
;
but
withal
she
possess
a
good
face
,
and
no


unkindly
character
.




the
meal
at
last
draw
to
a
close
.
it
would
have
be
over
long
ago
if


Mr.
Donne
have
not
persist
in
sit
with
his
cup
half
full
of
cold


tea
before
he
,
long
after
the
rest
have
finish
and
after
he
himself


have
discuss
such
allowance
of
viand
as
he
feel
competent
to


swallow
--
long
,
indeed
,
after
sign
of
impatience
have
be
manifest


all
round
the
board
,
till
chair
be
push
back
,
till
the
talk


flag
,
till
silence
fall
.
vainly
do
Caroline
inquire
repeatedly
if
he


would
have
another
cup
,
if
he
would
take
a
little
hot
tea
,
as
that
must


be
cold
,
etc
.
;
he
would
neither
drink
it
nor
leave
it
.
he
seem
to


think
that
this
isolated
position
of
his
give
he
somehow
a
certain


importance
,
that
it
be
dignified
and
stately
to
be
the
last
,
that
it


be
grand
to
keep
all
the
other
wait
.
so
long
do
he
linger
,
that


the
very
urn
die
;
it
cease
to
hiss
.
at
length
,
however
,
the
old
rector


himself
,
who
have
hitherto
be
too
pleasantly
engage
with
Hannah
to


care
for
the
delay
,
get
impatient
.




"
for
whom
be
we
wait
?
"
he
ask
.




"
for
I
,
I
believe
,
"
return
Donne
complacently
,
appear
to
think
it


much
to
his
credit
that
a
party
should
thus
be
keep
dependent
on
his


movement
.




"
Tut
!
"
cry
Helstone
.
then
stand
up
,
"
let
we
return
thank
,
"
say


he
;
which
he
do
forthwith
,
and
all
quit
the
table
.
Donne
,
nothing


abash
,
still
sit
ten
minute
quite
alone
,
whereupon
Mr.
Helstone
ring


the
bell
for
the
thing
to
be
remove
.
the
curate
at
length
see
himself


force
to
empty
his
cup
,
and
to
relinquish
the
_
rôle
_
which
,
he
think
,


have
give
he
such
a
felicitous
distinction
,
draw
upon
he
such


flattering
general
notice
.




and
now
,
in
the
natural
course
of
event
(
Caroline
,
know
how
it
would


be
,
have
open
the
piano
,
and
produce
music

book
in
readiness
)
,
music


be
ask
for
.
this
be
Mr.
Sweeting
's
chance
for
show
off
.
he
be


eager
to
commence
.
he
undertake
,
therefore
,
the
arduous
task
of


persuade
the
young
lady
to
favour
the
company
with
an
air
--
a
song
.


_
Con
amore

he
go
through
the
whole
business
of
beg
,
pray
,


resist
excuse
,
explain
away
difficulty
,
and
at
last
succeed


in
persuade
Miss
Harriet
to
allow
herself
to
be
lead
to
the
instrument
.


then
out
come
the
piece
of
his
flute
(
he
always
carry
they
in
his


pocket
,
as
unfailingly
as
he
carry
his
handkerchief
)
.
they
be


screw
and
arrange
,
Malone
and
Donne
meanwhile
herd
together
and


sneer
at
he
,
which
the
little
man
,
glance
over
his
shoulder
,
see
,


but
do
not
heed
at
all
.
he
be
persuade
their
sarcasm
all
arise
from


envy
.
they
could
not
accompany
the
lady
as
he
could
;
he
be
about
to


enjoy
a
triumph
over
they
.




the
triumph
begin
.
malone
,
much
chagrin
at
hear
he
pipe
up
in
most


superior
style
,
determine
to
earn
distinction
too
,
if
possible
,
and


all
at
once
assume
the
character
of
a
swain
(
which
character
he
have


endeavour
to
enact
once
or
twice
before
,
but
in
which
he
have
not


hitherto
meet
with
the
success
he
doubtless
opine
his
merit
deserve
)
,


approach
a
sofa
on
which
Miss
Helstone
be
seat
,
and
deposit
his


great
irish
frame
near
she
,
try
his
hand
(
or
rather
tongue
)
at
a
fine


speech
or
two
,
accompany
by
grin
the
most
extraordinary
and


incomprehensible
.
in
the
course
of
his
effort
to
render
himself


agreeable
,
he
contrive
to
possess
himself
of
the
two
long
sofa
cushion


and
a
square
one
;
with
which
,
after
roll
they
about
for
some
time


with
strange
gesture
,
he
manage
to
erect
a
sort
of
barrier
between


himself
and
the
object
of
his
attention
.
caroline
,
quite
willing
that


they
should
be
sunder
,
soon
devise
an
excuse
for
step
over
to
the


opposite
side
of
the
room
,
and
take
up
a
position
beside
Mrs.
Sykes
,


of
which
good
lady
she
entreat
some
instruction
in
a
new
stitch
in


ornamental
knitting
,
a
favour
readily
grant
;

thus
Peter
Augustus


be
throw
out
.




very
sullenly
do
his
countenance
low
when
he
see
himself


abandon
--
leave
entirely
to
his
own
resource
,
on
a
large
sofa
,
with
the


charge
of
three
small
cushion
on
his
hand
.
the
fact
be
,
he
feel


dispose
seriously
to
cultivate
acquaintance
with
Miss
Helstone
,
because


he
think
,
in
common
with
other
,
that
her
uncle
possess
money
,
and


conclude
that
,
since
he
have
no
child
,
he
would
probably
leave
it
to


his
niece
.
Gérard
Moore
be
well
instruct
on
this
point
:
he
have
see


the
neat
church
that
owe
its
origin
to
the
rector
's
zeal
and
cash
,
and


more
than
once
,
in
his
inmost
soul
,
have
curse
an
expensive
caprice


which
cross
his
wish
.




the
evening
seem
long
to
one
person
in
that
room
.
caroline
at


interval
drop
she
knitting
on
her
lap
,
and
give
herself
up
to
a
sort


of
brain
-
lethargy

close
her
eye

depress
her
head

by


what
seem
to
she
the
unmeaning
hum
around
her,--the
inharmonious
,


tasteless
rattle
of
the
piano
key
,
the
squeaking
and
gasp
note
of


the
flute

the
laughter

mirth
of
her
uncle
,

Hannah

Mary

could
not
tell
whence
originate
,
for
she
hear
nothing
comic
or


gleeful
in
their
discourse
;
and
more
than
all
,
by
the
interminable


gossip
of
Mrs.
Sykes
murmur
close
at
her
ear

the


change

her

of

to


come
off
next
week
at
Whinbury

at
length
to
exhaustion

she
embrace
the
opportunity
of
Mr.


sweeting
come
up
to
speak
to
Mrs.
Sykes
to
slip
quietly
out
of
the


apartment
,
and
seek
a
moment
's
respite
in
solitude

repair
to
the


dining

the
clear

low
remnant

large
easy

chair

half
shut


her

rest
herself

rest
at

her
limb
,
her
sense
,
she


hearing
,
her
vision

weary
with
listen
to
nothing

gaze
on

to
her
mind

to
the
Hollow

bless
by
the

it

for
Robert

half
a
mile
away
from
both
,

much
near
to
Caroline
than
she


deaden
spirit

be
at
this
moment
cross
the


churchyard

approach
the

not
,

to

on
communicate
a
brief
piece
of


intelligence

up

Moore
,

else

undegraded

neither

Moore


abruptly
turn
from
the
deputation
and
re
-
enter
his
counting
-
house
.




his
last
word
have
leave
a
bad
,
harsh
impression
;
he
,
at
least
,
have


"
fail
in
the
disposing
of
a
chance
he
be
lord
of
.
"
by
speak
kindly


to
William
Farren
--
who
be
a
very
honest
man
,
without
envy
or
hatred
of


those
more
happily
circumstance
than
himself
,
think
it
no
hardship


and
no
injustice
to
be
force
to
live
by
labour
,
disposed
to
be


honourably
content
if
he
could
but
get
work
to
do
--
Moore
might
have
make


a
friend
.
it
seem
wonderful
how
he
could
turn
from
such
a
man
without


a
conciliatory
or
a
sympathize
expression
.
the
poor
fellow
's
face


look
haggard
with
want
;
he
have
the
aspect
of
a
man
who
have
not
know


what
it
be
to
live
in
comfort
and
plenty
for
week
,
perhaps
month
,


past
,
and
yet
there
be
no
ferocity
,
no
malignity
in
his
countenance
;
it


be
wear
,
deject
,
austere
,
but
still
patient
.
how
could
Moore
leave


he
thus
,
with
the
word
,
"
I
'll
never
give
in

"
and
not
a
whisper
of


good

will
,
or
hope
,

selfish
,
an
unfeeling

frivolous
.
she
draw
no


distinction
.
yet
she
be
a
very
good
wife
,
a
very
careful
mother
,


look
after
her
child
unceasingly
,
be
sincerely
attach
to
she


husband
;
only
the
bad
of
it
be
,
if
she
could
have
have
her
will
,
she


would
not
have
permit
he
to
have
any
friend
in
the
world
beside


herself
.
all
his
relation
be
insupportable
to
she
,
and
she
keep
they


at
arm
's
length
.




Mr.
Yorke
and
she
agree
perfectly
well
,
yet
he
be
naturally
a
social
,


hospitable
man
,
an
advocate
for
family
unity
;
and
in
his
youth
,
as
have


be
say
,
he
like
none
but
lively
,
cheerful
woman
.
why
he
choose
she
,


how
they
contrive
to
suit
each
other
,
be
a
problem
puzzle
enough
,
but


which
might
soon
be
solve
if
one
have
time
to
go
into
the
analysis
of


the
case
.
suffice
it
here
to
say
that
yorke
have
a
shadowy
side
as
well


as
a
sunny
side
to
his
character
,
and
that
his
shadowy
side
find


sympathy
and
affinity
in
the
whole
of
his
wife
's
uniformly
overcast


nature
.
for
the
rest
,
she
be
a
strong
-
minded
woman
;
never
say
a
weak


or
a
trite
thing
;
take
stern
,
democratic
view
of
society
,
and
rather


cynical
one
of
human
nature
;
consider
herself
perfect
and
safe
,
and


the
rest
of
the
world
all
wrong
.
her
main
fault
be
a
brooding
,
eternal
,


immitigable
suspicion
of
all
man
,
thing
,
creed
,
and
party
;
this


suspicion
be
a
mist
before
her
eye
,
a
false
guide
in
her
path
,


wherever
she
look
,
wherever
she
turn
.




it
may
be
suppose
that
the
child
of
such
a
pair
be
not
likely
to


turn
out
quite
ordinary
,
commonplace
being
;
and
they
be
not
.
you
see


six
of
they
,
reader
.
the
young
be
a
baby
on
the
mother
's
knee
.
it
be


all
her
own
yet
,
and
that
one
she
have
not
yet
begin
to
doubt
,
suspect
,


condemn
;
it
derive
its
sustenance
from
she
,
it
hang
on
she
,
it
cling


to
she
,
it
love
she
above
everything
else
in
the
world
.
she
be
sure
of


that
,
because
,
as
it
live
by
she
,
it
can
not
be
otherwise
,
therefore
she


love
it
.




the
two
next
be
girl
,
Rose
and
Jessy
;
they
be
both
now
at
their


father
's
knee
;
they
seldom
go
near
their
mother
,
except
when
oblige
to


do
so
.
Rose
,
the
elder
,
be
twelve
year
old
;
she
be
like
her
father
--
the


most
like
he
of
the
whole
group
--
but
it
be
a
granite
head
copy
in


ivory
;
all
be
soften
in
colour
and
line
.
yorke
himself
have
a
harsh


face
--
his
daughter
's
be
not
harsh
,
neither
be
it
quite
pretty
;
it
be


simple
,
childlike
in
feature
;
the
round
cheek
bloom
:
as
to
the
gray


eye
,
they
be
otherwise
than
childlike
;
a
serious
soul
light
they
--
a


young
soul
yet
,
but
it
will
mature
,
if
the
body
live
;
and
neither


father
nor
mother
have
a
spirit
to
compare
with
it
.
partake
of
the


essence
of
each
,
it
will
one
day
be
well
than
either
--
strong
,
much


purer
,
more
aspiring
.
Rose
be
a
still
,
sometimes
a
stubborn
,
girl
now
.


her
mother
want
to
make
of
she
such
a
woman
as
she
be
herself
--
a
woman


of
dark
and
dreary
duty
;
and
Rose
have
a
mind
full
-
set
,
thick
-
sow
with


the
germ
of
idea
her
mother
never
know
.
it
be
agony
to
she
often
to


have
these
idea
trample
on
and
repress
.
she
have
never
rebel
yet
;


but
if
hard
drive
,
she
will
rebel
one
day
,
and
then
it
will
be
once
for


all
.
Rose
love
her
father
:
her
father
do
not
rule
she
with
a
rod
of


iron
;
he
be
good
to
she
.
he
sometimes
fear
she
will
not
live
,
so
bright


be
the
spark
of
intelligence
which
,
at
moment
,
flash
from
her
glance


and
gleam
in
her
language
.
this
idea
make
he
often
sadly
tender
to


she
.




he
have
no
idea
that
little
Jessy
will
die
young
,
she
be
so
gay
and


chatter
,
arch
,
original
even
now
;
passionate
when
provoke
,
but
most


affectionate
if
caress
;
by
turn
gentle
and
rattling
;
exact
,
yet


generous
;
fearless
--
of
her
mother
,
for
instance
,
whose
irrationally
hard


and
strict
rule
she
have
often
defy
--
yet
reliant
on
any
who
will
help


she
.
Jessy
,
with
her
little
piquant
face
,
engage
prattle
,
and
win


way
,
be
make
to
be
a
pet
,
and
her
father
's
pet
she
accordingly
be
.
it


be
odd
that
the
doll
should
resemble
her
mother
feature
by
feature
,
as


Rose
resemble
her
father
,
and
yet
the
physiognomy
--
how
different
!




Mr.
Yorke
,
if
a
magic
mirror
be
now
hold
before
you
,
and
if
therein


be
show
you
your
two
daughter
as
they
will
be
twenty
year
from
this


night
,
what
would
you
think
?
the
magic
mirror
be
here
:
you
shall
learn


their
destiny
--
and
first
that
of
your
little
life
,
Jessy
.




do
you
know
this
place
?
no
,
you
never
see
it
;
but
you
recognize
the


nature
of
these
tree
,
this
foliage
--
the
cypress
,
the
willow
,
the
yew
.


stone
crosse
like
these
be
not
unfamiliar
to
you
,
nor
be
these
dim


garland
of
everlasting
flower
.
here
be
the
place
--
green
sod
and
a
gray


marble
headstone
.
Jessy
sleep
below
.
she
live
through
an
April
day
;


much
love
be
she
,
much
loving
.
she
often
,
in
her
brief
life
,
shed


tear
,
she
have
frequent
sorrow
;
she
smile
between
,
gladden
whatever


see
she
.
her
death
be
tranquil
and
happy
in
Rose
's
guardian
arm
,
for


Rose
have
be
her
stay
and
defence
through
many
trial
.
the
dying
and


the
watch
english
girl
be
at
that
hour
alone
in
a
foreign


country
,
and
the
soil
of
that
country
give
Jessy
a
grave
.




now
,
behold
Rose
two
year
later
.
the
crosse
and
garland
look


strange
,
but
the
hill
and
wood
of
this
landscape
look
still
strange
.


this
,
indeed
,
be
far
from
England
;
remote
must
be
the
shore
which
wear


that
wild
,
luxuriant
aspect
.
this
be
some
virgin
solitude
.
unknown
bird


flutter
round
the
skirt
of
that
forest
;
no
european
river
this
,
on


whose
bank
Rose
sit
think
.
the
little
quiet
Yorkshire
girl
be
a


lonely
emigrant
in
some
region
of
the
southern
hemisphere
.
will
she
ever


come
back
?




the
three
eld
of
the
family
be
all
boy
--
Matthew
,
Mark
,
and
Martin
.


they
be
seat
together
in
that
corner
,
engage
in
some
game
.
Observe


their
three
head
:
much
alike
at
a
first
glance
;
at
a
second
,
different
;


at
a
third
,
contrasted
.
dark
-
haired
,
dark
-
eyed
,
red
-
cheek
be
the


whole
trio
;
small
English
feature
they
all
possess
;
all
own
a
blend


resemblance
to
sire
and
mother
;
and
yet
a
distinctive
physiognomy
,
mark


of
a
separate
character
,
belong
to
each
.




I
shall
not
say
much
about
Matthew
,
the
first
-
bear
of
the
house
,
though


it
be
impossible
to
avoid
gaze
at
he
long
,
and
conjecture
what


quality
that
visage
hide
or
indicate
.
he
be
no
plain
-
look
boy
:


that
jet
-
black
hair
,
white
brow
,
high
-
coloured
cheek
,
those
quick
,
dark


eye
,
be
good
point
in
their
way
.
how
be
it
that
,
look
as
long
as
you


will
,
there
be
but
one
object
in
the
room
,
and
that
the
most
sinister
,


to
which
Matthew
's
face
seem
to
bear
an
affinity
,
and
of
which
,
ever


and
anon
,
it
remind
you
strangely
--
the
eruption
of
Vesuvius
?
Flame
and


shadow
seem
the
component
part
of
that
lad
's
soul
--
no
daylight
in
it
,


and
no
sunshine
,
and
no
pure
,
cool
moonbeam
ever
shine
there
.
he
have
an


english
frame
,
but
,
apparently
,
not
an
english
mind
--
you
would
say
,
an


italian
stiletto
in
a
sheath
of
british
workmanship
.
he
be
cross
in


the
game
--
look
at
his
scowl
.
Mr.
Yorke
see
it
,
and
what
do
he
say
?
in


a
low
voice
he
plead
,
"
Mark
and
Martin
,
do
n't
anger
your
brother
.
"
and


this
be
ever
the
tone
adopt
by
both
parent
.
theoretically
,
they
decry


partiality
--
no
right
of
primogeniture
be
to
be
allow
in
that
house
;


but
Matthew
be
never
to
be
vex
,
never
to
be
oppose
;
they
avert


provocation
from
he
as
assiduously
as
they
would
avert
fire
from
a


barrel
of
gunpowder
.
"
concede
,
conciliate
,
"
be
their
motto
wherever
he


be
concern
.
the
republican
be
fast
make
a
tyrant
of
their
own


flesh
and
blood
.
this
the
young
scion
know
and
feel
,
and
at
heart


they
all
rebel
against
the
injustice
.
they
can
not
read
their
parent
'


motive
;
they
only
see
the
difference
of
treatment
.
the
dragon
's
tooth


be
already
sow
amongst
Mr.
Yorke
's
young
olive
-
branch
;
discord
will


one
day
be
the
harvest
.




Mark
be
a
bonny
-
look
boy
,
the
most
regular
-
feature
of
the
family
.
he


be
exceedingly
calm
;
his
smile
be
shrewd
;
he
can
say
the
driest
,
most


cut
thing
in
the
quietest
of
tone
.
despite
his
tranquillity
,
a


somewhat
heavy
brow
speak
temper
,
and
remind
you
that
the
smooth


water
be
not
always
the
safe
.
besides
,
he
be
too
still
,
unmoved
,


phlegmatic
,
to
be
happy
.
life
will
never
have
much
joy
in
it
for
Mark
.


by
the
time
he
be
five
-
and
-
twenty
he
will
wonder
why
people
ever
laugh
,


and
think
all
fool
who
seem
merry
.
Poetry
will
not
exist
for
Mark
,


either
in
literature
or
in
life
;
its
good
effusion
will
sound
to
he


mere
rant
and
jargon
.
enthusiasm
will
be
his
aversion
and
contempt
.
Mark


will
have
no
youth
;
while
he
look
juvenile
and
blooming
,
he
will
be


already
middle
-
aged
in
mind
.
his
body
be
now
fourteen
year
of
age
,
but


his
soul
be
already
thirty
.




Martin
,
the
young
of
the
three
,
own
another
nature
.
life
may
,
or
may


not
,
be
brief
for
he
,
but
it
will
certainly
be
brilliant
.
he
will
pass


through
all
its
illusion
,
half
believe
in
they
,
wholly
enjoy
they
,
then


outlive
they
.
that
boy
be
not
handsome
--
not
so
handsome
as
either
of
his

denounce

she
be
fond
of
go
to
Hollow
's
cottage
;
also


he
suspect
that
she
like
Robert
Moore
's
occasional
presence
at
the


rectory
.
the
Cossack
have
perceive
that
whereas
if
Malone
step
in
of


an
evening
to
make
himself
sociable
and
charming
,
by
pinch
the
ear


of
an
aged
black
cat
,
which
usually
share
with
Miss
Helstone
's
foot
the


accommodation
of
her
footstool
,
or
by
borrow
a
fowling
-
piece
,
and


bang
away
at
a
tool
shed
door
in
the
garden
while
enough
of
daylight


remain
to
show
that
conspicuous
mark
,
keep
the
passage
and


sit
-
room
door
meantime
uncomfortably
open
for
the
convenience
of


run
in
and
out
to
announce
his
failure
and
success
with
noisy


_
brusquerie_--he
have
observe
that
under
such
entertaining
circumstance


Caroline
have
a
trick
of
disappear
,
trip
noiselessly
upstairs
,
and


remain
invisible
till
call
down
to
supper
.
on
the
other
hand
,
when


Robert
Moore
be
the
guest
,
though
he
elicit
no
vivacity
from
the


cat
,
do
nothing
to
it
,
indeed
,
beyond
occasionally
coax
it
from
the


stool
to
his
knee
,
and
there
let
it
purr
,
climb
to
his
shoulder
,
and


rub
its
head
against
his
cheek
;
though
there
be
no
ear
-
split


crack
off
of
firearm
,
no
diffusion
of
sulphurous
gunpowder
perfume
,


no
noise
,
no
boasting
during
his
stay
--
that
still
Caroline
sit
in
the


room
,
and
seem
to
find
wondrous
content
in
the
stitching
of
Jew
-
basket


pin
-
cushion
and
the
knitting
of
missionary
-
basket
sock
.




she
be
very
quiet
,
and
Robert
pay
she
little
attention
,
scarcely
ever


address
his
discourse
to
she
;
but
Mr.
Helstone
,
not
be
one
of


those
elderly
gentleman
who
be
easily
blind
--
on
the
contrary
,
find


himself
on
all
occasion
extremely
wide
-
awake
--
have
watch
they
when


they
bid
each
other
good
-
night
.
he
have
just
see
their
eye
meet


once
--
only
once
.
some
nature
would
have
take
pleasure
in
the
glance


then
surprised
,
because
there
be
no
harm
and
some
delight
in
it
.
it
be


by
no
means
a
glance
of
mutual
intelligence
,
for
mutual
love
secret


exist
not
between
they
.
there
be
nothing
then
of
craft
and


concealment
to
offend
:
only
Mr.
Moore
's
eye
,
look
into
Caroline
's
,


feel
they
be
clear
and
gentle
;
and
Caroline
's
eye
,
encounter
Mr.


Moore
's
,
confess
they
be
manly
and
search
.
each
acknowledge
the


charm
in
his
or
her
own
way
.
Moore
smile
slightly
,
and
Caroline


colour
as
slightly
.
Mr.
Helstone
could
,
on
the
spot
,
have
rate
they


both
.
they
annoy
he
.
why
?
impossible
to
say
.
if
you
have
ask
he


what
Moore
merit
at
that
moment
,
he
would
have
say
a
"
horsewhip
;
"
if


you
have
inquire
into
Caroline
's
desert
,
he
would
have
adjudge
she
a


box
on
the
ear
;
if
you
have
far
demand
the
reason
of
such


chastisement
,
he
would
have
storm
against
flirtation
and


love
-
making
,
and
vow
he
would
have
no
such
folly
go
on
under
his


roof
.




these
private
consideration
,
combine
with
political
reason
,
fix
his


resolution
of
separate
the
cousin
.
he
announce
his
will
to
Caroline


one
evening
as
she
be
sit
at
work
near
the
drawing
-
room
window
.
she


face
be
turn
towards
he
,
and
the
light
fall
full
upon
it
.
it
have


strike
he
a
few
minute
before
that
she
be
look
paler
and
quieter


than
she
use
to
look
.
it
have
not
escape
he
either
that
Robert
Moore
's


name
have
never
,
for
some
three
week
past
,
drop
from
her
lip
;
nor


during
the
same
space
of
time
have
that
personage
make
his
appearance
at


the
rectory
.
some
suspicion
of
clandestine
meeting
haunt
his
mind
.


have
but
an
indifferent
opinion
of
woman
,
he
always
suspect
they
.
he


think
they
need
constant
watching
.
it
be
in
a
tone
dryly


significant
he
desire
she
to
cease
her
daily
visit
to
the
Hollow
.
he


expect
a
start
,
a
look
of
depreciation
.
the
start
he
see
,
but
it
be
a


very
slight
one
;
no
look
whatever
be
direct
to
he
.




"
do
you
hear
I
?
"
he
ask
.




"
yes
,
uncle
.
"




"
of
course
you
mean
to
attend
to
what
I
say
?
"




"
yes
,
certainly
.
"




"
and
there
must
be
no
letter
-
scribble
to
your
cousin
Hortense
--
no


intercourse
whatever
.
I
do
not
approve
of
the
principle
of
the
family
.


they
be
jacobinical
.
"




"
very
well
,
"
say
Caroline
quietly
.
she
acquiesce
then
.
there
be
no


vex
flush
of
the
face
,
no
gathering
tear
;
the
shadowy


thoughtfulness
which
have
cover
her
feature
ere
Mr.
Helstone
speak


remain
undisturbed
;
she
be
obedient
.




yes
,
perfectly
;
because
the
mandate
coincide
with
her
own
previous


judgment
;
because
it
be
now
become
pain
to
she
to
go
to
Hollow
's


cottage
;
nothing
meet
she
there
but
disappointment
.
hope
and
love
have


quit
that
little
tenement
,
for
Robert
seem
to
have
desert
its


precinct
.
whenever
she
ask
after
he
--
which
she
very
seldom
do
,


since
the
mere
utterance
of
his
name
make
her
face
grow
hot
--
the
answer


be
,
he
be
from
home
,
or
he
be
quite
take
up
with
business
.
Hortense


fear
he
be
kill
himself
by
application
.
he
scarcely
ever
take
a


meal
in
the
house
;
he
live
in
the
counting
-
house
.




at
church
only
Caroline
have
the
chance
of
see
he
,
and
there
she


rarely
look
at
he
.
it
be
both
too
much
pain
and
too
much
pleasure


to
look
--
it
excite
too
much
emotion
;
and
that
it
be
all
waste
emotion


she
have
learn
well
to
comprehend
.




once
,
on
a
dark
,
wet
Sunday
,
when
there
be
few
people
at
church
,
and


when
especially
certain
lady
be
absent
,
of
whose
observant
faculty


and
tomahawk
tongue
Caroline
stand
in
awe
,
she
have
allow
her
eye
to


seek
Robert
's
pew
,
and
to
rest
awhile
on
its
occupant
.
he
be
there


alone
.
Hortense
have
be
keep
at
home
by
prudent
consideration
relative


to
the
rain
and
a
new
spring
_
chapeau
_
.
during
the
sermon
he
sit
with


fold
arm
and
eye
cast
down
,
look
very
sad
and
abstracted
.
when


depressed
,
the
very
hue
of
his
face
seem
more
dusk
than
when
he


smile
,
and
to
-
day
cheek
and
forehead
wear
their
most
tintless
and
sober


olive
.
by
instinct
Caroline
know
,
as
she
examine
that
clouded


countenance
,
that
his
thought
be
run
in
no
familiar
or
kindly


channel
;
that
they
be
far
away
,
not
merely
from
she
,
but
from
all


which
she
could
comprehend
,
or
in
which
she
could
sympathize
.
nothing


that
they
have
ever
talk
of
together
be
now
in
his
mind
:
he
be
wrapt


from
she
by
interest
and
responsibility
in
which
it
be
deem
such


as
she
could
have
no
part
.




Caroline
meditate
in
her
own
way
on
the
subject
;
speculate
on
his


feeling
,
on
his
life
,
on
his
fear
,
on
his
fate
;
muse
over
the
mystery


of
"
business
,
"

to
comprehend
more
about
it
than
have
ever
be

she
--
to
understand
its
perplexity
,
liability
,
duty
,
exaction
;


endeavour
to
realize
the
state
of
mind
of
a
"
man
of
business
,
"
to


enter
into
it
,
feel
what
he
would
feel
,
aspire
to
what
he
would
aspire
.


her
earnest
wish
be
to
see
thing
as
they
be
,
and
not
to
be
romantic
.


by
dint
of
effort
she
contrive
to
get
a
glimpse
of
the
light
of
truth


here
and
there
,
and
hope
that
scant
ray
might
suffice
to
guide
she
.




"

she
conclude
,
"

Robert
's
mental
condition

mine

only
of
he

no

no
leisure

strange
that
grief


should
now
almost

the

solve
it

good

right

some
measure
,

a
very
convenient
doctrine


for
the
people
who
hold
it
;
but
I
perceive
that
certain
set
of
human


being
be
very
apt
to
maintain
that
other
set
should
give
up
their


live
to
they
and
their
service
,
and
then
they
requite
they
by
praise
;


they
call
they
devoted
and
virtuous
.
be
this
enough
?
be
it
to
live
?
be


there
not
a
terrible
hollowness

mockery
,

,

existence

away

of
something
of
your


own
to
bestow
it

there
be

virtue
lie
in
abnegation


of
self

I
do
not
believe
it
.
undue
humility
make
tyranny
;
weak


concession
create
selfishness
.
the
romish
religion
especially
teach


renunciation
of
self
,
submission
to
other
,

nowhere
be
find
so


many
grasp
tyrant
as
in
the
rank
of
the
romish
priesthood
.
each


human
being
have
his
share
of
right
.
I
suspect
it
would
conduce
to
the


happiness
and
welfare
of
all
if
each
know
his
allotment

hold
to
it

tenaciously

tidy

one
of
Miss

be
compose
herself
ever
since
she
come
down
in
the


morning
,
and
have
just
attain
a
certain
lethargic
state
of
tranquillity


when
the
visitor
's
knock
at
the
door
startle
she
,

undo
her
day

she

,
to

she


receive
she
with

bid
she
be

with
austerity

when


she
get
she
place
opposite
,
she
fix
she
with
her
eye
.




this
be
no
ordinary
doom
--
to
be
fix
with
Miss
Mann
's
eye
.
Robert


Moore
have
undergo
it
once
,
and
have
never
forget
the
circumstance
.




he
consider
it
quite
equal
to
anything
Medusa
could
do
.
he
profess


to
doubt
whether
,
since
that
infliction
,
his
flesh
have
be
quite
what


it
be
before
--
whether
there
be
not
something
stony
in
its
texture
.
the


gaze
have
have
such
an
effect
on
he
as
to
drive
he
promptly
from
the


apartment
and
house
;
it
have
even
send
he
straightway
up
to
the
rectory
,


where
he
have
appear
in
Caroline
's
presence
with
a
very
queer
face
,
and


amazed
she
by
demand
a
cousinly
salute
on
the
spot
,
to
rectify
a


damage
that
have
be
do
he
.




certainly
Miss
Mann
have
a
formidable
eye
for
one
of
the
soft
sex
.
it


be
prominent
,
and
show
a
great
deal
of
the
white
,
and
look
as


steadily
,
as
unwinkingly
,
at
you
as
if
it
be
a
steel
ball
solder
in


her
head
;
and
when
,
while
look
,
she
begin
to
talk
in
an
indescribably


dry
,
monotonous
tone
--
a
tone
without
vibration
or
inflection
--
you
feel


as
if
a
graven
image
of
some
bad
spirit
be
address
you
.
but
it
be


all
a
figment
of
fancy
,
a
matter
of
surface
.
Miss

's
goblin
grimness


scarcely
go
deep
than
the
angel
sweetness
of
hundred
of
beauty

she
be
a
perfectly
honest
,
conscientious
woman

who
have
perform


duty
in
her
day

severe
anguish
many
a

Peri

eyed
,
silken
-
tressed
,

tongue

would
have
shrink


appal

she
have
pass
alone
through
protract
scene

suffering
,


exercise
rigid
self
-
denial
,
make
large
sacrifice

time

money
,


health
for
those
who
have
repay
she
only
by
ingratitude
,
and
now
her


main
--
almost
her
sole
--
fault
be
that
she
be
censorious
.




censorious
she
certainly
be
.
Caroline
have
not
sit
five
minute
ere
she


hostess
,
still
keep
she
under
the
spell
of
that
dread
and
Gorgon


gaze
,
begin
flay
alive
certain
of
the
family
in
the
neighbourhood
.


she
go
to
work
at
this
business
in
a
singularly
cool
,
deliberate


manner
,
like
some
surgeon
practise
with
his
scalpel
on
a
lifeless


subject
.
she
make
few
distinction
;
she
allow
scarcely
any
one
to
be


good
;
she
dissect
impartially
almost
all
her
acquaintance
.
if
she


auditress
venture
now
and
then
to
put
in
a
palliative
word
she
set
it


aside
with
a
certain
disdain
.
still
,
though
thus
pitiless
in
moral


anatomy
,
she
be
no
scandal
-
monger
.
she
never
disseminate
really


malignant
or
dangerous
report
.
it
be
not
her
heart
so
much
as
she


temper
that
be
wrong
.




Caroline
make
this
discovery
for
the
first
time
to
-
day
,
and
move


thereby
to
regret
diver
unjust
judgment
she
have
more
than
once
pass


on
the
crab
old
maid
,
she
begin
to
talk
to
she
softly
,
not
in


sympathize
word
,
but
with
a
sympathize
voice
.
the
loneliness
of
she


condition
strike
her
visitor
in
a
new
light
,
as
do
also
the
character


of
her
ugliness
--
a
bloodless
pallor
of
complexion
,
and
deeply
wear
line


of
feature
.
the
girl
pity
the
solitary
and
afflict
woman
;
her
look


tell
what
she
feel
.
a
sweet
countenance
be
never
so
sweet
as
when
the


move
heart
animate
it
with
compassionate
tenderness
.
Miss
Mann
,
see


such
a
countenance
raise
to
she
,
be
touch
in
her
turn
.
she


acknowledge
her
sense
of
the
interest
thus
unexpectedly
show
in
she
,


who
usually
meet
with
only
coldness
and
ridicule
,
by
reply
to
she


candidly
.
communicative
on
her
own
affair
she
usually
be
not
,
because


no
one
care
to
listen
to
she
;
but
to
-
day
she
become
so
,
and
she


confidante
shed
tear
as
she
hear
she
speak
,
for
she
tell
of
cruel
,


slow
-
waste
,
obstinate
suffering
.
well
might
she
be
corpse
-
like
;
well


might
she
look
grim
,
and
never
smile
;
well
might
she
wish
to
avoid


excitement
,
to
gain
and
retain
composure
!
Caroline
,
when
she
know
all
,


acknowledge
that
Miss
Mann
be
rather
to
be
admire
for
fortitude
than

for
moroseness

Miss

,
draw
on
by
the
still
attention
of
her
listener
,
proceed
to


allude
to
circumstance
in
her
past
life
.
she
speak
like
one
who
tell


the
truth
--
simply
,
and
with
a
certain
reserve
;
she
do
not
boast
,
nor


do
she
exaggerate
.
Caroline
find
that
the
old
maid
have
be
a
most


devoted
daughter
and
sister
,
an
unwearied
watcher
by
linger


deathbed
;
that
to
prolonged
and
unrelaxing
attendance
on
the
sick

that
now
poison
her

she
have
be
a
support

succour
in
the
depth
of

that
it
be
still
her
hand

keep

from

.
Miss
Helstone
stay
the
whole
evening
,
omit


to
pay
her
other
intended
visit
;
and
when
she
leave
Miss
Mann
it
be
with


the
determination
to
try
in
future
to
excuse
her
fault
;
never
again
to


make
light
of
her
peculiarity
or
to
laugh
at
her
plainness
;
and
,
above


all
thing
,
not
to
neglect
she
,
but
to
come
once
a
week
,
and
to
offer


she
,
from
one
human
heart
at
least
,
the
homage
of
affection
and
respect
.


she
feel
she
could
now
sincerely
give
she
a
small
tribute
of
each


feel
.




Caroline
,
on
her
return
,
tell
Fanny
she
be
very
glad
she
have
go
out
,


as
she
feel
much
well
for
the
visit
.
the
next
day
she
fail
not
to


seek
Miss
Ainley
.
this
lady
be
in
narrow
circumstance
than
Miss


Mann
,
and
her
dwelling
be
more
humble
.
it
be
,
however
,
if
possible
,


yet
more
exquisitely
clean
,
though
the
decay
gentlewoman
could
not


afford
to
keep
a
servant
,
but
wait
on
herself
,
and
have
only
the


occasional
assistance
of
a
little
girl
who
live
in
a
cottage
near
.




not
only
be
Miss
Ainley
poor
,
but
she
be
even
plain
than
the
other


old
maid
.
in
her
first
youth
she
must
have
be
ugly
;
now
,
at
the
age
of


fifty
,
she
be
_
very
_
ugly
.
at
first
sight
,
all
but
peculiarly


well
-
discipline
mind
be
apt
to
turn
from
she
with
annoyance
,
to


conceive
against
she
a
prejudice
,
simply
on
the
ground
of
she


unattractive
look
.
then
she
be
prim
in
dress
and
manner
;
she
look
,


speak
,
and
move
the
complete
old
maid
.




her
welcome
to
Caroline
be
formal
,
even
in
its
kindness
--
for
it
be


kind
;
but
Miss
Helstone
excuse
this
.
she
know
something
of
the


benevolence
of
the
heart
which
beat
under
that
starch
kerchief
;
all


the
neighbourhood
--
at
least
all
the
female
neighbourhood
--
know
something


of
it
.
no
one
speak
against
Miss
Ainley
except
lively
young
gentleman


and
inconsiderate
old
one
,
who
declare
she
hideous
.




Caroline
be
soon
at
home
in
that
tiny
parlour
.
a
kind
hand
take
from


her
her
shawl
and
bonnet
,
and
instal
she
in
the
most
comfortable
seat


near
the
fire
.
the
young
and
the
antiquated
woman
be
presently
deep
in


kindly
conversation
,
and
soon
Caroline
become
aware
of
the
power
a
most


serene
,
unselfish
,
and
benignant
mind
could
exercise
over
those
to
whom


it
be
develop
.
she
talk
never
of
herself
,
always
of
other
.
their


fault
she
pass
over
.
her
theme
be
their
want
,
which
she
seek
to


supply
;
their
suffering
,
which
she
long
to
alleviate
.
she
be


religious
,
a
professor
of
religion
--
what
some
would
call
"
a
saint
;
"
and


she
refer
to
religion
often
in
sanctioned
phrase
--
in
phrase
which


those
who
possess
a
perception
of
the
ridiculous
,
without
own
the


power
of
exactly
test
and
truly
judge
character
,
would
certainly


have
esteem
a
proper
subject
for
satire
,
a
matter
for
mimicry
and


laughter
.
they
would
have
be
hugely
mistaken
for
their
pain
.


sincerity
be
never
ludicrous
;
it
be
always
respectable
.
whether


truth
--
be
it
religious
or
moral
truth
--
speak
eloquently
and
in


well
-
choose
language
or
not
,
its
voice
should
be
hear
with
reverence
.


let
those
who
can
not
nicely
,
and
with
certainty
,
discern
the
difference


between
the
tone
of
hypocrisy
and
those
of
sincerity
,
never
presume
to


laugh
at
all
,
lest
they
should
have
the
miserable
misfortune
to
laugh
in


the
wrong
place
,
and
commit
impiety
when
they
think
they
be
achieve


wit
.




not
from
Miss
Ainley
's
own
lip
do
Caroline
hear
of
her
good
work
,
but


she
know
much
of
they
nevertheless
.
her
beneficence
be
the
familiar


topic
of
the
poor
in
Briarfield
.
they
be
not
work
of
almsgive
.
the


old
maid
be
too
poor
to
give
much
,
though
she
straiten
herself
to


privation
that
she
might
contribute
her
mite
when
needful
.
they
be
the


work
of
a
Sister
of
Charity
--
far
more
difficult
to
perform
than
those


of
a
Lady
Bountiful
.
she
would
watch
by
any
sick
-
bed
;
she
seem
to
fear


no
disease
.
she
would
nurse
the
poor
whom
none
else
would
nurse
.
she


be
serene
,
humble
,
kind
,
and
equable
through
everything
.




for
this
goodness
she
get
but
little
reward
in
this
life
.
many
of
the


poor
become
so
accustomed
to
her
service
that
they
hardly
thank
she


for
they
.
the
rich
hear
they
mention
with
wonder
,
but
be
silent
,


from
a
sense
of
shame
at
the
difference
between
her
sacrifice
and
their


own
.
many
lady
,
however
,
respect
she
deeply
.
they
could
not
help
it
.


one
gentleman
--
one
only
--
give
she
his
friendship
and
perfect
confidence
.


this
be
Mr.
Hall
,
the
vicar
of
Nunnely
.
he
say
,
and
say
truly
,
that


her
life
come
nearer
the
life
of
Christ
than
that
of
any
other
human


be
he
have
ever
meet
with
.
you
must
not
think
,
reader
,
that
in


sketch
Miss
Ainley
's
character
I
depict
a
figment
of
imagination
.
no
.


we
seek
the
original
of
such
portrait
in
real
life

Miss
Helstone
study
well
the
mind

heart
now
reveal
to
she

she


find
no
high
intellect
to
admire
--
the
old
maid
be
merely
sensible
--
but


she
discover
so
much
goodness
,
so
much
usefulness
,
so
much
mildness
,


patience
,
truth
,
that
she
bend
her
own
mind
before
Miss
Ainley
's
in


reverence
.
what
be
her
love
of
nature
,
what
be
her
sense
of
beauty
,


what
be
she
more
varied
and
fervent
emotion
,
what
be
she
deep


power
of
thought
,
what
her
wide
capacity
to
comprehend
,
compare
to
the


practical
excellence
of
this
good
woman
?
momently
,
they
seem
only


beautiful
form
of
selfish
delight
;
mentally
,
she
trod
they
under
foot
.




it
be
true
she
still
feel
with
pain
that
the
life
which
make
Miss
Ainley


happy
could
not
make
she
happy
.
pure
and
active
as
it
be
,
in
her
heart


she
deem
it
deeply
dreary
,
because
it
be
so
loveless
--
to
her
idea
,


so
forlorn
.
yet
,
doubtless
,
she
reflect
,
it
need
only
habit
to
make


it
practicable
and
agreeable
to
any
one
.
it
be
despicable
,
she
feel
,
to


pine
sentimentally
,
to
cherish
secret
grief
,
vain
memory
,
to
be


inert
,
to
waste
youth
in
ache
languor
,
to
grow
old
do
nothing
.




"
I
will
bestir
myself
,
"
be
her
resolution
,
"
and
try
to
be
wise
if
I


can
not
be
good
.
"




she
proceed
to
make
inquiry
of
Miss
Ainley
if
she
could
help
she
in


anything
.
Miss
Ainley
,
glad
of
an
assistant
,
tell
she
that
she
could
,


and
indicate
some
poor
family
in
Briarfield
that
it
be
desirable
she


should
visit
,
give
she
likewise
,
at
her
further
request
,
some
work
to


do
for
certain
poor
woman
who
have
many
child
,
and
who
be
unskille


in
use
the
needle
for
themselves
.




Caroline
go
home
,
lay
her
plan
,
and
take
a
resolve
not
to
swerve


from
they
.
she
allot
a
certain
portion
of
her
time
for
her
various


study
,
and
a
certain
portion
for
do
anything
Miss
Ainley
might


direct
she
to
do
.
the
remainder
be
to
be
spend
in
exercise
;
not
a


moment
be
to
be
leave
for
the
indulgence
of
such
fevere
thought
as
have


poison
last
Sunday
evening
.




to
do
her
justice
,
she
execute
her
plan
conscientiously
,


perseveringly
.
it
be
very
hard
work
at
first
--
it
be
even
hard
work
to


the
end
--
but
it
help
she
to
stem
and
keep
down
anguish
;
it
force
she


to
be
employ
;
it
forbid
she
to
brood
;
and
gleam
of
satisfaction


chequer
her
gray
life
here
and
there
when
she
find
she
have
do
good
,


imparted
pleasure
,
or
allay
suffering

yet
I
must
speak
truth
.
these
effort
bring
she
neither
health
of
body


nor
continue
peace
of
mind

with
they
all
she
waste
,
grow
more
joyless


and
more
wan

with
they
all

harp
on
the

an
elegy

busy

,

all
,
so
active

by

back
in

evening

pale
and
weary
-
look
,
yet
seemingly
not


fatigued
;
for
still
,
as
soon
as
she
have
throw
off
her
bonnet
and
shawl
,


she
would
,
instead
of
rest
,
begin
to
pace
her
apartment
.
sometimes


she
would
not
sit
down
till
she
be
literally
faint
.
she
say
she
do


this
to
tire
herself
well
,
that
she
might
sleep
soundly
at

if


that
be
her
aim
it

unattained
;
for
at
night
,
when
other
slumber
,


she
be
toss
on
her
pillow
,
or
sit
at
the
foot
of
her
couch
in


the
darkness
,
forgetful
,
apparently
,
of
the
necessity
of
seek
repose
.


often
,
unhappy
girl
!
she
be
cry
--
cry
in
a
sort
of
intolerable


despair
,
which
,
when
it
rush
over
she
,
smite
down
her
strength
,
and


reduce
she
to
childlike
helplessness
.




when
thus
prostrate
,
temptation
besiege
she
.
weak
suggestion


whisper
in
her
weary
heart
to
write
to
Robert
,
and
say
that
she
be


unhappy
because
she
be
forbid
to
see
he
and
Hortense
,
and
that
she


fear
he
would
withdraw
his
friendship
(
not
love
)
from
she
,
and
forget


she
entirely
,
and
beg
he
to
remember
she
,
and
sometimes
to
write
to


she
.
one
or
two
such
letter
she
actually
indite
,
but
she
never
send


they
:
shame
and
good
sense
forbid
.




at
last
the
life
she
lead
reach
the
point
when
it
seem
she
could
bear


it
no
long
,
that
she
must
seek
and
find
a
change
somehow
,
or
her
heart


and
head
would
fail
under
the
pressure
which
strain
they
.
she
long


to
leave
Briarfield
,
to
go
to
some
very
distant
place
.
she
long
for


something
else
--
the
deep
,
secret
,
anxious
yearning
to
discover
and
know


her
mother
strengthen
daily
;
but
with
the
desire
be
couple
a
doubt
,


a
dread
--
if
she
know
she
,
could
she
love
she
?
there
be
cause
for


hesitation
,
for
apprehension
on
this
point
.
never
in
her
life
have
she


hear
that
mother
praise
;
whoever
mention
she
mention
she
coolly
.


her
uncle
seem
to
regard
his
sister
-
in
-
law
with
a
sort
of
tacit


antipathy
;
an
old
servant
,
who
have
live
with
Mrs.
James
Helstone
for
a


short
time
after
her
marriage
,
whenever
she
refer
to
her
former


mistress
,
speak
with
chilling
reserve
--
sometimes
she
call
she
"
queer
,
"


sometimes
she
say
she
do
not
understand
she
.
these
expression
be


ice
to
the
daughter
's
heart
;
they
suggest
the
conclusion
that
it
be


perhaps
well
never
to
know
her
parent
than
to
know
she
and
not
like


she
.




but
one
project
could
she
frame
whose
execution
seem
likely
to
bring


she
a
hope
of
relief
:
it
be
to
take
a
situation
,
to
be
a
governess
;
she


could
do
nothing
else
.
a
little
incident
bring
she
to
the
point
,
when


she
find
courage
to
break
her
design
to
her
uncle
.




her
long
and
late
walk
lie
always
,
as
have
be
say
,
on
lonely
road
;


but
in
whatever
direction
she
have
ramble
--
whether
along
the
drear


skirt
of
Stilbro
'
Moor
or
over
the
sunny
stretch
of
nunnely
Common
--
she


homeward
path
be
still
so
contrived
as
to
lead
she
near
the
Hollow
.
she


rarely
descend
the
den
,
but
she
visit
its
brink
at
twilight
almost


as
regularly
as
the
star
rise
over
the
hillcrest
.
her
resting
-
place


be
at
a
certain
stile
under
a
certain
old
thorn
.
thence
she
could
look


down
on
the
cottage
,
the
mill
,
the
dewy
garden
-
ground
,
the
still
,
deep


dam
;
thence
be
visible
the
well

ask
Caroline
to
herself
as
she
quit
the
room
.




a
week
or
two
pass
;
her
bodily
and
mental
health
neither
grow
bad


nor
well
.
she
be
now
precisely
in
that
state
when
,
if
she


constitution
have
contain
the
seed
of
consumption
,
decline
,

slow


fever
,
those
disease
would
have
be
rapidly
develop
,
and
would
soon


have
carry
she
quietly
from
the
world
.
People
never
die
of
love
or


grief
alone
,
though
some
die
of
inherent
malady
which
the
torture
of


those
passion
prematurely
force
into
destructive
action
.
the
sound
by


nature
undergo
these
torture
,
and
be
rack
,
shake
,
shatter
;
their


beauty
and
bloom
perish
,
but
life
remain
untouched
.
they
be
bring
to


a
certain
point
of
dilapidation
;
they
be
reduce
to
pallor
,
debility
,


and
emaciation
.
People
think
,
as
they
see
they
glide
languidly
about
,


that
they
will
soon
withdraw
to
sick
-
bed
,
perish
there
,
and
cease
from


among
the
healthy
and
happy
.
this
do
not
happen
.
they
live
on
;
and


though
they
can
not
regain
youth
and
gaiety
,
they
may
regain
strength
and


serenity
.
the
blossom
which
the
March
wind
nip
,
but
fail
to
sweep


away
,
may
survive
to
hang
a
withered
apple
on
the
tree
late
into
autumn
:


having
brave
the
last
frost
of
spring
,
it
may
also
brave
the
first
of


winter
.




every
one
notice
the
change

Miss
Helstone

most

say
she
be
go
to

she
never
think
so
herself
.
she
feel


in
no
die
case
;
she
have
neither
pain
nor
sickness
.
her
appetite
be


diminish
;
she
know
the
reason
.
it
be
because
she
weep
so
much
at


night
.
her
strength
be
lessen
;
she
could
account
for
it
.
Sleep
be


coy
and
hard
to
be
win
;
dream
be
distress
and
baleful
.
in
the
far


future
she
still
seem
to
anticipate
a
time
when
this
passage
of
misery


should
be
get
over
,
and
when
she
should
once
more
be
calm

perhaps
never
again
happy
.

embarrassment
be

diffident
Englishwomen
.
Miss

feel


this
,
sympathize
with
the
stranger
,
and
know
by
experience
what
be


good
for
the
timid
,
take
a
seat
quietly
near
she
,
and
begin
to
talk
to


she
with
a
gentle
ease
,
communicate
for
the
moment
by
the
presence
of


one
less
self
-
possess
than
herself
.




she
and
this
lady
would
,
if
alone
,
have
at
once
get
on
extremely
well


together
.
the
lady
have
the
clear
voice
imaginable
--
infinitely
soft


and
more
tuneful
than
could
have
be
reasonably
expect
from
forty


year

and
a
form
decidedly
inclined
to
_
embonpoint

.
this
voice


Caroline
like
;
it
atone
for
the
formal
,
if
correct
,
accent
and


language
.
the
lady
would
soon
have
discover
she
like
it

she
,

in
ten
minute
they
would
have
be
friend

Mr.

stand
on


the

at
they
both

at
the
strange
lady

his
sarcastic
,
keen
eye
,
that
clearly
express
impatience
of
she


chilly
ceremony
,
and
annoyance
at
her
want
of
_
aplomb
_
.
his
hard
gaze


and
rasp
voice
discomfit
the
lady
more
and
more
.
she
try
,


however
,
to
get
up
little
speech
about
the
weather
,
the
aspect
of
the


country
,

.

the
impracticable
Mr.

this

oftener

in

first

her
predilection
increase
greatly

this

hardly

Miss

fancy

too
pretty
a
face

soft
,
to
be
anything
out
of
the
common
way
in

she
very
much
wonder

up
archly
to
the

many
aversion

have
the
comfort
of
laugh


together

false
sentimentality

pompous
pretension

note


from

Home
Secretary

it
appear
they
be
uneasy
at


the
state
of
matter
here
in
the
north
;
they
especially
condemn
the


supineness
and
pusillanimity
of
the
mill

owner

they
say
,
as
I
have


always
say
,
that
inaction
,
under
present
circumstance
,
be
criminal
,


and
that
cowardice
be
cruelty
,
since
both
can
only
encourage
disorder
,


and
lead
finally
to
sanguinary
outbreak

note

it

your
perusal

peruse
they
he
take
his
tea
quietly
;

though
his
tongue


be
still

his
observant
faculty
seem
by
no
means
off
duty

Mrs.

sit
in
the
background

do
not
come
within
the
range

two
young

the
full
benefit
thereof

shape

in
relief

dark
panelling

Shirley
's
clear
cheek

tint

with
the
colour
which
have
rise
into

down

dusk
yet


delicate
line
of
her
eyebrow
,
the
almost
sable
gloss
of
her
curl
,
make


her
heightened
complexion

fine

there
be
natural
grace
in
her
attitude

there
be


artistic
effect
in
the
ample
and
shine
fold
of
her
silk
dress

an


attire
simply

almost
splendid

shifting


brightness
of
its
dye
,
warp
and
woof
being
of
tint
deep

change
as


the
hue
on

a
glancing
bracelet
on
her
arm
produce


the
contrast
of
gold

something
brilliant

whole

be

Moore
think
so
,

his
eye

long
on
it

he
seldom
permit
his
feeling
or
his
opinion


to
exhibit
themselves
in
his
face
.
his
temperament
boast
a
certain


amount
of
phlegm
,

he
prefer
an
undemonstrative
,
not
ungentle
,

serious
aspect
to
any
other

he
continue


the

stand
before

from
the
tenor
of
what
he
say

it


appear
evident
that
they
both
apprehend
disturbance
in
the


neighbourhood
of

in
what
form
they
expect
they

break
out
be
not

neither
Caroline

Mrs.

ask


question

the
subject
do
not
appear
to
be
regard

one
ripe
for


free
discussion

the
lady

her
tenant

suffer

keep


detail

Caroline

a
great
weight
on
my

I
have
get


into

an
eagle

iron

have
fall
under
a


stern
influence

I
scarcely
approve
,

can
not
resist
.
something


will
be
do

long

it
by
no

enter

n't
be

,

you


see
I
all
at
once
turn
outrageously
charitable

I
have
no
idea
how
to


begin
,

you
must
give
I
some
advice

we
will
talk
more
on
the


subject
to

excellent

a

I

rather
a

she

but
they
be
wise
in
abstain
.


to
have
consult
she
--
and
this
they
know
by
instinct
--
would
only
have


be
to
involve
she
in
painful
embarrassment
.
she
be
far
well


inform
,
well
read
,
a
deep
thinker
than
Miss
Ainley
,
but
of


administrative
energy
,
of
executive
activity
,
she
have
none
.
she
would


subscribe
her
own
modest
mite
to
a
charitable
object
willingly
--
secret


almsgive
suited
she
;
but
in
public
plan
,
on
a
large
scale
,
she
could


take
no
part
;
as
to
originate
they
,
that
be
out
of
the
question
.
this


Shirley
know
,
and
therefore
she
do
not
trouble
Mrs.
Pryor
by
unavaile


conference
,
which
could
only
remind
she
of
her
own
deficiency
,
and
do


no
good
.




it
be
a
bright
day
for
Miss
Ainley
when
she
be
summon
to
Fieldhead


to
deliberate
on
project
so
congenial
to
she
;
when
she
be
seat
with


all
honour
and
deference
at
a
table
with
paper
,
pen

and
--
what
be


good
of

draw
up
a
regular
plan


for

relief
to
the
destitute
poor
of

.
she
,
who


know
they
all
,
have
study
their
want
,
have
again
and
again
feel
in
what


way
they
might
well
be
succour
,
could
the
mean
of
succour
only
be


find
,
be
fully
competent
to
the
undertaking
,
and
a
meek
exultation


gladden
her
kind
heart
as
she
feel
herself
able
to
answer
clearly
and


promptly
the
eager
question
put
by
the
two
young
girl
,
as
she
show


they
in
her
answer
how
much
and
what
serviceable
knowledge
she
have


acquire
of
the
condition
of
her
fellow

creature
around
she
.




Shirley
place
at
her
disposal
£
300
,
and
at
sight
of
the
money
Miss


Ainley
's
eye
fill
with
joyful
tear
;
for
she
already
see
the
hungry


feed
,
the
naked
clothe
,
the
sick
comfort
thereby
.
she
quickly
draw
up


a
simple
,
sensible
plan
for
its
expenditure
;
and
she
assure
they


bright
time
would
now
come
round
,
for
she
doubt
not
the
lady
of


Fieldhead
's
example
would
be
follow
by
other
.
she
should
try
to
get


additional
subscription
,
and
to
form
a
fund
;
but
first
she
must
consult


the
clergy
.
yes
,
on
that
point
she
be
peremptory
.
Mr.
Helstone
,
Dr.


boultby
,
Mr.
Hall
,
_
must
_
be
consult
(
for
not
only
must
Briarfield
be


relieve
,
but
Whinbury
and
nunnely
)
.
it
would
,
she
aver
,
be


presumption
in
she
to
take
a
single
step
unauthorized
by
they
.




the
clergy
be
sacred
being
in
Miss
Ainley
's
eye
;
no
matter
what


might
be
the
insignificance
of
the
individual
,
his
station
make
he


holy
.
the
very
curate
--
who
,
in
their
trivial
arrogance
,
be
hardly


worthy
to
tie
her
patten
-
string
,
or
carry
her
cotton
umbrella
,
or
check


woollen
shawl
--
she
,
in
her
pure
,
sincere
enthusiasm
,
look
upon
as


suck
saint
.
no
matter
how
clearly
their
little
vice
and
enormous


absurdity
be
point
out
to
she
,
she
could
not
see
they
;
she
be


blind
to
ecclesiastical
defect
;
the
white
surplice
cover
a
multitude


of
sin
.




Shirley
,
know
this
harmless
infatuation
on
the
part
of
she


recently
-
choose
prime
minister
,
stipulate
expressly
that
the
curate


be
to
have
no
voice
in
the
disposal
of
the
money
,
that
their
meddling


finger
be
not
to
be
insert
into
the
pie
.
the
rector
,
of
course
,


must
be
paramount
,
and
they
might
be
trust
.
they
have
some
experience
,


some
sagacity
,
and
Mr.
Hall
,
at
least
,
have
sympathy
and
loving
-
kindness


for
his
fellow
-
man
;
but
as
for
the
youth
under
they
,
they
must
be
set


aside
,
keep
down
,
and
teach
that
subordination
and
silence
well
become


their
year
and
capacity
.




it
be
with
some
horror
Miss
Ainley
hear
this
language
.
Caroline
,


however
,
interpose
with
a
mild
word
or
two
in
praise
of
Mr
Sweeting
,


calm
she
again
.
sweeting
be
,
indeed
,
her
own
favourite
.
she


endeavour
to
respect
Messrs.
Malone
and
Donne
,
but
the
slice
of


sponge
-
cake
and
glass
of
cowslip
or
primrose
wine
she
have
at
different


time
administer
to
Sweeting
,
when
he
come
to
see
she
in
her
little


cottage
,
be
ever
offer
with
sentiment
of
truly
motherly
regard
.
the


same
innocuous
collation
she
have
once
present
to
Malone
;
but
that


personage
evince
such
open
scorn
of
the
offering
,
she
have
never


venture
to
renew
it
.
to
Donne
she
always
serve
the
treat
,
and
be


happy
to
see
his
approbation
of
it
prove
beyond
a
doubt
by
the
fact
of


his
usually
eat
two
piece
of
cake
,
and
put
a
third
in
his


pocket
.




indefatigable
in
her
exertion
where
good
be
to
be
do
,
Miss
Ainley


would
immediately
have
set
out
on
a
walk
of
ten
mile
round
to
the
three


rector
,
in
order
to
show
her
plan
,
and
humbly
solicit
their
approval
;


but
Miss
Keeldar
interdict
this
,
and
propose
,
as
an
amendment
,
to


collect
the
clergy
in
a
small
select
reunion
that
evening
at
Fieldhead
.


Miss
Ainley
be
to
meet
they
,
and
the
plan
be
to
be
discuss
in
full


privy
council
.




Shirley
manage
to
get

accordingly
,
and


before
the

arrival
,

have
,
far
,
talk
all
the

the
most
charming
mood
imaginable
.
she
herself
have
take


in

Dr.
Boultby
and
Mr.

.
the
first

a
stubborn
old


welshman
,

,
and
obstinate
,
but
withal
a
man
who

great
deal
of
good
,

noise
about
it
.
the


latter

.
she
have
rather
a
friendly
feeling
for
both
,
especially


for
old
Helstone
;
and
it
cost
she
no
trouble
to
be
quite
delightful
to


they
.
she
take
they
round
the
garden
;
she
gather
they
flower
;
she
be


like
a

seem
to
fear

and
Mr.

never
fail


to
avail
himself
of
this
privilege
when
he
possibly
could
.
such


preference
show
by
a
single
gentleman
to
a
single
lady
would
certainly
,


in
ordinary
case
,
have
set
in
motion
the
tongue
of
the
gossip
;

with
a
sort
of

could
not
have
bring
himself
to
attempt
to
give


another
colour
to
her
sentiment
,

they
form
a
trio
which
the
gay
and


thoughtless
would
have
scorn
,
indeed
,
as
quite
worthless
and


unattractive

a
middle

aged
widow

two
plain

his
consent
he
consider

weighty
to
be
give
in
a
hurry
.
helstone


glance
sharply
round
with
an
alert
,
suspicious
expression
,

at
work
,
and
that
something
in

underhand
to
acquire

much
influence
,

itself
of
too
much
importance

Shirley
catch

take
its
sentinel

survey

remember
once
see
a

usually

sleepy

secretly
on

an

chill
my

it

in
that
quarter
so
wondrously
unexpected

that
for

it
off

heart

it
in
its
farth

she

the


fine

she
cease

a
very
bull

he
have
sense
to
feel
that
,
since
he
could


not
challenge
the
owner
of

grow
presently


_

March

come
in
like
a
lion
,
he
purpose
to
go
out
like
a
lamb
.




for
the
sake
of
air
,
as
it
appear
,
or
perhaps
for
that
of
ready
exit


in
case
of
some
new
emergency
arise
,
he
take
his
seat,--not
on
the


sofa
,
where
Miss
Keeldar
offer
he
enthronization
,
nor
yet
near
the


fireside

to
which
Caroline

by
a
friendly
sign

no
long
sullen

furious
,

,
after
his
fashion

embarrassed

he
talk
to
the


lady
by
fit
and
start
,
choose
for
topic
whatever
be
most


intensely
commonplace
.
he
sigh
deeply
,
significantly
,
at
the
close
of


every
sentence
;
he
sigh
in
each
pause
;
he
sigh
ere
he
open
his


mouth
.
at
last
,
find
it
desirable
to
add
ease
to
his
other
charm
,
he


draw
forth
to
aid
he
an
ample
silk
pocket
-
handkerchief
.
this
be
to
be


the
graceful
toy
with
which
his
unoccupied
hand
be
to
trifle
.
he
go


to
work
with
a
certain
energy
.
he
fold
the
red
-
and
-
yellow
square


cornerwise
;
he
whip
it
open
with
a
waft
;
again
he
fold
it
in


narrow
compass
;
he
make
of
it
a
handsome
band
.
to
what
purpose
would


he
proceed
to
apply
the
ligature
?
would
he
wrap
it
about
his
throat
--
his


head
?
should
it
be
a
comforter
or
a
turban
?
neither
.
Peter
Augustus
have


an
inventive
,
an
original
genius
.
he
be
about
to
show
the
lady
grace


of
action
possess
at
least
the
charm
of
novelty
.
he
sit
on
the
chair


with
his
athletic
irish
leg
cross
,
and
these
leg
,
in
that
attitude
,


he
circle
with
the
bandana
and
bind
firmly
together
.
it
be
evident


he
feel
this
device
to
be
worth
an
encore
;
he
repeat
it
more
than


once
.
the
second
performance
send
Shirley
to
the
window
,
to
laugh
she


silent
but
irrepressible
laugh
unseen
;
it
turn
Caroline
's
head
aside
,


that
her
long
curl
might
screen
the
smile
mantle
on
her
feature
.


Miss
Helstone
,
indeed
,
be
amuse
by
more
than
one
point
in
Peter
's


demeanour
.
she
be
edify
at
the
complete
though
abrupt
diversion
of


his
homage
from
herself
to
the
heiress
.
the
£
5,000
he
suppose
she


likely
one
day
to
inherit
be
not
to
be
weigh
in
the
balance
against


Miss
Keeldar
's
estate
and
hall
.
he
take
no
pain
to
conceal
his


calculation
and
tactic
.
he
pretend
to
no
gradual
change
of
view
;
he


wheel
about
at
once
.
the
pursuit
of
the
less
fortune
be
openly


relinquish
for
that
of
the
great
.
on
what
ground
he
expect
to


succeed
in
his
chase
himself
well
know
;
certainly
not
by
skilful


management
.




from
the
length
of
time
that
elapse
,
it
appear
that
John
have
some


difficulty
in
persuade
Mr.
Donne
to
descend
.
at
length
,
however
,
that


gentleman
appear
;
nor
,
as
he
present
himself
at
the
oak

,
do
he
seem
in
the
slight
degree
ashamed
or
confused
--
not
a


whit
.
Donne
,
indeed
,
be
of
that
coldly
phlegmatic
,
immovably


complacent
,
densely
self
-
satisfied
nature
which
be
insensible
to
shame
.


he
have
never
blush
in
his
life
;
no
humiliation
could
abash
he
;
his


nerve
be
not
capable
of
sensation
enough
to
stir
his
life
and
make


colour
mount
to
his
cheek
;
he
have
no
fire
in
his
blood

no
modesty
in


his
soul
;
he
be
a
frontless
,
arrogant
,
decorous
slip
of
the


commonplace
--
conceite
,
inane
,
insipid
;
and
this
gentleman
have
a
notion


of
woo
Miss

he
know
no

he
should
have
formally
visit
she
a
few
time
,
to
write
a


letter
propose
marriage
.
then
he
calculate
she
would
accept
he
for


love
of
his
office
;
then
they
would
be
marry
;
then
he
should
be
master


of
Fieldhead

he

live
very
comfortably

his


command

eat
and
drink

you

suspect
his
intention
when
he

six
month
--
of
the


reign
of
the

,

I
be
safe
;
for

you

in

you
be

as

tranquillity
of

to
the
permanent
good
effect
of


your
charitable
fund

I
doubt
.
eleemosynary
relief
never
yet


tranquillize
the
working
-
class
--
it
never
make
they
grateful
;
it
be


not
in
human
nature
that
it
should
.
I
suppose
,
be
all
thing
order


aright
,
they
ought
not
to
be
in
a
position
to
need
that
humiliating


relief
;
and
this
they
feel
.
we
should
feel
it
be
we
so
place
.


besides
,
to
whom
should
they
be
grateful
?
to
you
,
to
the
clergy
perhaps
,


but
not
to
we
mill
-
owner
.
they
hate
we
bad
than
ever
.
then
the


disaffect
here
be
in
correspondence
with
the
disaffect

Birmingham

the

for
the

the

it

most
populous
parish
--
Whinbury
far
outdo
it

it
so

strong

this

it
drag
her
perforce
into
public
,


compel
she
to
face
all
that
be
wealthy
,
respectable
,
influential
in


the
neighbourhood
;
in
whose
presence
,
but
for
the
kind
countenance
of


Mr.
Hall
,
she
would
have
appear
unsupported
.
oblige
to
be


conspicuous
;
oblige
to
walk
at
the
head
of
her
regiment
as
the
rector
's


niece
,
and
first
teacher

tea
at
the


first
table
for
a
mixed
multitude
of
lady
and
gentleman

to
do
all


this
without
the
countenance
of
mother
,
aunt
,
or
other
chaperon
--
she
,

,

a
nervous
person
,
who
mortally
fear
publicity
--
it
will


be
comprehend
that
,
under
these
circumstance
,
she
tremble
at
the


approach
of
Whitsuntide
.




but
this
year
Shirley
be
to
be
with
she
,
and
that
change
the
aspect
of


the
trial
singularly
--
it
change
it
utterly
.
it
be
a
trial
no


long
--
it
be
almost
an
enjoyment
.
Miss
Keeldar

well
in

single
self
than
a
host
of
ordinary
friend
.
quite
self
-
possess
,
and


always
spirited
and
easy
;
conscious
of
her
social
importance
,
yet
never


presume
upon
it
--
it
would
be
enough
to
give
one
courage
only
to
look


at
she
.
the
only
fear
be
lest
the
heiress
should
not
be
punctual
to


tryst
.
she
often
have
a
careless
way
of
linger
behind
time
,
and


Caroline
know
her
uncle
would
not
wait
a
second
for
any
one
.
at
the


moment
of
the
church
clock
tolling
two
,
the
bell
would
clash
out
and


the
march
begin
.
she
must
look
after
Shirley
,
then
,
in
this
matter
,
or


her
expect
companion
would
fail
she
.




whit
-
Tuesday
see
she
rise
almost
with
the
sun
.
she
,
Fanny
,
and
Eliza


be
busy
the
whole
morning
arrange
the
rectory
parlour
in
first
-
rate


company
order
,
and
set
out
a
collation
of
cool


refreshment
--
wine
,
fruit
,
cake
--
on
the
dining
-
room
sideboard
.
then
she


have
to
dress
in
her
fresh
and
fairest
attire
of
white
muslin
:
the


perfect
fineness
of
the
day
and
the
solemnity
of
the
occasion
warrant
,


and
even
exact
,
such
costume
.
her
new
sash
--
a
birthday
present
from


Margaret
Hall
,
which
she
have
reason
to
believe
Cyril
himself
have
buy
,


and
in
return
for
which
she
have
indeed
give
he
a
set
of
cambric
band


in
a
handsome
case
--
be
tie
by
the
dexterous
finger
of
Fanny
,
who
take


no
little
pleasure
in
array
her
fair
young
mistress
for
the
occasion
.


her
simple
bonnet
have
be
trim
to
correspond
with
her
sash
;
she


pretty
but
inexpensive
scarf
of
white
crape
suit
her
dress
.
when
ready


she
form
a
picture
,
not
bright
enough
to
dazzle
,
but
fair
enough
to


interest
;
not
brilliantly
striking
,
but
very
delicately
pleasing
--
a


picture
in
which
sweetness
of
tint
,
purity
of
air
,
and
grace
of
mien


atone
for
the
absence
of
rich
colouring
and
magnificent
contour
.
what


her
brown
eye
and
clear
forehead
show
of
her
mind
be
in
keep
with


her
dress
and
face
--
modest
,
gentle
,
and
,
though
pensive
,
harmonious
.
it


appear
that
neither
lamb
nor
dove
need
fear
she
,
but
would
welcome


rather
,
in
her
look
of
simplicity
and
softness
,
a
sympathy
with
their


own
nature
,
or
with
the
nature
we
ascribe
to
they
.




after
all
,
she
be
an
imperfect
,
faulty
human
being
,
fair
enough
of


form
,
hue
,
and
array
,
but
,
as
Cyril
Hall
say
,
neither
so
good
nor
so


great
as
the
withered
Miss
Ainley
,
now
put
on
her
good
black
gown


and
Quaker
drab
shawl
and
bonnet
in
her
own
narrow
cottage
chamber
.




away
Caroline
go
,
across
some
very
sequester
field
and
through
some


quite
hide
lane
,
to
Fieldhead
.
she
glide
quickly
under
the
green


hedge
and
across
the
greener
leas
.
there
be
no
dust
,
no
moisture
,
to


soil
the
hem
of
her
stainless
garment
,
or
to
damp
her
slender
sandal
.


after
the
late
rain
all
be
clean
,
and
under
the
present
glow
sun


all
be
dry
.
she
walk
fearlessly
,
then
,
on
daisy
and
turf
,
and
through


thick
plantation
;
she
reach
Fieldhead
,
and
penetrate
to
Miss


Keeldar
's
dressing
-
room
.




it
be
well
she
have
come
,
or
Shirley
would
have
be
too
late
.
instead


of
make
ready
with
all
speed
,
she
lie
stretch
on
a
couch
,
absorb


in
reading
.
Mrs.
Pryor
stand
near
,
vainly
urge
she
to
rise
and
dress
.


Caroline
waste
no
word
.
she
immediately
take
the
book
from
she
,
and


with
her
own
hand
commence
the
business
of
disrobe
and
rerobe
she
.


Shirley
,
indolent
with
the
heat
,
and
gay
with
her
youth
and
pleasurable


nature
,
want
to
talk
,
laugh
,
and
linger
;
but
Caroline
,
intent
on
be


in
time
,
persevere
in
dress
she
as
fast
as
finger
could
fasten


string
or
insert
pin
.
at
length
,
as
she
unite
a
final
row
of
hook


and
eye
,
she
find
leisure
to
chide
she
,
say
she
be
very
naughty
to


be
so
unpunctual
,
that
she
look
even
now
the
picture
of
incorrigible


carelessness
;
and
so
Shirley
do
,
but
a
very
lovely
picture
of
that


tiresome
quality
.




she
present
quite
a
contrast
to
Caroline
.
there
be
style
in
every


fold
of
her
dress
and
every
line
of
her
figure
.
the
rich
silk
suit
she


well
than
a
simple
costume
;
the
deep
embroider
scarf
become
she
.


she
wear
it
negligently
but
gracefully
.
the
wreath
on
her

a

all
about

be
pragmatical
and

complacent
,
from

to

on
,
Mr.
Donne
!
you
have
undergo
scrutiny
.
you
think
you
look


well
.
whether
the
white
and
purple
figure
watch
you
from
yonder
hill


think
so
be
another
question
.




these
figure
come
run
down
when
the
regiment
have
march
by
.
the


churchyard
be
full
of
child
and
teacher
,
all
in
their
very
good


holiday
attire
;
and
,
distressed
as
be
the
district
,
bad
as
be
the


time
,
it
be
wonderful
to
see
how
respectably
,
how
handsomely
even
,
they


have
contrive
to
clothe
themselves
.
that
british
love
of
decency
will


work
miracle
.
the
poverty
which
reduce
an
irish
girl
to
rag
be


impotent
to
rob
the
english
girl
of
the
neat
wardrobe
she
know


necessary
to
her
self
-
respect
.
besides
,
the

have
really
do
they
good
.
her
seasonable
bounty
console
many
a


poor
family
against
the
come
holiday
,
and
supply
many
a
child
with
a


new
frock
or
bonnet
for
the
occasion
.
she
know
it
,
and
be
elate
with


the
consciousness
--
glad
that
her
money
,
example
,
and
influence
have


really
,
substantially
,
benefit
those
around
she
.
she
can
not

charitable
like
Miss
Ainley
:
it
be
not
in
her
nature
.
it
relieve
she
to


feel
that
there
be
another
way
of

charitable
,
practicable
for


other

under
other
circumstance
.

for
she
also
have

good
in
her
small

herself
of
more
than
one

ribbon
,

she
could


ill
spare
,
to
aid
in
fit
out
the
scholar
of
her
class
;
and
as
she


could
not
give
money
,
she
have
follow
Miss
Ainley
's
example
in

Caroline
and
Shirley
be
soon
in
the

of
the
company

the
former

they
very
easily
for
she
.
instead
of
sit
down
in
a
retired


corner
,
or
steal
away
to
her
own
room

the
procession
should
be

accord
to
she
wo

,
she
move
through
the
three


parlour
,
converse
and
smile
,
absolutely
speak
once
or
twice
ere
she


be
speak
to
,
and
,
in
short
,
seem
a
new
creature
.
it
be
Shirley
's


presence
which
thus
transform
she
;
the
view
of
Miss
Keeldar
's
air
and


manner
do
she
a
world
of
good
.
Shirley
have
no
fear
of
her
kind
,
no


tendency
to
shrink
from
,
to
avoid
it
.
all
human
being
--
man
,
woman
,
or


child
--
whom
low
breeding
or
coarse
presumption
do
not
render


positively
offensive
,
be
welcome
enough
to
she
--
some
much
more
so
than


other
,
of
course
;
but
,
generally
speak
,
till
a
man
have
indisputably


prove
himself
bad
and
a
nuisance
,
Shirley
be
willing
to
think
he
good


and
an
acquisition
,
and
to
treat
he
accordingly
.
this
disposition
make


her
a
general
favourite
,
for
it
rob
her
very
raillery
of
its
sting
,


and
give
she
serious
or
smile
conversation
a
happy
charm
;
nor
do
it


diminish
the
value
of
her
intimate
friendship
,
which
be
a
distinct


thing
from
this
social
benevolence
--
depend
,
indeed
,
on
quite
a


different
part
of
her
character
.
Miss
Helstone
be
the
choice
of
she


affection
and
intellect
;
the
Misses
Pearson
,
Sykes
,
Wynne
,

.
,
etc
.
,


only
the
profiteer
by
her
good
-
nature
and
vivacity
.




Donne
happen
to
come
into
the
drawing
-
room
while
Shirley
,
sit
on


the
sofa
,
form
the
centre
of
a
tolerably
wide
circle
.
she
have
already


forget
her
exasperation
against
he
,
and
she
bow
and
smile


good
-
humouredly
.
the
disposition
of
the
man
be
then
see
.
he
know


neither
how
to
decline
the
advance
with
dignity
,
as
one
whose
just
pride


have
be
wound
,
nor
how
to
meet
it
with
frankness
,
as
one
who
be
glad


to
forget
and
forgive
.
his
punishment
have
impress
he
with
no
sense
of


shame
,
and
he
do
not
experience
that
feel
on
encounter
his


chastiser
.
he
be
not
vigorous
enough
in
evil
to
be
actively


malignant
--
he
merely
pass
by
sheepishly
with
a
rate
,
scowl
look
.


nothing
could
ever
again
reconcile
he
to
his
enemy
;
while
no
passion
of


resentment
,
for
even
sharp
and
more
ignominious
infliction
,
could
his


lymphatic
nature
know
.




"
he
be
not
worth
a
scene
!
"
say
Shirley
to
Caroline
.
"
what
a
fool
I


be
!
to
revenge
on
poor
Donne
his
silly
spite
at
Yorkshire
be
something


like
crush
a
gnat
for
attack
the
hide
of
a
rhinoceros
.
have
I
be


a
gentleman

believe
I
should
have
help
he
off
the
premise
by
dint


of
physical
force
.
I
be
glad
now
I
only
employ
the
moral
weapon
.
but


he
must
come
near
I
no
more
.
I
do
n't
like
he
.
he
irritate
I
.
there


be
not
even
amusement
to
be
have
out
of

"




it
seem
as
if
Malone
wish
to
justify
the
preference

the
word

scarcely
out

the
most
cunning
pencil

justice

who
,
after
this
,
could
dare
to
say
that
Peter
be


not
a
lady
's
man
?
he
have
gather
and
he
have
give
flower
;
he
have


offer
a
sentimental
,
a
poetic
tribute
at
the
shrine
of
Love
or
Mammon
.


hercule
hold
the
distaff
be
but
a
faint
type
of
Peter
bear
the


rose

he
must
have
think
this
himself
,
for
he
seem
amazed
at
what


he
have
do
.
he
back
without
a
word
;
he
be
go
away
with
a
husky


chuckle
of
self
-
satisfaction
;
then
he
bethink
himself
to
stop
and


turn
,
to
ascertain
by
ocular
testimony
that
he
really
have
present
a


bouquet
.
yes
,
there
be
the
six
red
cabbage
on
the
purple
satin
lap

a


very
white
hand

some
gold

take
a
turn
down

in
his
walk

interchange


greeting
with
other

that

opinion

now
look

all
well
known
to


herself
,

all
of
the
order
whom
she
systematically
avoid
whenever


avoidance
be
possible
.
Shyer
at
some
moment
than
at
other
,
she
feel


just
now
no
courage
at
all
to
join
this
company
.
she
could
not
,
however
,


stand
alone
where
all
other
go
in
pair
or
party
;
so
she
approach


a
group
of
her
own
scholar
,
great
girl
,

rather
young
woman

out

they
be
not
more
in

she
of
they

she


draw
near
they
now

rather
to
find
protection
in
their
company
than
to


patronize
they
with
her
presence
.
by
some
instinct
they
know
she


weakness

with
natural
politeness
they
respect
it
.

on

off

they
do
not
take
advantage

it
.
peasant
girl
as

too
much
of
our
own
english
sensibility
to
be
guilty
of
the
coarse


error

they
stand
round
she
still

civil
,
friendly
,
receive
her
slight


smile

rather
hurried

prepare

have
fortify

garrison
his
mill

in
itself

a
strong
building

a


cool
,
brave
man

to
the
defence
with
unflinche
firmness

those
who
be
with
he
catch
his
spirit

copy
his
demeanour
.
the


rioter
have
never
be
so
meet
before

at

have
attack


they
have
find
no
resistance
;
an
organized
,
resolute
defence
be
what


they
never

.
when
their
leader

the
steady


fire
keep
up
from
the

the
composure

determination

its
owner

hear
themselves
coolly
defy

invite
on
to
death

behold
their
man
fall
wound

nothing

they
disperse
wide
over
the
field
,

silence

ruin
behind

have

conflict
would
now
wish
to
hasten
to
the

never
sleep
at


the
rectory
before

and
though
the
recent
scene
be
one
unparalleled
for


excitement
and
terror
by
any
it

hitherto

her
lot

eye

her
sense

perfect
health

Shirley
's
enviable
portion

though
warm

hearted
and


sympathetic
,
she
be
not
nervous
;
powerful
emotion
could
rouse
and
sway


without
exhaust
her
spirit
.
the
tempest
troubled
and
shake
she
while

it
leave
her
elasticity
unbent

freshness

emotion

so
every
night

Caroline
now
watch
her
sleeping

and
read


the
serenity
of
her
mind
in
the
beauty
of
her
happy
countenance

herself

a
different
temperament

could
not
sleep

the


commonplace
excitement
of
the
tea
-
drinking
and
school
-
gathering
would


alone
have
suffice
to
make
her
restless
all
night
;
the
effect
of
the


terrible
drama
which
have
just
be
enact
before
her
eye
be
not


likely
to
quit
she
for
day
.
it
be
vain
even
to
try
to
retain
a


recumbent
posture
;
she
sit
up
by
Shirley
's
side
,
count
the
slow


minute
,
and
watch
the
June
sun
mount
the
heavens
.




life
waste
fast
in
such
vigil
as
Caroline
have
of
late
but
too
often


keep
--
vigil
during
which
the
mind
,
have
no
pleasant
food
to
nourish


it
,
no
manna
of
hope
,
no
hive
-
honey
of
joyous
memory
,
try
to
live


on
the
meagre
diet
of
wish
,
and
fail
to
derive
thence
either


delight
or
support
,
and
feel
itself
ready
to
perish
with
crave


want
,
turn
to
philosophy
,
to
resolution
,
to
resignation
;
call
on
all


these
god
for
aid

call
vainly

unheard
,
unhelped
,

languishe

Caroline
be
a
Christian
;
therefore
in
trouble
she
frame
many
a
prayer


after
the
christian
creed
,
prefer
it
with
deep
earnestness
,
beg


for
patience
,
strength
,
relief
.
this
world
,
however
,
we
all
know
,
be
the


scene
of
trial
and
probation
;
and
,
for
any
favourable
result
she


petition
have
yet
work
,
it
seem
to
she
that
they
be
unheard
and


unaccepte
.
she
believe
,
sometimes
,
that
God
have
turn
his
face
from


she
.
at
moment
she
be
a
calvinist
,
and
,
sink
into
the
gulf
of


religious
despair
,
she
see
darken
over
she
the
doom
of
reprobation

Most
people
have
have
a
period
or
period
in
their
life
when
they
have


feel
thus
forsake

when
,
having
long
hope
against
hope
,
and
still
see


the
day
of
fruition
defer
,
their
heart
have
truly
sicken
within


they
.
this
be
a
terrible
hour
,
but
it
be
often
that
dark
point
which


precede
the
rise
of
day

that
turn
of
the
year

prophecy
of

spring

the

bird
,
however
,
can
not
thus


understand
the
blast
before
which
they
shiver
;
and
as
little
can
the


suffer
soul
recognize
,
in
the
climax
of
its
affliction
,
the
dawn
of


its
deliverance
.
yet
,
let
whoever
grieve
still
cle
fast

love

a


thorny

take
up

again
five

find
that
lady
deeply
depressed

not

that


Miss

hastiness
have
hurt
her
feeling

it
be
evident
an


inward
wound

she
.
to
any

a
congenial
nature

would
have

insensible

Miss

I

I
think
Miss

should
have
know
my
character
well
enough
by
this
time
to
be
aware

I
always
feel
an
even
painful

the
alarm
of
the
night

I
could
not
venture
to
act


promptly
for
another

I
trust
no
serious
harm
will
result
from
my


lapse
of
firmness

Hiram

"




from
a
man
Mr.

would
not
have
bear
this
language
very
patiently
,


nor
would
he
have
endure
it
from
some

honest

pretty
,
and
her
plain

he
.
besides
,
he


take
a
secret
pleasure
in
hear
she
defend
her
tenant
,
for
we
have


already
intimate
he
have
Robert
Moore
's
interest
very
much
at
heart
.


moreover
,
if
he
wish
to
avenge
himself
for
her
severity
,
he
know
the


mean
lie
in
his
power
:
a
word
,
he
believe
,
would
suffice
to
tame
and


silence
she
,
to
cover
her
frank
forehead
with
the
rosy
shadow
of
shame
,


and
veil
the
glow
of
her
eye
under
down
-
droop
lid
and
lash
.




"
what
more
hast
thou
to
say
?
"
he
inquire
,
as
she
pause
,
rather
,
it


appear
,
to
take
breath
than
because
her
subject
or
her
zeal
be


exhausted
.




"
say
,
Mr.
Yorke
!
"
be
the
answer
,
the
speaker
meantime
walk
fast
from


wall
to
wall
of
the
oak
parlour--"say
?
I
have
a
great
deal
to
say
,
if
I


could
get
it
out
in
lucid
order
,
which
I
never
_
can
_
do
.
I
have
to
say


that
your
view
,
and
those
of
most
extreme
politician
,
be
such
as
none


but
man
in
an
irresponsible
position
_
can
_
advocate
;
that
they
be


purely
opposition
view
,
mean
only
to
be
talk
about
,
and
never


intend
to
be
act
on
.
make
you
Prime
Minister
of
England
to

you
would
have
to
abandon

you

Moore
for

his


mill

you
be
in
Moore
's
place
you
could
not
with
honour
or
sense


have
act
otherwise
than
he
act
.
you
abuse
Mr.
Helstone
for


everything
he
do
.
Mr.
Helstone
have
his
fault
;
he
sometimes
do


wrong
,
but
oftener
right
.
be
you
ordained
vicar
of
Briarfield
,
you


would
find
it
no
easy
task
to
sustain
all
the
active
scheme
for
the


benefit
of
the
parish
plan
and
persevere
in
by
your
predecessor
.
I


wonder
people
can
not
judge
more
fairly
of
each
other
and
themselves
.


when
I
hear
Messrs.
Malone
and
Donne
chatter
about
the
authority
of
the


church
,
the
dignity
and
claim
of
the
priesthood
,
the
deference
due
to


they
as
clergyman
;
when
I
hear
the
outbreak
of
their
small
spite


against
Dissenters
;
when
I
witness
their
silly
,
narrow
jealousy
and


assumption
;
when
their
palaver
about
form
,
and
tradition
,
and


superstition
be
sound
in
my
ear
;
when
I
behold
their
insolent


carriage
to
the
poor
,
their
often
base
servility
to
the
rich
--
I
think


the
Establishment
be
indeed
in
a
poor
way
,
and
both
she
and
her
son


appear
in
the
utmost
need
of
reformation
.
turn
away
distressed
from


minster
tower
and
village
spire
--
ay
,
as
distressed
as
a
churchwarden
who


feel
the
exigence
of
white

I

pampered
parson

circumstance

then
,
Mr.

doubt
clutch
my

to

seek


byway

lonely
lane

one
companion

prefer
to
total
solitude

in
solitude

vague
fear
of
annoying

the
enjoyment
of
quite
lonely
ramble
.

she
fear
nothing

get
away
from

habitation

enter


the
still
demesne

by
this
one
youthful
friend

propitious
change
seem
to
steal
over

about
the
various

in
the
tree
,

their
specie
,

something
about
their
habit

intimation
of

it
appear
that

minutely
study
the
botany
of

to

life
.






only
half
of
Moore
's
activity
and
resolution
have
be
see
in
his


defence
of
the
mill
;
he
show
the
other
half
(
and
a
terrible
half
it


be
)
in
the
indefatigable
,
the
relentless
assiduity
with
which
he


pursue
the
leader
of
the
riot
.
the
mob
,
the
mere
follower
,
he
let


alone
.
perhaps
an
innate
sense
of
justice
tell
he
that
man
mislead
by


false
counsel
and
goad
by
privation
be
not
fit
object
of
vengeance
,


and
that
he
who
would
visit
an
even
violent
act
on
the
bent
head
of


suffering
be
a
tyrant
,
not
a
judge
.
at
all
event
,
though
he
know
many


of
the
number
,
having
recognize
they
during
the
latter
part
of
the


attack
when
day
begin
to
dawn
,
he
let
they
daily
pass
he
on
street
and


road
without
notice
or
threat
.




the
leader
he
do
not
know
.
they
be
stranger
--
emissary
from
the


large
town
.
Most
of
these
be
not
member
of
the
operative
class
.
they


be
chiefly
"
down

draught
,
"
bankrupt
,
man
always
in
debt

often
in


drink

who
have
nothing
to
lose
,

much
,
in
the
way
of
character
,


cash
,
and
cleanliness
,

gain
.
these
person
Moore
hunt
like
any


sleuth
-
hound
,
and
well
he
like
the
occupation
.
its
excitement
be
of
a


kind
pleasant
to
his
nature
.
he
like
it
well
than
make
cloth
.




his
horse
must
have
hate
these
time
,
for
it
be
ride
both
hard
and


often
.
he
almost
live
on
the
road
,
and
the
fresh
air
be
as
welcome
to


his
lung
as
the
policeman
's
quest
to
his
mood
;
he
prefer
it
to
the


steam
of
dye
-
house
.
the
magistrate
of
the
district
must
have
dread


he
.
they
be
slow
,
timid
man
;
he
like
both
to
frighten
and
to
rouse


they
.
he
like
to
force
they
to
betray
a
certain
fear
,
which
make
they


alike
falter
in
resolve
and
recoil
in
action
--
the
fear
,
simply
,
of


assassination
.
this
,
indeed
,
be
the
dread
which
have
hitherto
hamper


every
manufacturer
and
almost
every
public
man
in
the
district
.
helstone


alone
have
ever
repel
it
.
the
old
Cossack
know
well
he
might
be
shoot
.


he
know
there
be
risk
;
but
such
death
have
for
his
nerve
no
terror
.
it


would
have
be
his
choose
,
might
he
have
have
a
choice
.




Moore
likewise
know
his
danger
.
the
result
be
an
unquenchable
scorn
of


the
quarter
whence
such
danger
be
to
be
apprehend
.
the
consciousness


that
he
hunt
assassin
be
the
spur
in
his
high
-
mettle
temper
's


flank
.
as
for
fear
,
he
be
too
proud
,
too
hard
-
natured
(
if
you
will
)
,


too
phlegmatic
a
man
to
fear
.
many
a
time
he
ride
belate
over
the


moor
,
moonlit
or
moonless
as
the
case
might
be
,
with
feeling
far
more


elate
,
faculty
far
well
refresh
,
than
when
safety

off

suppose
to
lie
near
Birmingham

not

his

mill

light
task

not

in

entrance

grim
metal
darling
--
the
machine

justice
and
exact


business
claim
his
energy
and
harass
his
thought

he
now
and
then


give
one
moment
,
dedicate
one
effort
,
to
keep
alive
gentler
fire
than


those
which
smoulder
in
the
fane
of
Nemesis
,
it
be
not
easy
to


discover
.
he
seldom
go
near
Fieldhead
;
if
he
do
,
his
visit
be


brief
.
if
he
call
at
the
rectory
,
it
be
only
to
hold
conference
with


the
rector
in
his
study
.
he
maintain
his
rigid
course
very
steadily
.


meantime
the
history
of
the
year
continue
trouble
.
there
be
no
lull


in
the
temp
of
war
;
her
long
hurricane
still
sweep
the
continent
.


there
be
not
the
faint
sign
of
serene
weather
,
no
opening
amid
"
the


cloud
of
battle
-
dust
and
smoke
,
"
no
fall
of
pure
dew
genial
to
the


olive
,
no
cessation
of
the
red
rain
which
nourish
the
baleful
and


glorious
laurel
.
meantime
,
Ruin
have
her
sapper
and
miner
at
work
under


Moore
's
foot
,
and
whether
he
ride
or
walk
,
whether
he
only
cross
his


count
-
house
hearth
or
gallop
over
sullen
Rushedge
,
he
be
aware
of


a
hollow
echo
,
and
feel
the
ground
shake
to
his
tread
.




while
the
summer
thus
pass
with
Moore
,
how
do
it
lapse
with
Shirley


and
Caroline
?
let
we
first
visit
the
heiress
.
how
do
she
look
?
like
a


love
-
lorn
maiden
,
pale
and
pine
for
a
neglectful
swain
?
do
she
sit


the
day
long
bent
over
some
sedentary
task
?
have
she
for
ever
a
book
in


her
hand
,
or
sew
on
her
knee
,
and
eye
only
for
that
,
and
word
for


nothing
,
and
thought
unspoken
?




by
no
means
.
Shirley
be
all
right
.
if
her
wistful
cast
of
physiognomy
be


not
go
,
no
more
be
her
careless
smile
.
she
keep
her
dark
old


manor
-
house
light
and
bright
with
her
cheery
presence
.
the
gallery
and


the
low
-
ceile
chamber
that
open
into
it
have
learn
lively
echo


from
her
voice
;
the
dim
entrance
-
hall
,
with
its
one
window
,
have
grow


pleasantly
accustomed
to
the
frequent
rustle
of
a
silk
dress
,
as
its


wearer
sweep
across
from
room
to
room
,
now
carry
flower
to
the


barbarous
peach
-
bloom
salon
,
now
enter
the
dining
-
room
to
open
its


casement
and
let
in
the
scent
of
mignonette

sweet
-
briar

anon


bring
plant
from
the
staircase
window

place
in

sun

take
she
sew
occasionally
;
but
,
by
some
fatality
,
she
be
doom


never
to
sit
steadily
at
it
for
above
five
minute
at
a
time

thimble

scarcely
fit
on

needle
scarce
thread
,
when
a
sudden


think
call
she
upstairs
.
perhaps
she
go
to
seek
some


just
-
then
-
remember
old
ivory
-
back
needle
-
book
or
old
china
-
top


work
-
box
,
quite
unneeded
,
but
which
seem
at
the
moment
indispensable
;


perhaps
to
arrange
her
hair
,
or
a
drawer
which
she
recollect
to
have


see
that
morning
in
a
state
of
curious
confusion
;
perhaps
only
to
take


a
peep
from
a
particular
window
at
a
particular
view
,
whence
Briarfield


church
and
rectory
be
visible
,
pleasantly
bower
in
tree

have


scarcely

again
take
up
the
slip
of
cambric

square

feel

see
her
tear
fall
slowly
on

work

she
would
wonder
how
the


excellent
woman
who
have
cut
it
out

arrange
it
for
her

"
I
never
find
Miss
Ainley
oppress
with

she
think
;
"
yet
her
cottage
be
a
still
,
dim
little
place
,

she
be


without
a
bright
hope
or
near
friend
in
the
world
.
I
remember
,
though
,


she
tell
I
once
she
have
tutor
her
thought
to
tend
upwards
to
heaven

she
allow
there
be
,

ever
have
be
,
little
enjoyment
in
this

for
she

she
look

I
suppose

the
bliss

strait

their
bed
narrow
as
a
coffin

she
say
often
she
have
no
fear
of


death
--
no
dread
of
the
grave
;
no
more
,

St.
Simeon


Stylites
,
lift
up
terrible
on
his
wild
column
in

no


more

the

I
do

Poor
Miss
Ainley
would
cling
close
to


life
if
life
have
more
charm
for
she
.
God
surely
do
not
create
we
and


cause
we
to
live
with
the
sole
end
of
wish
always
to
die
.
I
believe


in
my
heart
we
be
intend
to
prize
life
and
enjoy
it
so
long
as
we


retain
it
.
Existence
never
be
originally
mean
to
be
that
useless
,


blank
,
pale
,
slow
-
trail
thing
it
often
become
to
many
,
and
be


become
to
I
among
the
rest
.




"
nobody
,
"
she
go
on--"nobody
in
particular
be
to
blame
,
that
I
can


see
,
for
the
state
in
which
thing
be
;

I
can
not

much


I
puzzle
over
it
,
how
they
be
to
be
alter
for
the
well
;
but
I
feel


there
be
something
wrong
somewhere
.
I
believe
single
woman
should
have


more
to
do
--
well
chance
of
interesting
and
profitable
occupation

they
possess
now

when
I
speak
thus
I
have
no
impression
that
I


displease
God
by
my
word
;
that
I
be
either
impious
or
impatient
,


irreligious
or
sacrilegious
.
my
consolation
be
,
indeed
,
that
God
hear


many
a
groan
,
and
compassionate
much
grief
which
man
stop
his
ear


against
,
or
frown
on
with
impotent
contempt
.
I
say
_
impotent
_
,
for
I


observe
that
to
such
grievance
as
society
can
not
readily
cure
it


usually
forbid
utterance
,
on
pain
of
its
scorn
,
this
scorn
be
only
a


sort
of
tinsel
cloak

its
deform
weakness
.
People
hate
to
be


remind
of
ill
they
be
unable
or
unwilling
to
remedy
.
such
reminder

in
force
on
they
a
sense
of
their
own
incapacity
,
or
a
more
painful


sense
of
an
obligation
to
make
some
unpleasant
effort

household
work

no

wondrous
narrowness

wish
,
the
sole
aim

they

to

the

will
never

;


they
hold
they
very
cheap

they
say
--
I
have
hear
they
say

with


sneer
laugh
many
a
time

angry

to
stay
at

expect

to
do
at
home
?
if
you
ask
,
they
would
answer

sew

they
expect
they
to
do
this
,
and
this
only
,
contentedly
,
regularly
,


uncomplainingly
,
all
their
life
long
,
as
if
they
have
no
germ
of


faculty
for
anything
else
--
a
doctrine
as
reasonable
to
hold
as
it


would
be
that
the
father
have
no
faculty
but
for
eat
what
their


daughter
cook
or
for
wear
what
they
sew
.
could
man
live
so


themselves
?
would
they
not
be
very
weary
?
and
when
there
come
no
relief


to
their
weariness
,
but
only
reproach
at
its
slight
manifestation
,


would
not
their
weariness
ferment
in
time
to
frenzy
?

'

the

I
like
she
a
good

I

n't

Mr.

the

her
reason
for
the
preference
,

assign
by
herself

be
that
Miss

a

deportment

the

levity
of

that
,
be
a
foreigner
,
she


must
feel
the
want
of
a
friend
to
countenance
she
.
she
might
have
add


that
her
plain
aspect
,
homely
,
precise
dress
,

phlegmatic

manner
be
to

additional

be

,
that

,

doubtful


what

discretion

a
review
of
the

that
time

office

a


consideration

edification

Jessie
have
something


of
the
genius
of
humour
in
her
nature
.
it
be
inexpressibly
comic
to


hear
she
repeat
her
sire
's
denunciation
in
his
nervous
northern


Doric

as
hearty

little
Jacobin
as

mutinous
spirit

nature
,
her
language
be
not


so
bitter
as
it
be
racy
,
and
the
expressive
little
face
give
a
piquancy


to
every
phrase
which
hold
a
beholder

captive

chide

delight
to
a
subsequent
tirade
against

Prince
Regent

Jessie


quickly
read

in
the
sparkle
of
her
hearer
's
eye
and
the
laughter


hover
round
her
lip
,
that
at
last
she
have
hit
on
a
topic
that


pleased
.
many
a
time
have
she
hear
the
fat
"
Adonis

her

table

she
now
give
Mr.

's
comment


on
the
theme

genuine
as
utter
by
his
Yorkshire
lip
.




but
,

I
will
write
about
you
no
more

curtain

hurry
sob

in

cemetery

near

wood
fire
on

merry

a
gap

be
fill
,

be


make
in
their
circle

they
know
they
have
lose
something
whose
absence


could
never
be
quite
atone
for
so
long
as
they
live

that
heavy
fall

into
the
wet
earth

cover

seem
naturally
rather
a


grave
,
still
,
retire
man
;
but
the
Caroline
of
this
evening
,
which
be


not
(
as
you
know
,
reader
)
the
Caroline
of
every
day
,
thaw
his
reserve
,


and
cheer
his
gravity
soon
.
he
sit
near
she
and
talk
to
she
.
she


already
know
his
vocation
be
that
of
tuition
.
she
learn
now
he
have


for
some
year
be
the
tutor
of
Mr.
Sympson
's
son
;
that
he
have
be


travel
with
he
,
and
have
accompany
he
to
the
north
.
she
inquire


if
he
like
his
post
,
but
get
a
look
in
reply
which
do
not
invite
or


license
further
question
.
the
look
wake
Caroline
's
ready
sympathy
.
she


think
it
a
very
sad
expression
to
pass
over
so
sensible
a
face
as


Louis
's
;
for
he
_
have
_
a
sensible
face
,
though
not
handsome
,
she


consider
,
when
see
near
Robert
's
.
she
turn
to
make
the
comparison
.


Robert
be
lean
against
the
wall
,
a
little
behind
she
,
turn
over


the
leave
of
a
book
of
engraving
,
and
probably
listen
,
at
the
same


time
,
to
the
dialogue
between
she
and
Louis
.




"
how
could
I
think
they
alike
?
"
she
ask
herself
.
"
I
see
now
it
be


Hortense
Louis
resemble
,
not
Robert
.
"




and
this
be
in
part
true
.
he
have
the
short
nose
and
long
upper
lip


of
his
sister
rather
than
the
fine
trait
of
his
brother
.
he
have
she


mould
of
mouth
and
chin
--
all
less
decisive
,
accurate
,
and
clear
than


those
of
the
young
mill
-
owner
.
his
air
,
though
deliberate
and


reflective
,
could
scarcely
be
call
prompt
and
acute
.
you
feel
,
in


sit
near
and
look
up
at
he
,
that
a
slow
and
probably
a
more


benignant
nature
than
that
of
the
eld
Moore
shed
calm
on
your


impression
.




Robert
--
perhaps
aware
that
Caroline
's
glance
have
wander
towards
and


dwell
upon
he
,
though
he
have
neither
meet
nor
answer
it
--
put
down
the


book
of
engraving
,
and
approach
,
take
a
seat
at
her
side
.
she


resume
her
conversation
with
Louis
,
but
while
she
talk
to
he
she


thought
be
elsewhere
.
her
heart
beat
on
the
side
from
which
her
face


be
half
avert
.
she
acknowledge
a
steady
,
manly
,
kindly
air
in
Louis
;


but
she
bend
before
the
secret
power
of
Robert
.
to
be
so
near


he
--
though
he
be
silent
,
though
he
do
not
touch
so
much
as
she


scarf

fringe
or
the
white
hem
of
her
dress

affect
she
like
a

,


at

excite
she
.
her
discourse
flow


freely
;
it
be
gay
,
playful
,
eloquent
.
the
indulgent
look

placid


manner
of
her
auditor

she
to
ease

his

out
all

accustom
to


wait
on
sick
people
,
ma'am
.
you
move
about
the
room
so
softly
,
and
you


speak
so
quietly
,
and
touch
I
so
gently
.
"




"
I
be
dexterous
in
nothing
,
my
dear
.
you
will
often
find
I
awkward
,
but


never
negligent
.
"




negligent
,
indeed
,
she
be
not
.
from
that
hour
Fanny
and
Eliza
become


cipher
in
the
sick
-
room
.
Mrs.
Pryor
make
it
her
domain
;
she
perform


all
its
duty
;
she
live
in
it
day
and
night
.
the
patient


remonstrate
--
faintly
,
however
,
from
the
first
,
and
not
at
all
ere
long
.


loneliness
and
gloom
be
now
banish
from
her
bedside
;
protection
and


solace
sit
there
instead
.
she
and
her
nurse
coalesce
in
wondrous
union
.


Caroline
be
usually
pain
to
require
or
receive
much
attendance
.
Mrs.


Pryor
,
under
ordinary
circumstance
,
have
neither
the
habit
nor
the
art


of
perform
little
office
of
service
;
but
all
now
pass
with
such


ease
,
so
naturally
,
that
the
patient
be
as
willing
to
be
cherish
as


the
nurse
be
bent
on
cherish
;
no
sign
of
weariness
in
the
latter


ever
remind
the
former
that
she
ought
to
be
anxious
.
there
be
,
in


fact
,
no
very
hard
duty
to
perform
;
but
a
hireling
might
have
find
it


hard
.




with
all
this
care
it
seem
strange
the
sick
girl
do
not
get
well
;
yet


such
be
the
case
.
she
waste
like
any
snow
-
wreath
in
thaw
;
she
fade


like
any
flower
in
drought
.
Miss
Keeldar
,
on
whose
thought
danger
or


death
seldom
intrude
,
have
at
first
entertain
no
fear
at
all
for
she


friend
;
but
see
her
change
and
sink
from
time
to
time
when
she
pay


her
visit
,
alarm
clutch
her
heart
.
she
go
to
Mr.
Helstone
and


express
herself
with
so
much
energy
that
that
gentleman
be
at
last


oblige
,
however
unwillingly
,
to
admit
the
idea
that
his
niece
be
ill


of
something
more
than
a
migraine
;
and
when
Mrs.
Pryor
come
and
quietly


demand
a
physician
,
he
say
she
might
send
for
two
if
she
like
.
one


come
,
but
that
one
be
an
oracle
.
he
deliver
a
dark
saying
of
which


the
future
be
to
solve
the
mystery
,
write
some
prescription
,
give
some


direction
--
the
whole
with
an
air
of
crush
authority
--
pocket
his


fee
,
and
go
.
probably
he
know
well
enough
he
could
do
no
good
,
but


do
n't
like
to
say
so
.




still
,
no
rumour
of
serious
illness
get
wind
in
the
neighbourhood
.
at


Hollow
's
cottage
it
be
think
that
Caroline
have
only
a
severe
cold
,


she
having
write
a
note
to
Hortense
to
that
effect
;
and
mademoiselle


content
herself
with
send
two
pot
of
currant
jam
,
a
recipe
for
a


tisane
,
and
a
note
of
advice
.




Mrs.
Yorke
be
tell
that
a
physician
have
be
summon
,
sneer
at
the


hypochondriac
fancy
of
the
rich
and
idle
,
who
,
she
say
,
have


nothing
but
themselves
to
think
about
,
must
needs
send
for
a
doctor
if


only
so
much
as
their
little
finger
ache
.




the
"
rich
and
idle
,
"
represent
in
the
person
of
Caroline
,
be


meantime
fall
fast
into
a
condition
of
prostration
,
whose
quickly


consummate
debility
puzzle
all
who
witness
it
except
one
;
for
that


one
alone
reflect
how
liable
be
the
undermined
structure
to
sink
in


sudden
ruin
.




sick
people
often
have
fancy
inscrutable
to
ordinary
attendant
,
and


Caroline
have
one
which
even
her
tender
nurse
could
not
at
first
explain
.


on
a
certain
day
in
the
week
,
at
a
certain
hour
,
she
would
--
whether


bad
or
well
--
entreat
to
be
take
up
and
dress
,
and
suffer
to
sit


in
her
chair
near
the
window
.
this
station
she
would
retain
till
noon


be
past
.
whatever
degree
of
exhaustion
or
debility
her
wan
aspect


betray
,
she
still
softly
put
off
all
persuasion
to
seek
repose
until


the
church
clock
have
duly
toll
midday
.
the
twelve
stroke
sound
,
she


grow
docile
,
and
would
meekly
lie
down
.
return
to
the
couch
,
she


usually
bury
her
face
deep
in
the
pillow
,
and
draw
the
coverlet
close


round
she
,
as
if
to
shut
out
the
world
and
sun
,
of
which
she
be
tired
.


More
than
once
,
as
she
thus
lay
,
a
slight
convulsion
shake
the
sick
-
bed
,


and
a
faint
sob
break
the
silence
round
it
.
these
thing
be
not


unnote
by
Mrs.

.




one
Tuesday

lean
forward
in
the

their
lustre
;

earnestly
out
.
Mrs.
Pryor
,

softly
near
,

over
her
shoulder
.
from
this
window

road

there
,

sharply
by

;
half
a

she
now

that
Tuesday

.
Mr.
Moore
must


always

the
rectory
on

in
her
hand
.
that
Tuesday
afternoon

transient


doze

under
its

a
curl

Caroline

a
certain
look
have
pass
from
her
face

a
look
dread

eye

Mrs.

see
lay
on


the
pillow
a
face
pale
and
waste
enough

perhaps
more
haggard
than
the


other
appearance
,

less
awful
;

it

a
sick

William

find
plenty
to
talk
about

have
a

topic
in

interesting
to
they
,

the
rest

take
a
similar
interest

,
and
plant
;
they


hold
similar
doctrine
about
humanity

the
low
creation
,

have
a


similar
turn
for
minute
observation

put

great
savour
in
its


marvellous
anecdote
of
animal
sagacity
.




this
be
a
digression
,
but
it
suffice
to
explain
why
Caroline
would
have


no
other
hand
than
William
's
to
guide
her
chair
,

why
his
society
and


conversation
suffice
to
give
interest
to
her
garden

airing
.




Mrs.
Pryor
,
walk
near
,
wonder
how
her
daughter
could
be
so
much
at


ease
with
a
"
man
of
the
people
.
"
_
she
_
find
it
impossible
to
speak
to


he
otherwise
than
stiffly
.
she
feel
as
if
a
great
gulf
lie
between
she


caste
and
his
,
and
that
to
cross
it
or
meet
he
half
-
way
would
be
to


degrade
herself
.
she
gently
ask
Caroline
,
"
be
you
not
afraid
,
my


dear
,
to
converse
with
that
person
so
unreservedly

he


seek
his
cousin
Shirley

this
boy
differ
from
his
sister

he
be


little
,
lame
,
and
pale
;
his
large
eye
shine
somewhat
languidly
in
a
wan


orbit

they
be
,
indeed
,
usually
rather
dim
,

they
be
capable
of


illumination

at
time
they
could
not
only
shine
,

blaze

Inward


emotion
could
likewise
give
colour

his
cheek

decision

his


crippled
movement

a
mark
of
election

not

talent

most
spirited
sketch

nothing

I

a
fact

strangely
astonish
Caroline

it
be
--
to
discover
that


her
cousin

absolutely
_
no

sympathize

the
estimable

what
have
befall

hearted

so


indifferent

the
dreary
position
of
a
fellow
-
creature

isolate

her
roof

she
be
not
,
perhaps
,
haughty
to
he
,

she
never


notice
he

she
let
he
alone

he
come
and
go
,
speak

be
silent

and
she
rarely
recognize
his
existence

as
to
Louis
Moore
himself
,
he
have
the
air
of
a
man
use
to
this
life

and
who
have
make
up
his
mind

bear
it

a
time

his
faculty
seem


wall
up
in
he
,
and
be
unmurmure
in
their
captivity
.
he
never


laugh

he
seldom
smile
;
he
be
uncomplaine

he
fulfil
the
round

his
duty
scrupulously

his
pupil
love
he
;
he
ask
nothing
more


than
civility
from
the
rest
of
the
world

it
even
appear

during
Miss
Keeldar
's
stay
at
the
fashionable
watering
-
place
of


Cliffbridge
,
she
and
her
friend
have
meet
with
and
be
introduce
to
Sir


Philip
nunnely
.
they
encounter
he
again
and
again
on
the
sand
,
the


cliff
,
in
the
various
walk
,
sometimes
at
the
public
ball
of
the


place
.
he
seem
solitary
.
his
manner
be
very
unpretending
--
too
simple


to
be
term
affable
;
rather
timid
than
proud
.
he
do
not
_
condescend
_


to
their
society
;
he
seem
_
glad
_
of
it
.




with
any
unaffected
individual
Shirley
could
easily
and
quickly
cement


an
acquaintance
.
she
walk
and
talk
with
Sir
Philip
;
she
,
her
aunt
,


and
cousin
sometimes
take
a
sail
in
his
yacht
.
she
like
he
because


she
find
he
kind
and
modest
,
and
be
charm
to
feel
she
have
the
power


to
amuse
he
.




one
slight
drawback
there
be
--
where
be
the
friendship
without
it?--Sir


Philip
have
a
literary
turn
.
he
write
poetry
--
sonnet
,
stanza
,
ballad
.


perhaps
Miss
Keeldar
think
he
a
little
too
fond
of
reading
and


recite
these
composition
;
perhaps
she
wish
the
rhyme
have
possess


more
accuracy
,
the
measure
more
music
,
the
trope
more
freshness
,
the


inspiration
more
fire
.
at
any
rate
,
she
always
wince
when
he
recur


to
the
subject
of
his
poem
,
and
usually
do
she
good
to
divert
the


conversation
into
another
channel
.




he
would
beguile
she
to
take
moonlight
walk
with
he
on
the
bridge
,
for


the
sole
purpose
,
as
it
seem
,
of
pour
into
she
ear
the
long
of


his
ballad
.
he
would
lead
she
away
to
sequester
rustic
seat
,
whence


the
rush
of
the
surf
to
the
sand
be
hear
soft
and
soothing
;
and
when


he
have
she
all
to
himself
,
and
the
sea
lie
before
they
,
and
the
scented


shade
of
garden
spread
round
,
and
the
tall
shelter
of
cliff
rise


behind
they
,
he
would
pull
out
his
last
batch
of
sonnet
,
and
read
they


in
a
voice
tremulous
with
emotion
.
he
do
not
seem
to
know
that
though


they
might
be
rhyme
they
be
not
poetry
.
it
appear
,
by
Shirley
's


downcast
eye
and
disturb
face
,
that
she
know
it
,
and
feel
heartily


mortify
by
the
single
foible
of
this
good
and
amiable
gentleman
.




often
she
try
,
as
gently
as
might
be
,
to
wean
he
from
this
fanatic


worship
of
the
Muses
.
it
be
his
monomania
;
on
all
ordinary
subject
he


be
sensible
enough
,
and
fain
be
she
to
engage
he
in
ordinary
topic
.


he
question
she
sometimes
about
his
place
at
nunnely
;
she
be
but
too


happy
to
answer
his
interrogatory
at
length
.
she
never
weary
of


describe
the
antique
priory
,
the
wild
silvan
park
,
the
hoary
church


and
hamlet
;
nor
do
she
fail
to
counsel
he
to
come
down
and
gather
his


tenantry
about
he
in
his
ancestral
hall
.




somewhat
to
her
surprise
,
Sir
Philip
follow
her
advice
to
the
letter
,


and
actually
,
towards
the
close
of
September
,
arrive
at
the
priory
.




he
soon
make
a
call
at
Fieldhead
,
and
his
first
visit
be
not
his
last
.


he
say
--
when
he
have
achieve
the
round
of
the
neighbourhood
--
that
under


no
roof
have
he
find
such
pleasant
shelter
as
beneath
the
massive
oak


beam
of
the
gray
manor
-
house
of
Briarfield
;
a
cramp
,
modest
dwell


enough
compare
with
his
own
,
but
he
like
it
.




presently
it
do
not
suffice
to
sit
with
Shirley
in
her
panel


parlour
,
where
other
come
and
go
,
and
where
he
could
rarely
find
a


quiet
moment
to
show
she
the
late
production
of
his
fertile
muse
;
he


must
have
she
out
amongst
the
pleasant
pasture
,
and
lead
she
by
the


still
water
.
_
tête
-
à

rambling
she
shun
,
so
he
make
party


for
she
to
his
own
ground
,
his
glorious
forest
;
to
remoter


scene
--
wood
sever
by
the
Wharfe
,

the
Aire
.




such
assiduity
cover
Miss
Keeldar
with
distinction
.
her
uncle
's


prophetic
soul
anticipate
a
splendid
future
.
he
already
scent
the


time
afar
off
when
,
with
nonchalant
air
,
and
leave
foot
nurse
on
his


right
knee
,
he
should
be
able
to
make
dashingly
-
familiar
allusion
to
his


"
nephew
the
baronet
.
"
now
his
niece
dawn
upon
he
no
long
"
a
mad


girl
,
"
but
a
"
most
sensible
woman
.
"
he
term
she
,
in
confidential


dialogue
with
Mrs.
Sympson
,
"
a
truly
superior
person
;
peculiar
,
but


very
clever
.
"
he
treat
she
with
exceed
deference
;
rise
reverently


to
open
and
shut
door
for
she
;
redden
his
face
and
give
himself


headache
with
stoop
to
pick
up
glove
,
handkerchief
,
and
other


loose
property
,
whereof
Shirley
usually
hold
but
insecure
tenure
.
he


would
cut
mysterious
joke
about
the
superiority
of
woman
's
wit
over


man
's
wisdom
;
commence
obscure
apology
for
the
blunder
mistake
he


have
commit
respect
the
generalship
,
the
tactic
,
of
"
a
personage


not
a
hundred
mile
from
Fieldhead
.
"
in
short
,
he
seem
elate
as
any


"
midden
-
cock
on
patten
.
"




his
niece
view
his
manœuvre
and
receive
his
innuendo
with
phlegm
;


apparently
she
do
not
above
half
comprehend
to
what
aim
they
tend
.


when
plainly
charge
with
be
the
preferred
of
the
baronet
,
she
say


she
believe
he
do
like
she
,
and
for
her
part
she
like
he
.
she
have


never
think
a
man
of
rank
--
the
only
son
of
a
proud
,
fond
mother
,
the


only
brother
of
doting
sister
--
could
have
so
much
goodness
,
and
,
on
the


whole
,
so
much
sense
.




time
prove
,
indeed
,
that
Sir
Philip
like
she
.
perhaps
he
have
find
in


she
that
"
curious
charm
"
notice
by
Mr.
Hall
.
he
seek
her
presence


more
and
more
,
and
at
last
with
a
frequency
that
attest
it
have
become


to
he
an
indispensable
stimulus
.
about
this
time
strange
feeling


hover
round
Fieldhead
;
restless
hope
and
haggard
anxiety
haunt


some
of
its
room
.
there
be
an
unquiet
wandering
of
some
of
the
inmate


among
the
still
field
round
the
mansion
;
there
be
a
sense
of


expectancy
that
keep
the
nerve
strain
.




one
thing
seem
clear
:
Sir
Philip
be
not
a
man
to
be
despise
.
he
be


amiable
;
if
not
highly
intellectual
,
he
be
intelligent
.
Miss
Keeldar


could
not
affirm
of
he
,
what
she
have
so
bitterly
affirm
of
Sam
Wynne
,


that
his
feeling
be
blunt
,
his
taste
coarse
,
and
his
manner
vulgar
.


there
be
sensibility
in
his
nature
;
there
be
a
very
real
,
if
not
a


very
discriminating
,
love
of
the
art
;
there
be
the
english
gentleman


in
all
his
deportment
.
as
to
his
lineage
and
wealth
,
both
be
,
of


course
,
far
beyond
her
claim
.




his
appearance
have
at
first
elicit
some
laugh
though
not


ill
-
natured
remark
from
the
merry
Shirley
.
it
be
boyish
.
his
feature


be
plain
and
slight
,
his
hair
sandy
,
his
stature
insignificant
.
but


she
soon
check
her
sarcasm
on
this
point
;
she
would
even
fire
up
if


any
one
else
make
uncomplimentary
allusion
thereto
.
he
have
"
a
pleasing


countenance
,
"
she
affirm
;
"
and
there
be
that
in
his
heart
which
be


well
than
three
roman
nose
,
than
the
lock
of
Absalom
or
the


proportion
of
Saul
.
"
a
spare
and
rare
shaft
she
still
reserve
for
his


unfortunate
poetic
propensity
;
but
even
here
she
would
tolerate
no
irony


save
her
own
.




in
short
,
matter
have
reach
a
point
which
seem
fully
to
warrant
an


observation
make
about
this
time
by
Mr.
Yorke
to
the
tutor
,
Louis
.

she
offer
the
foot

hill

her
little
failing

a
source

irritation

if
they
vex
I
it
be
a
most
pleasurable
vexation

no
niggard

minister
to
my
enjoyment

she


would
just
give
I
something
to
do

rectify

a
theme

my

lecture

never
lecture

wrong

transform

come
the
delight
I
take
in
that
talk

myself
sometimes

her
mood

I
for
disapprobation

never
wilder

when
equip
in

hat

never
less
manageable

when
she

Zoë

in
fiery

wait
an
hour

court

the
chance
of


witness
her
return
,

for
the
dearer
chance
of
receive
she
in
my


arm
from
the
saddle

I
have
notice
(
again
it
be
to
this

I


would
make
the
remark

that
she
will
never
permit
any
man

myself
to


render
she
that
assistance

I
have

politely
decline
Sir
Philip


nunnely

aid

always
mighty
gentle

tender
for
his
feeling

his
very
thin

have
mark
she
haughtily
reject
Sam
Wynne

now
I


know
--
my
heart
know
it

it
have
feel
it

that
she
resign
herself
to


I
unreluctantly
.
be
she
conscious
how
my
strength
rejoice
to
serve


she

I
myself
be
not
her

I
declare
it

but
my
faculty
gather


to
her
beauty
,
like
the
genii
to
the
glisten
of
the
lamp

all
my


knowledge
,
all
my
prudence
,
all
my
calm
,
and
all
my
power
stand
in
she


presence
humbly
wait
a
task
.
how
glad
they
be
when
a
mandate
come
!


what
joy
they
take
in
the
toil
she
assign
!
do
she
know
it

"
I
have
call
she
careless
.
it
be
remarkable
that
her
carelessness


never
compromise
her
refinement
.
indeed
,
through
this
very
loophole
of


character
,
the
reality
,
depth
,
genuineness
of
that
refinement
may
be


ascertain
.
a
whole
garment
sometimes
cover
meagreness
and


malformation
;
through
a
rent
sleeve
a
fair
round
arm
may
be
reveal
.
I


have
see
and
handle
many
of
her
possession
,
because
they
be


frequently
astray
.
I
never
see
anything
that
do
not
proclaim
the


lady
--
nothing
sordid
,
nothing
soil
.
in
one
sense
she
be
as
scrupulous


as
,
in
another
,
she
be
unthinke
.
as
a
peasant
girl
,
she
would
go
ever


trim
and
cleanly
.
look
at
the
pure
kid
of
this
little
glove
,
at
the


fresh
,
unsullied
satin
of
the
bag

a
difference

be
between
S.

pearl
C.

Caroline
,
I


fancy
,
be
the
soul
of
conscientious
punctuality
and
nice
exactitude
.
she


would
precisely
suit
the
domestic
habit
of
a
certain
fastidious
kinsman


of
mine
--
so
delicate
,
dexterous
,
quaint
,
quick
,
quiet
--
all
do
to
a


minute
,
all
arrange
to
a
strawbreadth
.
she
would
suit
Robert
.
but
what


could
_
I
_
do
with
anything
so
nearly
faultless
?
_
she
_
be
my
equal
,
poor


as
myself
.
she
be
certainly
pretty

Raffaelle

raffaelle

quite
english
in
expression

insular


grace
and
purity
;
but
where
be
there
anything
to
alter
,
anything
to


endure
,
anything
to
reprimand
,
to
be
anxious
about

there
she
be
,
a
lily


of
the
valley
,
untinted
,

no

what
change
could
improve
she

_
my

sweetheart
,
if
I
ever
have
one
,
must


bear
near
affinity
to
the
rose

sweet
,
lively
delight

with


prickly
peril

_
my

wife

if
I
ever
marry
,
must
stir
my
great
frame
with


a
sting
now

must
furnish
use
to
her

mass
of


patience

I
be
not
make
so
enduring
to
be

with
a
lamb

I
should


find
more
congenial
responsibility
in
the
charge
of
a
young
lioness
or


leopardess

I
like
few

sweet
but
what
be
likewise
pungent
--
few


thing
bright
but
what

.
I
like

blush

blanch

fear

should
tire
of
the

monotonous
innocence

burdensome

nestling
dove

view
be
a
little


alter
.
while
I
be
in
Birmingham
I
look
a
little
into
reality
,


consider
closely
and
at
their
source
the
cause
of
the
present


trouble
of
this
country
.
I
do
the

in
London
.
unknown
,
I
could
go


where
I
please
,
mix
with
whom
I
would
.
I
go
where
there
be
want
of


food
,
of
fuel
,
of
clothing
;
where
there
be
no
occupation
and
no
hope
.
I


see
some
,
with
naturally
elevate
tendency
and
good
feeling
,
keep


down
amongst
sordid
privation
and
harass
grief
.
I
see
many


originally
low
,
and
to
whom
lack
of
education
leave
scarcely
anything
but


animal
want
,
disappoint
in
those
want
,
ahungere
,
athirst
,
and


desperate
as
famished
animal
.
I
see
what
teach
my
brain
a
new
lesson
,


and
fill
my
breast
with
fresh
feeling
.
I
have
no
intention
to
profess


more
softness
or
sentiment
than
I
have
hitherto
profess
;
mutiny
and


ambition
I
regard
as
I
have
always
regard
they
.
I
should
resist
a


riotous
mob
just
as
heretofore
;
I
should
open
on
the
scent
of
a
runaway


ringleader
as
eagerly
as
ever
,
and
run
he
down
as
relentlessly
,
and


follow
he
up
to
condign
punishment
as
rigorously

I
should
do
it


now

for
the

a

one
of

perhaps
at
the

parlour

;
she
have
see
the
isolate
tree
of
the


domain

broad
,
strong
,
spread
oak
,
and
high

wrestle
with
the
gale

ear
have
catch
the
full
roar
of


the
forest
lower
down
;
the
swift
rushing
of

the
moon

be
much
about
love
in
the


ballad

faithful
love
that
refuse
to
abandon
its
object
;
love
that

an
amount
of
energy
which
the
present
empty
condition
of


his
youthful
stomach

not

likely

Martin

fastidious
selection
from
its

delay

determine
it
should
be
_

.
it
appear
to
he
that
a


variety
on
his
usual
somewhat
insipid
fare
of
bread
and
milk
be
both


desirable
and
advisable
;
the
savoury
and
the
salutary
he
think
might


be
combine
.
there
be
store
of
rosy
apple

in

on
the
plain
household
bread

eye


do
not
dwell
;
but
he
survey
with
favour
some
currant

condescend
to
make
choice
of

to
his
clasp

knife
,
he
be


able
to
appropriate
a
wing

a
slice
of
ham
;
a
cantlet
of
cold


custard
-
pudding
he
think
would
harmonize
with
these
article
;
and


having
make
this
final
addition
to
his
booty
,
he
at
length
sally
forth


into
the
hall
.




he
be
already
half

way
across

more

have

in
full


equipage
of
horn
,
hoofs
,
and
tail
.




Matthew
,
sceptic
and
scoffer
,
have
already
fail
to
subscribe
a
prompt


belief
in
that
pain
about
the
heart
.
he
have
mutter
some
word
,
amongst


which
the
phrase
"
sham
Abraham
"
have
be
very
distinctly
audible
,


and
the
succession
to
the
armchair
and
newspaper
have
appear
to
affect


he
with
mental
spasm
.
the
spectacle
now
before
he
--
the
apple
,
the


tart
,
the
tea
-
cake
,
the
fowl
,
ham
,
and
pudding
--
offer
evidence
but


too
well
calculated
to
inflate
his
opinion
of
his
own
sagacity
.




Martin
pause
_

_
one
minute
,
one
instant
;
the
next
he

well
.
with
the
true
perspicacity
_

he
at
once
see
how
this
at
first
sight
untoward
event
might
be


turn
to
excellent
account
.
he
see
how
it
might
be
so
handle
as
to


secure
the
accomplishment
of
his
second
task
--
namely
,
the
disposal
of


his
mother
.
he
know
that
a
collision
between
he
and
Matthew
always


suggest
to
Mrs.
Yorke
the
propriety
of
a
fit
of
hysteric
.
he
far


know
that
,
on
the
principle
of
calm
succeeding
to
storm
,
after
a
morning


of
hysteric
his
mother
be
sure
to
indulge
in
an
afternoon
of
bed
.
this


would
accommodate
he
perfectly
.




the
collision
duly
take
place
in
the
hall
.
a
dry
laugh
,
an
insulting


sneer
,
a
contemptuous
taunt
,

by
a
nonchalant
but
most
cut
reply

be
the
signal
.
they
rush
at
it
.
Martin

his
own
attachment

constitute
an
additional
motive

probably
he
have
a


third
motive

than
either

think
.
the
housekeeper
stand
wring


her
hand
,
entreat
I
to
desist
.
I
desist
that
moment
,
and
feel
at


once
as
cool
as
stone
.
but
I
tell
Mrs.
Gill
to
fetch
the
Red
-
House
Inn


chaise
instantly
,
and
inform
Mr.
Sympson
he
must
depart
from
Fieldhead


the
instant
it
come
.
though
half
frighten
out
of
his
wit
,
he
declare


he
would
not
.
repeat
the
former
order
,
I
add
a
commission
to
fetch


a
constable
.
I
say
,
'
you
_
shall
_
go
,
by
fair
mean
or
foul
.

"
he
threaten
prosecution
;
I
care
for
nothing
.
I
have
stand
over
he


once
before
,
not
quite
so
fiercely
as
now
,
but
full
as
austerely
.
it
be


one
night
when
burglar
attempt
the
house
at
Sympson
Grove
,
and
in
his


wretched
cowardice
he
would
have
give
a
vain
alarm
,
without
dare
to


offer
defence
.
I
have
then
be
oblige
to
protect
his
family
and
his


abode
by
master
himself
--
and
I
have
succeed
.
I
now
remain
with
he


till
the
chaise
come
.
I
marshal
he
to
it
,
he
scold
all
the
way
.


he
be
terribly
bewildered
,
as
well
as
enraged
.
he
would
have
resist


I
,
but
know
not
how
.
he
call
for
his
wife
and
daughter
to
come
.
I


say
they
should
follow
he
as
soon
as
they
could
prepare
.
the
smoke
,


the
fume
,
the
fret
of
his
demeanour
be
inexpressible
,
but
it
be
a
fury


incapable
of
produce
a
deed
.
that
man
,
properly
handle
,
must
ever


remain
impotent
.
I
know
he
will
never
touch
I
with
the
law
.
I
know
his


wife
,
over
whom
he
tyrannize
in
trifle
,
guide
he
in
matter
of


importance
.
I
have
long
since
earn
her
undying
mother
's
gratitude
by


my
devotion
to
her
boy

in
some
of
Henry

ailment
I
have
nurse


he
--
well
,
she
say
,
than
any
woman
could
nurse
.
she
will
never
forget


that
.
she
and
her
daughter
quit
I
to

day

in
mute
wrath
and


consternation
;

she
respect
I

Henry
clung
to
my
neck
as
I


lift
he
into
the
carriage
and
place
he
by
her
side
,
when
I
arrange


her
own
wrapping
to
make
she
warm
,

she
turn
her
head
from
I

I


see
the
tear
start
to
her
eye

she
will
but
the
more
zealously


advocate
my
cause
because
she
have
leave
I
in
anger

I
be
glad
of


this

not
for

here
he

,
with
his
lady
on
his

--
the
most
splendid

the


weighty

in
Yorkshire

Mrs.

formerly
Miss

and
Mr.

,
belove
by
their
parishioner
and
by
a
numerous
circle


of
friend
.




there
!
I
think
the
varnish
have
be
put
on
very
nicely
.




Advance
,
Mr.
Donne
.




this
gentleman
turn
out
admirably
--
far
well
than
either
you
or
I


could
possibly
have
expect
,
reader
.
he
,
too
,
marry
a
most
sensible
,


quiet
,
lady
-
like
little
woman
.
the
match
be
the
making
of
he
.
he


become
an
exemplary
domestic
character
,
and
a
truly
active
parish
priest


(
as
a
pastor
he
,
to
his
die
day
,
conscientiously
refuse
to
act
)
.
the


outside
of
the
cup
and
platter
he
burnish
up
with
the
good


polish
-
powder
;
the
furniture
of
the
altar
and
temple
he
look
after


with
the
zeal
of
an
upholsterer
,
the
care
of
a
cabinet
-
maker
.
his
little


school
,
his
little
church
,
his
little
parsonage
,
all
owe
their
erection


to
he
;
and
they
do
he
credit
.
each
be
a
model
in
its
way
.
if


uniformity
and
taste
in
architecture
have
be
the
same
thing
as


consistency
and
earnestness
in
religion
,
what
a
shepherd
of
a
Christian


flock
Mr.
Donne
would
have
make
!
there
be
one
art
in
the
mastery
of


which
nothing
mortal
ever
surpass
Mr.
Donne
:
it
be
that
of
beg
.


by
his
own
unassisted
effort
he
beg
all
the
money
for
all
his


erection
.
in
this
matter
he
have
a
grasp
of
plan
,
a
scope
of
action


quite
unique
.
he
beg
of
high
and
low
--
of
the
shoeless
cottage
brat


and
the
coroneted
duke
.
he
send
out
beg
-
letter
far
and
wide
--
to
old


Queen
Charlotte
,
to
the
princess
her
daughter
,
to
her
son
the
royal


duke
,
to
the
Prince
Regent
,
to
Lord
Castlereagh
,
to
every
member
of
the


ministry
then
in
office
;
and
,
what
be
more
remarkable
,
he
screw


something
out
of
every
one
of
these
personage
.
it
be
on
record
that
he


get
five
pound
from
the
close
-
fiste
old
lady
Queen
Charlotte
,
and
two


guinea
from
the
royal
profligate
her
eld
son
.
when
Mr.
Donne
set
out


on
beg
expedition
,
he
arm
himself
in
a
complete
suit
of
brazen


mail
.
that
you
have
give
a
hundred
pound
yesterday
be
with
he
no


reason
why
you
should
not
give
two
hundred
to
-
day
.
he
would
tell
you
so


to
your
face
,
and
,
ten
to
one
,
get
the
money
out
of
you
.
People
give
to


get
rid
of
he
.
after
all
,
he
do
some
good
with
the
cash
.
he
be


useful
in
his
day
and
generation
.




perhaps
I
ought
to
remark
that
on
the
premature
and
sudden
vanishing
of


Mr.
Malone
from
the
stage
of
Briarfield
parish
(
you
can
not
know
how
it


happen
,
reader
;
your
curiosity
must
be
rob
to
pay
your
elegant
love


of
the
pretty
and
pleasing
)
,
there
come
as
his
successor
another
irish


curate
,
Mr.
Macarthey
.
I
be
happy
to
be
able
to
inform
you
,
_
with


truth
_
,
that
this
gentleman
do
as
much
credit
to
his
country
as
Malone


have
do
it
discredit
.
he
prove
himself
as
decent
,
decorous
,
and


conscientious
as
Peter
be
rampant
,
boisterous
,
and----
this
last


epithet
I
choose
to
suppress
,
because
it
would
let
the
cat
out
of
the


bag
.
he
labour
faithfully
in
the
parish
.
the
school
,
both
Sunday
and


day
school
,
flourish
under
his
sway
like
green
bay
tree
.
be


human
,
of
course
he
have
his
fault
.
these
,
however
,
be
proper
,


steady
-
go
,
clerical
fault
--
what
many
would
call
virtue
.
the


circumstance
of
find
himself
invite
to
tea
with
a
Dissenter
would


unhinge
he
for
a
week
.
the
spectacle
of
a
Quaker
wear
his
hat
in
the


church
,
the
thought
of
an
unbaptized
fellow
-
creature
be
inter
with


christian
rite
--
these
thing
could
make
strange
havoc
in
Mr.


Macarthey
's
physical
and
mental
economy
.
otherwise
he
be
sane
and


rational
,
diligent
and
charitable
.




I
doubt
not
a
justice
-
love
public
will
have
remark
,
ere
this
,
that
I


have
thus
far
show
a
criminal
remissness
in
pursue
,
catching
,
and


bring
to
condign
punishment
the
would
-
be
assassin
of
Mr.
Robert


Moore
.
here
be
a
fine
opening
to
lead
my
willing
reader
a
dance
,
at


once
decorous
and
exciting
--
a
dance
of
law
and
gospel
,
of
the
dungeon
,


the
dock
,
and
the
"
dead
-
thraw
.
"
you
might
have
like
it
,
reader
,
but
_
I
_


should
not
.
I
and
my
subject
would
presently
have
quarrel
,
and
then
I


should
have
break
down
.
I
be
happy
to
find
that
fact
perfectly


exonerate
I
from
the
attempt
.
the
murderer
be
never

,
for
the


good
reason
that
he
be
never
catch

the
result
of
the
further


circumstance
that
he

never

make
a


shuffle

they

to
rise

do
valiant
thing
;

since
Moore
himself
,
instead
of
urge
and
lead
they
as
heretofore
,


lie
still
on
his
little
cottage

couch
,
laugh
in
his
sleeve
,
and


sneer
with
every
feature
of
his
pale

foreign
face

they
consider


well
of
it
,

after
fulfil
certain
indispensable
form

prudently
resolve
to
let
the

quietly
drop

substantial
stone
and
brick
and
ashe

the
cinder
-
black


highway
,
the
cottage
,
and
the
cottage
garden
;
there
I
see
a
mighty


mill
,
and
a
chimney
ambitious
as
the
tower
of
Babel
.
I
tell
my
old


housekeeper
when
I
come
home

old


mill
be
build
--
the
very
first
it
be
in
all
the
district
;
and
then
I


can
remember
it
be
pull
down
,
and
go
with
my
lake
-
lass


[
companion
]
to
see
the
foundation
-
stone
of
the
new
one
lay
.
the
two


Mr.
Moores
make
a
great
stir
about
it
.
they
be
there
,
and
a
deal
of


fine
folk
besides
,
and
both
their
lady
;
very
bonny
and
grand
they


look
.
but
Mrs.
Louis

the
grand
;
she
always
wear
such
handsome


dress
.
Mrs.
Robert

have
a
real
,

,

een


that
pierce
a
body
through
.
there
be
no
such
lady
nowadays
.
"




"
what
be
the
Hollow
like
then
,
Martha
?
"




"
different
to
what
it
be
now
;
but
I
can
tell
of
it
clean
different


again
,
when
there
be
neither
mill
,
nor
cot
,
nor
hall
,
except
Fieldhead
,


within
two
mile
of
it
.
I
can
tell
,
one
summer
evening
,
fifty
year


syne
,
my
mother
come
run
in
just
at
the
edge
of
dark
,
almost


fleye
out
of
her
wit
,
say
she
have
see
a
fairish
[
fairy
]
in


Fieldhead
Hollow
;
and
that
be
the
last
fairish
that
ever
be
see
on


this
countryside
(
though
they
've
be
hear
within
these
forty
year
)
.
a


lonesome
spot
it
be
,
and
a
bonny
spot
,
full
of
oak
tree
and
nut
tree
.


it
be
alter
now
.
"




the
story
be
tell
.
I
think
I
now
see
the
judicious
reader
put
on
his


spectacle
to
look
for
the
moral
.
it
would
be
an
insult
to
his
sagacity


to
offer
direction
.
I
only
say
,
God
speed
he
in
the
quest
!






the
END
