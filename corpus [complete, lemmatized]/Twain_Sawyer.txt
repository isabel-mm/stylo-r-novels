with
a
talent
for
dark

mysterious
diplomacy

she


love
to
contemplate
her
most
transparent

bit

a
scare
shoot
through

a
touch
of
uncomfortable
suspicion
.
he


search
Aunt
Polly
’s
face

it
tell
he
nothing

it
flatter

dry
without
anybody

that

where

wind
lie

forestall
what

overlook
that
bit
of


circumstantial
evidence
,

miss
a
trick
.
then
she
have
a
new


inspiration
:




"

half
glad
that

into

enough
to
buy

not
half
enough
to
buy
so
much
as
half
an
hour


of
pure
freedom
.
so
he
return
his

give
up
the
idea
of

upon

nothing
less
than
a
great
,


magnificent

Tom
say
to
himself
that
it
be
not
such
a
hollow
world
,
after
all
.
he


have
discover
a
great
law
of
human
action
,
without
know
it
--
namely
,


that
in
order
to
make
a
man
or
a
boy
covet
a
thing
,
it
be
only
necessary


to
make
the
thing
difficult
to
attain
.
if
he
have
be
a
great
and


wise
philosopher
,
like
the
writer
of
this
book
,
he
would
now
have


comprehend
that
work
consist
of
whatever
a
body
be
_
oblige
_
to
do
,


and
that
play
consist
of
whatever
a
body
be
not
oblige
to
do
.
and


this
would
help
he
to
understand
why
construct
artificial
flower
or


perform
on
a
tread
-
mill
be
work
,
while
roll
ten
-
pin
or
climb


Mont
Blanc
be
only
amusement
.
there
be
wealthy
gentleman
in
England


who
drive
four
-
horse
passenger
-
coach
twenty
or
thirty
mile
on
a


daily
line
,
in
the
summer
,
because
the
privilege
cost
they
considerable


money
;
but
if
they
be
offer
wage
for
the
service
,
that
would
turn


it
into
work
and
then
they
would
resign
.




the
boy
muse
awhile
over
the
substantial
change
which
have
take
place

trust
in
such
evidence
.
she
go
out
to
see
for


herself
;

she

homeward
alone
.




as
he
be
pass
by
the
house
where
Jeff
Thatcher
live
,
he
see
a
new


girl
in
the
garden
--
a
lovely
little
blue
-
eyed
creature
with
yellow


hair
plait
into
two
long
-
tail
,

summer

and
embroider


pan
-
talette
.
the
fresh
-
crown
hero
fall
without
fire
a
shot
.
a


certain
Amy
Lawrence
vanish
out
of
his
heart
and
leave
not
even
a


memory
of
herself
behind
.
he
have
think
he
love
she
to
distraction
;


he
have
regard
his
passion
as
adoration
;
and
behold
it
be
only
a
poor


little
evanescent
partiality
.
he
have
be
month
win
she
;
she
have


confess
hardly
a
week
ago
;
he
have
be
the
happy
and
the
proud


boy
in
the
world
only
seven
short
day
,
and
here
in
one
instant
of
time


she
have
go
out
of
his
heart
like
a
casual
stranger
whose
visit
be


do
.




he
worship
this
new
angel
with
furtive
eye
,
till
he
see
that
she
have


discover
he
;
then
he
pretend
he
do
not
know
she
be
present
,
and


begin
to
"
show
off
"
in
all
sort
of
absurd
boyish
way
,
in
order
to
win


her
admiration
.
he
keep
up
this
grotesque
foolishness
for
some
time
;


but
by
-
and
-
by
,
while
he
be
in
the
midst
of
some
dangerous
gymnastic


performance
,
he
glance
aside
and
see
that
the
little
girl
be
wend


her
way
toward
the
house
.
Tom
come
up
to
the
fence
and
lean
on
it
,


grieving
,
and
hope
she
would
tarry
yet
awhile
long
.
she
halt
a


moment
on
the
step
and
then
move
toward
the
door
.
Tom
heave
a
great


sigh
as
she
put
her
foot
on
the
threshold
.
but
his
face
light
up
,


right
away
,
for
she
toss
a
pansy
over
the
fence
a
moment
before
she


disappear
.




the
boy
run
around
and
stop
within
a
foot
or
two
of
the
flower
,
and


then
shade
his
eye
with
his
hand
and
begin
to
look
down
street
as


if
he
have
discover
something
of
interest
go
on
in
that
direction
.


presently
he
pick
up
a
straw
and
begin
try
to
balance
it
on
his


nose
,
with
his
head
tilt
far
back
;
and
as
he
move
from
side
to
side
,


in
his
effort
,
he
edge
near
and
near
toward
the
pansy
;
finally
his


bare
foot
rest
upon
it
,
his
pliant
toe
close
upon
it
,
and
he
hop


away
with
the
treasure
and
disappear
round
the
corner
.
but
only
for
a


minute
--
only
while
he
could
button
the
flower
inside
his
jacket
,
next


his
heart
--
or
next
his
stomach
,
possibly
,
for
he
be
not
much
post
in


anatomy
,
and
not
hypercritical
,
anyway
.




he
return
,
now
,
and
hang
about
the
fence
till
nightfall
,
"
show


off
,
"
as
before
;
but
the
girl
never
exhibit
herself
again
,
though
Tom


comfort
himself
a
little
with
the
hope
that
she
have
be
near
some


window
,
meantime
,
and
be
aware
of
his
attention
.
finally
he
stride


home
reluctantly
,
with
his
poor
head
full
of
vision
.




all
through
supper
his
spirit
be
so
high
that
his
aunt
wonder
"
what


have
get
into
the
child
.
"
he
take
a
good
scolding
about
clodde
Sid
,
and


do
not
seem
to
mind
it
in
the
least
.
he
try
to
steal
sugar
under
his


aunt
’s
very
nose
,
and
get
his
knuckle
rap
for
it
.
he
say
:




"
aunt
,
you
do
n’t
whack
Sid
when
he
take
it
.
"




"
well
,
Sid
do
n’t
torment
a
body
the
way
you
do
.
you
’d
be
always
into


that
sugar
if
I
warn’t
watch
you
.
"




presently
she
step
into
the
kitchen
,
and
Sid
,
happy
in
his
immunity
,


reach
for
the
sugar
-
bowl
--
a
sort
of
glory
over
Tom
which
be


wellnigh
unbearable
.
but
Sid
’s
finger
slip
and
the
bowl
drop
and


break
.
Tom
be
in
ecstasy
.
in
such
ecstasy
that
he
even
control


his
tongue
and
be
silent
.
he
say
to
himself
that
he
would
not
speak
a


word
,
even
when
his
aunt
come
in
,
but
would
sit
perfectly
still
till
she


ask
who
do
the
mischief
;
and
then
he
would
tell
,
and
there
would
be


nothing
so
good
in
the
world
as
to
see
that
pet
model
"
catch
it
.
"
he
be


so
brimful
of
exultation
that
he
could
hardly
hold
himself
when
the
old


lady
come
back
and
stand
above
the
wreck
discharge
lightning
of
wrath


from
over
her
spectacle
.
he
say
to
himself
,
"
now
it
’s
come
!
"
and
the


next
instant
he
be
sprawl
on
the
floor
!
the
potent
palm
be
uplifted


to
strike
again
when
Tom
cry
out
:




"
hold
on
,
now
,
what
'
er
you
belt
_

_
for?--Sid
break
it
!
"




Aunt
Polly
pause
,
perplexed
,
and
Tom
look
for
heal
pity
.
but
when


she
get
her
tongue
again
,
she
only
say
:




"
Umf
!
well
,
you
do
n’t
get
a
lick
amiss
,
I
reckon
.
you
be
into
some


other
audacious
mischief
when
I
be
n’t
around
,
like
enough
.
"




then
her
conscience
reproach
she
,
and
she
yearn
to
say
something


kind
and
love
;
but
she
judge
that
this
would
be
construe
into
a


confession
that
she
have
be
in
the
wrong
,
and
discipline
forbid
that
.


so
she
keep
silence
,
and
go
about
her
affair
with
a
troubled
heart
.


Tom
sulk
in
a
corner
and
exalt
his
woe
.
he
know
that
in
her
heart


his
aunt
be
on
her
knee
to
he
,
and
he
be
morosely
gratify
by
the


consciousness
of
it
.
he
would
hang
out
no
signal
,
he
would
take
notice


of
none
.
he
know
that
a
yearning
glance
fall
upon
he
,
now
and
then
,


through
a
film
of
tear
,
but
he
refuse
recognition
of
it
.
he
picture


himself
lie
sick
unto
death
and
his
aunt
bend
over
he
beseech


one
little
forgiving
word
,
but
he
would
turn
his
face
to
the
wall
,
and


die
with
that
word
unsaid
.
ah
,
how
would
she
feel
then
?
and
he
picture


himself
bring
home
from
the
river
,
dead
,
with
his
curl
all
wet
,
and


his
sore
heart
at
rest
.
how
she
would
throw
herself
upon
he
,
and
how


her
tear
would
fall
like
rain
,
and
her
lip
pray
God
to
give
she
back


her
boy
and
she
would
never
,
never
abuse
he
any
more
!
but
he
would


lie
there
cold
and
white
and
make
no
sign
--
a
poor
little
sufferer
,
whose


grief
be
at
an
end
.
he
so
work
upon
his
feeling
with
the
pathos
of


these
dream
,
that
he
have
to
keep
swallow
,
he
be
so
like
to
choke
;


and
his
eye
swam
in
a
blur
of
water
,
which
overflow
when
he
wink
,


and
run
down
and
trickle
from
the
end
of
his
nose
.
and
such
a
luxury
to


he
be
this
petting
of
his
sorrow
,
that
he
could
not
bear
to
have
any


worldly
cheeriness
or
any
grating
delight
intrude
upon
it
;
it
be
too


sacred
for
such
contact
;
and
so
,
presently
,
when
his
cousin
Mary
dance


in
,
all
alive
with
the
joy
of
see
home
again
after
an
age
-
long
visit


of
one
week
to
the
country
,
he
get
up
and
move
in
cloud
and
darkness


out
at
one
door
as
she
bring
song
and
sunshine
in
at
the
other
.




he
wander
far
from
the
accustomed
haunt
of
boy
,
and
seek
desolate


place
that
be
in
harmony
with
his
spirit
.
a
log
raft
in
the
river


invite
he
,
and
he
seat
himself
on
its
outer
edge
and
contemplate


the
dreary
vastness
of
the
stream
,
wish
,
the
while
,
that
he
could


only
be
drown
,
all
at
once
and
unconsciously
,
without
undergo
the


uncomfortable
routine
devise
by
nature
.
then
he
think
of
his
flower
.


he
get
it
out
,
rumple
and
wilted
,
and
it
mightily
increase
his
dismal


felicity
.
he
wonder
if
she
would
pity
he
if
she
know
?
would
she


cry
,
and
wish
that
she
have
a
right
to
put
her
arm
around
his
neck
and


comfort
he
?
or
would
she
turn
coldly
away
like
all
the
hollow
world
?


this
picture
bring
such
an
agony
of
pleasurable
suffering
that
he


work
it
over
and
over
again
in
his
mind
and
set
it
up
in
new
and


varied
light
,
till
he
wear
it
threadbare
.
at
last
he
rise
up
sigh


and
depart
in
the
darkness
.




about
half
-
past
nine
or
ten
o’clock
he
come
along
the
deserted
street
to


where
the
Adored
Unknown
live
;
he
pause
a
moment
;
no
sound
fall
upon


his
listening
ear
;
a
candle
be
cast
a
dull
glow
upon
the
curtain


of
a
second
-
story
window
.
be
the
sacred
presence
there
?
he
climb
the


fence
,
thread
his
stealthy
way
through
the
plant
,
till
he
stand
under


that
window
;
he
look
up
at
it
long
,
and
with
emotion
;
then
he
lay
he


down
on
the
ground
under
it
,
dispose
himself
upon
his
back
,
with
his


hand
clasp
upon
his
breast
and
hold
his
poor
wilted
flower
.


and
thus
he
would
die
--
out
in
the
cold
world
,
with
no
shelter
over
his


homeless
head
,
no
friendly
hand
to
wipe
the
death
-
damp
from
his
brow
,


no
love
face
to
bend
pityingly
over
he
when
the
great
agony
come
.
and


thus
_
she
_
would
see
he
when
she
look
out
upon
the
glad
morning
,
and


oh
!
would
she
drop
one
little
tear
upon
his
poor
,
lifeless
form
,
would


she
heave
one
little
sigh
to
see
a
bright
young
life
so
rudely
blight
,


so
untimely
cut
down
?

in
the
air

with
the

of
a
curse
,

,

small
,

form

over

away

a
very
plainly
bind
Bible
(
worth
forty
cent
in
those
easy


time
)
to
the
pupil
.
how
many
of
my
reader
would
have
the
industry
and


application
to
memorize
two
thousand
verse
,
even
for
a
Dore
Bible
?
and


yet
Mary
have
acquire
two
bible
in
this
way
--
it
be
the
patient
work
of


two
year
--
and
a
boy
of
german
parentage
have
win
four
or
five
.
he
once


recite
three
thousand
verse
without
stop
;
but
the
strain
upon
his


mental
faculty
be
too
great
,
and
he
be
little
well
than
an
idiot


from
that
day
forth
--
a
grievous
misfortune
for
the
school
,
for
on
great


occasion
,
before
company
,
the
superintendent
(
as
Tom
express
it
)


have
always
make
this
boy
come
out
and
"
spread
himself
.
"
only
the
old


pupil
manage
to
keep
their
ticket
and
stick
to
their
tedious
work


long
enough
to
get
a
Bible
,
and
so
the
delivery
of
one
of
these
prize


be
a
rare
and
noteworthy
circumstance
;
the
successful
pupil
be
so


great
and
conspicuous
for
that
day
that
on
the
spot
every
scholar
’s


heart
be
fire
with
a
fresh
ambition
that
often
last
a
couple


of
week
.
it
be
possible
that
Tom
’s
mental
stomach
have
never
really


hunger
for
one
of
those
prize
,
but
unquestionably
his
entire
being


have
for
many
a
day
long
for
the
glory
and
the
eclat
that
come
with
it
.




in
due
course
the
superintendent
stand
up
in
front
of
the
pulpit
,
with


a
closed
hymn
-
book
in
his
hand
and
his
forefinger
insert
between
its


leave
,
and
command
attention
.
when
a
Sunday
-
school
superintendent


make
his
customary
little
speech
,
a
hymn
-
book
in
the
hand
be
as


necessary
as
be
the
inevitable
sheet
of
music
in
the
hand
of
a
singer


who
stand
forward
on
the
platform
and
sing
a
solo
at
a
concert
--
though


why
,
be
a
mystery
:
for
neither
the
hymn
-
book
nor
the
sheet
of
music


be
ever
refer
to
by
the
sufferer
.
this
superintendent
be
a
slim


creature
of
thirty
-
five
,
with
a
sandy
goatee
and
short
sandy
hair
;
he


wear
a
stiff
standing
-
collar
whose
upper
edge
almost
reach
his
ear


and
whose
sharp
point
curve
forward
abreast
the
corner
of
his
mouth
--
a


fence
that
compel
a
straight
lookout
ahead
,
and
a
turning
of
the


whole
body
when
a
side
view
be
require
;
his
chin
be
prop
on
a


spread
cravat
which
be
as
broad
and
as
long
as
a
bank
-
note
,
and
have


fringe
end
;
his
boot
toe
be
turn
sharply
up
,
in
the
fashion


of
the
day
,
like
sleigh
-
runner
--
an
effect
patiently
and
laboriously


produce
by
the
young
man
by
sit
with
their
toe
press
against
a


wall
for
hour
together
.
Mr.
Walters
be
very
earnest
of
mien
,
and
very


sincere
and
honest
at
heart
;
and
he
hold
sacred
thing
and
place


in
such
reverence
,
and
so
separate
they
from
worldly
matter
,
that


unconsciously
to
himself
his
Sunday
-
school
voice
have
acquire
a
peculiar


intonation
which
be
wholly
absent
on
week
-
day
.
he
begin
after
this


fashion
:




"
now
,
child
,
I
want
you
all
to
sit
up
just
as
straight
and
pretty
as


you
can
and
give
I
all
your
attention
for
a
minute
or
two
.
there
--
that


be
it
.
that
be
the
way
good
little
boy
and
girl
should
do
.
I
see
one


little
girl
who
be
look
out
of
the
window
--
I
be
afraid
she
think
I


be
out
there
somewhere
--
perhaps
up
in
one
of
the
tree
make
a
speech


to
the
little
bird
.
[
applausive
titter
.
]
I
want
to
tell
you
how
good
it


make
I
feel
to
see
so
many
bright
,
clean
little
face
assemble
in
a


place
like
this
,
learn
to
do
right
and
be
good
.
"
and
so
forth
and
so


on
.
it
be
not
necessary
to
set
down
the
rest
of
the
oration
.
it
be
of
a


pattern
which
do
not
vary
,
and
so
it
be
familiar
to
we
all
.




the
latter
third
of
the
speech
be
mar
by
the
resumption
of
fight


and
other
recreation
among
certain
of
the
bad
boy
,
and
by
fidgeting


and
whispering
that
extend
far
and
wide
,
wash
even
to
the
basis
of


isolated
and
incorruptible
rock
like
Sid
and
Mary
.
but
now
every
sound


cease
suddenly
,
with
the
subsidence
of
Mr.
Walters
’
voice
,
and
the


conclusion
of
the
speech
be
receive
with
a
burst
of
silent
gratitude
.




a
good
part
of
the
whispering
have
be
occasion
by
an
event
which
be


more
or
less
rare
--
the
entrance
of
visitor
:
lawyer
Thatcher
,
accompany


by
a
very
feeble
and
aged
man
;
a
fine
,
portly
,
middle
-
aged
gentleman


with
iron
-
gray
hair
;
and
a
dignified
lady
who
be
doubtless
the
latter
’s


wife
.
the
lady
be
lead
a
child
.
Tom
have
be
restless
and
full
of


chafing
and
repining
;
conscience
-
smitten
,
too
--
he
could
not
meet
Amy


Lawrence
’s
eye
,
he
could
not
brook
her
love
gaze
.
but
when
he
see
this


small
newcomer
his
soul
be
all
ablaze
with
bliss
in
a
moment
.
the
next


moment
he
be
"
show
off
"
with
all
his
might
--
cuff
boy
,
pull


hair
,
make
face
--
in
a
word
,
use
every
art
that
seem
likely
to


fascinate
a
girl
and
win
her
applause
.
his
exaltation
have
but
one


alloy
--
the
memory
of
his
humiliation
in
this
angel
’s
garden
--
and
that


record
in
sand
be
fast
washing
out
,
under
the
wave
of
happiness
that


be
sweep
over
it
now
.




the
visitor

the
high
seat
of
honor

as
soon
as

a
prodigious
personage
--
no
less
a
one


than
the
county
judge
--
altogether
the
most
august
creation
these
child


have
ever
look
upon
--
and
they
wonder
what
kind
of
material
he
be
make


of
--
and
they
half
want
to
hear
he
roar
,
and
be
half
afraid
he
might
,


too
.

from
Constantinople
,

roof
.
the
awe
which
these


reflection
inspire
be
attest
by
the
impressive
silence
and
the


rank
of
stare

it
would
have
be
music


to
his

a
thunderbolt

here

it
be
the
most
stunning
surprise
of
the
decade
,
and


so
profound
be
the
sensation
that
it
lift
the
new
hero
up
to
the


judicial
one
’s
altitude
,
and
the
school
have
two
marvel
to
gaze
upon


in
place
of
one
.
the
boy
be
all
eat
up
with
envy
--
but
those
that


suffer
the
bitter
pang
be
those
who
perceive
too
late
that
they


themselves
have
contribute
to
this
hate
splendor
by
trade
ticket
to


Tom
for
the
wealth
he
have
amass
in

be
the
dupe
of
a
wily
fraud
,
a


guileful
snake
in
the
grass
.




the
prize
be
deliver

Tom
with
as
much
effusion
as
the


superintendent
could
pump
up
under
the
circumstance
;
but
it
lack


somewhat
of
the
true
gush
,
for
the
poor
fellow
’s
instinct
teach
he


that
there
be
a
mystery
here
that
could
not
well
bear
the
light
,


perhaps
;
it
be
simply
preposterous
that
this
boy
have
warehouse
two


thousand
sheaf
of
Scriptural
wisdom
on
his
premise
--
a
dozen
would


strain
his
capacity
,
without
a
doubt
.




Amy
Lawrence

proud
and
glad
,

she
try
to
make
Tom
see
it
in


her
face

he
would
n’t
look

she
wonder
;
then
she
be
just
a
grain


troubled
;
next
a
dim
suspicion
come
and
go

come
again
;
she
watch
;


a
furtive
glance
tell
her
world

and
then
her
heart
break
,

she
be


jealous
,

angry
,

the
tear
come

hate
everybody

his
tongue
be
tie

his
breath


would
hardly

,
his
heart
quake
--
partly
because
of
the
awful


greatness
of
the
man
,

mainly
because
he

her

have
like
to
fall
down
and

there
be

the
boy
whose
history
this
book
relate
do
not
enjoy
the
prayer
,
he


only
endure
it
--
if
he
even
do
that
much
.
he
be
restive
all
through
it
;


he
keep
tally
of
the
detail
of
the
prayer
,
unconsciously
--
for
he
be
not


listen
,
but
he
know
the
ground
of
old
,
and
the
clergyman
’s
regular


route
over
it
--
and
when
a
little
trifle
of
new
matter
be
interlard
,


his
ear
detect
it
and
his
whole
nature
resent
it
;
he
consider


addition
unfair
,
and
scoundrelly
.
in
the
midst
of
the
prayer
a
fly
have


light
on
the
back
of
the
pew
in
front
of
he
and
torture
his
spirit
by


calmly
rub
its
hand
together
,
embrace
its
head
with
its
arm
,
and


polish
it
so
vigorously
that
it
seem
to
almost
part
company
with


the
body
,
and
the
slender
thread
of
a
neck
be
expose
to
view
;
scrape


its
wing
with
its
hind
leg
and
smooth
they
to
its
body
as
if
they


have
be
coat
-
tail
;
go
through
its
whole
toilet
as
tranquilly
as
if


it
know
it
be
perfectly
safe
.
as
indeed
it
be
;
for
as
sorely
as
Tom
’s


hand
itch
to
grab
for
it
they
do
not
dare
--
he
believe
his
soul
would


be
instantly
destroy
if
he
do
such
a
thing
while
the
prayer
be
go


on
.
but
with
the
closing
sentence
his
hand
begin
to
curve
and
steal


forward
;
and
the
instant
the
"
amen
"
be
out
the
fly
be
a
prisoner
of


war
.
his
aunt
detect
the
act
and
make
he
let
it
go
.




the
minister
give
out
his
text
and
drone
along
monotonously
through
an


argument
that
be
so
prosy
that
many
a
head
by
and
by
begin
to
nod
--
and


yet
it
be
an
argument
that
deal
in
limitless
fire
and
brimstone
and


thin
the
predestine
elect
down
to
a
company
so
small
as
to
be
hardly


worth
the
saving
.
Tom
count
the
page
of
the
sermon
;
after
church
he


always
know
how
many
page
there
have
be
,
but
he
seldom
know
anything


else
about
the
discourse
.
however
,
this
time
he
be
really
interested


for
a
little
while
.
the
minister
make
a
grand
and
move
picture
of
the


assemble
together
of
the
world
’s
host
at
the
millennium
when
the
lion


and
the
lamb
should
lie
down
together
and
a
little
child
should
lead


they
.
but
the
pathos
,
the
lesson
,
the
moral
of
the
great
spectacle


be
lose
upon
the
boy
;
he
only
think
of
the
conspicuousness
of
the


principal
character
before
the
on
-
look
nation
;
his
face
light
with
the


think
,
and
he
say
to
himself
that
he
wish
he
could
be
that
child
,


if
it
be
a
tame
lion
.




now
he
lapse
into
suffer
again
,
as
the
dry
argument
be
resume
.


presently
he
bethink
he
of
a
treasure
he
have
and
get
it
out
.
it
be


a
large
black
beetle
with
formidable
jaw
--
a
"
pinchbug
,
"
he
call
it
.
it


be
in
a
percussion
-
cap
box
.
the
first
thing
the
beetle
do
be
to


take
he
by
the
finger
.
a
natural
fillip
follow
,
the
beetle
go


flounder
into
the
aisle
and
light
on
its
back
,
and
the
hurt
finger
go


into
the
boy
’s
mouth
.
the
beetle
lie
there
work
its
helpless
leg
,


unable
to
turn
over
.
Tom
eye
it
,
and
long
for
it
;
but
it
be
safe
out


of
his
reach
.
other
people
uninterested
in
the
sermon
find
relief
in


the
beetle
,
and
they
eye
it
too
.
presently
a
vagrant
poodle
dog
come


idle
along
,
sad
at
heart
,
lazy
with
the
summer
softness
and
the


quiet
,
weary
of
captivity
,
sigh
for
change
.
he
spy
the
beetle
;
the


droop
tail
lift
and
wag
.
he
survey
the
prize
;
walk
around


it
;
smelt
at
it
from
a
safe
distance
;
walk
around
it
again
;
grow


bolder
,
and
take
a
close
smell
;
then
lift
his
lip
and
make
a
gingerly


snatch
at
it
,
just
miss
it
;
make
another
,
and
another
;
begin
to
enjoy


the
diversion
;
subside
to
his
stomach
with
the
beetle
between
his
paw
,


and
continue
his
experiment
;
grow
weary
at
last
,
and
then
indifferent


and
absent
-
minded
.
his
head
nod
,
and
little
by
little
his
chin


descend
and
touch
the
enemy
,
who
seize
it
.
there
be
a
sharp
yelp
,


a
flirt
of
the
poodle
’s
head
,
and
the
beetle
fall
a
couple
of
yard


away
,
and
light
on
its
back
once
more
.
the
neighbor
spectator


shake
with
a
gentle
inward
joy
,
several
face
go
behind
fan
and


hand
-
kerchief
,
and
Tom
be
entirely
happy
.
the
dog
look
foolish
,


and
probably
feel
so
;
but
there
be
resentment
in
his
heart
,
too
,
and
a


crave
for
revenge
.
so
he
go
to
the
beetle
and
begin
a
wary
attack
on


it
again
;
jump
at
it
from
every
point
of
a
circle
,
light
with
his


fore
-
paw
within
an
inch
of
the
creature
,
make
even
close
snatch
at


it
with
his
tooth
,
and
jerk
his
head
till
his
ear
flap
again
.
but


he
grow
tired
once
more
,
after
a
while
;
try
to
amuse
himself
with
a


fly
but
find
no
relief
;
follow
an
ant
around
,
with
his
nose
close


to
the
floor
,
and
quickly
weary
of
that
;
yawn
,
sigh
,
forget
the


beetle
entirely
,
and
sit
down
on
it
.
then
there
be
a
wild
yelp
of
agony


and
the
poodle
go
sail
up
the
aisle
;
the
yelp
continue
,
and
so


do
the
dog
;
he
cross
the
house
in
front
of
the
altar
;
he
fly


down
the
other
aisle
;
he
cross
before
the
door
;
he
clamor
up
the


home
-
stretch
;
his
anguish
grow
with
his
progress
,
till
presently
he
be


but
a
woolly
comet
move
in
its
orbit
with
the
gleam
and
the
speed
of


light
.
at
last
the
frantic
sufferer
sheer
from
its
course
,
and
spring


into
its
master
’s
lap
;
he
fling
it
out
of
the
window
,
and
the
voice
of


distress
quickly
thin
away
and
die
in
the
distance
.




by
this
time
the
whole
church
be
red
-
face
and
suffocate
with


suppress
laughter
,
and
the
sermon
have
come
to
a
dead
standstill
.


the
discourse
be
resume
presently
,
but
it
go
lame
and
halting
,
all


possibility
of
impressiveness
be
at
an
end
;
for
even
the
grave


sentiment
be
constantly
be
receive
with
a
smother
burst
of


unholy
mirth
,
under
cover
of
some
remote
pew
-
back
,
as
if
the
poor
parson


have
say
a
rarely
facetious
thing
.
it
be
a
genuine
relief
to
the
whole


congregation
when
the
ordeal
be
over
and
the
benediction
pronounce
.




Tom
Sawyer
go
home
quite
cheerful
,
think
to
himself
that
there
be


some
satisfaction
about
divine
service
when
there
be
a
bit
of
variety


in
it
.
he
have
but
one
mar
thought
;
he
be
willing
that
the
dog


should
play
with
his
pinchbug
,
but
he
do
not
think
it
be
upright
in


he
to
carry
it
off
.










chapter
VI




MONDAY
morning
find
Tom
Sawyer
miserable
.
Monday
morning
always
find


he
so
--
because
it
begin
another
week
’s
slow
suffering
in
school
.
he


generally
begin
that
day
with
wish
he
have
have
no
intervene
holiday
,


it
make
the
go
into
captivity
and
fetter
again
so
much
more
odious
.




Tom
lie
think
.
presently
it
occur
to
he
that
he
wish
he
be


sick
;
then
he
could
stay
home
from
school
.
here
be
a
vague
possibility
.


he
canvass
his
system
.
no
ailment
be
find
,
and
he
investigate


again
.
this
time
he
think
he
could
detect
colicky
symptom
,
and
he


begin
to
encourage
they
with
considerable
hope
.
but
they
soon
grow


feeble
,
and
presently
die
wholly
away
.
he
reflect
far
.
suddenly


he
discover
something
.
one
of
his
upper
front
tooth
be
loose
.
this


be
lucky
;
he
be
about
to
begin
to
groan
,
as
a
"
starter
,
"
as
he


call
it
,
when
it
occur
to
he
that
if
he
come
into
court
with
that


argument
,
his
aunt
would
pull
it
out
,
and
that
would
hurt
.
so
he
think


he
would
hold
the
tooth
in
reserve
for
the
present
,
and
seek
far
.


nothing
offer
for
some
little
time
,
and
then
he
remember
hear


the
doctor
tell
about
a
certain
thing
that
lay
up
a
patient
for
two
or


three
week
and
threaten
to
make
he
lose
a
finger
.
so
the
boy
eagerly


draw
his
sore
toe
from
under
the
sheet
and
hold
it
up
for
inspection
.


but
now
he
do
not
know
the
necessary
symptom
.
however
,
it
seem


well
worth
while
to
chance
it
,
so
he
fall
to
groan
with
considerable


spirit
.




but
Sid
sleep
on
unconscious
.




Tom
groan
louder
,
and
fancy
that
he
begin
to
feel
pain
in
the
toe
.




no
result
from
Sid
.




Tom
be
pant
with
his
exertion
by
this
time
.
he
take
a
rest
and
then


swell
himself
up
and
fetch
a
succession
of
admirable
groan
.




Sid
snore
on
.




Tom
be
aggravate
.
he
say
,
"

"
and
shake
he
.
this
course


work
well
,
and
Tom
begin
to
groan
again
.
Sid
yawn
,
stretch
,
then


bring
himself
up
on
his
elbow
with
a
snort
,
and
begin
to
stare
at
Tom
.


Tom
go
on
groan
.
Sid
say
:




"

just
at
this

,
fateful
grip
close
on

as
the
school

down

make
an
honest
effort
to
study
,

the
turmoil
within
he
be

great
.
in
turn
he
take
his
place
in
the

the
hard
Tom
try
to
fasten
his
mind
on
his
book
,
the
more
his
idea


wander
.
so
at
last
,
with
a
sigh
and
a
yawn
,
he
give
it
up
.
it
seem


to
he
that
the
noon
recess
would
never
come
.
the
air
be
utterly
dead
.


there
be
not
a
breath
stir
.
it
be
the
sleepy
of
sleepy
day
.


the
drowse
murmur
of
the
five
and
twenty
study
scholar
soothe


the
soul
like
the
spell
that
be
in
the
murmur
of
bee
.
away
off
in
the


flame
sunshine
,
Cardiff
Hill
lift
its
soft
green
side
through
a


shimmer
veil
of
heat
,
tint
with
the
purple
of
distance
;
a
few
bird


float
on
lazy
wing
high
in
the
air
;
no
other
living
thing
be
visible


but
some
cow
,
and
they
be
asleep
.
Tom
’s
heart
ache
to
be
free
,
or


else
to
have
something
of
interest
to
do
to
pass
the
dreary
time
.


his
hand
wander
into
his
pocket
and
his
face
light
up
with
a
glow
of


gratitude
that
be
prayer
,
though
he
do
not
know
it
.
then
furtively


the
percussion
-
cap
box
come
out
.
he
release
the
tick
and
put
he
on


the
long
flat
desk
.
the
creature
probably
glow
with
a
gratitude
that


amount
to
prayer
,
too
,
at
this
moment
,
but
it
be
premature
:
for
when


he
start
thankfully
to
travel
off
,
Tom
turn
he
aside
with
a
pin
and


make
he
take
a
new
direction
.




Tom
’s
bosom
friend
sit
next
he
,
suffer
just
as
Tom
have
be
,
and


now
he
be
deeply
and
gratefully
interested
in
this
entertainment
in


an
instant
.
this
bosom
friend
be
Joe
Harper
.
the
two
boy
be
swear


friend
all
the
week
,
and
embattle
enemy
on
Saturdays
.
Joe
take
a


pin
out
of
his
lapel
and
begin
to
assist
in
exercise
the
prisoner
.


the
sport
grow
in
interest
momently
.
soon
Tom
say
that
they
be


interfere
with
each
other
,
and
neither
get
the
full
benefit


of
the
tick
.
so
he
put
Joe
’s
slate
on
the
desk
and
draw
a
line
down
the


middle
of
it
from
top
to
bottom
.




"
now
,
"
say
he
,
"
as

on
your
side
you
can
stir
he
up
and


I
’ll
let
he
alone
;
but
if
you
let
he
get
away
and
get
on
my
side
,


you
’re
to
leave
he
alone

"
all
right

ahead
;
start
he
up
.
"




the
tick
escape
from
Tom
,
presently
,
and
cross
the
equator
.
Joe


harass
he
awhile
,
and
then
he
get
away
and
cross
back
again
.
this


change
of
base
occur
often
.
while
one
boy
be
worry
the
tick
with


absorb
interest
,
the
other
would
look
on
with
interest
as
strong
,
the


two
head
bow
together
over
the
slate
,
and
the
two
soul
dead
to
all


thing
else
.
at
last
luck
seem
to
settle
and
abide
with
Joe
.
the


tick
try
this
,
that
,
and
the
other
course
,
and
get
as
excited
and
as


anxious
as
the
boy
themselves
,
but
time
and
again
just
as
he
would


have
victory
in
his
very
grasp
,
so
to
speak
,
and
Tom
’s
finger
would


be
twitch
to
begin
,
Joe
’s
pin
would
deftly
head
he
off
,
and
keep


possession
.
at
last
Tom
could
stand
it
no
long
.
the
temptation
be
too


strong
.
so
he
reach
out
and
lend
a
hand
with
his
pin

Joe
be
angry
in


a
moment
.

"




a
tremendous
whack
come
down
on
Tom
’s
shoulder
,
and
its
duplicate
on


Joe
’s
;
and
for
the
space
of
two
minute
the
dust
continue
to
fly
from


the
two
jacket
and
the
whole
school
to
enjoy
it
.
the
boy
have
be


too
absorb
to
notice
the
hush
that
have
steal
upon
the
school
awhile


before
when
the
master
came
tiptoe
down
the
room
and
stand
over
they
.


he
have
contemplate
a
good
part
of
the
performance
before
he
contribute


his
bit
of
variety
to
it
.




when
school
break
up
at
noon
,
Tom
fly
to
Becky
Thatcher
,
and
whisper


in
her
ear
:




"

the
rest
of

so
the
one
go
off
with

group
of
scholar

with


another

meet
at

so
create
another
surprising


house
.
when
the
interest
in

begin
to
wane
,
the
two
fall
to
talk

Tom

house
be
hardly
distinguishable
away
off
in
the


valley
behind

.
he
enter
a
dense
wood
,
pick
his
pathless
way
to


the
centre
of
it
,
and
sit
down
on
a
mossy
spot
under
a

this
seem
to

.

seem
to
he


that
life
be

a
trouble

at
good
,

so
lately

must
be

dream
forever

,
with
the
wind
whisper
through


the
tree
and
caress
the
grass

the
flower
over
the
grave
,

nothing
to
bother
and
grieve
about
,

any
more

the
good
in

would
be
sorry
some
day

maybe
when
it

too
late
.
ah
,
if
he
could
only


die

the
elastic
heart
of
youth
can
not
be
compress
into
one
constrain


shape
long
at
a
time

Tom
presently
begin
to
drift
insensibly
back
into


the
concern
of
this
life
again
.
what
if
he
turn
his
back
,
now
,

disappear
mysteriously
?
what
if
he
go
away

ever
so
far
away
,
into


unknown
country
beyond
the
sea

and
never
come
back
any
more

how


would
she
feel
then
!
the
idea
of
be
a
clown
recur
to
he
now
,
only


to
fill
he
with
disgust
.
for
frivolity
and
joke
and
spot
tight


be
an
offense
,
when
they
intrude
themselves
upon
a
spirit
that
be


exalt
into
the
vague
august
realm
of
the
romantic

go
on


the
warpath
in
the
mountain
range
and
the
trackless
great
plain
of
the


far
West
,

away
in
the
future
come
back

whoop
,
and
sear
the
eyeball


of
all
his
companion
with
unappeasable
envy
.
but
no
,
there
be


something
gaudy
even
than
this
.
he

the
world

at
the
zenith
of
his
fame
,
how
he
would
suddenly
appear


at
the
old
village
and
stalk
into

expose
a

he
take
it


up
and
disclose
a
shapely
little
treasure
-
house
whose
bottom
and
side


be
of
shingle

in
it
lie
a
marble

Tom
’s
astonishment
be
bind
-
less
!


he
scratch
his
head
with
a
perplexed
air
,
and
say
:




"
well
,
that
beat
anything

"




then
he
toss
the
marble
away
pettishly
,
and
stand
cogitate
.
the


truth
be
,
that
a
superstition
of
his
have
fail
,
here
,
which
he
and


all
his
comrade
have
always
look
upon
as
infallible
.
if
you
bury


a
marble
with
certain
necessary
incantation
,
and
leave
it
alone
a


fortnight
,
and
then
open
the
place
with
the
incantation
he
have
just


use
,
you
would
find
that
all
the
marble
you
have
ever
lose
have
gather


themselves
together
there
,
meantime
,
no
matter
how
widely
they
have
be


separate
.
but
now
,
this
thing
have
actually
and
unquestionably
fail
.


Tom
’s
whole
structure
of
faith
be
shake
to
its
foundation
.
he
have


many
a
time
hear
of
this
thing
succeed
but
never
of
its
fail


before
.
it
do
not
occur
to
he
that
he
have
try
it
several
time


before
,
himself
,
but
could
never
find
the
hiding

place
afterward
.
he


puzzle
over
the
matter
some
time
,
and
finally
decide
that
some
witch


have
interfere
and
break
the
charm
.
he
think
he
would
satisfy
himself


on
that
point
;
so
he
search
around
till
he
find
a
small
sandy
spot


with
a
little
funnel
-
shape
depression
in
it
.
he
lay
himself
down
and


put
his
mouth
close

he
well
know
the

of
try
to
contend
against

so
he


give
up
discouraged
.
but
it
occur
to
he
that
he
might
as
well
have


the
marble
he
have
just
throw
away

therefore
he
go
and
make
a


patient
search
for
it
.

he
could
not

now
he
go

himself
just
as
he
have

when
he
toss
the
marble
away
;
then
he
take
another
marble

his


pocket

toss
it
in
the

way

he
watch

stop

go
there
and
look
.
but
it
must


have
fall
short
or
go
too
far
;
so
he
try
twice
more
.
the
last


repetition
be
successful
.
the
two

within
a
foot

just
here
the

faintly
down

to
he
that

must
be


nearly
daylight

he

his
nerve

he
be


afraid

up
into

dark

dismally
still

now
the


tiresome
chirping
of
a
cricket
that
no
human
ingenuity
could
locate
,


begin
.
next
the
ghastly
ticking

a
fainter
howl

remoter
distance

in
an
agony

then
there
come

melancholy

finish
breakfast

there
be
no

there
be
avert


eye
;
there
be
a
silence

an
air
of
solemnity
that
strike
a
chill


to
the
culprit
’s
heart

he
sit

it
rouse
no
smile

he
lapse
into


silence

let
his
heart
sink
down
to
the
depth
.




after
breakfast
his
aunt
take
he
aside

the

it
be
not
so

his
aunt


weep
over
he

ask
he
how
he
could
go
and
break
her
old
heart
so
;


and
finally
tell
he
to
go
on
,

ruin
himself

bring
her
gray
hair

it

no
use

he
cry

he
plead
for
forgiveness
,

dismissal

that


he
have
win

an
imperfect
forgiveness

a
feeble


confidence

he
leave
the
presence
too
miserable
to
even
feel
revengeful
toward


sid
;

so
the
latter
’s
prompt
retreat
through
the
back
gate

unnecessary

he
mope
to

busy
with
heavy
woe

wholly
dead

and
hear
the


stony
-
hearted
liar
reel
off
his
serene
statement
,
they
expect
every


moment
that
the
clear
sky
would
deliver
God
’s
lightning
upon
his
head
,


and
wonder
to
see
how
long
the
stroke
be
delay
.
and
when
he
have


finish
and
still

alive

whole
,
their
waver
impulse
to


break
their
oath
and
save
the
poor
betray
prisoner
’s
life
fade
and


vanish
away
,
for
plainly
this
miscreant
have
sell
himself
to
Satan
and


it
would
be
fatal
to
meddle
with
the
property
of
such
a
power
as
that
.




"
why

you

and
he
fall
to


sob
again
.




Injun
Joe
repeat
his
statement
,
just
as
calmly
,
a
few
minute


afterward
on
the
inquest
,
under
oath
;
and
the
boy
,
see
that
the


lightning

confirm
in
their
belief
that

have
sell
himself
to
the
devil
.
he
be
now
become
,
to
they
,
the
most


balefully
interesting
object
they
have
ever
look
upon
,
and
they
could


not
take
their
fascinated
eye
from
his
face
.




they
inwardly
resolve
to
watch
he
night
,
when
opportunity
should


offer
,
in
the
hope
of
get
a
glimpse
of
his
dread
master

Injun

help
to
raise
the
body
of
the

put
it

the

think
that
this
happy


circumstance
would
turn
suspicion
in
the
right
direction
;
but
they
be


disappointed
,
for
more
than
one

Mary
say
she
have
be
affect
much
the

way
.
Sid
seem
satisfied
.


Tom
get
out
of
the
presence
as
quick
as
he
plausibly
could
,
and
after


that
he
complain
of
toothache
for
a
week
,
and
tie
up
his
jaw
every


night
.
he
never
know
that
Sid
lie
nightly
watch
,
and
frequently


slip
the
bandage
free
and
then
lean
on
his
elbow
listen
a
good


while
at
a
time
,
and
afterward
slip
the
bandage
back
to
its
place


again
.
Tom
’s
distress
of
mind
wear
off
gradually
and
the
toothache
grow


irksome
and
be
discard
.
if
Sid
really
manage
to
make
anything
out
of


Tom
’s
disjoint
muttering
,
he
keep
it
to
himself
.




it
seem
to
Tom
that
his
schoolmate
never
would
get
do
hold


inquest
on
dead
cat
,
and
thus
keep
his
trouble
present
to
his
mind
.


Sid
notice
that
Tom
never
be
coroner
at
one
of
these
inquiry
,


though
it
have
be
his
habit
to
take
the
lead
in
all
new
enterprise
;


he
notice
,
too
,
that
Tom
never
act
as
a
witness
--
and
that
be
strange
;


and
Sid
do
not
overlook
the
fact
that
Tom
even
show
a
marked
aversion


to
these
inquest
,
and
always
avoid
they
when
he
could
.
Sid
marvel
,


but
say
nothing
.
however
,
even
inquest
go
out
of
vogue
at
last
,
and


cease
to
torture
Tom
’s
conscience
.




every
day
or
two
,
during
this
time
of
sorrow
,
Tom
watch
his


opportunity
and
go
to
the
little
grated
jail
-
window
and
smuggle
such


small
comfort
through
to
the
"
murderer
"
as
he
could
get
hold
of
.
the


jail
be
a
trifling
little
brick
den
that
stand
in
a
marsh
at
the
edge


of
the
village
,
and
no
guard
be
afford
for
it
;
indeed
,
it


be
seldom
occupy
.
these
offering
greatly
help
to
ease
Tom
’s


conscience
.




the
villager
have
a
strong
desire
to
tar

and
-
feather
Injun
Joe
and
ride


he
on
a
rail
,
for
body
-
snatch
,
but
so
formidable
be
his
character


that
nobody
could
be
find
who
be
willing
to
take
the
lead
in
the


matter
,
so
it
be
drop
.
he
have
be
careful
to
begin
both
of
his


inquest
-
statement
with
the
fight
,
without
confess
the
grave
-
robbery


that
precede
it
;
therefore
it
be
deem
wise
not
to
try
the
case

the
court
at
present

chapter
xii




one
of
the
reason
why
Tom

mind
have
drift
away
from
its
secret


trouble
be
,
that
it
have
find
a

and
feel
very
miserable
.
she
be
ill
.
what
if
she


should
die
!
there
be
distraction
in
the
thought
.
he
no
long
take
an


interest
in
war
,
nor
even
in
piracy
.
the
charm
of
life
be
go
;
there


be
nothing
but
dreariness
leave
.
he
put
his
hoop
away
,
and
his
bat
;


there
be
no
joy
in

his

she
begin

when
something
fresh
in
this
line
come
out
she
be
in
a


fever
,
right
away
,
to
try
it
;
not
on
herself
,
for
she
be
never
ail
,


but
on
anybody
else
that
come

.
she
be
a
subscriber
for
all
the

the
solemn
ignorance

her
nostril
.
all
the

they


contain
about

how
to
go
to

and
what
sort
of

be
all

she
never
observe
that

journal
of
the
current
month
customarily
upset
everything
they


have
recommend
the

before
.
she
be
as
simple
-
hearted
and
honest


as
the
day
be
long
,
and
so
she
be
an
easy
victim
.
she
gather


together
her
quack
periodical
and
her
quack
medicine
,
and
thus
arm


with
death
,
go
about
on
her
pale
horse
,
metaphorically
speak
,
with


"
hell
follow
after

"
but
she
never
suspect
that
she
be
not
an


angel
of
healing
and
the
balm
of
Gilead
in
disguise
,
to
the
suffering


neighbor
.




the
water
treatment
be
new
,
now
,
and
Tom
’s
low
condition
be
a
windfall


to
she
.
she
have
he
out
at
daylight
every
morning
,
stand
he
up
in
the


wood
-
shed
and
drown
he
with
a
deluge
of
cold
water
;
then
she
scrub


he
down
with
a
towel
like
a
file
,
and
so
bring
he
to
;
then
she


roll
he
up
in
a
wet
sheet
and
put
he
away
under
blanket
till
she


sweat
his
soul
clean
and
"
the
yellow
stain
of
it
come
through
his


pores”--as
Tom
say
.




yet
notwithstanding
all
this
,
the
boy
grow
more
and
more
melancholy
and


pale
and
deject
.
she
add
hot
bath
,
sitz
bath
,
shower
bath
,
and


plunge
.
the
boy
remain
as
dismal
as
a
hearse
.
she
begin
to
assist
the


water
with
a
slim
oatmeal
diet
and
blister
-
plaster
.
she
calculate
his


capacity
as
she
would
a
jug
’s
,
and
fill
he
up
every
day
with
quack


cure
-
all
.




Tom
have
become
indifferent
to
persecution
by
this
time
.
this
phase


fill
the
old
lady
’s
heart
with
consternation
.
this
indifference
must


be
break
up
at
any
cost
.
now
she
hear
of
Pain
-
killer
for
the
first


time
.
she
order
a
lot
at
once
.
she
taste
it
and
be
fill
with


gratitude
.
it
be
simply
fire
in
a
liquid
form
.
she
drop
the
water


treatment
and
everything
else
,
and
pin
her
faith
to
Pain
-
killer
.


she
give
Tom
a
teaspoonful
and
watch
with
the
deep
anxiety
for
the


result
.
her
trouble
be
instantly
at
rest
,
her
soul
at
peace
again
;


for
the
"
indifference
"
be
break
up
.
the
boy
could
not
have
show
a


wilder
,
hearty
interest
,
if
she
have
build
a
fire
under
he
.




Tom
feel
that
it
be
time
to
wake
up
;
this
sort
of
life
might
be


romantic
enough
,
in
his
blighted
condition
,
but
it
be
get
to
have


too
little
sentiment
and
too
much
distract
variety
about
it
.
so
he


think
over
various
plan
for
relief
,
and
finally
hit
upon
that
of


profess
to
be
fond
of
Pain
-
killer
.
he
ask
for
it
so
often
that
he


become
a
nuisance
,
and
his
aunt
end
by
tell
he
to
help
himself
and


quit
bother
she
.
if
it
have
be
sid
,
she
would
have
have
no
misgiving


to
alloy
her
delight
;
but
since
it
be
Tom
,
she
watch
the
bottle


clandestinely
.
she
find
that
the
medicine
do
really
diminish
,
but
it


do
not
occur
to
she
that
the
boy

so

for
the

why
should

he


should
never

never

that
old
familiar
sound
any
more

it

Tom

wipe
his
eye
with
his
sleeve

begin
to
blubber
out
something
about


a
resolution
to
escape
from
hard
usage
and
lack
of
sympathy
at
home
by

abroad

that
Joe
would
not

he
.




but
it
transpire
that
this
be
a
request
which
Joe
have
just
be
go


to
make
of
Tom

have
come
to

up
for
that
purpose
.
his
mother


have
whip
he
for
drink
some
cream
which
he
have
never
taste
and


know
nothing
about
;
it
be
plain
that
she
be
tired
of
he
and
wish


he
to
go
;
if
she
feel
that
way
,
there
be
nothing
for
he
to
do
but


succumb
;
he
hope
she
would
be
happy
,
and
never
regret
having
drive
she


poor
boy
out
into
the
unfeele
world
to
suffer
and
die
.




as
the
two
boy
walk
sorrow
along
,
they
make
a
new
compact
to
stand


by
each
other
and
be
brother
and
never
separate
till
death
relieve


they
of
their
trouble
.
then
they
begin
to
lay
their
plan
.
Joe
be
for


be
a
hermit
,
and
live
on
crust
in
a
remote
cave
,
and
die
,


some
time
,
of
cold
and
want
and
grief
;
but
after
listen
to
Tom
,
he


concede
that
there
be
some
conspicuous
advantage
about
a
life
of


crime
,
and
so
he
consent
to
be
a
pirate
.




three
mile
below
St.
Petersburg
,
at
a
point
where
the
Mississippi
River


be
a
trifle
over
a
mile
wide
,
there
be
a
long
,
narrow
,
woode
island
,


with
a
shallow
bar
at
the
head
of
it
,
and
this
offer
well
as
a


rendezvous
.
it
be
not

it
lie
far
over
toward
the
further


shore
,
abreast
a
dense
and
almost
wholly
unpeopled
forest

up

promptly

for
all
career

one

he
;
he
be


indifferent

they
presently
separate
to
meet
at
a
lonely
spot
on
the


river

bank
two
mile
above
the
village
at
the
favorite
hour

which
be


midnight
.
there
be
a
small
log
raft
there

they

he

in
the
most
dark

Joe
,
with
enthusiasm
.

Huck
.




"
why

"




Huck
scan
his
own
clothing
forlornly
.




"
I
reckon
I
ai

"
say
he
,
with
a


regretful
pathos
in
his
voice
;
"
but
I
ai
n’t
get
none
but
these
.
"




but
the
other
boy
tell
he
the
fine
clothe
would
come
fast
enough
,


after
they
should
have
begin
their
adventure
.
they
make
he
understand


that
his
poor
rag
would
do
to
begin
with
,
though
it
be
customary
for


wealthy
pirate
to
start
with
a
proper
wardrobe
.




gradually
their
talk
die
out
and
drowsiness
begin
to
steal
upon
the


eyelid
of
the
little
waif
.
the
pipe
drop
from
the
finger
of
the


Red
-
Handed
,
and
he
sleep
the
sleep
of
the
conscience
-
free
and
the
weary
.


the
Terror
of
the
Seas
and
the
Black
Avenger
of
the
Spanish
Main
have


more
difficulty
in
get
to
sleep
.
they
say
their
prayer
inwardly
,


and
lie
down
,
since
there
be
nobody
there
with
authority
to
make
they


kneel
and
recite
aloud
;
in
truth
,
they
have
a
mind
not
to
say
they
at


all
,
but
they
be
afraid
to
proceed
to
such
length
as
that
,
lest
they


might
call
down
a
sudden
and
special
thunderbolt
from
heaven
.
then
at


once
they
reach
and
hover
upon
the
imminent
verge
of
sleep
--
but
an


intruder
come
,
now
,
that
would
not
"
down
.
"
it
be
conscience
.
they
begin


to
feel
a
vague
fear
that
they
have
be
do
wrong
to
run
away
;
and


next
they
think
of
the
steal
meat
,
and
then
the
real
torture
come
.


they
try
to
argue
it
away
by
remind
conscience
that
they
have


purloin
sweetmeat
and
apple
score
of
time
;
but
conscience
be
not


to
be
appease
by
such
thin
plausibility
;
it
seem
to
they
,
in
the


end
,
that
there
be
no
get
around
the
stubborn
fact
that
take


sweetmeat
be
only
"
hook
,
"
while
take
bacon
and
ham
and
such


valuable
be
plain
simple
stealing
--
and
there
be
a
command
against
that


in
the
Bible
.
so
they
inwardly
resolve
that
so
long
as
they
remain
in


the
business
,
their
piracy
should
not
again
be
sully
with
the


crime
of
stealing
.
then
conscience
grant
a
truce
,
and
these
curiously


inconsistent
pirate
fall
peacefully
to
sleep
.










chapter
XIV




when
Tom
awake
in
the
morning
,
he
wonder
where
he
be
.
he
sit
up
and


rub
his
eye
and
look
around
.
then
he
comprehend
.
it
be
the
cool


gray
dawn
,
and
there
be
a
delicious
sense
of
repose
and
peace
in
the


deep
pervading
calm
and
silence
of
the
wood
.
not
a
leaf
stir
;
not


a
sound
obtrude
upon
great
Nature
’s
meditation
.
Beaded
dewdrop
stand


upon
the
leave
and
grass
.
a
white
layer
of
ashe
cover
the
fire
,


and
a
thin
blue
breath
of
smoke
rise
straight
into
the
air
.
Joe
and
Huck


still
sleep
.




now
,
far
away
in
the
wood
a
bird
call
;
another
answer
;
presently


the
hammering
of
a
woodpecker
be
hear
.
gradually
the
cool
dim
gray


of
the
morning
whiten
,
and
as
gradually
sound
multiplied
and
life


manifest
itself
.
the
marvel
of
Nature
shake
off
sleep
and
go


to
work
unfold
itself
to
the
musing
boy
.
a
little
green
worm
come


crawl
over
a
dewy
leaf
,
lift
two
-
third
of
his
body
into
the
air


from
time
to
time
and
"
sniff
around
,
"
then
proceed
again
--
for
he


be
measure
,
Tom
say
;
and
when
the
worm
approach
he
,
of
its
own


accord
,
he
sit
as
still
as
a
stone
,
with
his
hope
rise
and
fall
,


by
turn
,
as
the
creature
still
come
toward
he
or
seem
inclined
to


go
elsewhere
;
and
when
at
last
it
consider
a
painful
moment
with
its


curved
body
in
the
air
and
then
come
decisively
down
upon
Tom
’s
leg
and


begin
a
journey
over
he
,
his
whole
heart
be
glad
--
for
that
mean
that


he
be
go
to
have
a
new
suit
of
clothe
--
without
the
shadow
of
a


doubt
a
gaudy
piratical
uniform
.
now
a
procession
of
ant
appear
,


from
nowhere
in
particular
,
and
go
about
their
labor
;
one
struggle


manfully
by
with
a
dead
spider
five
time
as
big
as
itself
in
its
arm
,


and
lug
it
straight
up
a
tree
-
trunk
.
a
brown
spot
lady
-
bug
climb


the
dizzy
height
of
a
grass
blade
,
and
Tom
bend
down
close
to
it
and


say
,
"
Lady
-
bug
,
lady
-
bug
,
fly
away
home
,
your
house
be
on
fire
,
your


child
’s
alone
,
"
and
she
take
wing
and
go
off
to
see
about
it
--
which


do
not
surprise
the
boy
,
for
he
know
of
old
that
this
insect
be


credulous
about
conflagration
,
and
he
have
practise
upon
its
simplicity


more
than
once
.
a
tumblebug
come
next
,
heave
sturdily
at
its
ball
,
and


Tom
touch
the
creature
,
to
see
it
shut
its
leg
against
its
body


and
pretend
to
be
dead
.
the
bird
be
fairly
riot
by
this
time
.
a


catbird
,
the
northern
mocker
,
light
in
a
tree
over
Tom
’s
head
,
and
trill


out
her
imitation
of
her
neighbor
in
a
rapture
of
enjoyment
;
then


a
shrill
jay
sweep
down
,
a
flash
of
blue
flame
,
and
stop
on
a
twig


almost
within
the
boy
’s
reach
,
cock
his
head
to
one
side
and
eye
the


stranger
with
a
consume
curiosity
;
a
gray
squirrel
and
a
big
fellow


of
the
"
fox
"
kind
came
skurrye
along
,
sit
up
at
interval
to


inspect
and
chatter
at
the
boy
,
for
the
wild
thing
have
probably
never


see
a
human
being
before
and
scarcely
know
whether
to
be
afraid
or
not
.


all
Nature
be
wide
awake
and
stir
,
now
;
long
lance
of
sunlight


pierce
down
through
the
dense
foliage
far
and
near
,
and
a
few


butterfly
came
flutter
upon
the
scene
.




Tom
stir
up
the
other
pirate
and
they
all
clatter
away
with


a
shout
,
and
in
a
minute
or
two
be
strip
and
chase
after
and


tumble
over
each
other
in
the
shallow
limpid
water
of
the
white


sandbar
.
they
feel
no
longing
for
the
little
village
sleep
in
the


distance
beyond
the
majestic
waste
of
water
.
a
vagrant
current
or
a


slight
rise
in
the
river
have
carry
off
their
raft
,
but
this
only


gratify
they
,
since
its
going
be
something
like
burn
the
bridge


between
they
and
civilization
.




they
come
back
to
camp
wonderfully
refresh
,
glad
-
hearted
,
and


ravenous
;
and
they
soon
have
the
camp
-
fire
blazing
up
again
.
Huck
find
a


spring
of
clear
cold
water
close
by
,
and
the
boy
make
cup
of
broad
oak


or
hickory
leave
,
and
feel
that
water
,
sweeten
with
such
a
wildwood


charm
as
that
,
would
be
a
good
enough
substitute
for
coffee
.
while
Joe


be
slice
bacon
for
breakfast
,
Tom
and
Huck
ask
he
to
hold
on
a


minute
;
they
step
to
a
promising
nook
in
the
river
-
bank
and
throw
in


their
line
;
almost
immediately
they
have
reward
.
Joe
have
not
have
time


to
get
impatient
before
they
be
back
again
with
some
handsome
bass
,


a
couple
of
sun
-
perch
and
a
small
catfish
--
provision
enough
for
quite
a


family
.
they
fry
the
fish
with
the
bacon
,
and
be
astonish
;
for


no
fish
have
ever
seem
so
delicious
before
.
they
do
not
know
that
the


quick
a
fresh
-
water
fish
be
on
the
fire
after
he
be
catch
the
well


he
be
;
and
they
reflect
little
upon
what
a
sauce
open
-
air
sleeping
,


open
-
air
exercise
,
bathing
,
and
a
large
ingredient
of
hunger
make
,
too
.




they
lie
around
in
the
shade
,
after
breakfast
,
while
Huck
have
a
smoke
,


and
then
go
off
through
the
wood
on
an
explore
expedition
.
they


tramp
gayly
along
,
over
decay
log
,
through
tangled
underbrush
,


among
solemn
monarchs
of
the
forest
,
hang
from
their
crown
to
the


grind
with
a
droop
regalia
of
grape
-
vine
.
now
and
then
they
come


upon
snug
nook
carpet
with
grass
and
jewel
with
flower
.




they
find
plenty
of
thing
to
be
delighted
with
,
but
nothing
to
be


astonish
at
.
they
discover
that
the
island
be
about
three
mile


long
and
a
quarter
of
a
mile
wide
,
and
that
the
shore
it
lie
close
to


be
only
separate
from
it
by
a
narrow
channel
hardly
two
hundred
yard


wide
.
they
take
a
swim
about
every
hour
,
so
it
be
close
upon
the
middle


of
the
afternoon
when
they
get
back
to
camp
.
they
be
too
hungry
to


stop
to
fish
,
but
they
fare
sumptuously
upon
cold
ham
,
and
then
throw


themselves
down
in
the
shade
to
talk
.
but
the
talk
soon
begin
to
drag
,


and
then
die
.
the
stillness
,
the
solemnity
that
brood
in
the
wood
,


and
the
sense
of
loneliness
,
begin
to
tell
upon
the
spirit
of
the
boy
.


they
fall
to
think
.
a
sort
of
undefined
longing
creep
upon
they
.
this


take
dim
shape
,
presently
--
it
be
bud
homesickness
.
even
finn
the


red
-
Handed
be
dream
of
his
doorstep
and
empty
hogshead
.
but
they


be
all
ashamed
of
their
weakness
,
and
none
be
brave
enough
to
speak


his
thought
.




for
some
time
,
now
,
the
boy
have
be
dully
conscious
of
a
peculiar


sound
in
the
distance
,
just
as
one
sometimes
be
of
the
ticking
of
a


clock
which
he
take
no
distinct
note
of
.
but
now
this
mysterious
sound


become
more
pronounced
,
and
force
a
recognition
.
the
boy
start
,


glance
at
each
other
,
and
then
each
assume
a
listen
attitude
.
there


be
a
long
silence
,
profound
and
unbroken
;
then
a
deep
,
sullen
boom
come


float
down
out
of
the
distance
.




"
what
be
it
!
"
exclaim
Joe
,
under
his
breath
.




"
I
wonder
,
"
say
Tom
in
a
whisper
.




"
'
tain’t
thunder
,
"
say
Huckleberry
,
in
an
awed
tone
,
"
becuz
thunder--
"




"
Hark
!
"
say
Tom
.
"
listen
--
don’t
talk
.
"




they
wait
a
time
that
seem
an
age
,
and
then
the
same
muffled
boom


trouble
the
solemn
hush
.




"
let
’s
go
and
see
.
"




they
spring
to
their
foot
and
hurry
to
the
shore
toward
the
town
.
they


part
the
bush
on
the
bank
and
peer
out
over
the
water

it
.
"




"
yes
,
yes
,
yes
,
I
know
just
how
you
feel
,
Mrs.
Harper
,
I
know
just


exactly
how
you
feel
.
no
long
ago
than
yesterday
noon
,
my
Tom
take


and
fill
the
cat
full
of
pain
-
killer
,
and
I
do
think
the
cretur
would


tear
the
house
down
.
and
God
forgive
I
,
I
crack
Tom
’s
head
with
my


thimble
,
poor
boy
,
poor
dead
boy
.
but
he
’
out
of
all
his
trouble
now
.


and
the
last
word
I
ever
hear
he
say
be
to
reproach--
"




but
this
memory
be
too
much
for
the
old
lady
,
and
she
break
entirely


down
.
Tom
be
snuffle
,
now
,
himself
--
and
more
in
pity
of
himself
than


anybody
else
.
he
could
hear
Mary
cry
,
and
put
in
a
kindly
word


for
he
from
time
to
time
.
he
begin
to
have
a
nobler
opinion
of
himself


than
ever
before
.
still
,
he
be
sufficiently
touch
by
his
aunt
’s
grief


to
long
to
rush
out
from
under
the
bed
and
overwhelm
she
with
joy
--
and


the
theatrical
gorgeousness
of
the
thing
appeal
strongly
to
his


nature
,
too
,
but
he
resist
and
lie
still
.




he
go
on
listening
,
and
gather
by
odd
and
end
that
it
be


conjecture
at
first
that
the
boy
have
got
drown
while
take
a
swim
;


then
the
small
raft
have
be
miss
;
next
,
certain
boy
say
the
miss


lad
have
promise
that
the
village
should
"
hear
something
"
soon
;
the


wise
-
head
have
"
put
this
and
that
together
"
and
decide
that
the
lad


have
go
off
on
that
raft
and
would
turn
up
at
the
next
town
below
,


presently
;
but
toward
noon
the
raft
have
be
find
,
lodge
against
the


Missouri
shore
some
five
or
six
mile
below
the
village
--
and
then
hope


perish
;
they
must
be
drown
,
else
hunger
would
have
drive
they
home


by
nightfall
if
not
soon
.
it
be
believe
that
the
search
for
the


body
have
be
a
fruitless
effort
merely
because
the
drowning
must


have
occur
in
mid
-
channel
,
since
the
boy
,
be
good
swimmer
,
would


otherwise
have
escape
to
shore
.
this
be
Wednesday
night
.
if
the
body


continue
miss
until
Sunday
,
all
hope
would
be
give
over
,
and
the


funeral
would
be
preach
on
that
morning
.
Tom
shudder
.




Mrs.
Harper
give
a
sob
goodnight
and
turn
to
go
.
then
with
a


mutual
impulse
the
two
bereaved
woman
fling
themselves
into
each
other
’s


arm
and
have
a
good
,
console
cry
,
and
then
parted
.
Aunt
Polly
be


tender
far
beyond
she
wo
nt
,
in
her
goodnight
to
Sid
and
Mary
.
Sid


snuffle
a
bit
and
Mary
go
off
cry
with
all
her
heart
.




Aunt
polly
kneel
down
and
pray
for
Tom
so
touchingly
,
so
appealingly
,


and
with
such
measureless
love
in
her
word
and
her
old
trembling
voice
,


that
he
be
welter
in
tear
again
,
long
before
she
be
through
.




he
have
to
keep
still
long
after
she
go
to
bed
,
for
she
keep
make


break
-
hearted
ejaculation
from
time
to
time
,
toss
unrestfully
,
and


turn
over
.
but
at
last
she
be
still
,
only
moan
a
little
in
she


sleep
.
now
the
boy
steal
out
,
rise
gradually
by
the
bedside
,
shade
the


candle
-
light
with
his
hand
,
and
stand
regard
she
.
his
heart
be
full


of
pity
for
she
.
he
take
out
his
sycamore
scroll
and
place
it
by
the


candle
.
but
something
occur
to
he
,
and
he
linger
consider
.


his
face
light
with
a
happy
solution
of
his
thought
;
he
put
the
bark


hastily
in
his
pocket
.
then
he
bend
over
and
kiss
the
faded
lip
,
and


straightway
make
his
stealthy
exit
,
latch
the
door
behind
he
.




he
thread
his
way
back
to
the
ferry
landing
,
find
nobody
at
large


there
,
and
walk
boldly
on
board
the
boat
,
for
he
know
she
be


tenantless
except
that
there
be
a
watchman
,
who
always
turn
in
and


sleep
like
a
graven
image
.
he
untie
the
skiff
at
the
stern
,
slip


into
it
,
and
be
soon
row
cautiously
upstream
.
when
he
have
pull
a


mile
above
the
village
,
he
start
quarter
across
and
bend
himself


stoutly
to
his
work
.
he
hit
the
landing
on
the
other
side
neatly
,
for


this
be
a
familiar
bit
of
work
to
he
.
he
be
move
to
capture


the
skiff
,
argue
that
it
might
be
consider
a
ship
and
therefore


legitimate
prey
for
a
pirate
,
but
he
know
a
thorough
search
would
be


make
for
it
and
that
might
end
in
revelation
.
so
he
step
ashore
and


enter
the
wood
.




he
sit
down
and
take
a
long
rest
,
torture
himself
meanwhile
to
keep


awake
,
and
then
start
warily
down
the
home
-
stretch
.
the
night
be
far


spend
.
it
be
broad
daylight
before
he
find
himself
fairly
abreast
the


island
bar
.
he
rest
again
until
the
sun
be
well
up
and
gild
the


great
river
with
its
splendor
,
and
then
he
plunge
into
the
stream
.
a


little
later
he
pause
,
dripping
,
upon
the
threshold
of
the
camp
,
and


hear
Joe
say
:

be
a
disgrace
to

too
proud
for
that


sort
of
thing
.

fine
dramatic
effect

grandly
into

boastful
company
of

then
Tom

after
dinner
all
the
gang
turn
out
to
hunt
for
turtle
egg
on
the
bar
.


they
go
about
poke
stick
into
the
sand
,
and
when
they
find
a
soft


place
they
go
down
on
their
knee
and
dig
with
their
hand
.
sometimes


they
would
take
fifty
or
sixty
egg
out
of
one
hole
.
they
be
perfectly


round
white
thing
a
trifle
small
than
an
english
walnut
.
they
have
a


famous
fry
-
egg
feast
that
night
,
and
another
on
Friday
morning
.




after
breakfast
they
go
whooping
and
prance
out
on
the
bar
,
and


chase
each
other
round
and
round
,
shed
clothe
as
they
go
,
until


they
be
naked
,
and
then
continue
the
frolic
far
away
up
the
shoal


water
of
the
bar
,
against
the
stiff
current
,
which
latter
trip
their


leg
from
under
they
from
time
to
time
and
greatly
increase
the
fun
.


and
now
and
then
they
stoop
in
a
group
and
splash
water
in
each


other
’s
face
with
their
palm
,
gradually
approach
each
other
,
with


avert
face
to
avoid
the
strangle
spray
,
and
finally
grip
and


struggle
till
the
good
man
duck
his
neighbor
,
and
then
they
all


go
under
in
a
tangle
of
white
leg
and
arm
and
come
up
blow
,


sputtering
,
laugh
,
and
gasp
for
breath
at
one
and
the
same
time
.




when
they
be
well
exhausted
,
they
would
run
out
and
sprawl
on
the
dry
,


hot
sand
,
and
lie
there
and
cover
themselves
up
with
it
,
and
by
and
by


break
for
the
water
again
and
go
through
the
original
performance
once


more
.
finally
it
occur
to
they
that
their
naked
skin
represent


flesh
-
color
"
tight
"
very
fairly
;
so
they
draw
a
ring
in
the
sand
and


have
a
circus
--
with
three
clown
in
it
,
for
none
would
yield
this
proud


post
to
his
neighbor
.




next
they
get
their
marble
and
play
"
knuck
"
and
"
ringtaw
"
and


"
keep
"
till
that
amusement
grow
stale
.
then
Joe
and
Huck
have
another


swim
,
but
Tom
would
not
venture
,
because
he
find
that
in
kick
off


his
trouser
he
have
kick
his
string
of
rattlesnake
rattle
off
his


ankle
,
and
he
wonder
how
he
have
escape
cramp
so
long
without
the


protection
of
this
mysterious
charm
.
he
do
not
venture
again
until
he


have
find
it
,
and
by
that
time
the
other
boy
be
tired
and
ready
to


rest
.
they
gradually
wander
apart
,
drop
into
the
"
dump
,
"
and


fall
to
gaze
longingly
across
the
wide
river
to
where
the
village
lie


drowse
in
the
sun
.
Tom
find
himself
write
"
BECKY
"
in
the
sand
with


his
big
toe
;
he
scratch
it
out
,
and
be
angry
with
himself
for
his


weakness
.
but
he
write
it
again
,
nevertheless
;
he
could
not
help
it
.
he


erase
it
once
more
and
then
take
himself
out
of
temptation
by
drive


the
other
boy
together
and
join
they
.




but
Joe
’s
spirit
have
go
down
almost
beyond
resurrection
.
he
be
so


homesick
that
he
could
hardly
endure
the
misery
of
it
.
the
tear
lie


very
near
the
surface
.
Huck
be
melancholy
,
too
.
Tom
be
downhearted
,


but
try
hard
not
to
show
it
.
he
have
a
secret
which
he
be
not
ready


to
tell
,
yet
,
but
if
this
mutinous
depression
be
not
break
up
soon
,
he


would
have
to
bring
it
out
.
he
say
,
with
a
great
show
of
cheerfulness
:




"
I
bet
there
’s

pirate
on
this
island
before

.
we
’ll
explore


it
again
.
they
’ve
hide

somewhere
.
how
’d

light


on
a
rotten
chest
full
of
gold
and
silver
--
hey
?
"




but
it
rouse
only
faint
enthusiasm
,
which
fade
out
,
with
no
reply
.


Tom
try
one
or
two
other
seduction
;
but
they
fail
,
too
.
it
be


discourage
work
.
Joe
sit
poke
up
the
sand
with
a
stick
and
look


very
gloomy
.
finally
he
say
:




"
oh

,

give
it
up

"

say
Tom
.
"

"




"
I

suddenly
dawn

become

still

make


one
final
struggle

the
"
point

set
up
a


warwhoop
of
applause

it
be
"
splendid

if

tell
they
at
first
,
they
would
n’t
have
start
away
.
he
make
a
plausible


excuse
;
but
his
real
reason
have
be
the
fear
that
not
even
the
secret


would
keep
they
with
he
any
very
great
length
of

so
he
have


mean
to
hold
it
in
reserve
as
a
last
seduction

the
lad
come
gayly
back
and
go
at
their
sport
again
with
a
will

chatter
all
the
time
about
Tom
’s
stupendous
plan

admire
the


genius

Joe

at
the
idea

out
on

charily

,
with
quiver
lip

halting
utterance

"

Huck
sit
down
again

wait
an
hour
.
then
he
find
it
lonesome
,

go
to
find
his
comrade

they
be
wide
apart
in
the
wood

very
pale

both
fast
asleep

something
inform

have

night

a
humble
look

when
Huck
prepare
his
pipe
after
the
meal

be
go
to
prepare


theirs

no

very
well

something
they
eat


at
dinner
have
disagree
with
they
.




about
midnight
Joe
awake
,
and
call
the
boy
.
there
be
a
brooding


oppressiveness
in
the
air
that
seem
to
bode
something
.
the
boy


huddle
themselves
together
and
seek
the
friendly
companionship
of


the
fire
,
though
the
dull
dead
heat
of
the
breathless
atmosphere
be


stifle
.
they
sit
still
,
intent
and
wait
.
the
solemn
hush
continue
.


beyond
the
light
of
the
fire
everything
be
swallow
up
in
the


blackness
of
darkness
.
presently
there
come
a
quivering
glow
that


vaguely
reveal
the
foliage
for
a
moment
and
then
vanish

by
and
by


another
come

a
little
strong
.
then
another
.
then
a
faint
moan
come


sigh
through
the
branch
of
the
forest
and
the
boy
feel
a
fleeting


breath
upon
their
cheek
,
and
shudder
with
the
fancy
that
the
Spirit


of
the
Night
have
go
by
.
there
be
a
pause
.
now
a
weird
flash
turn


night
into
day
and
show
every
little
grassblade
,
separate
and


distinct
,
that
grow
about
their
foot

three
white
,


startle
face
,
too
.
a
deep
peal
of
thunder
go
roll
and
tumble


down
the
heaven
and
lose
itself
in
sullen
rumbling
in
the
distance
.
a


sweep
of
chilly
air
pass
by
,
rustle
all
the
leave
and
snow
the


flaky
ashe
broadcast
about
the
fire
.
another
fierce
glare
light
up
the


forest
and
an
instant
crash
follow
that
seem
to
rend
the
treetop


right
over
the
boy
’
head
.
they
cling
together
in
terror
,
in
the
thick


gloom
that
follow
.
a
few
big
raindrop
fall
patter
upon
the
leave
.




"
quick
!
boy
,
go
for
the
tent
!
"
exclaim
Tom
.




they
spring
away
,
stumble
over
root
and
among
vine
in
the
dark
,
no


two
plunge
in
the
same
direction
.
a
furious
blast
roar
through


the
tree
,
make
everything
sing
as
it
go
.
one
blind
flash
after


another
come
,
and
peal
on
peal
of
deafen
thunder
.
and
now
a
drenching


rain
pour
down
and
the
rise
hurricane
drive
it
in
sheet
along
the


ground
.
the
boy
cry
out
to
each
other
,
but
the
roar
wind
and
the


boom
thunderblast
drown
their
voice
utterly
.
however
,
one
by
one


they
straggle
in
at
last
and
take
shelter
under
the
tent
,
cold
,
scared
,


and
stream
with
water
;
but
to
have
company
in
misery
seem
something


to
be
grateful
for
.
they
could
not
talk
,
the
old
sail
flap
so


furiously
,
even
if
the
other
noise
would
have
allow
they
.
the
temp


rise
higher
and
high
,
and
presently
the
sail
tear
loose
from
its


fastening
and
go
wing
away
on
the
blast
.
the
boy
seize
each


other
’
hand
and
flee
,
with
many
tumbling
and
bruise
,
to
the
shelter


of
a
great
oak
that
stand
upon
the
riverbank
.
now
the
battle
be
at
its


high
.
under
the
ceaseless
conflagration
of
lightning
that
flame


in
the
sky
,
everything
below
stand
out
in
cleancut
and
shadowless


distinctness
:
the
bend
tree
,
the
billowy
river
,
white
with
foam
,
the


drive
spray
of
spumeflake
,
the
dim
outline
of
the
high
bluff
on


the
other
side
,
glimpse
through
the
drift
cloudrack
and
the
slanting


veil
of
rain
.
every
little
while
some
giant
tree
yield
the
fight


and
fall
crash
through
the
young
growth
;
and
the
unflagge


thunderpeal
come
now
in
ear
-
split
explosive
burst
,
keen
and
sharp
,


and
unspeakably
appalling
.
the
storm
culminate
in
one
matchless
effort


that
seem
likely
to
tear
the
island
to
piece
,
burn
it
up
,
drown
it
to


the
treetop
,
blow
it
away
,
and
deafen
every
creature
in
it
,
all
at
one


and
the
same
moment
.
it
be
a
wild
night
for
homeless
young
head
to
be


out
in
.




but
at
last
the
battle
be
do
,
and
the
force
retire
with
weak
and


weak
threatening
and
grumbling
,
and
peace
resume
her
sway
.
the


boy
go
back
to
camp
,
a
good
deal
awed
;
but
they
find
there
be
still


something
to
be
thankful
for
,
because
the
great
sycamore
,
the
shelter


of
their
bed
,
be
a
ruin
,
now
,
blast
by
the
lightning
,
and
they
be


not
under
it
when
the
catastrophe
happen
.




everything
in
camp
be
drench
,
the
campfire
as
well
;
for
they
be
but


heedless
lad
,
like
their
generation
,
and
have
make
no
provision
against


rain
.
here
be
matter
for
dismay
,
for
they
be
soak
through
and


chill
.
they
be
eloquent
in
their
distress
;
but
they
presently


discover
that
the
fire
have
eat
so
far
up
under
the
great
log
it
have


be
build
against
(
where
it
curve
upward
and
separate
itself
from


the
ground
)
,
that
a
handbreadth
or
so
of
it
have
escape
wet
;
so
they


patiently
work
until
,
with
shred
and
bark
gather
from
the
under


side
of
sheltered
log
,
they
coax
the
fire
to
burn
again
.
then
they


pile
on
great
dead
bough
till
they
have
a
roaring
furnace
,
and
be


gladhearte
once
more
.
they
dry
their
boil
ham
and
have
a
feast
,


and
after
that
they
sit
by
the
fire
and
expand
and
glorify
their


midnight
adventure
until
morning
,
for
there
be
not
a
dry
spot
to
sleep


on
,
anywhere
around
.




as
the
sun
begin
to
steal
in
upon
the
boy
,
drowsiness
come
over


they
,
and
they
go
out
on
the
sandbar
and
lie
down
to
sleep
.
they
get


scorch
out
by
and
by
,
and
drearily
set
about
get
breakfast
.
after


the
meal
they
feel
rusty
,
and
stiff
-
jointed
,
and
a
little
homesick
once


more
.
Tom
see
the
sign
,
and
fall
to
cheer
up
the
pirate
as
well
as


he
could
.
but
they
care
nothing
for
marble
,
or
circus
,
or
swimming
,
or


anything
.
he
remind
they
of
the
impose
secret
,
and
raise
a
ray
of


cheer
.
while
it
last
,
he
get
they
interested
in
a
new
device
.
this
be


to
knock
off
be
pirate
,
for
a
while
,
and
be
Indians
for
a
change
.


they
be
attract
by
this
idea
;
so
it
be
not
long
before
they
be


strip
,
and
stripe
from
head
to
heel
with
black
mud
,
like
so
many


zebra
--
all
of
they
chief
,
of
course
--
and
then
they
went
tear
through


the
wood
to
attack
an
english
settlement
.




by
and
by
they
separate
into
three
hostile
tribe
,
and
dart
upon
each


other
from
ambush
with
dreadful
warwhoop
,
and
kill
and
scalp
each


other
by
thousand
.
it
be
a
gory
day
.
consequently
it
be
an
extremely


satisfactory
one
.




they
assemble
in
camp
toward
suppertime
,
hungry
and
happy
;
but
now


a
difficulty
arise
--
hostile
Indians
could
not
break
the
bread
of


hospitality
together
without
first
make
peace
,
and
this
be
a
simple


impossibility
without
smoke
a
pipe
of
peace
.
there
be
no
other


process
that
ever
they
have
hear
of
.
two
of
the
savage
almost
wish


they
have
remain
pirate
.
however
,
there
be
no
other
way
;
so
with
such


show
of
cheerfulness
as
they
could
muster
they
call
for
the
pipe
and


take
their
whiff
as
it
pass
,
in
due
form
.




and
behold
,
they
be
glad
they
have
go
into
savagery
,
for
they
have


gain
something
;
they
find
that
they
could
now
smoke
a
little
without


have
to
go
and
hunt
for
a
lose
knife
;
they
do
not
get
sick
enough
to


be
seriously
uncomfortable
.
they
be
not
likely
to
fool
away
this
high


promise
for
lack
of
effort
.
no
,
they
practise
cautiously
,
after
supper
,


with
right
fair
success
,
and
so
they
spend
a
jubilant
evening
.
they
be


prouder
and
happy
in
their
new
acquirement
than
they
would
have
be


in
the
scalping
and
skinning
of
the
six
Nations
.
we
will
leave
they
to


smoke
and
chatter
and
brag
,
since
we
have
no
further
use
for
they
at


present
.










chapter
XVII




but
there
be
no
hilarity
in
the
little
town
that
same
tranquil
Saturday


afternoon
.
the
Harpers
,
and
Aunt
Polly
’s
family
,
be
be
put
into


mourn
,
with
great
grief
and
many
tear
.
an
unusual
quiet
possess


the
village
,
although
it
be
ordinarily
quiet
enough
,
in
all
conscience
.


the
villager
conduct
their
concern
with
an
absent
air
,
and
talk


little
;
but
they
sigh
often
.
the
Saturday
holiday
seem
a
burden
to


the
child
.
they
have
no
heart
in
their
sport
,
and
gradually
give
they


up
.




in
the
afternoon
Becky
Thatcher
find
herself
mope
about
the
deserted


schoolhouse
yard
,
and
feel
very
melancholy
.
but
she
find
nothing


there
to
comfort
she
.
she
soliloquize
:




"
oh
,
if
I
only
have
a
brass
andiron
-
knob
again
!
but
I
have
n’t
get


anything
now
to
remember
he
by
.
"
and
she
choke
back
a
little
sob
.




presently
she
stop
,
and
say
to
herself
:




"
it
be
right
here
.
oh
,
if
it
be
to
do
over
again
,
I
would
n’t
say


that
--
I
would
n’t
say
it
for
the
whole
world
.
but
he
’s
go
now
;
I
’ll


never
,
never
,
never
see
he
any
more
.
"




this
thought
break
she
down
,
and
she
wander
away
,
with
tear
roll


down
her
cheek
.
then
quite
a
group
of
boy
and
girl
--
playmate
of
Tom
’s


and
Joe’s
--
come
by
,
and
stand
look
over
the
pale
fence
and
talk


in
reverent
tone
of
how
Tom
do
so
-
and
-
so
the
last
time
they
see


he
,
and
how
Joe
say
this
and
that
small
trifle
(
pregnant
with
awful


prophecy
,
as
they
could
easily
see
now!)--and
each
speaker
point
out


the
exact
spot
where
the
lose
lad
stand
at
the
time
,
and
then
add


something
like
"
and
I
be
a
-
stand
just
so
--
just
as
I
be
now
,
and
as
if


you
be
he
--
I
be
as
close
as
that
--
and
he
smile
,
just
this
way
--
and
then


something
seem
to
go
all
over
I
,
like
--
awful
,
you
know
--
and
I
never


think
what
it
mean
,
of
course
,
but
I
can
see
now
!
"




then
there
be
a
dispute
about
who
see
the
dead
boy
last
in
life
,
and


many
claim
that
dismal
distinction
,
and
offer
evidence
,
more
or


less
tamper
with
by
the
witness
;
and
when
it
be
ultimately
decide


who
_
do
_
see
the
depart
last
,
and
exchange
the
last
word
with
they
,


the
lucky
party
take
upon
themselves
a
sort
of
sacred
importance
,


and
be
gape
at
and
envy
by
all
the
rest
.
one
poor
chap
,
who
have


no
other
grandeur
to
offer
,
say
with
tolerably
manifest
pride
in
the


remembrance
:




"
well
,
Tom
Sawyer
he
lick
I
once
.
"




but
that
bid
for
glory
be
a
failure
.
Most
of
the
boy
could
say
that
,


and
so
that
cheapen
the
distinction
too
much
.
the
group
loiter
away
,


still
recall
memory
of
the
lose
hero
,
in
awed
voice
.




when
the
Sunday
-
school
hour
be
finish
,
the
next
morning
,
the
bell


begin
to
toll
,
instead
of
ring
in
the
usual
way
.
it
be
a
very
still


Sabbath
,
and
the
mournful
sound
seem
in
keep
with
the
musing
hush


that
lie
upon
nature
.
the
villager
begin
to
gather
,
loiter
a
moment


in
the
vestibule
to
converse
in
whisper
about
the
sad
event
.
but
there


be
no
whispering
in
the
house
;
only
the
funereal
rustling
of
dress


as
the
woman
gather
to
their
seat
disturb
the
silence
there
.
none


could
remember
when
the
little
church
have
be
so
full
before
.
there


be
finally
a
wait
pause
,
an
expectant

over
the

hungry
for
news

would
venture
to
get
out

resignation


at
once

and
that
night

be
a
free

again
,


however
--
there

something
in

but

to
his
surprise
that

the
simple
fact
that

could
,
take

desire
away

the
charm
of

when
he
get


upon
his
foot
at
last
and
move
feebly
downtown
,
a
melancholy
change
have


come
over
everything
and
every
creature
.
there
have
be
a
"
revival

go
about

hope
against
hope
for
the
sight
of
one

sinful
face
,
but
disappointment
cross
he
everywhere
.
he
find
Joe


harper
study
a
Testament
,
and
turn
sadly
away
from
the
depressing


spectacle
.
he
seek
Ben
Rogers
,
and
find
he
visit
the
poor
with
a


basket
of
tract
.
he
hunt
up
Jim
Hollis
,
who
call
his
attention
to


the
precious
blessing
of
his
late
measle
as
a
warning
.
every
boy


he
encounter
add
another
ton
to
his
depression
;
and
when
,
in


desperation
,
he
fly
for
refuge
at
last
to
the
bosom
of
Huckleberry
Finn


and
be
receive
with
a
Scriptural
quotation
,
his
heart
break
and
he


creep
home
and
to
bed
realize
that
he
alone
of
all
the
town
be
lose
,


forever
and
forever
.




and
that
night
there
come
on
a
terrific
storm
,
with
drive
rain
,
awful


clap
of
thunder
and
blind
sheet
of
lightning
.
he
cover
his
head


with
the
bedclothe
and
wait
in
a
horror
of
suspense
for
his
doom
;
for


he
have
not
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
that
all
this
hubbub
be
about
he
.


he
believe
he
have
tax
the
forbearance
of
the
power
above
to
the


extremity
of
endurance
and
that
this
be
the
result
.
it
might
have


seem
to
he
a
waste
of
pomp
and
ammunition
to
kill
a
bug
with
a


battery
of
artillery
,
but
there
seem
nothing
incongruous
about
the


get
up
such
an
expensive
thunderstorm
as
this
to
knock
the
turf
from


under
an
insect
like
himself
.




by
and
by
the
temp
spend
itself
and
die
without
accomplish
its


object
.
the
boy
’s
first
impulse
be
to
be
grateful
,
and
reform
.
his


second
be
to
wait
--
for
there
might
not
be
any
more
storm
.




the
next
day
the
doctor
be
back
;
Tom
have
relapse
.
the
three
week
he


spend
on
his
back
this
time
seem
an
entire
age
.
when
he
get
abroad


at
last
he
be
hardly
grateful
that
he
have
be
spare
,
remember
how


lonely
be
his
estate
,
how
companionless
and
forlorn
he
be
.
he
drift


listlessly
down
the
street
and
find
Jim
Hollis

as
judge
in
a


juvenile
court
that
be

in
the
presence
of
she


victim
,
a
bird
.
he
find
Joe
Harper
and
Huck

while
;
to

a
remark
about
the


morrow
’s
prospect
and
possibility
there
.
as
the
sun
begin
to
sink


into
the
west
they
take
their
way
homeward
athwart
the
long
shadow


of
the
tree
and
soon
be
bury
from
sight
in
the
forest
of
Cardiff


Hill
.




on
Saturday
,
shortly
after
noon
,
the
boy
be
at
the
dead
tree
again
.


they
have
a
smoke
and
a
chat
in
the
shade
,
and
then
dig
a
little
in
their


last
hole
,
not
with
great
hope
,
but
merely
because
Tom
say
there
be


so
many
case
where
people
have
give
up
a
treasure
after
get
down


within
six
inch
of
it
,
and
then
somebody
else
have
come
along
and


turn
it
up
with
a
single
thrust
of
a
shovel
.
the
thing
fail
this


time
,
however
,
so
the
boy
shoulder
their
tool
and
go
away
feel


that
they
have
not
trifle
with
fortune
,
but
have
fulfil
all
the


requirement
that
belong
to
the
business
of
treasure
-
hunting
.




when
they
reach
the
haunt
house
there
be
something
so
weird
and


grisly
about
the
dead
silence
that
reign
there
under
the
bake
sun
,


and
something
so
depressing
about
the
loneliness
and
desolation
of
the


place
,
that
they
be
afraid
,
for
a
moment
,
to
venture
in
.
then
they


creep
to
the
door
and
take
a
tremble
peep
.
they
see
a
weedgrown
,


floorless
room
,
unplastered
,
an
ancient
fireplace
,
vacant
window
,


a
ruinous
staircase
;
and
here
,
there
,
and
everywhere
hang
rag
and


abandon
cobwebs
.
they
presently
enter
,
softly
,
with
quicken


pulse
,
talk
in
whisper
,
ear
alert
to
catch
the
slight
sound
,


and
muscle
tense
and
ready
for
instant
retreat
.




in
a
little
while
familiarity
modify
their
fear
and
they
give
the


place
a
critical
and
interested
examination
,
rather
admire
their
own


boldness
,
and
wonder
at
it
,
too
.
next
they
want
to
look
upstairs
.


this
be
something
like
cut
off
retreat
,
but
they
get
to
dare


each
other
,
and
of
course
there
could
be
but
one
result
--
they
throw
their


tool
into
a
corner
and
make
the
ascent
.
up
there
be
the
same
sign
of


decay
.
in
one
corner
they
find
a
closet
that
promise
mystery
,
but
the


promise
be
a
fraud

there
be
nothing
in
it

their
courage
be
up
now

well

they
be
about

down

Tom

rise
up
,

relieved

through
the
chink
between
the

of
the

not
they
.
they


be
content
to
reach
ground
again
without
broken
neck
,
and
take
the


townward
track
over
the
hill
.
they
do
not
talk
much
.
they
be
too
much


absorb
in
hate
themselves

hate
the
ill
luck
that
make
they
take


the
spade

there
.

for
that
,
Injun
Joe
never
would
have


suspect
.
he
would
have
hide
the
silver
with
the
gold
to
wait


there
till
his
"
revenge
"
be
satisfied

and
then
he
would
have
have
the


misfortune
to
find
that

turn
up

.
bitter
,

they
resolve
to
keep
a
lookout
for
that
Spaniard
when
he
should
come
to


town
spy
out
for
chance
to
do
his
revengeful
job
,

follow
he
to

that
might

.




they
talk
it
all
over

and
as
they
enter

they
agree
to
believe


that

else

at

that

might
at

XXVII




the
adventure
of
the
day
mightily
torment
Tom
’s
dream
that
night
.


four
time
he
have
his
hand
on
that
rich
treasure
and
four
time


it
waste
to
nothingness
in
his
finger
as
sleep
forsook
he
and


wakefulness
bring
back
the
hard
reality
of
his
misfortune
.
as
he
lie


in
the
early
morning
recall
the
incident
of
his
great
adventure
,
he


notice
that
they
seem
curiously
subdue
and
far
away
--
somewhat
as
if


they
have
happen
in
another
world
,
or
in
a
time
long
go
by
.
then
it


occur
to
he
that
the
great
adventure
itself
must
be
a
dream
!
there


be
one
very
strong
argument
in
favor
of
this
idea
--
namely
,
that
the


quantity
of
coin
he
have
see
be
too
vast
to
be
real
.
he
have
never
see


as
much
as
fifty
dollar
in
one
mass
before
,
and
he
be
like
all
boy
of


his
age
and
station
in
life
,
in
that
he
imagine
that
all
reference
to


"
hundred
"
and
"
thousand
"
be
mere
fanciful
form
of
speech
,
and
that


no
such
sum
really
exist
in
the
world
.
he
never
have
suppose
for


a
moment
that
so
large
a
sum
as
a
hundred
dollar
be
to
be
find
in


actual
money
in
any
one
’s
possession
.
if
his
notion
of
hide
treasure


have
be
analyze
,
they
would
have
be
find
to
consist
of
a
handful
of


real
dime
and
a
bushel
of
vague
,
splendid
,
ungraspable
dollar
.




but
the
incident
of
his
adventure
grow
sensibly
sharp
and
clear


under
the
attrition
of
think
they
over
,
and
so
he
presently
find


himself
lean
to
the
impression
that
the
thing
might
not
have
be
a


dream
,
after
all
.
this
uncertainty
must
be
sweep
away
.
he
would
snatch
a


hurried
breakfast
and
go
and
find
Huck
.
Huck
be
sit
on
the
gunwale


of
a
flatboat
,
listlessly
dangle
his
foot
in
the
water
and
look


very
melancholy
.
Tom
conclude
to
let
Huck
lead
up
to
the
subject
.
if


he
do
not
do
it
,
then
the
adventure
would
be
prove
to
have
be
only
a


dream

momentarily
expect
some
catastrophe
to
happen
that
would

away


his

there
be
not

inhale
it

thimbleful

heart
would
soon
wear
itself
out

way
it
be
beat

a
peculiarly
satisfactory
way

day
for
the
long

the
young
folk
of
the
village

into
a
fever
of
preparation


and

he
to
keep

at
Judge
Thatcher

everything

be
:




"
you
’ll
not

some
of
the
girl
that
live
near
the

mind
and
behave
yourself
and
do
n’t
be
any
trouble
.
"




presently
,
as
they
trip
along
,
Tom
say
to
Becky
:




"
say
--
i’ll
tell
you
what
we
’ll
do

'
Stead
of
go
to

we
’ll


climb
right
up

"
oh
,

will
be

then
Becky
reflect
a
moment
and
say
:




"

what
will
mamma

the

turn
the
idea
over
in
her
mind

reluctantly

all
she


want
be
that

’ll
be

I
bet
you

"




the
Widow
Douglas
’
splendid
hospitality
be
a
tempting
bait
.
it
and


Tom
’s
persuasion
presently
carry
the
day
.
so
it
be
decide
to
say


nothing
to
anybody
about
the
night
’s
programme
.
presently
it
occur
to


Tom
that
maybe
Huck
might
come
this
very
night
and
give
the
signal
.
the


think
take
a
deal
of
the
spirit
out
of
his
anticipation
.
still
he


could
not
bear
to
give
up
the
fun
at
Widow
Douglas
'
.
and
why
should
he


give
it
up
,
he
reason
--
the
signal
do
not
come
the
night
before
,
so


why
should
it
be
any
more
likely
to
come
tonight
?
the
sure
fun
of
the


evening
outweigh
the
uncertain
treasure
;
and
,
boy
-
like
,
he
determine


to
yield
to
the
strong
inclination
and
not
allow
himself
to
think
of


the
box
of
money
another
time
that
day
.




three
mile
below
town
the
ferryboat
stop
at
the
mouth
of
a
woody


hollow
and
tie
up
.
the
crowd
swarm
ashore
and
soon
the
forest


distance
and
craggy
height
echo
far
and
near
with
shouting
and


laughter
.
all
the
different
way
of
get
hot
and
tired
be
go


through
with
,
and
by
-
and
-
by
the
rover
straggle
back
to
camp
fortify


with
responsible
appetite
,
and
then
the
destruction
of
the
good
thing


begin
.
after
the
feast
there
be
a
refreshing
season
of
rest
and
chat
in


the
shade
of
spread
oak
.
by
-
and
-
by
somebody
shout
:




"
who
’
ready
for
the
cave
?
"




everybody
be
.
bundle
of
candle
be
procure
,
and
straightway
there


be
a
general
scamper
up
the
hill
.
the
mouth
of
the
cave
be
up
the


hillside
--
an
opening
shape
like
a
letter
a.
its
massive
oaken
door
stand


unbarred
.
within
be
a
small
chamber
,
chilly
as
an
icehouse
,
and
wall


by
nature
with
solid
limestone
that
be
dewy
with
a
cold
sweat
.
it
be


romantic
and
mysterious
to
stand
here
in
the
deep
gloom
and
look
out


upon
the
green
valley
shine
in
the
sun
.
but
the
impressiveness
of
the


situation
quickly
wear
off
,
and
the
romping
begin
again
.
the
moment


a
candle
be
light
there
be
a
general
rush
upon
the
owner
of
it
;
a


struggle
and
a
gallant
defence
follow
,
but
the
candle
be
soon
knock


down
or
blow
out
,
and
then
there
be
a
glad
clamor
of
laughter
and
a


new
chase
.
but
all
thing
have
an
end
.
by
-
and
-
by
the
procession
go


file
down
the
steep
descent
of
the
main
avenue
,
the
flicker
rank
of


light
dimly
reveal
the
lofty
wall
of
rock
almost
to
their
point
of


junction
sixty
foot
overhead
.
this
main
avenue
be
not
more
than


eight
or
ten
foot
wide
.
every
few
step
other
lofty
and
still
narrow


crevice
branch
from
it
on
either
hand
--
for
McDougal
’s
cave
be
but
a


vast
labyrinth
of
crooked
aisle
that
run
into
each
other
and
out
again


and
lead
nowhere
.
it
be
say
that
one
might
wander
day
and
night


together
through
its
intricate
tangle
of
rift
and
chasm
,
and
never


find
the
end
of
the
cave
;
and
that
he
might
go
down
,
and
down
,
and


still
down
,
into
the
earth
,
and
it
be
just
the
same
--
labyrinth
under


labyrinth
,
and
no
end
to
any
of
they
.
no
man
"
know
"
the
cave
.
that
be


an
impossible
thing
.
Most
of
the
young
man
know
a
portion
of
it
,
and
it


be
not
customary
to
venture
much
beyond
this
know
portion
.
Tom
Sawyer


know
as
much
of
the
cave
as
any
one
.




the
procession
move
along
the
main
avenue
some
three
-
quarter
of


a
mile
,
and
then
group
and
couple
begin
to
slip
aside
into
branch


avenue
,
fly
along
the
dismal
corridor
,
and
take
each
other
by
surprise


at
point
where
the
corridor
join
again
.
party
be
able
to
elude


each
other
for
the
space
of
half
an
hour
without
go
beyond
the


"
know
"
ground
.




by
-
and
-
by
,
one
group
after
another
came
straggle
back
to
the
mouth


of
the
cave
,
pant
,
hilarious
,
smear
from
head
to
foot
with
tallow


dripping
,
daub
with
clay
,
and
entirely
delighted
with
the
success
of


the
day
.
then
they
be
astonish
to
find
that
they
have
be
take


no
note
of
time
and
that
night
be
about
at
hand
.
the
clang
bell
have


be
call
for
half
an
hour
.
however
,
this
sort
of
close
to
the
day
’s


adventure
be
romantic
and
therefore
satisfactory
.
when
the
ferryboat


with
her
wild
freight
push
into
the
stream
,
nobody
care
sixpence
for


the
waste
time
but
the
captain
of
the
craft
.




Huck
be
already
upon
his
watch
when
the
ferryboat
’s
light
go


glint
past
the
wharf
.
he
hear
no
noise
on
board
,
for
the
young


people
be
as
subdue
and
still
as
people
usually
be
who
be
nearly


tired
to
death
.
he
wonder
what
boat
it
be
,
and
why
she
do
not


stop
at
the
wharf
--
and
then
he
drop
she
out
of
his
mind
and
put
his


attention
upon
his
business
.
the
night
be
grow
cloudy
and
dark
.
ten


o’clock
come
,
and
the
noise
of
vehicle
cease
,
scatter
light
begin


to
wink
out
,
all
straggle
foot
-
passenger
disappear
,
the
village


betook
itself
to
its
slumber
and
leave
the
small
watcher
alone
with
the


silence
and
the
ghost
.
eleven
o’clock
come
,
and
the
tavern
light
be


put
out
;
darkness
everywhere
,
now
.
Huck
wait
what
seem
a
weary
long


time
,
but
nothing
happen
.
his
faith
be
weaken
.
be
there
any
use
?


be
there
really
any
use
?
why
not
give
it
up
and
turn
in
?




a
noise
fall
upon
his
ear
.
he
be
all
attention
in
an
instant
.
the
alley


door
close
softly
.
he
spring
to
the
corner
of
the
brick
store
.
the
next


moment
two
man
brush
by
he
,
and
one
seem
to
have
something
under


his
arm
.
it
must
be
that
box
!
so
they
be
go
to
remove
the
treasure
.


why
call
Tom
now
?
it
would
be
absurd
--
the
man
would
get
away
with
the
box


and
never
be
find
again
.
no
,
he
would
stick
to
their
wake
and
follow


they
;
he
would
trust
to
the
darkness
for
security
from
discovery
.
so


commune
with
himself
,
Huck
step
out
and
glide
along
behind
the


man
,
cat
-
like
,
with
bare
foot
,
allow
they
to
keep
just
far
enough


ahead
not
to
be
invisible
.




they
move
up
the
river
street
three
block
,
then
turn
to
the
left
up


a
crossstreet
.
they
go
straight
ahead
,
then
,
until
they
come
to
the


path
that
lead
up
Cardiff
Hill
;
this
they
take
.
they
pass
by
the
old


Welshman
’s
house
,
halfway
up
the
hill
,
without
hesitate
,
and
still


climb
upward
.
good
,
think
Huck
,
they
will
bury
it
in
the
old
quarry
.


but
they
never
stop
at
the
quarry
.
they
pass
on
,
up
the
summit
.


they
plunge
into
the
narrow
path
between
the
tall
sumach
bush
,
and


be
at
once
hide
in
the
gloom
.
Huck
close
up
and
shorten
his


distance
,
now
,
for
they
would
never
be
able
to
see
he
.
he
trot
along


awhile
;
then
slacken
his
pace
,
fear
he
be
gain
too
fast
;
move


on
a
piece
,
then
stop
altogether
;
listen
;
no
sound
;
none
,
save
that


he
seem
to
hear
the
beating
of
his
own
heart
.
the
hooting
of
an


owl
come
over
the
hill
--
ominous
sound
!
but
no
footstep
.
Heavens
,
be


everything
lose
!
he
be
about
to
spring
with
wing
foot
,
when
a
man


clear
his
throat
not
four
foot
from
he
!
Huck
’s
heart
shoot
into
his


throat
,
but
he
swallow
it
again
;
and
then
he
stand
there
shake
as


if
a
dozen
ague
have
take
charge
of
he
at
once
,
and
so
weak
that
he


think
he
must
surely
fall
to
the
ground
.
he
know
where
he
be
.
he


know
he
be
within
five
step
of
the
stile
lead
into
Widow
Douglas
'


ground
.
very
well
,
he
think
,
let
they
bury
it
there
;
it
wo
n’t
be
hard


to
find
.




now
there
be
a
voice
--
a
very
low
voice
--
Injun
Joe
’s
:




"

,

,

we

fifteen
foot
of

dark
as

and
just
then
I
find
I
be
go
to
sneeze
.
it
be
the


mean
kind
of
luck

I
try

no
use--’twas
bind
to


come

it
do
come
!
I
be
in
the
lead
with
my
pistol

when


the
sneeze
start
those
scoundrel
a

judge
we
never

they

a

start
,

bullet
whiz
by

n’t
do

any

the

we
quit
chasing

go
down

stir
up
the

they
get
a


posse
together

go
off

be
such
a
goose

betray
such


a
suspicious
excitement

he
have
drop
the
idea

the
parcel


bring
from

he
have
only
think
it

not
the
treasure

he
have
not
know
that
it
wasn’t

so
the
suggestion
of
a


capture
bundle
be
too
much
for
his
self

possession

on
the
whole


he
feel
glad
the
little
episode
have
happen

now
he
know
beyond
all


question
that
that

at

everything
seem
to

the

,
the
man
would
be
capture

seize

there
be

Huck


jump
for
a
hiding

place
,
for
he
have
no
mind
to
be

even


remotely
with
the
late

admit

have
to
tell
the

that
no
other
memorial
of
she
could
ever

so


precious

one

awful

a
far

away


speck

forth

a
score
of
man
go
troop
down
the

Tom

the
picnic

they
trip
along


the
murky
aisle
with
the
rest
of
the
company

visit
the
familiar


wonder
of
the

engage
in
it
with
zeal
until
the
exertion
begin
to
grow
a
trifle


wearisome
;
then
they
wander
down
a
sinuous
avenue
hold
their


candle
aloft
and
read
the
tangled
webwork
of
name
,
date
,


postoffice
address
,
and
motto
with
which
the
rocky
wall
have

frescoed
(
in
candle

still
drift
along
and
talk
,

scarcely

they
be
now
in
a
part
of
the
cave
whose
wall


be
not
fresco
.
they
smoke
their
own
name
under
an
overhanging


shelf
and
move
on
.
presently
they
come
to
a
place
where
a
little
stream


of
water
,
trickle
over
a
ledge

carry
a

his
small
body
behind


it
in

to
illuminate
it
for

gratification

find
that


it
curtain

sort
of
steep
natural
stairway

respond
to
his
call

they
make
a
smoke

mark
for
future


guidance
,
and
start
upon
their
quest
.
they
wind
this
way
and
that
,


far
down
into
the
secret
depth
of
the
cave

make
another
mark
,
and


branch
off
in
search
of
novelty
to
tell
the
upper
world
about
.
in


one
place
they
find
a
spacious
cavern
,
from
whose
ceiling
depend
a


multitude
of
shine
stalactite
of
the
length
and
circumference
of


a
man
’s
leg
;
they
walk
all
about
it

admiring
,

presently
leave
it
by
one
of
the
numerous
passage
that
open
into


it
.
this
shortly
bring
they
to
a
bewitching
spring

basin

frostwork

fantastic

have
be
form
by
the
joining
of
great
stalactite
and
stalagmite


together
,
the
result
of
the
ceaseless
water

drip
of
century

under
the


roof
vast
knot
of
bat

pack
themselves
together
,
thousand
in
a


bunch
;
the
light
disturb
the
creature
and
they
came
flock
down
by


hundred
,
squeak
and
dart
furiously
at
the
candle
.
Tom
know
their


way
and
the
danger
of
this
sort
of
conduct
.
he
seize
Becky
’s
hand
and


hurry
she
into
the
first
corridor
that
offer
;
and
none
too
soon
,
for


a
bat
strike
Becky
’s
light
out
with
its
wing
while
she
be
pass
out


of
the
cavern
.
the
bat
chase
the
child
a
good
distance
;
but
the


fugitive
plunge
into
every
new
passage
that
offer
,
and
at
last
get


rid
of
the
perilous
thing
.
Tom
find
a
subterranean
lake
,
shortly
,


which
stretch
its
dim
length
away
until
its
shape
be
lose
in
the


shadow
.
he
want
to
explore
its
border
,
but
conclude
that
it
would


be
good
to
sit
down
and
rest
awhile
,
first
.
now
,
for
the
first
time
,
the


deep
stillness
of
the
place
lay
a
clammy
hand
upon
the
spirit
of
the


child
.
Becky
say
:




"
why
,
I
do
n’t
notice

ever
so
long

Becky
grow
apprehensive
.




"
I
wonder
how
long

down

the

candle


out
it
will
be
an
awful
fix

’s
try
some
other
way

"
and
the
girl


shudder
at
the
thought
of
the
dreadful
possibility
.




they
start
through
a
corridor
,
and
traverse
it
in
silence
a
long


way

glance
at
each
new
opening
,
to
see
if
there
be
anything
familiar


about
the
look
of
it
;
but
they
be
all
strange
.
every
time
Tom
make
an


examination
,
Becky
would
watch
his
face
for
an
encouraging
sign
,
and
he


would
say
cheerily
:

but
he
feel
less
and
less
hopeful
with
each
failure
,
and
presently
begin


to
turn
off
into
diverge
avenue
at
sheer
random
,
in
desperate
hope
of

the
one

he
still
say
it

there

such
a

to


his
side

an
anguish

down

out
in

distance

a
faint

she
sink
to
the

into
such
a
frenzy
of
cry
that

appal
with
the
idea
that

he


sit
down

to
pay


attention

it
be
dreadful
to
think

in
any
direction

at

progress

might
bear
fruit

to
sit
down
be
to


invite
death
and
shorten
its
pursuit

with

the
comfortable
bed

,
above
all
,

Becky
cry
,

Tom


try
to
think
of
some
way
of
comfort

,

all
his
encouragement


be
grow
thread

bare
with
use
,

sound
like
sarcasm

fatigue
bore


so
heavily
upon
Becky
that
she
drowse
off
to
sleep

Tom
be
grateful

he
sat
look
into
her
draw
face

see
it
grow
smooth
and
natural


under
the
influence
of
pleasant
dream
;

by

by
a
smile

rest
there

reflect
somewhat
of
peace

stricken
dead

rise
up

along

hopeless

they
try


to
estimate
how
long
they
have
be
in
the
cave
,

all
they
know
be


that

it

down
,

a
frightened
look
in
Becky
’s
face
bring
Tom
to
his
sense
and
he
see


that
he
have
make
a
blunder
.
Becky
be
not
to
have
go
home
that
night
!


the
child
become
silent
and
thoughtful
.
in
a
moment
a
new
burst
of


grief
from
Becky
show
Tom
that
the
thing
in
his
mind
have
strike
hers


also
--
that
the
Sabbath
morning
might
be
half
spend
before
Mrs.
Thatcher


discover
that
Becky
be
not
at
Mrs.
Harper
’s
.




the
child
fasten
their
eye
upon
their
bit
of
candle
and
watch
it


melt
slowly
and
pitilessly
away
;
see
the
half
inch
of
wick
stand
alone


at
last
;
see
the
feeble
flame
rise
and
fall
,
climb
the
thin
column
of


smoke
,
linger
at
its
top
a
moment
,
and
then
--
the
horror
of
utter
darkness


reign
!




how
long
afterward
it
be
that
Becky
come
to
a
slow
consciousness
that


she
be
cry
in
Tom
’s
arm
,
neither
could
tell
.
all
that
they
know


be
,
that
after
what
seem
a
mighty
stretch
of
time
,
both
awake
out
of


a
dead
stupor
of
sleep
and
resume
their
misery
once
more
.
Tom
say


it
might
be
Sunday
,
now
--
maybe
Monday
.
he
try
to
get
Becky
to
talk
,
but


her
sorrow
be
too
oppressive
,
all
her
hope
be
go
.
Tom
say
that


they
must
have
be
miss
long
ago
,
and
no
doubt
the
search
be
go


on
.
he
would
shout
and
maybe
some
one
would
come
.
he
try
it
;
but
in


the
darkness
the
distant
echo
sound
so
hideously
that
he
try
it
no


more
.




the
hour
waste
away
,
and
hunger
come
to
torment
the
captive
again
.
a


portion
of
Tom
’s
half
of
the
cake
be
leave
;
they
divide
and
eat
it
.
but


they
seem
hungry
than
before
.
the
poor
morsel
of
food
only
whet


desire
.




by
-
and
-
by
Tom
say
:




"
SH
!
do
you
hear
that
?
"




both
hold
their
breath
and
listen
.
there
be
a
sound
like
the


faint
,
far
-
off
shout
.
instantly
Tom
answer
it
,
and
lead
Becky
by


the
hand
,
start
grope
down
the
corridor
in
its
direction
.
presently


he
listen
again
;
again
the
sound
be
hear
,
and
apparently
a
little


near
.




"
it
’
they
!
"
say
Tom
;
"
they
’re
come
!
come
along
,
Becky
--
we’re
all


right
now
!
"




the
joy
of
the
prisoner
be
almost
overwhelming
.
their
speed
be
slow
,


however
,
because
pitfall
be
somewhat
common
,
and
have
to
be
guard


against
.
they
shortly
come
to
one
and
have
to
stop
.
it
might
be
three


foot
deep
,
it
might
be
a
hundred
--
there
be
no
pass
it
at
any
rate
.


Tom
get
down
on
his
breast
and
reach
as
far
down
as
he
could
.
no


bottom
.
they
must
stay
there
and
wait
until
the
searcher
come
.
they


listen
;
evidently
the
distant
shouting
be
grow
more
distant
!


a
moment
or
two
more
and
they
have
go
altogether
.
the
heart
-
sink


misery
of
it
!
Tom
whoop
until
he
be
hoarse
,
but
it
be
of
no
use
.
he


talk
hopefully
to
Becky
;
but
an
age
of
anxious
waiting
pass
and
no


sound
come
again
.




the
child
grope
their
way
back
to
the
spring
.
the
weary
time
drag


on
;
they
sleep
again
,
and
awake
famished
and
woe
-
stricken
.
Tom
believe


it
must
be
Tuesday
by
this
time
.




now
an
idea
strike
he
.
there
be
some
side
passage
near
at
hand
.
it


would
be
well
to
explore
some
of
these
than
bear
the
weight
of
the


heavy
time
in
idleness
.
he
take
a
kite
-
line
from
his
pocket
,
tie
it
to


a
projection
,
and
he
and
Becky
start
,
Tom
in
the
lead
,
unwind
the


line
as
he
grope
along
.
at
the
end
of
twenty
step
the
corridor
end


in
a
"
jumping
-
off
place
.
"
Tom
get
down
on
his
knee
and
feel
below
,


and
then
as
far
around
the
corner
as
he
could
reach
with
his
hand


conveniently
;
he
make
an
effort
to
stretch
yet
a
little
far
to
the


right
,
and
at
that
moment
,
not
twenty
yard
away
,
a
human
hand
,
hold


a
candle
,
appear
from
behind
a
rock
!
Tom
lift
up
a
glorious
shout
,


and
instantly
that
hand
be
follow
by
the
body
it
belong
to
--
Injun


Joe
’s
!
Tom
be
paralyzed
;
he
could
not
move
.
he
be
vastly
gratify
the


next
moment
,
to
see
the
"
Spaniard
"
take
to
his
heel
and
get
himself
out


of
sight
.
Tom
wonder
that
Joe
have
not
recognize
his
voice
and
come


over
and
kill
he
for
testify
in
court
.
but
the
echo
must
have


disguise
the
voice
.
without
doubt
,
that
be
it
,
he
reason
.
Tom
’s


fright
weaken
every
muscle
in
his
body
.
he
say
to
himself
that
if
he


have
strength
enough
to
get
back
to
the
spring
he
would
stay
there
,
and


nothing
should
tempt
he
to
run
the
risk
of
meet
Injun
Joe
again
.
he


be
careful
to
keep
from
Becky
what
it
be
he
have
see
.
he
tell
she
he


have
only
shout
"
for
luck
.
"




but
hunger
and
wretchedness
rise
superior
to
fear
in
the
long
run
.


another
tedious
wait
at
the
spring
and
another
long
sleep
bring


change
.
the
child
awake
torture
with
a
rage
hunger
.
Tom
believe


that
it
must
be
Wednesday
or
Thursday
or
even
Friday
or
Saturday
,
now
,


and
that
the
search
have
be
give
over
.
he
propose
to
explore
another


passage
.
he
feel
willing
to
risk
Injun
Joe
and
all
other
terror
.
but


Becky
be
very
weak
.
she
have
sink
into
a
dreary
apathy
and
would
not

.
she
say
she
would
wait
,
now
,
where
she
be
,
and
die
--
it
would


not
be
long
.
she
tell
Tom
to
go
with
the
kite

line
and
explore
if
he


choose
;
but
she
implore
he
to
come
back
every
little
while
and
speak


to
she
;
and
she
make
he
promise
that
when
the
awful
time
come
,
he
would


stay
by

with
a

in
his
throat

make
a
show


of
be
confident
of
find
the
searcher
or
an
escape
from

then
he
take
the

down

an
abounding
sense

relief

which
reveal
to
he
in
a
degree
which
he

make
a


mighty
stir
in
the
poor
little

.
so
vast
a


sum
,
all
in

it
be
talk


about

over
,
glorify
,
until
the
reason
of
many
of
the
citizen


totter
under
the
strain
of
the
unhealthy
excitement
.
every
"
haunted
"


 
house

St.

the

pretty
grave
,
unromantic
man
,

,


some
of
they
.
wherever
Tom
and
Huck
appear
they
be
court
,
admire
,


stare
at
.
the
boy
be
not
able
to
remember
that
their
remark
have


possess
weight
before
;
but
now
their
saying
be

repeat
;
everything
they
do
seem
somehow
to
be

;
they
have
evidently
lose
the
power
of

,
their

rake
up

the

the
same
with
Tom
’s
at

Polly
’s
request
.
each
lad
have


an
income
,

,
that
be
simply
prodigious
--
a
dollar
for
every
weekday
in


the
year
and
half
of
the
Sundays
.
it
be
just
what
the

no

what
he

he
generally

collect
it

a

a
quarter

would
board

old


simple
day

,

,
for
that
matter
.




Judge
Thatcher
have
conceive
a
great
opinion
of
Tom
.
he
say
that
no


commonplace
boy
would
ever
have
get
his
daughter
out
of
the
cave
.
when


Becky
tell
her
father
,
in
strict
confidence
,
how
Tom
have
take
she


whip
at
school
,
the
Judge
be
visibly
move
;
and
when
she
plead


grace
for
the
mighty
lie
which
Tom
have
tell
in
order
to
shift
that


whip
from
her
shoulder
to
his
own
,
the
Judge
say
with
a
fine


outburst
that
it
be
a
noble
,
a
generous
,
a
magnanimous
lie
--
a
lie
that


be
worthy
to
hold
up
its
head
and
march
down
through
history
breast
to


breast
with
George
Washington
’s
laud
Truth
about
the

Becky

her
father
have
never

so
tall

so
superb

the
floor

stamp
his
foot
and
say
that
.
she
go
straight


off
and
tell
Tom
about
it
.




Judge
Thatcher
hope
to
see
Tom
a
great
lawyer
or
a
great
soldier
some


day
.
he
say
he
mean
to
look
to
it
that
Tom
should
be

Military
Academy

afterward
train
in
the
good
law

"




conclusion




so
endeth
this
chronicle
.
it
be
strictly
a
history
of
a
_
boy
_
,
it


must
stop
here
;
the
story
could
not
go
much
far
without
become
the


history
of
a
_
man
_
.
when
one
write
a
novel
about
grown
people
,
he
know


exactly
where
to
stop
--
that
is
,
with
a
marriage
;
but
when
he
write
of


juvenile
,
he
must
stop
where
he
well
can
.




Most
of
the
character
that
perform
in
this
book
still
live
,
and
be


prosperous
and
happy
.
some
day
it
may
seem
worth
while
to
take
up
the


story
of
the
young
one
again
and
see
what
sort
of
man
and
woman
they


turn
out
to
be
;
therefore
it
will
be
wise
not
to
reveal
any
of
that


part
of
their
life
at
present
.
