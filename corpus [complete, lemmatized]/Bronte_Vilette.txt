my
godmother
live
in
a
handsome
house
in
the
clean
and
ancient
town
of


Bretton
.
her
husband
's
family
have
be
resident
there
for
generation
,


and
bore
,
indeed
,
the
name
of
their
birthplace
--
Bretton
of
Bretton
:


whether
by
coincidence
,
or
because
some
remote
ancestor
have
be
a


personage
of
sufficient
importance
to
leave
his
name
to
his


neighbourhood
,
I
know
not
.




when
I
be
a
girl
I
go
to
Bretton
about
twice
a
year
,
and
well
I


like
the
visit
.
the
house
and
its
inmate
specially
suit
I
.
the


large
peaceful
room
,
the
well
-
arrange
furniture
,
the
clear
wide


window
,
the
balcony
outside
,
look
down
on
a
fine
antique
street
,


where
sunday
and
holiday
seem
always
to
abide
--
so
quiet
be
its


atmosphere
,
so
clean
its
pavement
--
these
thing
please
I
well
.




one
child
in
a
household
of
grown
people
be
usually
make
very
much
of
,


and
in
a
quiet
way
I
be
a
good
deal
take
notice
of
by
Mrs.
Bretton
,


who
have
be
leave
a
widow
,
with
one
son
,
before
I
know
she
;
she


husband
,
a
physician
,
having
die
while
she
be
yet
a
young
and


handsome
woman
.




she
be
not
young
,
as
I
remember
she
,
but
she
be
still
handsome
,
tall
,


well
-
make
,
and
though
dark
for
an
englishwoman
,
yet
wear
always
the


clearness
of
health
in
her
brunette
cheek
,
and
its
vivacity
in
a
pair


of
fine
,
cheerful
black
eye
.
People
esteem
it
a
grievous
pity
that


she
have
not
confer
her
complexion
on
her
son
,
whose
eye
be


blue
--
though
,
even
in
boyhood
,
very
pierce
--
and
the
colour
of
his


long
hair
such
as
friend
do
not
venture
to
specify
,
except
as
the
sun


shine
on
it
,
when
they
call
it
golden
.
he
inherit
the
line
of
his


mother
's
feature
,
however
;
also
her
good
tooth
,
her
stature
(
or
the


promise
of
her
stature
,
for
he
be
not
yet
full
-
grown
)
,
and
,
what
be


well
,
her
health
without
flaw
,
and
her
spirit
of
that
tone
and


equality
which
be
well
than
a
fortune
to
the
possessor
.




in
the
autumn
of
the
year
----
I
be
stay
at
Bretton
;
my
godmother


having
come
in
person
to
claim
I
of
the
kinsfolk
with
whom
be
at
that


time
fix
my
permanent
residence
.
I
believe
she
then
plainly
see


event
come
,
whose
very
shadow
I
scarce
guess
;
yet
of
which
the


faint
suspicion
suffice
to
impart
unsettled
sadness
,
and
make
I
glad


to
change
scene
and
society
.




Time
always
flow
smoothly
for
I
at
my
godmother
's
side
;
not
with


tumultuous
swiftness
,
but
blandly
,
like
the
gliding
of
a
full
river


through
a
plain
.
my
visit
to
she
resemble
the
sojourn
of
Christian


and
hopeful
beside
a
certain
pleasant
stream
,
with
"
green
tree
on
each


bank
,
and
meadow
beautify
with
lily
all
the
year
round
.
"
the
charm


of
variety
there
be
not
,
nor
the
excitement
of
incident
;
but
I
like


peace
so
well
,
and
seek
stimulus
so
little
,
that
when
the
latter
come


I
almost
feel
it
a
disturbance
,
and
wish
rather
it
have
still
hold


aloof
.




one
day
a
letter
be
receive
of
which
the
content
evidently
cause


Mrs.
Bretton
surprise
and
some
concern
.
I
think
at
first
it
be
from


home
,
and
tremble
,
expect
I
know
not
what
disastrous
communication
:


to
I
,
however
,
no
reference
be
make
,
and
the
cloud
seem
to
pass
.




the
next
day
,
on
my
return
from
a
long
walk
,
I
find
,
as
I
enter
my


bedroom
,
an
unexpected
change
.
in
,
addition
to
my
own
french
bed
in
its


shady
recess
,
appear
in
a
corner
a
small
crib
,
drape
with
white
;
and


in
addition
to
my
mahogany
chest
of
drawer
,
I
see
a
tiny
rosewood


chest
.
I
stand
still
,
gaze
,
and
consider
.




"
of
what
be
these
thing
the
sign
and
token
?
"
I
ask
.
the
answer


be
obvious
.
"
a
second
guest
be
come
:
Mrs.
Bretton
expect
other


visitor
.
"




on
descend
to
dinner
,
explanation
ensue
.
a
little
girl
,
I
be


tell
,
would
shortly
be
my
companion
:
the
daughter
of
a
friend
and


distant
relation
of
the
late
Dr.
Bretton
's
.
this
little
girl
,
it
be


add
,
have
recently
lose
her
mother
;
though
,
indeed
,
Mrs.
Bretton
ere


long
subjoined
,
the
loss
be
not
so
great
as
might
at
first
appear
.


Mrs.
Home
(
home
it
seem
be
the
name
)
have
be
a
very
pretty
,
but
a


giddy
,
careless
woman
,
who
have
neglect
her
child
,
and
disappoint


and
dishearten
her
husband
.
so
far
from
congenial
have
the
union


prove
,
that
separation
at
last
ensue
--
separation
by
mutual
consent
,


not
after
any
legal
process
.
soon
after
this
event
,
the
lady
have


over
-
exert
herself
at
a
ball
,
catch
cold
,
take
a
fever
,
and
die


after
a
very
brief
illness
.
her
husband
,
naturally
a
man
of
very


sensitive
feeling
,
and
shock
inexpressibly
by
too
sudden


communication
of
the
news
,
could
hardly
,
it
seem
,
now
be
persuade
but


that
some
over
-
severity
on
his
part
--
some
deficiency
in
patience
and


indulgence
--
have
contribute
to
hasten
her
end
.
he
have
brood
over
this


idea
till
his
spirit
be
seriously
affect
;
the
medical
man
insist


on
travel
be
try
as
a
remedy
,
and
meanwhile
Mrs.
Bretton
have


offer
to
take
charge
of
his
little
girl
.
"
and
I
hope
,
"
add
my


godmother
in
conclusion
,
"
the
child
will
not
be
like
her
mamma
;
as


silly
and
frivolous
a
little
flirt

enough


to
marry

of
a


fancy
to
anybody
in

be
not

naughty

wilful

she
be
far
from
disobedient

an
object
less
conducive
to


comfort
--
to
tranquillity
even

than
she
present
,
it
be
scarcely

grown
person
could


have
perform
that
uncheere
business
well
;
no
furrow
face
of


adult
exile

for
Europe
at
Europe
's
antipode

ever
bear
more


legibly
the
sign
of
home
sickness
than
do
her
infant
visage

she


seem
grow
old
and
unearthly
.
I
,
Lucy
Snowe
,
plead
guiltless
of


that
curse
,
an
overheated
and
discursive
imagination
;

whenever
,


open
a
room

I
find
she
seat
in
a
corner
alone
,
her
head
in


her
pigmy
hand
,
that
room
seem
to
I
not
inhabit
,

haunt

of
moonlight
night

white

conspicuous
in
its
night

dress
,
kneel
upright
in
bed
,
and


pray
like
some
catholic
or
methodist
enthusiast
--
some
precocious


fanatic
or
untimely
saint

I
scarcely
know
what
thought
I
have

they
run
risk
of
be
hardly
more
rational

healthy
than
that


child
's
mind
must
have
be
.




I
seldom
catch
a
word
of
her
prayer

they

low

sometimes
,

be
not

what

the

only
be
conjecture

down

give
time

she
have
sit


listlessly

hardly
look

and
not
count

when
--
my
eye
be
fix


on
hers
--
I
witness
in
its
iris
and
pupil
a
startling
transfiguration
.


these
sudden
,
dangerous
natures--_sensitive
_
as
they
be
call
--
offer


many
a
curious
spectacle
to
those
whom
a
cool
temperament
have
secure


from
participation
in
their
angular
vagary

the
fix

heavy
gaze


swum

tremble
,
then
glitter
in
fire
;
the
small
,
overcast
brow


clear
;
the
trivial
and
dejected
feature
light
up
;
the
sad
countenance


vanish
,
and
in
its
place
appear
a
sudden
eagerness

an
intense


expectancy

it

perhaps
Warren
be
in
the
way
and
obey
her
behest
,
which


would
be
impetuous
enough

I

watch
calmly

turning
,
and
quietly
announce
to
Mrs.
Bretton
that
the
child


be
run
out
mad
,
and
ought
instantly
to
be
pursue
,
I
see
she
catch


up
,
and
rapt
at
once
from
my
cool
observation
,
and
from
the
wonder


stare
of
the
passenger
.
a
gentleman
have
do
this
good
turn
,
and
now
,


cover
she
with
his
cloak
,
advanced
to
restore
she
to
the
house


whence
he
have
see
her
issue
.




I
conclude
he
would
leave
she
in
a
servant
's
charge
and
withdraw
;
but


he
enter
:
having
tarry
a
little
while
below
,
he
come
up
-
stair
.




his
reception
immediately
explain
that
he
be
know
to
Mrs.
Bretton
.


she
recognise
he
;
she
greet
he
,
and
yet
she
be
flutter
,


surprised
,
take
unawares
.
her
look
and
manner
be
even
expostulatory
;


and
in
reply
to
these
,
rather
than
her
word
,
he
said,--"i
could
not


help
it
,
madam
:
I
find
it
impossible
to
leave
the
country
without


see
with
my
own
eye
how
she
settle
.

you
will
unsettle

"

hope
not
.
and
how
be
papa
's
little
Polly
?
"




this
question
he
address
to
Paulina
,
as
he
sit
down
and
place
she


gently
on
the
ground
before
he
.




"
how
be
Polly
's
papa

"
be
the
reply
,
as
she
lean
on
his
knee
,
and


gaze
up
into
his
face
.




it
be
not
a
noisy
,
not
a
wordy
scene
:
for
that
I
be
thankful
;
but
it


be
a
scene
of
feel
too
brimful
,
and
which
,
because
the
cup
do
not


foam
up
high
or
furiously
overflow
,
only
oppress
one
the
more
.
on
all


occasion
of
vehement
,
unrestrained
expansion
,
a
sense
of
disdain
or


ridicule
come
to
the
weary
spectator
's
relief
;
whereas
I
have
ever


feel
most
burdensome
that
sort
of
sensibility
which
bend
of
its
own


will
,
a
giant
slave
under
the
sway
of
good
sense
.




Mr.
Home
be
a
stern
-
feature
--
perhaps
I
should
rather
say
,
a


hard
-
feature
man
:
his
forehead
be
knotty
,
and
his
cheekbone
be


mark
and
prominent
.
the
character
of
his
face
be
quite
scotch
;
but


there
be
feel
in
his
eye
,
and
emotion
in
his
now
agitate


countenance
.
his
northern
accent
in
speak
harmonise
with
his


physiognomy
.
he
be
at
once
proud
-
look
and
homely
-
look
.
he
lay


his
hand
on
the
child
's
uplifted
head
.
she
said--"Kiss
Polly
.
"




he
kiss
she
.
I
wish
she
would
utter
some
hysterical
cry
,
so
that
I


might
get
relief
and
be
at
ease
.
she
make
wonderfully
little
noise
:
she


seem
to
have
get
what
she
wanted--_all
_
she
want
,
and
to
be
in
a


trance
of
content
.
neither
in
mien
nor
in
feature
be
this
creature


like
her
sire
,
and
yet
she
be
of
his
strain
:
her
mind
have
be
fill


from
his
,
as
the
cup
from
the
flagon
.




indisputably
,
Mr.
Home

manly
self

,
however
he
might


secretly
feel
on
some
matter
.
"
polly
,
"
he
say
,
look
down
on
his


little
girl
,
"

hall

a

she
obey
;
go
and
return
deftly
and
nimbly

talk
to
Mrs.


Bretton
when
she
come
back
,

she
wait
with
the
handkerchief
in
she


hand

it
be
a
picture
,
in
its
way
,
to
see
she
,
with
her
tiny
stature
,


and
trim
,
neat
shape
,
stand
at
his
knee
.
see
that
he
continue
to


talk
,
apparently
unconscious
of
her
return
,
she
take
his
hand
,
open


the
unresisting
finger
,
insinuate
into
they
the
handkerchief
,
and


close
they
upon
it
one
by
one

he
still

not

neither

an
hour

during
an

space

some
minute

perceive
she
endure
agony

she
go


through
,
in
that
brief
interval
of
her
infant
life
,
emotion
such
as


some
never
feel
;
it
be
in
her
constitution

she
would
have
more

nobody

Mrs.
Bretton

a
mother

a
tear

two

Graham

be
write

lift
up
his
eye
and


gaze
at
she

I
,
Lucy

be
calm
.




the
little
creature
,
thus
leave
unharasse
,
do
for
herself
what
none


other
could
do
--
contend
with
an
intolerable
feeling
;
and
,
ere
long
,


in
some
degree
,
repress
it
.
that
day
she
would
accept
solace
from


none
;
nor
the
next
day
:
she
grow
more
passive
afterwards
.




on
the
third
evening
,
as
she
sit
on
the
floor
,
worn
and
quiet
,
Graham
,


come
in
,
take
she
up
gently
,
without
a
word
.
she
do
not
resist
:
she


rather
nestle
in
his
arm
,
as
if
weary
.
when
he
sit
down

she
lay
she


head

he
;
in
a
few
minute
she
sleep
;
he
carry
her
upstairs


to
bed
.
I
be
not
surprised
that
,
the
next
morning
,
the
first
thing
she


demand
be
,
"

it
happen
that
Graham

have


some
exercise

morning

be
busy
about
something

look
after
somebody

the
cup
be


entrust
to

for
,
if
restless

she
be
also
careful

the
cup

carpet

prisoner

pitcher

she
select
a
portion
of
whatever
be
good
on
the
table
;
and
,
ere


long
,
come
back
with
a
whispered
request
for
some
marmalade
,
which
be


not
there
.
having
get
it
,
however
,
(
for
Mrs.
Bretton
refuse
the
pair


nothing
)
,
Graham
be
shortly
after
hear
laud
she
to
the
sky
;


promise
that
,
when
he
have
a
house
of
his
own
,
she
should
be
his


housekeeper
,
and
perhaps
--
if
she
show
any
culinary
genius
--
his
cook
;


and
,
as
she
do
not
return
,
and
I
go
to
look
after
she
,
I
find


Graham
and
her
breakfasting
_
tete
-
a
-
tete_--she
standing
at
his
elbow
,


and
share
his
fare
:
except
the
marmalade
,
which
she
delicately


refuse
to
touch
,
lest
,
I
suppose
,
it
should
appear
that
she
have


procure
it
as
much
on
her
own
account
as
his
.
she
constantly
evince


these
nice
perception
and
delicate
instinct
.




the
league
of
acquaintanceship
thus
strike
up
be
not
hastily


dissolve
;
on
the
contrary
,
it
appear
that
time
and
circumstance


serve
rather
to
cement
than
loosen
it
.
Ill
-
assimilate
as
the
two
be


in
age
,
sex
,
pursuit
,
&
c.
,
they
somehow
find
a
great
deal
to
say
to


each
other
.
as
to
Paulina
,
I
observe
that
her
little
character
never


properly
come
out
,
except
with
young
Bretton
.
as
she
got
settle
,
and


accustomed
to
the
house
,
she
prove
tractable
enough
with
Mrs.
Bretton
;


but
she
would
sit
on
a
stool
at
that
lady
's
foot
all
day
long
,
learn


her
task
,
or
sewing
,
or
draw
figure
with
a
pencil
on
a
slate
,
and


never
kindle
once
to
originality
,
or
show
a
single
gleam
of
the


peculiarity
of
her
nature
.
I
cease
to
watch
she
under
such


circumstance
:
she
be
not
interesting
.
but
the
moment
Graham
's
knock


sound
of
an
evening
,
a
change
occur
;
she
be
instantly
at
the
head


of
the
staircase
.
usually
her
welcome
be
a
reprimand
or
a
threat
.




"

not

seeming
exhaustion

this
be
do
,
she
descend
warily
,
and
not
take
her
eye
from
the


feeble
Graham
.
of
course
her
approach
always
galvanize
he
to
new
and


spasmodic
life
:
the
game
of
romp
be
sure
to
be
exact
.
sometimes
she


would
be
angry
;
sometimes
the
matter
be
allow
to
pass
smoothly
,
and


we
could
hear
she
say
as
she
lead
he
up
-
stair
:
"
now
,
my
dear
boy
,
come

take
your
tea

I
be
sure
you
must
want
something
.
"




it
be
sufficiently
comical
to
observe
she
as
she
sit
beside
Graham
,


while
he
take
that
meal
.
in
his
absence
she
be
a
still
personage
,
but


with
he
the
most
officious
,
fidgety
little
body
possible
.
I
often


wish
she
would
mind
herself
and
be
tranquil
;
but
no
--
herself
be


forget
in
he
:
he
could
not
be
sufficiently
well
wait
on
,
nor


carefully
enough
look
after
;
he
be
more
than
the
Grand
Turk
in
she


estimation
.
she
would
gradually
assemble
the
various
plate
before
he
,


and
,
when
one
would
suppose
all
he
could
possibly
desire
be
within
his


reach
,
she
would
find
out
something
else
:
"
Ma'am
,
"
she
would
whisper
to


Mrs.
bretton,--"perhap
your
son
would
like
a
little
cake

sweet
cake

you
know

some
in
there

(
point
to
the
sideboard
cupboard
)
.


Mrs.
Bretton
,
as
a
rule
,
disapprove
of
sweet
cake
at
tea
,
but
still


the
request
be
urged,--"one
little
piece
--
only
for
he
--
as
he
go
to


school
:
girl
--
such
as
I
and
Miss
Snowe

don't
need
treat
,
but
_
he
_


would
like
it
.
"




Graham
do
like
it
very
well
,
and
almost
always
get
it
.
to
do
he


justice
,
he
would
have
share
his
prize
with
she
to
whom
he
owe
it
;


but
that
be
never
allow
:
to
insist
,
be
to
ruffle
she
for
the


evening
.
to
stand
by
his
knee
,
and
monopolize
his
talk
and
notice
,
be


the
reward
she
want
--
not
a
share
of
the
cake
.




with
curious
readiness
do
she
adapt
herself
to
such
theme
as


interest
he
.
one
would
have
think
the
child
have
no
mind
or
life
of


her
own
,
but
must
necessarily
live
,
move
,
and
have
her
be
in


another
:
now
that
her
father
be
take
from
she
,
she
nestle
to
Graham
,


and
seem
to
feel
by
his
feeling
:
to
exist
in
his
existence
.
she


learn
the
name
of
all
his
schoolfellow
in
a
trice
:
she
get
by
heart


their
character
as
give
from
his
lip
:
a
single
description
of
an


individual
seem
to
suffice
.
she
never
forget
,
or
confused
identity
:


she
would
talk
with
he
the
whole
evening
about
people
she
have
never


see
,
and
appear
completely
to
realise
their
aspect
,
manner
,
and


disposition
.
some
she
learn
to
mimic
:
an
under
-
master
,
who
be
an


aversion
of
young
Bretton
's
,
have
,
it
seem
,
some
peculiarity
,
which


she
catch
up
in
a
moment
from
Graham
's
representation
,
and
rehearse


for
his
amusement
;
this
,
however
,
Mrs.
Bretton
disapprove
and
forbid
.




the
pair
seldom
quarrel
;
yet
once
a
rupture
occur
,
in
which
she


feeling
receive
a
severe
shock
.




one
day
Graham
,
on
the
occasion
of
his
birthday
,
have
some
friend
--
lad


of
his
own
age
--
to
dine
with
he
.
Paulina
take
much
interest
in
the


come
of
these
friend
;
she
have
frequently
hear
of
they
;
they
be


amongst
those
of
whom
Graham
oftenest
speak
.
after
dinner
,
the
young


gentleman
be
leave
by
themselves
in
the
dining
-
room

Graham
quiet

a
serene
,

rather
indolent
sort
of
enjoyment
by
the
parlour


fireside

he
would
take
possession

couch

be
a
boy
not
quite
as
other
boy
be
;
all
his
delight
do
not


lie
in
action
:
he
be
capable
of
some
interval
of
contemplation
;
he


could
take
a
pleasure
too
in
reading
,
nor
be
his
selection
of
book


wholly
indiscriminate
:
there
be
glimmering
of
characteristic


preference
,

even
of
instinctive
taste
in
the
choice
.

rarely

true

singing


voice

Graham
would
take
exception
at
the
manner
,

proceed
to
give


a
lesson
in
recitation

reading

perhaps

chapter

Bible

correction

seldom
require
here

the
child
could


read
any
simple
narrative
chapter
very
well
;

,
when
the
subject
be


such
as
she
could
understand
and
take
an
interest
in

expression

the

Graham
in

little
arm

his

head

the
action
,
I
remember
,
strike
I
as


strangely
rash
;
exciting
the
feeling
one
might
experience
on
see
an


animal
dangerous
by
nature
,
and
but
half
-
tame
by
art
,
too
heedlessly


fondle
.
not
that
I
fear
Graham
would
hurt
,
or
very
roughly
check


she
;
but
I
think
she
run
risk
of
incur
such
a
careless
,
impatient


repulse
,
as
would
be
bad

on
the
whole

however
,
these
demonstration
be
bear
passively

sometimes
even
a


sort
of
complacent
wonder
at
her
earnest
partiality
would
smile
not


unkindly
in
his
eye

said:--"You

no

MISS

on
quit
Bretton
,
which
I
do
a
few
week
after
Paulina
's


departure
--
little
thinking
then
I
be
never
again
to
visit
it
;
never


more
to
tread
its
calm
old
street
--
I
betake
myself
home
,
having
be


absent
six
month
.
it
will
be
conjecture
that
I
be
of
course
glad
to


return
to
the
bosom
of
my
kindre
.
well
!
the
amiable
conjecture
do
no


harm
,
and
may
therefore
be
safely
leave
uncontradicted
.
far
from
say


nay
,
indeed
,
I
will
permit
the
reader
to
picture
I
,
for
the
next
eight


year
,
as
a
bark
slumber
through
halcyon
weather
,
in
a
harbour
still


as
glass
--
the
steersman
stretch
on
the
little
deck
,
his
face
up
to


heaven
,
his
eye
close
:
bury
,
if
you
will
,
in
a
long
prayer
.
a
great


many
woman
and
girl
be
suppose
to
pass
their
life
something
in
that


fashion
;
why
not
I
with
the
rest
?




picture
I
then
idle
,
basking
,
plump
,
and
happy
,
stretch
on
a


cushioned
deck
,
warm
with
constant
sunshine
,
rock
by
breeze


indolently
soft
.
however
,
it
can
not
be
conceal
that
,
in
that
case
,
I


must
somehow
have
fall
overboard
,
or
that
there
must
have
be
wreck


at
last
.
I
too
well
remember
a
time
--
a
long
time
--
of
cold
,
of
danger
,


of
contention
.
to
this
hour
,
when
I
have
the
nightmare
,
it
repeat
the


rush
and
saltness
of
briny
wave
in
my
throat
,
and
their
icy
pressure


on
my
lung
.
I
even
know
there
be
a
storm
,
and
that
not
of
one
hour


nor
one
day
.
for
many
day
and
night
neither
sun
nor
star
appear
;


we
cast
with
our
own
hand
the
tackling
out
of
the
ship
;
a
heavy


tempest
lie
on
we
;
all
hope
that
we
should
be
save
be
take
away
.
in


fine
,
the
ship
be
lose
,
the
crew
perish
.




as
far
as
I
recollect
,
I
complain
to
no
one
about
these
trouble
.


indeed
,
to
whom
could
I
complain
?
of
Mrs.
Bretton
I
have
long
lose


sight

impediment
,
raise
by
other
,
have
,
year
ago
,
come
in
the
way


of
our
intercourse
,
and
cut
it
off
.
besides
,
time
have
bring
change


for
she
,
too
:
the
handsome
property
of
which
she
be
leave
guardian
for


her
son
,
and
which
have
be
chiefly
invest
in
some
joint
-
stock


undertaking
,
have
melt
,
it
be
say
,
to
a
fraction
of
its
original


amount
.
Graham
,
I
learn
from
incidental
rumour
,
have
adopt
a


profession
;
both
he
and
his
mother
be
go
from
Bretton
,
and
be


understand
to
be
now
in
London
.
thus
,
there
remain
no
possibility
of


dependence
on
other
;
to
myself
alone
could
I
look
.
I
know
not
that
I


be
of
a
self
-
reliant
or
active
nature
;
but
self
-
reliance
and
exertion


be
force
upon
I
by
circumstance
,
as
they
be
upon
thousand


besides
;
and
when
Miss
Marchmont
,
a
maiden
lady
of
our
neighbourhood
,


send
for
I
,
I
obey
her
behest
,
in
the
hope
that
she
might
assign
I


some
task
I
could
undertake
.




Miss
Marchmont
be
a
woman
of
fortune
,
and
live
in
a
handsome


residence
;
but
she
be
a
rheumatic
cripple
,
impotent
,
foot
and
hand
,


and
have
be
so
for
twenty
year
.
she
always
sit
upstairs
:
she


drawing
-
room
adjoin
her
bed
-
room
.
I
have
often
hear
of
Miss


Marchmont
,
and
of
her
peculiarity
(
she
have
the
character
of
be


very
eccentric
)
,
but
till
now
have
never
see
she
.
I
find
she
a


furrow
,
grey
-
haired
woman
,
grave
with
solitude
,
stern
with
long


affliction
,
irritable
also
,
and
perhaps
exact
.
it
seem
that
a


maid
,
or
rather
companion
,
who
have
wait
on
she
for
some
year
,
be


about
to
be
marry
;
and
she
,
hearing
of
my
bereaved
lot
,
have
send
for


I
,
with
the
idea
that
I
might
supply
this
person
's
place
.
she
make
the


proposal
to
I
after
tea
,
as
she
and
I
sit
alone
by
her
fireside
.




"
it
will
not
be
an
easy
life
;
"
say
she
candidly
,
"
for
I
require
a
good


deal
of
attention
,
and
you
will
be
much
confine
;
yet
,
perhaps
,


contrast
with
the
existence
you
have
lately
lead
,
it
may
appear


tolerable
.
"




I
reflect
.
of
course
it
ought
to
appear
tolerable
,
I
argue
inwardly
;


but
somehow
,
by
some
strange
fatality
,
it
would
not
.
to
live
here
,
in


this
close
room
,
the
watcher
of
suffering
--
sometimes
,
perhaps
,
the
butt


of
temper
--
through
all
that
be
to
come
of
my
youth
;
while
all
that
be


go
have
pass
,
to
say
the
least
,
not
blissfully
!
my
heart
sink
one


moment
,
then
it
revive
;
for
though
I
force
myself
to
_
realise
_
evil
,


I
think
I
be
too
prosaic
to
_
idealise
_
,
and
consequently
to
exaggerate


they
.




"
my
doubt
be
whether
I
should
have
strength
for
the
undertaking
,
"
I


observe
.




"
that
be
my
own
scruple
,
"
say
she
;
"
for
you
look
a
worn
-
out
creature
.
"




so
I
do
.
I
see
myself
in
the
glass
,
in
my
mourning
-
dress
,
a
faded
,


hollow
-
eyed
vision
.
yet
I
think
little
of
the
wan
spectacle
.
the


blight
,
I
believe
,
be
chiefly
external
:
I
still
feel
life
at
life
's


source
.




"
what
else
have
you
in
view
--
anything
?
"




"
nothing
clear
as
yet
:
but
I
may
find
something
.
"




"
so
you
imagine
:
perhaps
you
be
right
.
try
your
own
method
,
then
;
and


if
it
do
not
succeed
,
test
mine
.
the
chance
I
have
offer
shall
be


leave
open
to
you
for
three
month
.
"




this
be
kind
.
I
tell
she
so
,
and
express
my
gratitude
.
while
I
be


speak
,
a
paroxysm
of
pain
come
on
.
I
minister
to
she
;
make
the


necessary
application
,
accord
to
her
direction
,
and
,
by
the
time


she
be
relieve
,
a
sort
of
intimacy
be
already
form
between
we
.
I
,


for
my
part
,
have
learn
from
the
manner
in
which
she
bear
this
attack
,


that
she
be
a
firm
,
patient
woman
(
patient
under
physical
pain
,
though


sometimes
perhaps
excitable
under
long
mental
canker
)
;
and
she
,
from


the
good
-
will
with
which
I
succour
she
,
discover
that
she
could


influence
my
sympathy
(
such
as
they
be
)
.
she
send
for
I
the
next


day
;
for
five
or
six
successive
day
she
claim
my
company
.
close


acquaintance
,
while
it
develop
both
fault
and
eccentricity
,


open
,
at
the
same
time
,
a
view
of
a
character
I
could
respect
.
stern


and
even
morose
as
she
sometimes
be
,
I
could
wait
on
she
and
sit


beside
she
with
that
calm
which
always
bless
we
when
we
be
sensible


that
our
manner
,
presence
,
contact
,
please
and
soothe
the
person
we


serve
.
even
when
she
scold
I
--
which
she
do
,
now
and
then
,
very


tartly
--
it
be
in
such
a
way
as
do
not
humiliate
,
and
leave
no
sting
;


it
be
rather
like
an
irascible
mother
rate
her
daughter
,
than
a


harsh
mistress
lecture
a
dependant
:
lecture
,
indeed
,
she
could
not
,


though
she
could
occasionally
storm
.
moreover
,
a
vein
of
reason
ever


run
through
her
passion
:
she
be
logical
even
when
fierce
.
ere
long
a


grow
sense
of
attachment
begin
to
present
the
thought
of
stay


with
she
as
companion
in
quite
a
new
light
;
in
another
week
I
have


agree
to
remain
.




two
hot
,
close
room
thus
become
my
world
;
and
a
crippled
old
woman
,
my


mistress
,
my
friend
,
my
all
.
her
service
be
my
duty
--
her
pain
,
my


suffering
--
her
relief
,
my
hope
--
her
anger
,
my
punishment
--
her
regard
,


my
reward
.
I
forget
that
there
be
field
,
wood
,
river
,
sea
,
an


ever
-
change
sky
outside
the
steam
-
dim
lattice
of
this
sick


chamber
;
I
be
almost
content
to
forget
it
.
all
within
I
become


narrow
to
my
lot
.
Tame
and
still
by
habit
,
discipline
by
destiny
,
I


demand
no
walk
in
the
fresh
air
;
my
appetite
need
no
more
than
the


tiny
mess
serve
for
the
invalid
.
in
addition
,
she
give
I
the


originality
of
her
character
to
study
:
the
steadiness
of
her
virtue
,
I


will
add
,
the
power
of
her
passion
,
to
admire
;
the
truth
of
she


feeling
to
trust
.
all
these
thing
she
have
,
and
for
these
thing
I


clung
to
she
.




for
these
thing
I
would
have
crawl
on
with
she
for
twenty
year
,
if


for
twenty
year
long
her
life
of
endurance
have
be
protract
.
but


another
decree
be
write
.
it
seem
I
must
be
stimulate
into
action
.


I
must
be
goad
,
drive
,
sting
,
force
to
energy
.
my
little
morsel
of


human
affection
,
which
I
prize
as
if
it
be
a
solid
pearl
,
must
melt


in
my
finger
and
slip
thence
like
a
dissolving
hailstone
.
my
small


adopt
duty
must
be
snatch
from
my
easily
contented
conscience
.
I


have
want
to
compromise
with
Fate
:
to
escape
occasional
great
agony


by
submit
to
a
whole
life
of
privation
and
small
pain
.
Fate
would


not
so
be
pacify
;
nor
would
providence
sanction
this
shrink
sloth


and
cowardly
indolence
.




one
February
night
--
I
remember
it
well
--
there
come
a
voice
near
Miss


Marchmont
's
house
,
hear
by
every
inmate
,
but
translate
,
perhaps
,
only


by
one
.
after
a
calm
winter
,
storm
be
usher
in
the
spring
.
I
have


put
Miss
Marchmont
to
bed
;
I
sit
at
the
fireside
sewing
.
the
wind
be


wail
at
the
window
;
it
have
wail
all
day
;
but
,
as
night
deepen
,


it
take
a
new
tone
--
an
accent
keen
,
pierce
,
almost
articulate
to
the


ear
;
a
plaint
,
piteous
and
disconsolate
to
the
nerve
,
trill
in
every


gust
.




"
oh
,
hush
!
hush
!
"
I
say
in
my
disturbed
mind
,
drop
my
work
,
and


make
a
vain
effort
to
stop
my
ear
against
that
subtle
,
search


cry
.
I
have
hear
that
very
voice
ere
this
,
and
compulsory
observation

force
on
I
a
theory
as
to
what
it
bode
.
three
time
in
the


course
of
my
life
,
event
have
teach
I
that
these
strange
accent
in


the
storm
--
this
restless
,
hopeless
cry
--
denote
a
come
state
of
the


atmosphere
unpropitious
to

often

by
a
gasping
,
sob
,
torment
,
long

lament

hence
,
I
infer
,
arise
the
legend
of
the
Banshee
.
I
fancy
,


too
,
I
have
notice

but
be
not
philosopher
enough
to
know
whether


there
be
any
connection
between
the
circumstance

that
we
often
at


the
same
time
hear
of
disturb
volcanic
action
in
distant
part
of
the


world
;
of
river
suddenly
rush
above
their
bank
;

strange


high

furiously

I

ask
,
just
at
this

my

so
strangely
clear,--let
I
reflect

for
what
crime
be
I
condemn
,

to
undergo
thirty

at

the

to
see

consult


an
old
servant

some
hour
with
she

how
to

I
.
still

darkness

I


leave
she
about

not

I
be
sure
,

I
should
have
tremble
in
that
lonely


walk
,
which
lie
through
still
field
,
and
pass
neither
village
nor


farmhouse

I
should
have
quail
in
the
absence
of


moonlight
,
for
it
be
by
the
leading
of
star
only
I
trace
the
dim


path
;
I
should
have
quail
still
more

the
unwonted
presence

that


which

the


keen

to

ask
once

out

,

,
I
have
a
staid


manner
of
my
own
which
ere
now
have
be
as
good
to
I
as

under
its
favour

even
approbation

,

may
think
.
in
fact
,
the
distance
be
only
fifty
mile
.
my


mean
would
suffice
both
to
take
I
there
,
to
keep
I
a
few
day
,
and


also
to
bring
I
back
if
I
find
no
inducement
to
stay
.
I
regard
it


as
a
brief
holiday
,
permit
for
once
to
work
-
weary
faculty
,
rather


than
as
an
adventure
of
life
and
death
.
there
be
nothing
like
take


all
you
do
at
a
moderate
estimate
:
it
keep
mind
and
body
tranquil
;


whereas
grandiloquent
notion
be
apt
to
hurry
both
into
fever
.




fifty
mile
be
then
a
day
's
journey

for
I
speak
of
a
time
go
by

my
hair
,
which
,
till
a
late
period
,
withstand
the
frost
of
time
,
lie


now
,
at
last
white
,
under
a
white
cap
,
like
snow
beneath
snow
)
.
about


nine
o'clock
of
a
wet
February
night
I
reach
London
.




my
reader
,
I
know
,
be
one
who
would
not
thank
I
for
an
elaborate


reproduction
of
poetic
first
impression
;
and
it
be
well
,
inasmuch
as
I


have
neither
time
nor
mood
to
cherish
such
;
arrive
as
I
do
late
,
on
a


dark
,
raw
,
and
rainy
evening
,
in
a
Babylon
and
a
wilderness
,
of
which


the
vastness
and
the
strangeness
try
to
the
utmost
any
power
of


clear
thought
and
steady
self
-
possession
with
which
,
in
the
absence
of


more
brilliant
faculty
,
Nature
might
have
gift
I
.




when
I
leave
the
coach
,
the
strange
speech
of
the
cabman
and
other


wait
round
,
seem
to
I
odd
as
a
foreign
tongue
.
I
have
never
before


hear
the
english
language
chop
up
in
that
way
.
however
,
I
manage


to
understand
and
to
be
understand
,
so
far
as
to
get
myself
and
trunk


safely
convey
to
the
old
inn
whereof
I
have
the
address
.
how


difficult
,
how
oppressive
,
how
puzzling
seem
my
flight
!
in
London
for


the
first
time
;
at
an
inn
for
the
first
time
;
tired
with
travel
;


confuse
with
darkness
;
palsy
with
cold
;
unfurnishe
with
either


experience
or
advice
to
tell
I
how
to
act
,
and
yet
--
to
act
oblige
.




into
the
hand
of
common
sense
I
confide
the
matter
.
common
sense
,


however
,
be
as
chill
and
bewildered
as
all
my
other
faculty
,
and


it
be
only
under
the
spur
of
an
inexorable
necessity
that
she


spasmodically
execute
her
trust
.
thus
urge
,
she
pay
the
porter
:


consider
the
crisis
,
I
do
not
blame
she
too
much
that
she
be


hugely
cheat
;
she
ask
the
waiter
for
a
room
;
she
timorously
call


for
the
chambermaid
;
what
be
far
more
,
she
bear
,
without
be
wholly


overcome
,
a
highly
supercilious
style
of
demeanour
from
that
young


lady
,
when
she
appear
.




I
recollect
this
same
chambermaid
be
a
pattern
of
town
prettiness
and


smartness
.
so
trim
her
waist
,
her
cap
,
her
dress
--
I
wonder
how
they


have
all
be
manufacture
.
her
speech
have
an
accent
which
in
its


mince
glibness
seem
to
rebuke
mine
as
by
authority
;
her
spruce


attire
flaunt
an
easy
scorn
to
my
plain
country
garb
.




"
well
,
it
ca
n't
be
help
,
"
I
think
,
"
and
then
the
scene
be
new
,
and


the
circumstance
;
I
shall
gain
good
.
"




maintain
a
very
quiet
manner
towards
this
arrogant
little
maid
,
and


subsequently
observe
the
same
towards
the
parsonic

look
,


black
-
coated
,

-
neckclothed
waiter
,
I
get
civility
from
they
ere


long
.
I
believe
at
first
they
think
I
be
a
servant
;
but
in
a
little


while
they
change
their
mind
,
and
hover
in
a
doubtful
state
between


patronage
and
politeness
.




I
keep
up
well
till
I
have
partake
of
some
refreshment
,
warm
myself


by
a
fire
,
and
be
fairly
shut
into
my
own
room
;
but
,
as
I
sit
down
by


the
bed
and
rest
my
head
and
arm
on
the
pillow
,
a
terrible


oppression
overcome
I
.
all
at
once
my
position
rise
on
I
like
a


ghost
.
anomalous
,
desolate
,
almost
blank
of
hope
it
stand

what
be
I


do
here
alone
in
great
London

what
should
I
do
on
the
morrow

what


prospect
have
I
in

Whence

come

Whither

I
wet
the
pillow
,
my
arm
,

my
hair

with
rush
tear
.
a
dark


interval
of
most
bitter
thought
follow
this
burst
;
but
I
do
not


regret
the
step
take
,
nor
wish
to
retract
it
.
a
strong
,
vague


persuasion
that
it
be
well
to
go
forward
than
backward
,
and
that
I


_
could
_
go
forward

a
way

narrow
and
difficult

in


time
open

predominate
over
other
feeling

its
influence
hush
they


so
far
,

at
last
I
become
sufficiently
tranquil
to
be
able
to
say


my
prayer
and
seek
my
couch
.
I
have
just
extinguish
my
candle
and


lain
down

when
a
deep
,
low
,
mighty
tone
swing
through
the
night

at


first

know
it
not

it
be
utter
twelve
time
,
and
at
the


twelfth
colossal
hum
and
tremble
knell

the

be
the
first
of
March
,

when
I
awake
,

,

my
curtain

I
see

struggle

a
sudden
feeling

who
never
yet
truly
live
,
be
at
last


about
to
taste

in
that
morning
my
soul
grow
as
fast
as

would
pass
his

I
go
down
;
not

exhausted
,

tidy
and


refresh
.
when
the
waiter
come
in
with
my
breakfast
,
I
manage
to


accost
he
sedately
,
yet
cheerfully
;
we
have
ten
minute
'
discourse
,
in


the
course
of
which
we
become
usefully
known
to
each
other
.




he
be
a
grey
-
haired
,
elderly
man
;
and
,
it
seem
,
have
live
in
his


present
place
twenty
year
.
having
ascertain
this
,
I
be
sure
he
must


remember
my
two
uncle
,
Charles
and
Wilmot
,
who
,
fifteen
,
year
ago
,


be
frequent
visitor
here

I
mention
their
name
;
he
recall
they


perfectly
,
and
with
respect
.
having
intimate
my
connection
,
my


position
in
his
eye
be
henceforth
clear
,
and
on
a
right
footing
.
he


say
I
be
like
my
uncle
Charles
:
I
suppose
he
speak
truth
,
because


Mrs.
Barrett
be
accustomed
to
say
the
same
thing
.
a
ready
and
obliging


courtesy
now
replace
his
former
uncomfortably
doubtful
manner
;


henceforth
I
need
no
long
be
at
a
loss
for
a
civil
answer
to
a


sensible
question
.




the
street
on
which
my
little
sitting
-
room
window
look
be
narrow
,


perfectly
quiet
,
and
not
dirty
:
the
few
passenger
be
just
such
as


one
see
in
provincial
town
:
here
be
nothing
formidable
;
I
feel
sure


I
might
venture
out
alone
.




having
breakfast
,
out
I
go
.
elation
and
pleasure
be
in
my
heart
:


to
walk
alone
in
London
seem
of
itself
an
adventure
.
presently
I


find
myself
in
Paternoster
Row
--
classic
ground
this
.
I
enter
a


bookseller
's
shop
,
keep
by
one
Jones
:
I
buy
a
little
book
--
a
piece


of
extravagance
I
could
ill
afford
;
but
I
think
I
would
one
day
give


or
send
it
to
Mrs.
Barrett
.
Mr.
Jones
,
a
dry
-
in
man
of
business
,


stand
behind
his
desk
:
he
seem
one
of
the
great
,
and
I
one
of
the


happy
of
being
.




Prodigious
be
the
amount
of
life
I
live
that
morning
.
find
myself


before
St.
Paul
's
,
I
go
in
;
I
mount
to
the
dome
:
I
see
thence


London
,
with
its
river
,
and
its
bridge
,
and
its
church
;
I
see


antique
Westminster
,
and
the
green
Temple
Gardens
,
with
sun
upon
they
,


and
a
glad
,
blue
sky
,
of
early
spring
above
;
and
between
they
and
it
,


not
too
dense
,
a
cloud
of
haze
.




descend
,
I
go
wander
whither
chance
might
lead
,
in
a
still


ecstasy
of
freedom
and
enjoyment
;
and
I
get
--
I
know
not
how
--
I
get
into


the
heart
of
city
life
.
I
see
and
feel
London
at
last
:
I
get
into
the


Strand
;
I
go
up
Cornhill
;
I
mix
with
the
life
pass
along
;
I


dare
the
peril
of
crossing
.
to
do
this
,
and
to
do
it
utterly
alone
,


give
I
,
perhaps
an
irrational
,
but
a
real
pleasure
.
since
those
day
,


I
have
see
the
West
End
,
the
park
,
the
fine
square
;
but
I
love
the


city
far
well
.
the
city
seem
so
much
more
in
earnest
:
its
business
,


its
rush
,
its
roar
,
be
such
serious
thing
,
sight
,
and
sound
.
the


city
be
get
its
living
--
the
West
End
but
enjoy
its
pleasure
.
at


the
West
end
you
may
be
amuse
,
but
in
the
city
you
be
deeply
excited
.




Faint
,
at
last
,
and
hungry
(
it
be
year
since
I
have
feel
such
healthy


hunger
)
,
I
return
,
about
two
o'clock
,
to
my
dark
,
old
,
and
quiet
inn
.


I
dine
on
two
dish
--
a
plain
joint
and
vegetable
;
both
seem


excellent
:
how
much
well
than
the
small
,
dainty
mess
Miss


Marchmont
's
cook
use
to
send
up
to
my
kind
,
dead
mistress
and
I
,
and


to
the
discussion
of
which
we
could
not
bring
half
an
appetite
between


we
!
delightfully
tired
,
I
lie
down
,
on
three
chair
for
an
hour
(
the


room
do
not
boast
a
sofa
)
.
I
sleep
,
then
I
wake
and
think
for
two


hour
.




my
state
of
mind
,
and
all
accompany
circumstance
,
be
just
now


such
as
most
to
favour
the
adoption
of
a
new
,
resolute
,
and

--
perhaps
desperate
--
line
of

.
I
have
nothing
to
lose
.


unutterable
loathing
of
a
desolate
existence
past
,
forbade
return
.
if
I


fail
in
what
I
now
design
to
undertake
,
who
,
save
myself
,
would


suffer
?
if
I
die
far
away
from
--
home
,
I
be
go
to
say
,
but
I
have
no


home
--
from
England
,
then
,
who
would
weep
?




I
might
suffer
;
I
be
inure
to
suffer
:
death
itself
have
not

I

,
those
terror
for
I
which
it
have
for
the

.
I


have
,
ere
this
,
look
on
the
thought
of
death
with
a
quiet
eye
.


prepare
,
then
,
for
any
consequence
,
I
form
a
project
.




that
same
evening
I
obtain
from
my
friend
,
the
waiter
,
information


respect
,
the
sailing
of
vessel
for
a
certain
continental
port
,


Boue
-
Marine
.
no
time
,
I
find
,
be
to
be
lose
:
that
very
night
I
must


take
my
berth
.
I
might
,
indeed
,
have
wait
till
the
morning
before


go
on
board
,
but
would
not
run
the
risk
of
be
too
late
.




"
well
take
your
berth
at
once
,
ma'am
,
"
counsel
the
waiter
.
I


agree
with
he
,
and
having
discharge
my
bill
,
and
acknowledge
my


friend
's
service
at
a
rate
which
I
now
know
be
princely
,
and
which
in


his
eye
must
have
seem
absurd
--
and
indeed
,
while
pocket
the
cash
,


he
smile
a
faint
smile
which
intimate
his
opinion
of
the
donor
's


_
savoir
-
faire_--he
proceed
to
call
a
coach
.
to
the
driver
he
also


recommend
I
,
give
at
the
same
time
an
injunction
about
take
I
,


I
think
,
to
the
wharf
,
and
not
leave
I
to
the
waterman
;
which
that


functionary
promise
to
observe
,
but
fail
in
keep
his
promise
:
on


the
contrary
,
he
offer
I
up
as
an
oblation
,
serve
I
as
a
dripping


roast
,
make
I
alight
in
the
midst
of
a
throng
of
waterman
.




this
be
an
uncomfortable
crisis
.
it
be
a
dark
night
.
the
coachman


instantly
drive
off
as
soon
as
he
have
get
his
fare
:
the
waterman


commence
a
struggle
for
I
and
my
trunk
.
their
oath
I
hear
at
this


moment
:
they
shake
my
philosophy
more
than
do
the
night
,
or
the


isolation
,
or
the
strangeness
of
the
scene
.
one
lay
hand
on
my
trunk
.


I
look
on
and
wait
quietly
;
but
when
another
lay
hand
on
I
,
I


speak
up
,
shake
off
his
touch
,
step
at
once
into
a
boat
,
desire


austerely
that
the
trunk
should
be
place
beside
me--"just


there,"--which
be
instantly
do
;
for
the
owner
of
the
boat
I
have


choose
become
now
an
ally

talk
all

not
to

to
the
young

her
son

her
very
picture
.
he
pass
in

out
of

quarrel

make
it
up
again


twenty
time
in
the
course
of
the
night
.
she
profess
to
be
write
a


letter
home

she

to
her

she
read
passage

aloud

I
no
more
than
a

perhaps
she
believe
I
asleep
.


several
of
these
passage
appear
to
comprise
family
secret
,

bore


special
reference
to
one
"
Charlotte
,
"
a
young
sister
who
,
from
the


bearing
of
the
epistle
,
seem
to
be
on
the
brink
of
perpetrate
a


romantic
and
imprudent
match
;
loud
be
the
protest
of
this
elder

the
distasteful
union

dutiful

his
mother

correspondence
to
scorn

she
defend
it
,
and
rave
at
he
.
they
be
a


strange
pair
.
she
might
be
thirty
-
nine
or
forty
,
and
be
buxom
and


bloom
as
a
girl
of
twenty
.
hard
,
loud
,
vain
and
vulgar
,
her
mind
and


body
alike
seem
brazen
and
imperishable
.
I
should
think
,
from
she


childhood
,
she
must
have
live
in
public
station
;
and
in
her
youth


might
very
likely
have
be
a
barmaid
.




towards
morning
her
discourse
run
on
a
new
theme
:
"
the
Watsons
,
"
a


certain
expect
family
-
party
of
passenger
,
know
to
she
,
it
appear
,


and
by
she
much
esteemed
on
account
of
the
handsome
profit
realize
in


their
fee
.
she
say
,
"
it
be
as
good
as
a
little
fortune
to
she


whenever
this
family
cross
.
"




at
dawn
all
be
astir
,
and
by
sunrise
the
passenger
come
on
board
.


Boisterous
be
the
welcome
give
by
the
stewardess
to
the
"
Watsons
,
"


and
great
be
the
bustle
make
in
their
honour
.
they
be
four
in


number
,
two
male
and
two
female
.
besides
they
,
there
be
but
one


other
passenger
--
a
young
lady
,
whom
a
gentlemanly
,
though


languid
-
look
man
escort
.
the
two
group
offer
a
marked
contrast
.


the
Watsons
be
doubtless
rich
people
,
for
they
have
the
confidence
of


conscious
wealth
in
their
bearing
;
the
woman
--
youthful
both
of
they
,


and
one
perfectly
handsome
,
as
far
as
physical
beauty
go
--
be


dress
richly
,
gaily
,
and
absurdly
out
of
character
for
the


circumstance
.
their
bonnet
with
bright
flower
,
their
velvet
cloak


and
silk
dress
,
seem
well
suited
for
park
or
promenade
than
for
a


damp
packet
deck
.
the
man
be
of
low
stature
,
plain
,
fat
,
and
vulgar
;


the
old
,
plain
,
greasiest
,
broad
,
I
soon
find
be
the


husband
--
the
bridegroom
I
suppose
,
for
she
be
very
young
--
of
the


beautiful
girl
.
deep
be
my
amazement
at
this
discovery
;
and
deep


still
when
I
perceive
that
,
instead
of
be
desperately
wretched
in


such
a
union
,
she
be
gay
even
to
giddiness
.
"
her
laughter
,
"
I


reflect
,
"
must
be
the
mere
frenzy
of
despair
.
"
and
even
while
this


thought
be
cross
my
mind
,
as
I
stand
lean
quiet
and
solitary


against
the
ship
's
side
,
she
came
trip
up
to
I
,
an
utter
stranger
,


with
a
camp
-
stool
in
her
hand
,
and
smile
a
smile
of
which
the
levity


puzzle
and
startle
I
,
though
it
show
a
perfect
set
of
perfect


tooth
,
she
offer
I
the
accommodation
of
this
piece
of
furniture
.
I


decline
it
of
course
,
with
all
the
courtesy
I
could
put
into
my


manner
;
she
dance
off
heedless
and
lightsome
.
she
must
have
be


good
-
natured
;
but
what
have
make
she
marry
that
individual
,
who
be
at


least
as
much
like
an
oil
-
barrel
as
a
man
?




the
other
lady
passenger
,
with
the
gentleman
-
companion
,
be
quite
a


girl
,
pretty
and
fair
:
her
simple
print
dress
,
untrimmed
straw
-
bonnet


and
large
shawl
,
gracefully
wear
,
form
a
costume
plain
to
quakerism
:


yet
,
for
she
,
become
enough
.
before
the
gentleman
quit
she
,
I


observe
he
throw
a
glance
of
scrutiny
over
all
the
passenger
,
as


if
to
ascertain
in
what
company
his
charge
would
be
leave
.
with
a
most


dissatisfied
air
do
his
eye
turn
from
the
lady
with
the
gay
flower
;


he
look
at
I
,
and
then
he
speak
to
his
daughter
,
niece
,
or
whatever


she
be
:
she
also
glance
in
my
direction
,
and
slightly
curl
she


short
,
pretty
lip
.
it
might
be
myself
,
or
it
might
be
my
homely


mourning
habit
,
that
elicit
this
mark
of
contempt
;
more
likely
,
both

I
notice

's
light

careless
temperament
,
and
fair
,
fragile
style
of


beauty
,
an
entire
incapacity
to
endure
:
they
seem
to
sour
in
adversity
,


like
small
beer
in
thunder
.
the
man
who
take
such
a
woman
for
his


wife
,
ought
to
be
prepared
to
guarantee
she
an
existence
all

indignant
at

with
her
teasing
peevishness

I
curtly
request
she


"
to
hold
her
tongue

the
rebuff

strong


against
the

it
be
strange
to
reflect
that
blackness
and


water
be
round

,
and
to
feel
the
ship
plough
straight
on

awake

I
finish
dress
,
a

come
to
the
door
:
I
say
,
"

expect
the
chambermaid

a

man
walk

he
impatiently
;
and
as

half

he
add
,

fortunately
it
do
turn
out
all
right
:
he
be
from
the
custom
-
house
.


where
to
go
to
get
some
breakfast
I
could
not
tell
;
but
I
proceed
,


not
without
hesitation
,
to
descend
.




I
now
observe
,
what
I
have
not
notice
in
my
extreme
weariness
last


night
,
viz
.
that
this
inn
be
,
in
fact
,
a
large
hotel
;
and
as
I
slowly


descend
the
broad
staircase
,
halt
on
each
step
(
for
I
be
in


wonderfully
little
haste
to
get
down
)
,
I
gaze
at
the
high
ceiling


above
I
,
at
the
paint
wall
around
,
at
the
wide
window
which
fill


the
house
with
light
,
at
the
vein
marble
I
trod
(
for
the
step
be


all
of
marble
,
though
uncarpeted
and
not
very
clean
)
,
and
contrast


all
this
with
the
dimension
of
the
closet
assign
to
I
as
a
chamber
,


with
the
extreme
modesty
of
its
appointment
,
I
fall
into
a


philosophize
mood
.




much
I
marvel
at
the
sagacity
evince
by
waiter
and
chamber
-
maid


in
proportion
the
accommodation
to
the
guest
.
how
could
inn
-
servant


and
ship
-
stewardess
everywhere
tell
at
a
glance
that
I
,
for
instance
,


be
an
individual
of
no
social
significance
,
and
little
burden
by


cash
?
they
_
do
_
know
it
evidently
:
I
see
quite
well
that
they
all
,
in


a
moment
's
calculation
,
estimate
I
at
about
the
same
fractional


value
.
the
fact
seem
to
I
curious
and
pregnant
:
I
would
not
disguise


from
myself
what
it
indicate
,
yet
manage
to
keep
up
my
spirit
pretty


well
under
its
pressure
.




having
at
last
land
in
a
great
hall
,
full
of
skylight
glare
,
I
make


my
way
somehow
to
what
prove
to
be
the
coffee
-
room
.
it
can
not
be


deny
that
on
enter
this
room
I
tremble
somewhat
;
feel
uncertain
,


solitary
,
wretched
;
wish
to
Heaven
I
know
whether
I
be
do
right


or
wrong
;
feel
convinced
that
it
be
the
last
,
but
could
not
help


myself
.
act
in
the
spirit
and
with
the
calm
of
a
fatalist
,
I
sit


down
at
a
small
table
,
to
which
a
waiter
presently
bring
I
some


breakfast
;
and
I
partook
of
that
meal
in
a
frame
of
mind
not
greatly


calculate
to
favour
digestion
.
there
be
many
other
people


breakfast
at
other
table
in
the
room
;
I
should
have
feel
rather


more
happy
if
amongst
they
all
I
could
have
see
any
woman
;
however
,


there
be
not
one
--
all
present
be
man
.
but
nobody
seem
to
think
I


be
do
anything
strange
;
one
or
two
gentleman
glance
at
I


occasionally
,
but
none
stare
obtrusively
:
I
suppose
if
there
be


anything
eccentric
in
the
business
,
they
account
for
it
by
this
word


"
anglaise
!
"




breakfast
over
,
I
must
again
move
--
in
what
direction
?
"
go
to
Villette
,
"


say
an
inward
voice
;
prompt
doubtless
by
the
recollection
of
this


slight
sentence
utter
carelessly
and
at
random
by
Miss
Fanshawe
,
as


she
bid
I
good
-
by
:
"
I
wish
you
would
come
to
Madame
Beck

;
she
have


some
marmot
whom
you
might
look
after
;
she
want
an
English


gouvernante
,
or

one
two

"




who
Madame
Beck

,
where
she
live
,
I
know
not
;
I
have
ask
,
but
the


question
pass
unheard
:
Miss
Fanshawe
,
hurry
away
by
her
friend
,


leave
it
unanswered
.
I
presume
Villette
to
be
her
residence
--
to


Villette
I
would
go
.
the
distance
be
forty
mile
.
I
know
I
be


catch
at
straw
;
but
in
the
wide
and
welter
deep
where
I
find


myself
,
I
would
have
catch
at
cobwebs
.
having
inquire
about
the
mean


of
travel
to
Villette
,
and
secure
a
seat
in
the
diligence
,
I


depart
on
the
strength
of
this
outline
--
this
shadow
of
a
project
.


before
you
pronounce
on
the
rashness
of
the
proceeding
,
reader
,
look


back
to
the
point
whence
I
start
;
consider
the
desert
I
have
leave
,


note
how
little
I
perille
:
mine
be
the
game
where
the
player
can
not


lose
and
may
win
.




of
an
artistic
temperament
,
I
deny
that
I
be
;
yet
I
must
possess


something
of
the
artist
's
faculty
of
make
the
most
of
present


pleasure
:
that
be
to
say
,
when
it
be
of
the
kind
to
my
taste
.
I
enjoy


that
day
,
though
we
travel
slowly
,
though
it
be
cold
,
though
it


rain
.
somewhat
bare
,
flat
,
and
treeless
be
the
route
along
which
our


journey
lie
;
and
slimy
canal
crept
,
like
half
-
torpid
green
snake
,


beside
the
road
;
and
formal
pollard
willow
edge
level
field
,
till


like
kitchen
-
garden
bed
.
the
sky
,
too
,
be
monotonously
gray
;
the


atmosphere
be
stagnant
and
humid
;
yet
amidst
all
these
deadening


influence
,
my
fancy
bud
fresh
and
my
heart
bask
in
sunshine
.


these
feeling
,
however
,
be
well
keep
in
check
by
the
secret
but


ceaseless
consciousness
of
anxiety
lie
in
wait
on
enjoyment
,
like
a


tiger
crouch
in
a
jungle
.
the
breathing
of
that
beast
of
prey
be
in


my
ear
always
;
his
fierce
heart
pant
close
against
mine
;
he
never


stir
in
his
lair
but
I
feel
he
:
I
know
he
wait
only
for
sun
-
down


to
bind
ravenous
from
his
ambush
.




I
have
hope
we
might
reach
Villette
ere
night
set
in
,
and
that
thus
I


might
escape
the
deep
embarrassment
which
obscurity
seem
to
throw


round
a
first
arrival
at
an
unknown
bourne
;
but
,
what
with
our
slow


progress
and
long
stoppage
--
what
with
a
thick
fog
and
small
,
dense


rain
--
darkness
,
that
might
almost
be
feel
,
have
settle
on
the
city
by


the
time
we
gain
its
suburb
.




I
know
we
pass
through
a
gate
where
soldier
be
station
--
so
much


I
could
see
by
lamplight
;
then
,
having
leave
behind
we
the
miry


Chaussee
,
we
rattle
over
a
pavement
of
strangely
rough
and
flinty


surface
.
at
a
bureau
,
the
diligence
stop
,
and
the
passenger


alight
.
my
first
business
be
to
get
my
trunk
;
a
small
matter
enough
,


but
important
to
I
.
understand
that
it
be
good
not

the

I
could
not

I
pass
a

with
insolence

I
walk

keep
pace

hunter

drive
I


beyond

,

further
prelude
,
we
fall


to
a
most
remarkable
conversation
.
Madame

(
for
Madame

she
have

shod
with


the
shoe
of
silence
,
I
have
hear
neither
her
entrance
nor


approach)--madame
Beck
have
exhaust
her
command
of
insular
speech
when


she
say
,
"

she
now

I
answer
in
mine

she
partly
understand


I
,

as
I
do
not
at
all
understand
she
--
though
we
make
together
an


awful
clamour
(
anything
like
Madame
's
gift
of
utterance
I
have
not


hitherto
hear
or
imagined)--we
achieve
little
progress
.
she
ring
,
ere


long
,
for
aid
;
which
arrive
in
the
shape
of
a
"
maitresse
,
"
who
have


be
partly
educate
in
an
irish
convent
,
and
be
esteem
a
perfect


adept
in
the
english
language
.
a
bluff
little
personage
this
maitresse


be
--
Labassecourienne
from
top
to
toe
:
and
how
she
do
slaughter
the


speech
of
Albion
!
however
,
I
tell
she
a
plain
tale
,
which
she


translate
.
I
tell
she
how
I
have
leave
my
own
country
,
intent
on


extend
my
knowledge
,
and
gain
my
bread
;
how
I
be
ready
to
turn


my
hand
to
any
useful
thing
,
provide
it
be
not
wrong

how
I
would
be
a

a
shade
of
compassion

cross
her
countenance

no

altogether
surprising

unexpected

surprise

ruffle
the
equality
of
her
grave
aspect

not

serenely
pointing
to
a
fourth
bed

intimate
that

then
,
having

the

it
a

look
at
my
hand


lie
on
the
bedclothe
.
this
do
,
she
turn
to
the
chair
where
my


clothe
lay
:
it
be
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
.
hear
her
touch
and
lift


they
,
I
open
my
eye
with
precaution
,
for
I
own
I
feel
curious
to
see


how
far
her
taste
for
research
would
lead
she
.
it
lead
she
a
good
way
:


every
article
do
she
inspect
.
I
divine
her
motive
for
this


proceeding
,
viz
.
the
wish
to
form
from
the
garment
a
judgment


respect
the
wearer
,
her
station
,
mean
,
neatness
,
&
c.
the
end
be


not
bad
,
but
the
mean
be
hardly
fair
or
justifiable
.
in
my
dress
be


a
pocket
;
she
fairly
turn
it
inside
out
:
she
count
the
money
in
my


purse
;
she
open
a
little
memorandum
-
book
,
coolly
peruse
its


content
,
and
take
from
between
the
leave
a
small
plait
lock
of
Miss


Marchmont
's
grey
hair
.
to
a
bunch
of
three
key
,
be
those
of
my


trunk
,
desk
,
and
work
-
box
,
she
accord
special
attention
:
with
these
,


indeed
,
she
withdraw
a
moment
to
her
own
room
.
I
softly
rise
in
my
bed


and
follow
she
with
my
eye
:
these
key
,
reader
,
be
not
bring
back


till
they
have
leave
on
the
toilet
of
the
adjoining
room
the
impress
of


their
ward
in
wax
.
all
be
thus
do
decently
and
in
order
,
my


property
be
return
to
its
place
,
my
clothe
be
carefully
refolde
.


of
what
nature
be
the
conclusion
deduce
from
this
scrutiny
?
be


they
favourable
or
otherwise
?
vain
question
.
Madame
's
face
of
stone


(
for
of
stone
in
its
present
night
aspect
it
look
:
it
have
be
human
,


and
,
as
I
say
before
,
motherly
,
in
the
salon
)
betray
no
response
.




her
duty
do
--
I
feel
that
in
her
eye
this
business
be
a
duty
--
she


rise
,
noiseless
as
a
shadow
:
she
move
towards
her
own
chamber
;
at
the


door
,
she
turn
,
fix
her
eye
on
the
heroine
of
the
bottle
,
who


still
sleep
and
loudly
snore
.
Mrs.
Svini
(
I
presume
this
be
Mrs.


Svini
,
Anglice
or
Hibernice
,
Sweeny)--Mrs
.
Sweeny
's
doom
be
in
Madame


Beck
's
eye
--
an
immutable
purpose
that
eye
speak
:
Madame
's
visitation


for
shortcoming
might
be
slow
,
but
they
be
sure
.
all
this
be
very


un
-
english
:
truly
I
be
in
a
foreign
land
.




the
morrow
make
I
far
acquaint
with
Mrs.
Sweeny
.
it
seem
she


have
introduce
herself
to
her
present
employer
as
an
English
lady
in


reduce
circumstance
:
a
native
,
indeed
,
of
Middlesex
,
profess
to


speak
the
english
tongue
with
the
pure
metropolitan
accent
.


Madame
--
reliant
on
her
own
infallible
expedient
for
find
out
the


truth
in
time
--
have
a
singular
intrepidity
in
hire
service
off
-
hand


(
as
indeed
seem
abundantly
prove
in
my
own
case
)
.
she
receive
Mrs.


Sweeny
as
nursery
-
governess
to
her
three
child
.
I
need
hardly


explain
to
the
reader
that
this
lady
be
in
effect
a
native
of
Ireland
;


her
station
I
do
not
pretend
to
fix
:
she
boldly
declare
that
she
have


"
have
the
bringing
-
up
of
the
son
and
daughter
of
a
marquis
.
"
I
think


myself
,
she
might
possibly
have
be
a
hanger
-
on
,
nurse
,
fosterer
,
or


washerwoman
,
in
some
irish
family
:
she
speak
a
smothered
tongue
,


curiously
overlaid
with
mince
cockney
inflection
.
by
some
mean
or


other
she
have
acquire
,
and
now
hold
in
possession
,
a
wardrobe
of


rather
suspicious
splendour
--
gown
of
stiff
and
costly
silk
,
fitting


she
indifferently
,
and
apparently
make
for
other
proportion
than
those


they
now
adorn
;
cap
with
real
lace
border
,
and
--
the
chief
item
in


the
inventory
,
the
spell
by
which
she
strike
a
certain
awe
through
the


household
,
quell
the
otherwise
scornfully
disposed
teacher
and


servant
,
and
,
so
long
as
her
broad
shoulder
_
wear
_
the
fold
of
that


majestic
drapery
,
even
influence
Madame
herself--_a
real
indian


shawl_--"un
veritable
cachemire
,
"
as
Madame
Beck
say
,
with
unmixed


reverence
and
amaze
.
I
feel
quite
sure
that
without
this
"
cachemire
"


she
would
not
have
keep
she
footing
in
the
pensionnat
for
two
day
:
by


virtue
of
it
,
and
it
only
,
she
maintain
the
same
a
month
.




but
when
Mrs.
Sweeny
know
that
I
be
come
to
fill
her
shoe
,
then
it


be
that
she
declare
herself
--
then
do
she
rise
on
Madame
Beck
in
she


full
power
--
then
come
down
on
I
with
her
concentrated
weight
.
Madame


bear
this
revelation
and
visitation
so
well
,
so
stoically
,
that
I
for


very
shame
could
not
support
it
otherwise
than
with
composure
.
for
one


little
moment
Madame
Beck
absent
herself
from
the
room
;
ten
minute


after
,
an
agent
of
the
police
stand
in
the
midst
of
we
.
Mrs.
Sweeny
and


her
effect
be
remove
.
Madame
's
brow
have
not
be
ruffle
during
the


scene
--
her
lip
have
not
drop
one
sharply
-
accent
word
.




this
brisk
little
affair
of
the
dismissal
be
all
settle
before


breakfast
:
order
to
march
give
,
policeman
call
,
mutineer
expel
;


"
chambre
d'enfans
"
fumigate
and
cleanse
,
window
throw
open
,
and


every
trace
of
the
accomplished
Mrs.
Sweeny
--
even
to
the
fine
essence


and
spiritual
fragrance
which
give
token
so
subtle
and
so
fatal
of
the


head
and
front
of
her
offending
--
be
annihilate
from
the
Rue
Fossette
:


all
this
,
I
say
,
be
do
between
the
moment
of
Madame
Beck
's
issuing


like
Aurora
from
her
chamber
,
and
that
in
which
she
coolly
sit
down
to


pour
out
her
first
cup
of
coffee
.




about
noon
,
I
be
summon
to
dress
Madame
.
(
it
appear
my
place
be


to
be
a
hybrid
between
gouvernante
and
lady's
-
maid
.
)
till
noon
,
she


haunt
the
house
in
her
wrapping
-
gown
,
shawl
,
and
soundless
slipper
.


how
would
the
lady
-
chief
of
an
english
school
approve
this
custom
?




the
dressing
of
her
hair
puzzle
I
;
she
have
plenty
of
it
:
auburn
,


unmixe
with
grey
:
though
she
be
forty
year
old
.
see
my


embarrassment
,
she
say
,
"
you
have
not
be
a
femme
-
de
-
chambre
in
your


own
country
?
"
and
take
the
brush
from
my
hand
,
and
set
I
aside
,


not
ungently
or
disrespectfully
,
she
arrange
it
herself
.
in
perform


other
office
of
the
toilet
,
she
half
-
direct
,
half
-
aid
I
,
without


the
least
display
of
temper
or
impatience
.
n.b.--that
be
the
first
and


last
time
I
be
require
to
dress
she
.
henceforth
,
on
Rosine
,
the


portress
,
devolve
that
duty
.




when
attire
,
Madame
Beck
appear
a
personage
of
a
figure
rather
short


and
stout
,
yet
still
graceful
in
its
own
peculiar
way
;
that
is
,
with


the
grace
result
from
proportion
of
part
.
her
complexion
be
fresh


and
sanguine
,
not
too
rubicund
;
her
eye
,
blue
and
serene
;
her
dark
silk


dress
fit
she
as
a
french
sempstress
alone
can
make
a
dress
fit
;
she


look
well
,
though
a
little
bourgeoise
;
as
bourgeoise
,
indeed
,
she


be
.
I
know
not
what
of
harmony
pervade
her
whole
person
;
and
yet
she


face
offer
contrast
,
too
:
its
feature
be
by
no
means
such
as
be


usually
see
in
conjunction
with
a
complexion
of
such
blended
freshness


and
repose
:
their
outline
be
stern
:
her
forehead
be
high
but
narrow
;


it
express
capacity
and
some
benevolence
,
but
no
expanse
;
nor
do
she


peaceful
yet
watchful
eye
ever
know
the
fire
which
be
kindle
in
the


heart
or
the
softness
which
flow
thence
.
her
mouth
be
hard
:
it
could


be
a
little
grim
;
her
lip
be
thin
.
for
sensibility
and
genius
,
with


all
their
tenderness
and
temerity
,
I
feel
somehow
that
Madame
would
be


the
right
sort
of
Minos
in
petticoat
.




in
the
long
run
,
I
find
she
be
something
else
in
petticoat
too
.
she


name
be
Modeste
Maria
Beck
,
nee
kint
:
it
ought
to
have
be
Ignacia
.


she
be
a
charitable
woman
,
and
do
a
great
deal
of
good
.
there
never


be
a
mistress
whose
rule
be
milder
.
I
be
tell
that
she
never
once


remonstrate
with
the
intolerable
Mrs.
Sweeny
,
despite
her
tipsiness
,


disorder
,
and
general
neglect
;
yet
Mrs.
Sweeny
have
to
go
the
moment
she


departure
become
convenient
.
I
be
tell
,
too
,
that
neither
master
nor


teacher
be
find
fault
with
in
that
establishment
;
yet
both
master


and
teacher
be
often
change
:
they
vanish
and
other
fill
their


place
,
none
could
well
explain
how
.




the
establishment
be
both
a
pensionnat
and
an
externat
:
the
externe


or
day
-
pupil
exceed
one
hundred
in
number
;
the
boarder
be
about
a


score
.
Madame
must
have
possess
high
administrative
power
:
she
rule


all
these
,
together
with
four
teacher
,
eight
master
,
six
servant
,


and
three
child
,
manage
at
the
same
time
to
perfection
the
pupil
'


parent
and
friend
;
and
that
without
apparent
effort
;
without
bustle
,


fatigue
,
fever
,
or
any
symptom
of
undue
,
excitement
:
occupy
she


always
be
--
busy
,
rarely
.
it
be
true
that
Madame
have
her
own
system
for


manage
and
regulate
this
mass
of
machinery
;
and
a
very
pretty


system
it
be
:
the
reader
have
see
a
speciman
of
it
,
in
that
small


affair
of
turn
my
pocket
inside
out
,
and
read
my
private


memoranda
.
"
surveillance
,
"
"
espionage,"--these
be
her
watchword
.




still
,
Madame
know
what
honesty
be
,
and
like
it
--
that
is
,
when
it
do


not
obtrude
its
clumsy
scruple
in
the
way
of
her
will
and
interest
.


she
have
a
respect
for
"
Angleterre
;
"
and
as
to
"
les
anglaise
,
"
she


would
have
the
woman
of
no
other
country
about
her
own
child
,
if
she


could
help
it
.




often
in
the
evening
,
after
she
have
be
plot
and
counter
-
plot
,


spy
and
receive
the
report
of
spy
all
day
,
she
would
come
up
to


my
room
--
a
trace
of
real
weariness
on
her
brow
--
and
she
would
sit
down


and
listen
while
the
child
say
their
little
prayer
to
I
in


English
:
the
Lord
's
Prayer
,
and
the
hymn
begin
"
Gentle
Jesus
,
"


these
little
Catholics
be
permit
to
repeat
at
my
knee
;
and
,
when
I


have
put
they
to
bed
,
she
would
talk
to
I
(
I
soon
gain
enough

)
about
England
and


Englishwomen
,
and
the
reason
for
what
she
be
pleased
to
term
their


superior
intelligence
,
and
more
real
and
reliable
probity
.
very
good


sense
she
often
show
;
very
sound
opinion
she
often
broach
:
she


seem
to
know
that
keep
girl
in
distrustful
restraint
,
in
blind


ignorance
,
and
under
a
surveillance
that
leave
they
no
moment
and
no


corner
for
retirement
,
be
not
the
good
way
to
make
they
grow
up
honest


and
modest
woman
;
but
she
aver
that
ruinous
consequence
would
ensue


if
any
other
method
be
try
with
continental
child
:
they
be
so


accustomed
to
restraint
,
that
relaxation
,
however
guard
,
would
be


misunderstood
and
fatally
presume
on
.
she
be
sick
,
she
would
declare
,


of
the
mean
she
have
to
use
,
but
use
they
she
must
;
and
after


discourse
,
often
with
dignity
and
delicacy
,
to
I
,
she
would
move


away
on
her
"
soulier
de
silence
,
"
and
glide
ghost
-
like
through
the


house
,
watch
and
spy
everywhere
,
peer
through
every
keyhole
,


listen
behind
every
door
.




after
all
,
Madame
's
system
be
not
bad
--
let
I
do
her
justice
.
nothing


could
be
well
than
all
her
arrangement
for
the
physical
well
-
being


of
her
scholar
.
no
mind
be
overtaske
:
the
lesson
be
well


distribute
and
make
incomparably
easy
to
the
learner
;
there
be
a


liberty
of
amusement
,
and
a
provision
for
exercise
which
keep
the
girl


healthy
;
the
food
be
abundant
and
good
:
neither
pale
nor
puny
face


be
anywhere
to
be
see
in
the
Rue
Fossette
.
she
never
grudge
a


holiday
;
she
allow
plenty
of
time
for
sleeping
,
dress
,
washing
,


eat
;
her
method
in
all
these
matter
be
easy
,
liberal
,
salutary
,


and
rational
:
many
an
austere
english
school
-
mistress
would
do
vastly


well
to
imitate
she
--
and
I
believe
many
would
be
glad
to
do
so
,
if


exact
english
parent
would
let
they
.




as
Madame
Beck
rule
by
espionage
,
she
of
course
have
her
staff
of


spy
:
she
perfectly
know
the
quality
of
the
tool
she
use
,
and
while


she
would
not
scruple
to
handle
the
dirty
for
a
dirty


occasion
--
fling
this
sort
from
she
like
refuse
rind
,
after
the


orange
have
be
duly
squeeze
--
I
have
know
she
fastidious
in
seek


pure
metal
for
clean
use
;
and
when
once
a
bloodless
and
rustless


instrument
be
find
,
she
be
careful
of
the
prize
,
keep
it
in
silk


and
cotton
-
wool
.
yet
,
woe
be
to
that
man
or
woman
who
rely
on
her
one


inch
beyond
the
point
where
it
be
her
interest
to
be
trustworthy
:


interest
be
the
master
-
key
of
Madame
's
nature
--
the
mainspring
of
she


motive
--
the
alpha
and
omega
of
her
life
.
I
have
see
she
_
feeling
_


appeal
to
,
and
I
have
smile
in
half
-
pity
,
half
-
scorn
at
the


appellant
.
none
ever
gain
her
ear
through
that
channel
,
or
sway


her
purpose
by
that
mean
.
on
the
contrary
,
to
attempt
to
touch
she


heart
be
the
sure
way
to
rouse
she
antipathy
,
and
to
make
of
she
a


secret
foe
.
it
prove
to
she
that
she
have
no
heart
to
be
touch
:
it


remind
she
where
she
be
impotent
and
dead
.
never
be
the
distinction


between
charity
and
mercy
well
exemplify
than
in
she
.
while
devoid


of
sympathy
,
she
have
a
sufficiency
of
rational
benevolence
:
she
would


give
in
the
ready
manner
to
people
she
have
never
see
--
rather
,


however
,
to
class
than
to
individual
.
"
pour
les
pauvre
,
"
she
open


her
purse
freely
--
against
_
the
poor
man
_
,
as
a
rule
,
she
keep
it


close
.
in
philanthropic
scheme
for
the
benefit
of
society
at
large


she
take
a
cheerful
part
;
no
private
sorrow
touch
she
:
no
force
or


mass
of
suffer
concentrate
in
one
heart
have
power
to
pierce
hers
.


not
the
agony
in
Gethsemane
,
not
the
death
on
Calvary
,
could
have
wring


from
her
eye
one
tear
.




I
say
again
,
Madame
be
a
very
great
and
a
very
capable
woman
.
that


school
offer
she
for
her
power
too
limited
a
sphere
;
she
ought
to


have
sway
a
nation
:
she
should
have
be
the
leader
of
a
turbulent


legislative
assembly
.
nobody
could
have
browbeaten
she
,
none
irritate


her
nerve
,
exhaust
her
patience
,
or
over
-
reach
her
astuteness
.
in


her
own
single
person
,
she
could
have
comprise
the
duty
of
a
first


minister
and
a
superintendent
of
police
.
wise
,
firm
,
faithless
;
secret
,


crafty
,
passionless
;
watchful
and
inscrutable
;
acute
and


insensate
--
withal
perfectly
decorous
--
what
more
could
be
desire
?




the
sensible
reader
will
not
suppose
that
I
gain
all
the
knowledge


here
condense
for
his
benefit
in
one
month
,
or
in
one
half
-
year
.
no
!


what
I
see
at
first
be
the
thrive
outside
of
a
large
and
flourish


educational
establishment
.
here
be
a
great
house
,
full
of
healthy
,


lively
girl
,
all
well
-
dress
and
many
of
they
handsome
,
gain


knowledge
by
a
marvellously
easy
method
,
without
painful
exertion
or


useless
waste
of
spirit
;
not
,
perhaps
,
make
very
rapid
progress
in


anything
;
take
it
easy
,
but
still
always
employ
,
and
never


oppress
.
here
be
a
corps
of
teacher
and
master
,
more
stringently


task
,
as
all
the
real
head
-
labour
be
to
be
do
by
they
,
in
order
to


save
the
pupil
,
yet
have
their
duty
so
arrange
that
they
relieve


each
other
in
quick
succession
whenever
the
work
be
severe
:
here
,
in


short
,
be
a
foreign
school
;
of
which
the
life
,
movement
,
and
variety


make
it
a
complete
and
most
charming
contrast
to
many
English


institution
of
the
same
kind
.




behind
the
house
be
a
large
garden
,
and
,
in
summer
,
the
pupil
almost


live
out
of
door
amongst
the
rose
-
bush
and
the
fruit
-
tree
.
under


the
vast
and
vine
-
drape
berceau
,
Madame
would
take
her
seat
on
summer


afternoon
,
and
send
for
the
class
,
in
turn
,
to
sit
round
she
and


sew
and
read
.
meantime
,
master
come
and
go
,
deliver
short
and


lively
lecture
,
rather
than
lesson
,
and
the
pupil
make
note
of


their
instruction
,
or
do
_
not
_
make
they
--
just
as
inclination


prompt
;
secure
that
,
in
case
of
neglect
,
they
could
copy
the
note
of


their
companion
.
besides
the
regular
monthly
_
jour
de
sortie
_
,
the


catholic
fete
-
day
bring
a
succession
of
holiday
all
the
year
round
;


and
sometimes
on
a
bright
summer
morning
,
or
soft
summer
evening
;
the


boarder
be
take
out
for
a
long
walk
into
the
country
,
regale
with


_
gaufre
_
and
_
vin
blanc
_
,
or
new
milk
and
_
pain
bis
_
,
or
_
pistolet
au


beurre
_
(
roll
)
and
coffee
.
all
this
seem
very
pleasant
,
and
Madame


appear
goodness
itself
;
and
the
teacher
not
so
bad
but
they
might
be


bad
;
and
the
pupil
,
perhaps
,
a
little
noisy
and
rough
,
but
type
of


health
and
glee
.




thus
do
the
view
appear
,
see
through
the
enchantment
of
distance
;
but


there
come
a
time
when
distance
be
to
melt
for
I
--
when
I
be
to
be


call
down
from
my
watch
-
tower
of
the
nursery
,
whence
I
have
hitherto


make
my
observation
,
and
be
to
be
compel
into
close
intercourse


with
this
little
world
of
the
Rue
Fossette
.




I
be
one
day
sit
up
-
stair
,
as
usual
,
hear
the
child
their


english
lesson
,
and
at
the
same
time
turn
a
silk
dress
for
Madame
,


when
she
came
saunter
into
the
room
with
that
absorb
air
and
brow


of
hard
thought
she
sometimes
wear
,
and
which
make
she
look
so
little


genial
.
drop
into
a
seat
opposite
mine
,
she
remain
some
minute


silent
.
Desiree
,
the
eld
girl
,
be
read
to
I
some
little
essay


of
Mrs.
Barbauld
's
,
and
I
be
make
she
translate
currently
from


english
to
French
as
she
proceed
,
by
way
of
ascertain
that
she


comprehend
what
she
read
:
Madame
listen
.




presently
,
without
preface
or
prelude
,
she
say
,
almost
in
the
tone
of


one
make
an
accusation
,
"
Meess
,
in
England
you
be
a
governess
?
"




"
no
,
Madame
,
"
say
I
smile
,
"
you
be
mistaken
.
"




"
be
this
your
first
essay
at
teaching
--
this
attempt
with
my
child
?
"




I
assure
she
it
be
.
again
she
become
silent
;
but
look
up
,
as
I


take
a
pin
from
the
cushion
,
I
find
myself
an
object
of
study
:
she


hold
I
under
her
eye
;
she
seem
turn
I
round
in
she


thought
--
measure
my
fitness
for
a
purpose
,
weigh
my
value
in
a


plan
.
Madame
have
,
ere
this
,
scrutinize
all
I
have
,
and
I
believe
she


esteem
herself
cognizant
of
much
that
I
be
;
but
from
that
day
,
for


the
space
of
about
a
fortnight
,
she
try
I
by
new
test
.
she
listen


at
the
nursery
door
when
I
be
shut
in
with
the
child
;
she
follow


I
at
a
cautious
distance
when
I
walk
out
with
they

steal
within


ear

shoot
whenever
the
tree

make
a
move
forward
.




one
morning
,
come
on
I
abruptly
,
and
with
the
semblance
of
hurry
,


she
say
she
find
herself
place
in
a
little
dilemma
.
Mr.
Wilson
,

english
master

have
fail
to

pupil
be
wait
in
classe
;
there
be
no
one
to
give
a
lesson
;


should
I
,
for
once
,
object
to
give
a
short
dictation
exercise
,
just


that
the
pupil
might
not
have
it
to
say
they
have
miss
their
English


lesson
?




"

"
where

say
I
;
for
I
know
the
number

and
with


my
usual
base
habit
of
cowardice
,
I
shrink
into
my
sloth
like
a
snail


into
its
shell
,
and
allege
incapacity
and
impracticability
as
a


pretext
to
escape
action
.
if
leave
to
myself
,
I
should
infallibly
have


let
this
chance
slip

some
of

real


enough

not
the

substantial
lay
in
my
want
of
mastery
over


the
medium
through
which
I
should
be
oblige
to
teach

I
have
,
indeed
,


study
French
closely
since
my
arrival
in
Villette

learn
its


practice
by
day
,

its
theory
in
every
leisure
moment
at
night
,
to
as


late
an
hour
as
the
rule
of
the

would
allow

light

I


be
far
from

be
able
to
trust
my
power
of
correct
oral


expression
.




"

Madame
sternly

I
might

obscurity
,

there
,


perhaps
,
moulder
for
the
rest
of
my
life

look
up
at
Madame

I


see
in
her
countenance

something

make
I

I

I
suddenly

the

I
that

eye

I
in

I

the
wide

lie

that

not


strength

the
campaign

a
series

tittering

soon
swell
into
murmur

the

in
many

actually
be
so

give
I
a
voice
that
could
make
itself
hear

if
lift
in
excitement

deepen
by
emotion
.
in
the
second

I
have
no

,
only


a

trickle

then
with
some


sarcasm

with
contemptuous
bitterness

I

the

that
this

a

the

hate

plainly


that
aid

from
Madame

her
righteous
plan

unbroken

the
pupil
,
at
any
and


every
cost
of
justice

comfort

the
teacher
.
for
a
teacher
to
seek


her
alliance
in
any
crisis
of
insubordination
be
equivalent
to


secure
her
own
expulsion
.
in
intercourse
with
her
pupil

Madame
only


take
to
herself
what

pleasant

amiable
,

recommendatory
;
rigidly

of
her
lieutenant
sufficiency

every
annoying
crisis

where
to
act
with
adequate
promptitude
be
to

unpopular

must
look

to
myself

her
soul
the
stirring

acknowledgment

this
little
foreign


attention

use
sometimes
to

that
,
of
the
two

consider

_
nonchalante
_
than
she
:
a
weak
,
transient
amaze
be
all
she
know
of
the


sensation
of
wonder
.
Most
of
her
other
faculty
seem
to
be
in
the


same
flimsy
condition
:
her
liking
and
dislike
,
her
love
and
hate
,


be
mere
cobweb
and
gossamer
;
but
she
have
one
thing
about
she
that


seem
strong
and
durable
enough
,
and
that
be
--
her
selfishness
.




she
be
not
proud
;
and--_bonne
d'enfant
_
as
I
be
--
she
would
forthwith


have
make
of
I
a
sort
of
friend
and
confidant
.
she
tease
I
with
a


thousand
vapid
complaint
about
school
-
quarrel
and
household
economy
:


the
cookery
be
not
to
her
taste
;
the
people
about
she
,
teacher
and


pupil
,
she
hold
to
be
despicable
,
because
they
be
foreigner
.
I
bear


with
her
abuse
of
the
Friday
's
salt
fish
and
hard
egg
--
with
she


invective
against
the
soup
,
the
bread
,
the
coffee
--
with
some
patience


for
a
time
;
but
at
last
,
weary
by
iteration
,
I
turn
crusty
,
and
put


she
to
right
:
a
thing
I
ought
to
have
do
in
the
very
beginning
,
for


a
salutary
setting
down
always
agree
with
she
.




much
long
have
I
to
endure
her
demand
on
I
in
the
way
of
work
.
she

so
far
as
concerned

of
external
wear

well
and


elegantly

;
but
there
be
other
habiliment
not
so
carefully


provide
:
what
she
have
,
need
frequent
repair
.
she
hate


needle
-
drudgery
herself
,
and
she
would
bring
she
hose
,
&
c.
to
I
in


heap
,
to
be
mend
.
a
compliance
of
some
week
threaten
to
result


in
the
establishment
of
an
intolerable
bore
--
I
at
last
distinctly
tell


she
she
must
make
up
her
mind
to
mend
her
own
garment
.
she
cry
on


receive
this
information
,
and
accuse
I
of
having
cease
to
be
she


friend
;
but
I
hold
by
my
decision
,
and
let
the
hysteric
pass
as
they


could
.




notwithstanding
these
foible
,

various
other
needless
to


mention

by
no
means
of
a
refined

elevate
character

how


pretty
she
be
!
how
charming
she

down

not
describe

neither
word

the
power
of
put
they
together
so
as
to
make


graphic
phrase

she

nothing

often
have
fail

my
interest

in
listen

for
one
thing
.
all
the
hint
she
drop

all
the
detail
she
give

go
unconsciously

my
thinking
,
that
M.
Isidore
's
homage


be
offer
with
great
delicacy
and
respect
.
I
inform
she
very


plainly
that
I
believe
he
much
too
good
for
she
,
and
intimate
with


equal
plainness
my
impression
that
she
be
but
a
vain
coquette
.
she


laugh
,
shake
her
curl
from
her
eye
,

dance
away
as
if
I
have


pay
she
a
compliment

Miss
Ginevra

school

study

little
well
than
nominal
;
there


be

three
thing
she
practise
in
earnest
,

.
music
,
singing
,

dance
;
also
embroider
the
fine
cambric
handkerchief

she


could
not
afford
to
buy
ready
work
:
such
mere
trifle
as
lesson
in


history
,
geography
,
grammar
,

arithmetic
,
she
leave
undone
,

get


other
to
do
for
she
.
very
much

her

Madame

aware
that
her
stay
at
school

now
limited
to
a
certain


period
,

would
not
be
extend
whether
she
make
progress

not

allow
her
great
licence
in
this
particular
.
Mrs.
Cholmondeley

company
at

sometimes
take
she
to
evening

party
at


the
house
of
her
acquaintance
.
Ginevra
perfectly
approve
this
mode
of


procedure
:
it
have
but
one
inconvenience
;
she
be
oblige
to
be
well


dress
,

she
have
not
money
to
buy
variety
of
dress
.

she


thought
turn
on
this
difficulty
;
her
whole
soul
be
occupy
with


expedient
for
effect
its
solution
.
it
be
wonderful
to
witness
the


activity
of
her
otherwise
indolent
mind
on
this
point
,
and
to
see
the


much
-
dare
intrepidity
to
which
she
be
spur
by
a
sense
of


necessity
,
and
the
wish
to
shine
.




she
beg
boldly
of
Mrs.
Cholmondeley
--
boldly
,
I
say
:
not
with
an
air


of
reluctant
shame
,

in
this
strain:--




"

in
her
mien

I
know
she
often
ponder


anxiously
what
she
call
"

but
if
the
young

a
puny

delicate

engaging

chance

spy
she

break
from
its


nurse

toddle
down
the
walk
,
come
all
eager
and
laugh
and


pant
to
clasp
her
knee
,
Madame
would
just
calmly
put
out
one
hand
,


so
as
to
prevent
inconvenient
concussion
from
the
child
's
sudden
onset
:


"
Prends
garde
,
mon

she
would
say
unmoved
,
patiently
permit
it


to
stand
near
she
a
few
moment
,
and
then
,
without
smile
or
kiss
,
or


endear
syllable
,
rise
and
lead
it
back
to
Trinette

her
demeanour
to
the
eld
girl
be
equally
characteristic
in
another


way
.
this
be
a
vicious
child
.
"

Quel

be
the
expression
dedicate
to
she
,
alike


in
kitchen
and
in
schoolroom
.
amongst
her
other
endowment
she
boast


an
exquisite
skill
in
the
art
,
of
provocation
,
sometimes
drive
she


_
bonne

the
servant
almost
wild
.
she
would
steal
to
their
attic
,


open
their
drawer
and
box
,
wantonly
tear
their
good
cap
and
soil


their
good
shawl
;
she
would
watch
her
opportunity
to
get
at
the
buffet


of
the
salle
-
a
-
manger
,
where
she
would
smash
article
of
porcelain
or


glass
--
or
to
the
cupboard
of
the
storeroom
,

she
would
plunder
the


preserve
,
drink
the
sweet
wine

break
jar

bottle

and
so


contrive
as
to
throw
the
onus
of
suspicion
on
the
cook
and
the


kitchen
-
maid

all
this
when
Madame

of
which
when
she
receive


report
,
her
sole
observation

utter
with
matchless
serenity

accordingly


she
keep
this
promising
olive

a
good
deal
at
her
side

never


once
,
I
believe
,
do
she
tell
she
faithfully
of
her
fault
,
explain
the


evil
of
such
habit
,
and
show
the
result
which
must
thence
ensue
.


surveillance
must
work
the
whole
cure
.
it
fail

Desiree

in
some

the

she
tease

pillage
she

whatever
belong
to
Madame

table

toilet
she


could
lay
her
hand

she
steal
and
hide

Madame
see
all
this
,
but
she


still
pretend
not
to
see
:
she
have
not
rectitude
of
soul
to
confront


the
child
with
her
vice
.
when
an
article
disappear

render
restitution
necessary

she
would
profess
to
think
that
Desiree


have
take
it
away
in

beg
she
to
restore
it

Desiree
be
not


to
be
so
cheated
:
she
have
learn
to
bring
falsehood
to
the
aid
of


theft
,
and
would
deny
having
touch
the
brooch
,
ring
,
or
scissor
.


carry
on
the
hollow
system
,
the
mother
would
calmly
assume
an
air
of


belief
,
and
afterwards
ceaselessly
watch
and
dog
the
child
till
she


track
she

to
her
hiding

some
hole
in
the

astute


parent

never

the
second

of
the
sort
likely
to
blunder
often
into


peril

it

he
pat
the
little

then
he

Madame

down

stair
together
;
she
talk
in
her
high
tide


of
spirit

volubility

he
listen
with
an
air
of
good

natured


amenity
,
dash
with
that
unconscious
roguish
archness

his

one


moment

not
to
address
I
,

to
speak
to
Madame

so
standing
,


that
I
almost
necessarily
look
up
at
he

a
recollection

have


be
struggle
to
form
in
my
memory

the
first

tread

first
visit

the
Rue

expect
home
the
next
day

there
appear
no
reason
why
his


temporary
substitute
should
again
represent
he
;
but
the
Fates
have


write
their
decree
to
the
contrary

Dr.
Pillule

be
summon
to
see

rich
old
hypochondriac

remedy

retain
to

the


timid

on
a
tour
of
some
week
;
it
but
remain
,
therefore
,
for


the
new
doctor
to
continue
his
attendance
at
the
Rue
Fossette
.




I
often
see
he
when
he
come
;
for
Madame
would
not
trust
the
little


invalid
to
Trinette
,
but
require
I
to
spend
much
of
my
time
in
the


nursery
.
I
think
he
be
skilful
.
Fifine
recover
rapidly
under
his


care
,
yet
even
her
convalescence
do
not
hasten
his
dismissal
.
destiny


and
Madame
Beck
seem
in
league
,
and
both
have
rule
that
he
should


make
deliberate
acquaintance
with
the
vestibule
,
the
private
staircase


and
upper
chamber
of
the
Rue
Fossette
.




no
soon
do
Fifine
emerge
from
his
hand
than
Desiree
declare


herself
ill
.
that
possess

a
genius
for
simulation
,
and


captivate
by
the
attention
and
indulgence
of
a
sick
-
room
,
she
come


to
the
conclusion
that
an
illness
would
perfectly
accommodate
she


taste
,
and
take
her
bed
accordingly
.
she
act
well
,
and
her
mother


still
well
;
for
while
the
whole
case
be
transparent
to
Madame
Beck


as
the
day
,
she
treat
it
with
an
astonishingly
well
-
assure
air
of


gravity
and
good
faith
.




what
surprise
I
be
,
that
Dr.
John
(
so
the
young
Englishman
have


teach
Fifine
to
call
he
,
and
we
all
take
from
she
the
habit
of


address
he
by
this
name
,
till
it
become
an
established
custom
,
and


he
be
know
by
no
other
in
the
Rue
fossette)--that
Dr.
John
consent


tacitly
to
adopt
Madame
's
tactic
,
and
to
fall
in
with
her
manoeuvre
.


he
betray
,
indeed
,
a
period
of
comic
doubt
,
cast
one
or
two
rapid


glance
from
the
child
to
the
mother
,
indulge
in
an
interval
of


self
-
consultation
,
but
finally
resign
himself
with
a
good
grace
to


play
his
part
in
the
farce
.

,

with
the

and
blanket
,
lounge


like
a
Turk
amidst

and

,
divert
herself
with

her

and

at
her
sister

over

short
,
with
unmerited
health
and
evil
spirit
;
only
languish
when


her
mamma
and
the
physician
pay
their
diurnal
visit
.
Madame
Beck
,
I


know
,
be
glad
,
at
any
price
,
to
have
her
daughter
in
bed
out
of
the


way
of
mischief
;
but
I
wonder
that
Dr.
John
do
not
tire
of
the


business
.




every
day
,
on
this
mere
pretext
of
a
motive
,
he
give
punctual


attendance
;
Madame
always
receive
he
with
the
same
empressement
,
the


same
sunshine
for
himself
,
the
same
admirably
counterfeit
air
of


concern
for
her
child
.
Dr.
John
write
harmless
prescription
for
the


patient
,
and
view
her
mother
with
a
shrewdly
sparkling
eye
.
Madame


catch
his
rally
look
without
resent
they
--
she
have
too
much
good


sense
for
that
.
supple
as
the
young
doctor
seem
,
one
could
not


despise
he
--
this
pliant
part
be
evidently
not
adopt
in
the
design


to
curry
favour
with
his
employer
:
while
he
like
his
office
at
the


pensionnat
,
and
linger
strangely
about
the
Rue
Fossette
,
he
be


independent
,
almost
careless
in
his
carriage
there
;
and
yet
,
too
,
he


be
often
thoughtful
and
preoccupied
.




it
be
not
perhaps
my
business
to
observe
the
mystery
of
his
bearing
,


or
search
out
its
origin
or
aim
;
but
,
place
as
I
be
,
I
could
hardly


help
it
.
he
lay
himself
open
to
my
observation
,
accord
to
my


presence
in
the
room
just
that
degree
of
notice
and
consequence
a


person
of
my
exterior
habitually
expect
:
that
be
to
say
,
about
what
be


give
to
unobtrusive
article
of
furniture
,
chair
of
ordinary
joiner
's


work
,
and
carpet
of
no
striking
pattern
.
often
,
while
wait
for


Madame
,
he
would
muse
,
smile
,
watch
,
or
listen
like
a
man
who
think


himself
alone
.
I
,
meantime
,
be
free
to
puzzle
over
his
countenance
and


movement
,
and
wonder
what
could
be
the
meaning
of
that
peculiar


interest
and
attachment
--
all
mix
up
with
doubt
and
strangeness
,
and


inexplicably
rule
by
some
preside
spell
--
which
wed
he
to
this


demi
-
convent
,
seclude
in
the
build
-
up
core
of
a
capital

,
I


believe
,
never
remember
that
I
have
eye
in
my
head
,
much
less
a
brain


behind
they
.




nor
would
he
ever
have
find
this
out
,
but
that
one
day
,
while
he
sit


in
the
sunshine
and
I
be
observe
the
colouring
of
his
hair
,


whisker
,
and
complexion
--
the
whole
being
of
such
a
tone
as
a
strong


light
bring
out
with
somewhat
perilous
force
(
indeed
I
recollect
I
be


drive
to
compare
his
beamy
head
in
my
thought
to
that
of
the
"
golden


image
"
which
Nebuchadnezzar
the
king

set
up

an
idea
new

,

startling

rivet
my
attention

an
over

power
of

not
to
this

how
I

at
he

the


force
of
surprise
,

also
of
conviction
,
make
I
forget
myself
;
and
I


only
recover
wonted
consciousness
when
I
see
that
his
notice
be


arrest

that
it
have
catch
my
movement

clear
little

philoprogenitiveness

at

the
indulgence
of

excessive
length

Madame
now
get
credit
for
having
act
on
this


occasion
in
a
spirit
of
motherly
partiality
:
she
come
off
with
fly


colour
;
people
like
she
as
a
directress
well
than
ever
.




to
this
day
I
never
fully
understand
why
she
thus
risk
her
interest


for
the
sake
of
Dr.
John
.
what
people
say
,
of
course
I
know
well
:
the


whole
house
--
pupil
,
teacher
,
servant
include
--
affirm
that
she
be


go
to
marry
he
.
so
they
have
settle
it
;
difference
of
age
seem
to


make
no
obstacle
in
their
eye
:
it
be
to
be
so
.




it
must
be
admit
that
appearance
do
not
wholly
discountenance
this


idea
;
Madame
seem
so
bent
on
retain
his
service
,
so
oblivious
of


her
former
protege
,
Pillule
.
she
make
,
too
,
such
a
point
of
personally


receive
his
visit
,
and
be
so
unfailingly
cheerful
,
blithe
,
and


benignant
in
her
manner
to
he
.
moreover
,
she
pay
,
about
this
time
,


mark
attention
to
dress
:
the
morning
dishabille
,
the
nightcap
and


shawl
,
be
discard
;
Dr.
John
's
early
visit
always
find
she
with


auburn
braid
all
nicely
arrange
,
silk
dress
trimly
fit
on
,
neat


laced
brodequin
in
lieu
of
slipper
:
in
short
the
whole
toilette


complete
as
a
model
,
and
fresh
as
a
flower
.
I
scarcely
think
,
however
,


that
her
intention
in
this
go
far
than
just
to
show
a
very


handsome
man
that
she
be
not
quite
a
plain
woman
;
and
plain
she
be


not
.
without
beauty
of
feature
or
elegance
of
form
,
she
please
.


without
youth
and
its
gay
grace
,
she
cheer
.
one
never
tired
of


see
she
:
she
be
never
monotonous
,
or
insipid
,
or
colourless
,
or


flat
.
her
unfaded
hair
,
her
eye
with
its
temperate
blue
light
,
she


cheek
with
its
wholesome
fruit
-
like
bloom
--
these
thing
pleased
in


moderation
,
but
with
constancy
.




have
she
,
indeed
,
float
vision
of
adopt
Dr.
John
as
a
husband
,


take
he
to
her
well
-
furnish
home
,
endow
he
with
her
saving
,


which
be
say
to
amount
to
a
moderate
competency
,
and
make
he


comfortable
for
the
rest
of
his
life
?
do
Dr.
John
suspect
she
of
such


vision
?
I
have
meet
he
come
out
of
her
presence
with
a
mischievous


half
-
smile
about
his
lip
,
and
in
his
eye
a
look
as
of
masculine


vanity
elate
and
tickled
.
with
all
his
good
look
and
good
-
nature
,
he


be
not
perfect
;
he
must
have
be
very
imperfect
if
he
roguishly


encourage
aim
he
never
intend
to
be
successful
.
but
do
he
not


intend
they
to
be
successful
?
People
say
he
have
no
money
,
that
he
be


wholly
dependent
upon
his
profession
.
Madame
--
though
perhaps
some


fourteen
year
his
senior
--
be
yet
the
sort
of
woman
never
to
grow
old
,


never
to
wither
,
never
to
break
down
.
they
certainly
be
on
good


term
.
_
he
_
perhaps
be
not
in
love
;
but
how
many
people
ever
_
do
_


love
,
or
at
least
marry
for
love
,
in
this
world

we
wait
the
end
.




for
what
_
he

wait

I
do
not
know
,
nor
for
what
he
watch
;

the


peculiarity
of
his
manner

his
expectant
,
vigilant
,
absorb
,
eager


look

never
wear
off

rather
intensify

he
have
never
be
quite


within
the
compass
of
my
penetration
,

I
think
he
range
far
and


far
beyond
it

one
morning

consequently


more
peevish

I
think
a


particular

with

I
doubt
whether

a

a
shudder
.
in


the
full
summer
daylight
,
her
face
,
though
it
still
have
the
colour
,


could
plainly
be
see
to
have
lose
the
texture
of
youth
;
and
then
,


where
be
youth
's
contour
?
ah
,
Madame
!
wise
as
you
be
,
even
_
you
_


know
weakness
.
never
have
I
pity
Madame
before
,
but
my
heart
soften


towards
she
,
when
she
turn
darkly
from
the
glass
.
a
calamity
have
come


upon
she
.
that
hag
Disappointment
be
greet
she
with
a
grisly


"
all
-
hail
,
"
and
her
soul
reject
the
intimacy
.




but
Rosine
!
my
bewilderment
there
surpass
description
.
I
embrace


five
opportunity
of
pass
her
cabinet
that
day
,
with
a
view
to


contemplate
her
charm
,
and
find
out
the
secret
of
their


influence
.
she
be
pretty
,
young
,
and
wear
a
well
-
make
dress
.
all
very


good
point
,
and
,
I
suppose
,
amply
sufficient
to
account
,
in
any


philosophic
mind
,
for
any
amount
of
agony
and
distraction
in
a
young


man
,
like
Dr.
John
.
still
,
I
could
not
help
form
half
a
wish
that


the
say
doctor
be
my
brother
;
or
at
least
that
he
have
a
sister
or
a


mother
who
would
kindly
sermonize
he
.
I
say
_
half
_
a
wish
;
I
break
it
,


and
fling
it
away
before
it
become
a
whole
one
,
discover
in
good


time
its
exquisite
folly
.
"
somebody
,
"
I
argue
,
"
might
as
well


sermonize
Madame
about
her
young
physician
:
and
what
good
would
that


do
?
"




I
believe
Madame
sermonize
herself
.
she
do
not
behave
weakly
,
or
make


herself
in
any
shape
ridiculous
.
it
be
true
she
have
neither
strong


feeling
to
overcome
,
nor
tender
feeling
by
which
to
be
miserably


pained
.
it
be
true
likewise
that
she
have
an
important
avocation
,
a
real


business
to
fill
her
time
,
divert
her
thought
,
and
divide
she


interest
.
it
be
especially
true
that
she
possess
a
genuine
good
sense


which
be
not
give
to
all
woman
nor
to
all
man
;
and
by
dint
of
these


combine
advantage
she
behave
wisely
--
she
behave
well
.
Brava
!
once


more
,
Madame
Beck
.
I
see
you
match
against
an
Apollyon
of
a


predilection
;
you
fight
a
good
fight

and
you
overcome

that

in
the
heart
of
a
city

to
my
recollection


at
this

it
seem
pleasant
:

time
,

distance

lend
to

an
influence
so
soften
;

how
precious

how


lovely

spot
of

there
go
a
tradition
that
Madame

house
have
in
old
day
be
a


convent
.
that
in
year
go
by
--
how
long
go
by
I
can
not
tell
,
but
I


think
some
century
--
before
the
city
have
over
-
spread
this
quarter
,
and


when
it
be
till
ground
and
avenue
,
and
such
deep
and
leafy
seclusion


as
ought
to
embosom
a
religious
house
--
that
something
have
happen
on


this
site
which
,
rouse
fear
and
inflict
horror
,
have
leave
to
the


place
the
inheritance
of
a
ghost
-
story
.
a
vague
tale
go
of
a
black

white
nun
,
sometimes
,
on
some
night
or
night
of
the

in


some
part
of
this
vicinage
.
the
ghost
must
have
be
build
out
some


age
ago

there
be

a

conclave

the
drear
middle

our
convent
,
which
extinguish
each
lamp
,
and
drop
the


curtain
round
each
couch
,
ring
for
the
gay
city
about
we
the
summon
to


festal
enjoyment
.
of
this
contrast
I
think
not
,
however
:
gay


instinct
my
nature
have
few
;
ball
or
opera
I
have
never
see
;
and
though


often
I
have
hear
they
describe
,
and
even
wish
to
see
they
,
it
be


not
the
wish
of
one
who
hope
to
partake
a
pleasure
if
she
could
only


reach
it
--
who
feels
fit
to
shine
in
some
bright
distant
sphere
,


could
she
but
thither
win
her
way
;
it
be
no
yearning
to
attain
,
no


hunger
to
taste
;
only
the
calm
desire
to
look
on
a
new
thing
.




a
moon
be
in
the
sky
,
not
a
full
moon
,
but
a
young
crescent
.
I
see
she


through
a
space
in
the
bough
overhead
.
she
and
the
star
,
visible


beside
she
,
be
no
stranger
where
all
else
be
strange
:
my
childhood


know
they
.
I
have
see
that
golden
sign
with
the
dark
globe
in
its
curve


lean
back
on
azure
,
beside
an
old
thorn
at
the
top
of
an
old
field
,


in
Old
England
,
in
long
past
day
,
just
as
it
now
lean
back
beside
a


stately
spire
in
this
continental
capital
.




oh
,
my
childhood
!
I
have
feeling
:
passive
as
I
live
,
little
as
I


speak
,
cold
as
I
look
,
when
I
think
of
past
day
,
I
_
could
_
feel
.


about
the
present
,
it
be
well
to
be
stoical
;
about
the
future
--
such


a
future
as
mine
--
to
be
dead
.
and
in
catalepsy
and
a
dead
trance
,
I


studiously
hold
the
quick
of
my
nature
.




at
that
time
,
I
well
remember
whatever
could
excite
--
certain
accident


of
the
weather
,
for
instance
,
be
almost
dread
by
I
,
because
they


wake
the
being
I
be
always
lull
,
and
stir
up
a
craving
cry
I


could
not
satisfy
.
one
night
a
thunder
-
storm
break
;
a
sort
of
hurricane


shake
we
in
our
bed
:
the
Catholics
rise
in
panic
and
pray
to
their


saint
.
as
for
I
,
the
temp
take
hold
of
I
with
tyranny
:
I
be


roughly
rouse
and
oblige
to
live
.
I
get
up
and
dress
myself
,
and


creep
outside
the
casement
close
by
my
bed
,
sit
on
its
ledge
,
with


my
foot
on
the
roof
of
a
low
adjoining
building
.
it
be
wet
,
it
be


wild
,
it
be
pitch
-
dark
.
within
the
dormitory
they
gather
round
the


night
-
lamp
in
consternation
,
pray
loud
.
I
could
not
go
in
:
too


resistless
be
the
delight
of
stay
with
the
wild
hour
,
black
and


full
of
thunder
,
peal
out
such
an
ode
as
language
never
deliver
to


man
--
too
terribly
glorious
,
the
spectacle
of
cloud
,
split
and
pierce


by
white
and
blind
bolt
.




I
do
long
,
achingly
,
then
and
for
four
and
twenty
hour
afterwards
,


for
something
to
fetch
I
out
of
my
present
existence
,
and
lead
I


upwards
and
onwards
.
this
longing
,
and
all
of
a
similar
kind
,
it
be


necessary
to
knock
on
the
head
;
which
I
do
,
figuratively
,
after
the


manner
of
Jael
to
Sisera
,
drive
a
nail
through
their
temple
.
unlike


Sisera
,
they
do
not
die
:
they
be
but
transiently
stunned
,
and
at


interval
would
turn
on
the
nail
with
a
rebellious
wrench
:
then
do
the


temple
bleed
,
and
the
brain
thrill
to
its
core
.




to
-
night
,
I
be
not
so
mutinous
,
nor
so
miserable
.
my
Sisera
lie
quiet


in
the
tent
,
slumber
;
and
if
his
pain
ache
through
his
slumber
,


something
like
an
angel
--
the
ideal
--
kneel
near
,
drop
balm
on
the


soothe
temple
,
hold
before
the
seal
eye
a
magic
glass
,
of
which


the
sweet
,
solemn
vision
be
repeat
in
dream
,
and
shed
a


reflex
from
her
moonlight
wing
and
robe
over
the
transfixed
sleeper
,


over
the
tent
threshold
,
over
all
the
landscape
lie
without
.
Jael
,


the
stern
woman
;
sit
apart
,
relent
somewhat
over
her
captive
;
but


more
prone
to
dwell
on
the
faithful
expectation
of
Heber
come
home
.


by
which
word
I
mean
that
the
cool
peace
and
dewy
sweetness
of
the


night
fill
I
with
a
mood
of
hope
:
not
hope
on
any
definite
point
,


but
a
general
sense
of
encouragement
and
heart
-
ease
.




should
not
such
a
mood
,
so
sweet
,
so
tranquil
,
so
unwonted
,
have
be


the
harbinger
of
good
?
alas

no
good

it

the

such

I
ca

my

tally
with

I
go

may

whose

theirs
seem

it
come
to

very
confusing

the
grey

more


definite
indication

Madame
Beck

a
grey
dress


just
now
;
another
teacher
,

have
have
grey


dress

of
the

it

a

of

happen
at
that
time

,
I
soon
find

mainly
design

a
wholesome


mortification
of
the
Intellect
,
a
useful
humiliation
of
the
Reason

such
a
dose
for
Common

as
she
might
digest
at
her
leisure

thrive
on

the


title

peruse
with
my

enormous

an


unworthy
heretic

legend
of

good
God
!


(
I
speak
the
word
reverently

what
legend

what
gasconading


rascal

have

monkish
extravagance

which
one
laugh
inwardly
;
there


be
,
besides
,
priestly
matter
,
and
the
priestcraft
of
the
book

far
bad
than
its
monkery

the
ear
burn
on
each
side
of
my
head

I
listen
,

to
tale
of
moral
martyrdom

by
Rome

dread

again

with


all
its
dreadful
viciousness

sicken
tyranny

black
impiety

tale
that
be
nightmare
of
oppression
,
privation

agony

I
sit
out
this
"

for
some
night
as
well

;
only
once
break
off

point

my

involuntarily
stick

somewhat
deep
in
the

,
at

I
so
burn
hot

my


temple
,

my

so
fast

my
sleep


afterwards

so
break
with
excitement

that
I
could
sit
no
long

Prudence
recommend
henceforward
a
swift
clearance
of
my
person
from


the
place
,
the
moment
that
guilty
old
book

out

Mause

up
her
testimony

Sergeant
Bothwell

I
--
to
speak
my
mind
in
this
matter
of
the


popish
"
lecture
pieuse
.
"
however
,
I
do
manage
somehow
to
curb
and
rein


in
;
and
though
always
,
as
soon
as
Rosine
come
to
light
the
lamp
,
I


shoot
from
the
room
quickly
,
yet
also
I
do
it
quietly
;
seize
that


vantage
moment
give
by
the
little
bustle
before
the
dead
silence
,
and


vanish
whilst
the
boarder
put
their
book
away
.




when
I
vanish
--
it
be
into
darkness
;
candle
be
not
allow
to
be


carry
about
,
and
the
teacher
who
forsook
the
refectory
,
have
only
the


unlit
hall
,
schoolroom
,
or
bedroom
,
as
a
refuge
.
in
winter
I
seek
the


long
class
,

pace
they
fast
to
keep
myself
warm
--
fortunate
if
the


moon
shine
,
and
if
there
be
only
star
,
soon
reconcile
to
their
dim


gleam
,
or
even
to
the
total
eclipse
of
their
absence
.
in
summer
it
be


never
quite
dark
,
and
then
I
go
up

stair
to
my
own
quarter
of
the


long
dormitory
,
open
my
own
casement
(
that
chamber

light
by
five


casement
large
as

door

,
and
lean
out
,
look
forth
upon
the


city
beyond
the
garden
,
and
listen
to
band

music
from
the
park
or
the


palace

square
,
think

my
own

in
my
own
still

shadow

this
evening
,
fugitive
as
usual
before
the
Pope
and
his
work
,
I


mount
the
staircase
,
approach
the
dormitory
,
and
quietly
open
the


door
,
which
be
always

carefully
shut

,

every
other


door

this
house

revolve
noiselessly
on
well

before
I


_
see

,
I
_
feel

that
life
be
in
the
great
room
,
usually
void
:
not
that


there

visible
at
a

;
all
be
empty
:


no
sleeper

therein
.
the
sound
of
a
drawer
cautiously
slide
out


strike
my
ear
;
step
a
little
to
one
side
,
my
vision
take
a
free


range
,
unimpeded
by
fall
curtain
.
I
now
command
my
own
bed
and
my


own
toilet

I


will
not
deny
that
it
be
with
a
secret
glee
I
watch
she
.
have
I
be


a
gentleman
I
believe
Madame
would
have
find
favour
in
my
eye
,
she


be
so
handy
,
neat
,
thorough
in
all
she
do
:
some
people
's
movement


provoke
the
soul
by
their
loose
awkwardness
,
her
--
satisfied
by
their


trim
compactness
.
I
stand
,
in
short
,
fascinated
;
but
it
be
necessary


to
make
an
effort
to
break
this
spell
a
retreat
must
be
beat
.
the


searcher
might
have
turn
and
catch
I
;
there
would
have
be
nothing


for
it
then
but
a
scene
,
and
she
and
I
would
have
have
to
come
all
at


once
,
with
a
sudden
clash
,
to
a
thorough
knowledge
of
each
other
:
down


would
have
go
conventionality
,
away
sweep
disguise
,
and
_
I
_
should


have
look
into
her
eye
,
and
she
into
mine
--
we
should
have
know
that


we
could
work
together
no
more
,
and
part
in
this
life
for
ever
.




where
be
the
use
of
tempt
such
a
catastrophe
?
I
be
not
angry
,
and


have
no
wish
in
the
world
to
leave
she
.
I
could
hardly
get
another


employer
whose
yoke
would
be
so
light
and
so
,
easy
of
carriage
;
and


truly
I
like
Madame
for
her
capital
sense
,
whatever
I
might
think
of


her
principle
:
as
to
her
system
,
it
do
I
no
harm
;
she
might
work
I


with
it
to
her
heart
's
content
:
nothing
would
come
of
the
operation
.


Loverless
and
inexpectant
of
love
,
I
be
as
safe
from
spy
in
my


heart
-
poverty
,
as
the
beggar
from
thief
in
his
destitution
of
purse
.


I
turn
,
then
,
and
flee
;
descend
the
stair
with
progress
as
swift


and
soundless
as
that
of
the
spider
,
which
at
the
same
instant
run
down


the
bannister
.




how
I
laugh
when
I
reach
the
schoolroom
.
I
know
now
she
have


certainly
see
Dr.
John
in
the
garden
;
I
know
what
her
thought
be
.


the
spectacle
of
a
suspicious
nature
so
far
mislead
by
its
own


invention
,
tickle
I
much
.
yet
as
the
laugh
die
,
a
kind
of
wrath


smote
I
,
and
then
bitterness
follow
:
it
be
the
rock
strike
,
and


Meribah
's
water
gush
out
.
I
never
have
feel
so
strange
and


contradictory
an
inward
tumult
as
I
feel
for
an
hour
that
evening
:


soreness
and
laughter
,
and
fire
,
and
grief
,
share
my
heart
between


they
.
I
cry
hot
tear
:
not
because
Madame
mistrust
I
--
I
do
not


care
twopence
for
her
mistrust
--

for
other
reason

,


disquieting
thought
break
up

whole
repose
of
my
nature

turmoil
subside

day
I
be
again
Lucy
Snowe

on
revisit
my
drawer

find
they
all
securely

the
close


subsequent
examination
could
not
discover
change
or
apparent


disturbance
in
the
position
of
one
object
.
my
few
dress

I
have
leave

a
certain
little
bunch

once
be
silently
present
to
I
by
a
stranger

a
stranger
to
I
,
for


we
have
never

which
I
have
dry
and
keep
for
its


sweet
perfume

of
my
good

a
thing
there
be
which
puzzle
myself

I
seek
in
my
brain
a
key


to
that
riddle
almost
as
sedulously
as
Madame
have
seek
a
guide
to


useful
knowledge
in
my
toilet
drawer

how
be
it
that
Dr.
John
,
if
he


have
not
be
accessory
to
the
dropping
of
that
casket
into
the
garden
,


should
have
know
that
it
_
be
_
drop

appear
so
promptly
on


the
spot
to
seek
it

so
strong
be
the
wish
to
clear
up
this
point
that


I
begin
to
entertain
this
daring
suggestion
:
"
why
may
I
not
,
in
case
I


should
ever
have
the
opportunity
,
ask
Dr.
John
himself
to
explain
this


coincidence
?
"




and
so
long
as
Dr.
John
be
absent
,
I
really
believe
I
have
courage
to


test
he
with
such
a
question
.




Little

convalescent

his
visit
very
rare

would
have
cease

altogether

not

:
presentation
of

,
collation
in
the

,
dramatic
performance
(
with
pupil
and


teacher
for
actor
)
,
a
dance
and
supper
.
very
gorgeous
seem
the


effect
of
the
whole
to
I
,
as
I
well
remember
.
Zelie
St.
Pierre


understand
these
thing
and
manage
they
ably
.




the
play
be
the
main
point
;
a
month
's
previous
drilling
be
there


require
.
the
choice
,
too
,
of
the
actor
require
knowledge
and
care
;


then
come
lesson
in
elocution
,
in
attitude
,
and
then
the
fatigue
of


countless
rehearsal
.
for
all
this
,
as
may
well
be
suppose
,
St.
Pierre


do
not
suffice
:
other
management
,
other
accomplishment
than
hers
be


requisite
here
.
they
be
supply
in
the
person
of
a
master
--
M.
Paul


Emanuel
,
professor
of
literature
.
it
be
never
my
lot
to
be
present
at


the
histrionic
lesson
of
M.
Paul
,
but
I
often
see
he
as
he
cross


the
_
carre
_
(
a
square
hall
between
the
dwelling
-
house
and


school
-
house
)
.
I
hear
he
,
too
,
in
the
warm
evening
,
lecture
with


open
door
,
and
his
name
,
with
anecdote
of
he
,
resound
in
one
ear


from
all
side
.
especially
our
former
acquaintance
,
Miss
Ginevra


Fanshawe,--who
have
be
select
to
take
a
prominent
part
in
the


play
--
use
,
in
bestow
upon
I
a
large
portion
of
her
leisure
,
to


lard
her
discourse
with
frequent
allusion
to
his
saying
and
doing
.


she
esteem
he
hideously
plain
,
and
use
to
profess
herself


frighten
almost
into
hysteric
at
the
sound
of
his
step
or
voice
.
a


dark
little
man
he
certainly
be
;
pungent
and
austere
.
even
to
I
he


seem
a
harsh
apparition
,
with
his
close
-
shorn
,
black
head
,
his
broad
,


sallow
brow
,
his
thin
cheek
,
his
wide
and
quiver
nostril
,
his


thorough
glance
,
and
hurried
bearing
.
irritable
he
be
;
one
hear
that
,


as
he
apostrophize
with
vehemence
the
awkward
squad
under
his
order
.


sometimes
he
would
break
out
on
these
raw
amateur
actress
with
a


passion
of
impatience
at
their
falseness
of
conception
,
their
coldness


of
emotion
,
their
feebleness
of
delivery
.
"
Ecoutez
!
"
he
would
cry
;
and


then
his
voice
ring
through
the
premise
like
a
trumpet
;
and
when
,


mimic
it
,
come
the
small
pipe
of
a
Ginevra
,
a
Mathilde
,
or
a


Blanche
,
one
understand
why
a
hollow
groan
of
scorn
,
or
a
fierce
hiss


of
rage
,
reward
the
tame
echo
.




"
Vous
n'etes
donc
que

"
I
hear

"




Vain
resolve
!
and
when
he
at
last
find
it
_
be
_
vain
,
he
suddenly


break
the
whole
business
down
.
Hitherto
he
have
be
teach
they
a


grand
tragedy
;
he
tear
the
tragedy
in
morsel
,
and
come
next
day
with
a


compact
little
comic
trifle
.
to
this
they
take
more
kindly
;
he


presently
knock
it
all
into
their
smooth
round
pate

Mademoiselle
St.
Pierre
always
preside
at
M.
Emanuel
's
lesson
,
and
I


be
tell
that
the
polish
of
her
manner
,
her
seem
attention
,
her
tact


and
grace
,
impress
that
gentleman
very
favourably
.
she
have
,
indeed
,


the
art
of
pleasing
,
for
a
give
time
,
whom
she
would
;
but
the
feeling


would
not
last
:
in
an
hour
it
be
dry
like
dew
,
vanish
like


gossamer
.




the
day
precede
Madame
's
fete
be
as
much
a
holiday
as
the
fete


itself
.
it
be
devoted
to
clear
out
,
clean
,
arranging
and


decorate
the
three
schoolroom
.
all
within
-
door
be
the
gay


bustle
;
neither
up

nor
down
could
a
quiet
,
isolated
person
find


rest
for
the
sole
of
her
foot
;
accordingly
,
for
my
part
,
I
take
refuge


in
the
garden
.
the
whole
day
do
I
wander
or
sit
there
alone
,
find


warmth
in
the
sun
,
shelter
among
the
tree
,
and
a
sort
of
companionship


in
my
own
thought
.
I
well
remember
that
I
exchange
but
two
sentence


that
day
with
any
live
being
:
not
that
I
feel
solitary
;
I
be
glad
to


be
quiet

a
looker

suffice
to
pass
through
the
room
once

twice

what

how

green

a

Mademoiselle
St.

how
an
eager
band

which
give
a
pleasant
sense
of
summer
freedom
--
and


freedom
the
most
complete
seem
indeed
the
order
of
the
day
.
teacher


and
pupil
descend
to

the
toilette
of
the
evening

they
seem
to


take
a
pleasure
in
indulge
that
forenoon
in
a
luxury
of
slovenliness
;


like
alderman
fast
in
preparation
for
a
feast
.
about
nine
o'clock


A.M.

important
functionary
,

smooth
as
a
shell
,

by


faultless
white
line
,
and
wreathe
about
with
grecian
plait
that


shine
as
if
lacquer
.
I
take
my
turn
with
the
rest
,
and
could
hardly


believe
what
the
glass
say
when
I

my

it

several
convincing
pull


to
give
assurance
to
the
contrary
.
I
then
acknowledge
in
the
coiffeur


a
first

one
who
certainly
make
the

of

the

elaborate

to
I
it
be
,

ever


must
be
an
enigma
,

spend
so
much
time

so


little

a
clear
white
muslin
dress
,
a
blue
sash

,


a

such
be
the
gala
uniform

to
the
assumption
whereof
that
houseful
of
teacher
and
pupil
devote


three
mortal
hour
.
but
though
simple
,
it
must
be
allow

and
freshness

every
head

also

with
exquisite
nicety

a
certain
compact
taste

suit
the


full
,
firm
comeliness
of

contour
,
though
too
stiff
for


any
more
flowing
and
flexible
style
of
beauty

the
general
effect
be
,


on
the
whole
,
commendable
.




in
behold
this
diaphanous
and
snowy
mass
,
I
well
remember
feel


myself
to
be
a
mere
shadowy
spot
on
a
field
of
light
;
the
courage
be


not
in
I
to
put
on
a
transparent
white
dress
:
something
thin

the
weather
and
room

too
hot
to
give
substantial

I
have
seek
through
a
dozen
shop

I
light
upon
a


crape

colour

on
a
moor
in

.
my
_
tailleuse
_
have
kindly
make
it
as
well
as


she
could
:
because
,
as
she
judiciously
observe
,
it
be
"

"
care
in
the
fashion

the
more
imperative
:
it
be
well


she
take
this
view
of
the
matter
,
for
I
,
have
no
flower
,
no
jewel
to


relieve
it
:
and
,
what
be
more
,
I
have
no
natural
rose
of
complexion
.




we
become
oblivious
of
these
deficiency
in
the
uniform
routine
of


daily
drudgery
,
but
they
_
will
_
force
upon
we
their
unwelcome
blank
on


those
bright
occasion
when
beauty
should
shine
.




however
,
in
this
same
gown
of
shadow
,
I
feel
at
home

at
ease
;
an

I
in
countenance

dress

almost
as
quiet
as
mine

that
she

a
bracelet
,

a
large


brooch
bright
with
gold
and
fine
stone

we
chance
to
meet
on
the

she
give
I
a
nod
and
smile
of
approbation
.
not
that
she


think
I
be

well

a
point
unlikely
to
engage

to
keep
a
sharp
look
-
out
on
the


black
-
beetle
and
cockroach
,
of
which
,
more
even
,
I
believe
,
than
of


the
rat
,
I
sit
in
mortal
dread
.




my
impression
at
first
be
that
I
have
undertake
what
it
really
be


impossible
to
perform
,
and
I
simply
resolve
to
do
my
good
and
be


resign
to
fail
.
I
soon
find
,
however
,
that
one
part
in
so
short
a


piece
be
not
more
than
memory
could
master
at
a
few
hour
'
notice
.
I


learn
and
learn
on
,
first
in
a
whisper
,
and
then
aloud
.
perfectly


secure
from
human
audience
,
I
act
my
part
before
the
garret
-
vermin
.


enter
into
its
emptiness
,
frivolity
,
and
falsehood
,
with
a
spirit


inspire
by
scorn
and
impatience
,
I
take
my
revenge
on
this
"
fat
,
"
by


make
he
as
fatuitous
as
I
possibly
could
.




in
this
exercise
the
afternoon
pass
:
day
begin
to
glide
into
evening
;


and
I
,
who
have
eat
nothing
since
breakfast
,
grow
excessively
hungry
.


now
I
think
of
the
collation
,
which
doubtless
they
be
just
then


devouring
in
the
garden
far
below
.
(
I
have
see
in
the
vestibule
a


basketful
of
small
_
pat
a
la
creme
_
,
than
which
nothing
in
the
whole


range
of
cookery
seem
to
I
well
)
.
a
_
pate
_
,
or
a
square
of
cake
,


it
seem
to
I
would
come
very
_
apropos
;
_
and
as
my
relish
for
those


dainty
increase
,
it
begin
to
appear
somewhat
hard
that
I
should
pass


my
holiday
,
fast
and
in
prison
.
remote
as
be
the
attic
from
the


street
-
door
and
vestibule
,
yet
the
ever
-
tinkle
bell
be
faintly


audible
here
;
and
also
the
ceaseless
roll
of
wheel
,
on
the
torment


pavement
.
I
know
that
the
house
and
garden
be
throng
,
and
that
all


be
gay
and
glad
below
;
here
it
begin
to
grow
dusk
:
the
beetle
be


fade
from
my
sight
;
I
tremble
lest
they
should
steal
on
I
a
march
,


mount
my
throne
unseen
,
and
,
unsuspected
,
invade
my
skirt
.
Impatient


and
apprehensive
,
I
recommence
the
rehearsal
of
my
part
merely
to
kill


time
.
just
as
I
be
conclude
,
the
long
-
delay
rattle
of
the
key
in


the
lock
come
to
my
ear

no
unwelcome
sound

dusk

for
light
enough
still
linger

the

blackness

head

sallow

I

that

the
difficulty

it
reveal


to
I
this
fact

not

fear
so

once
get
free
,

my
voice
take
its


true
pitch
,

find
its
natural

think

very
well

Ginevra

have
to
coquette
between
two
suitor

manage


admirably
:
in
fact
she
be
in
her
element
.
I
observe
that
she
once
or


twice
throw
a
certain
marked
fondness
and
point
partiality
into
she


manner

I

the
fop

with
such
emphasis
and
animation
do
she


favour
I

such
glance
do
she
dart
out
into
the

I
follow
her
eye

her
smile

she


gesture
,

ere
long
discover
that
she

at

act
enough

enough

such

be


her
triumph

bright
spot

her
flash

a
gem

flower

at
all
ordinary
diet

would
pout

feed
on
cream

ice

a


hum

thus
bloom

sparkle

the
mere

of

lavish
her
good
grace
that


night
for
the
edification
of
her
companion
only

for
that
of
the


parent

grand

parent

who
fill
the
carre

line

under
circumstance
so
insipid

limited

with
motive
so


chilly

vapid

Ginevra
would
scarce
have
deign
to
walk
one


quadrille
,
and
weariness
and
fretfulness
would
have
replace
animation


and
good
-
humour
,
but
she
know
of
a
leaven
in
the
otherwise
heavy
festal


mass
which
light
the
whole
;
she
taste
a
condiment

give
it


zest
;
she
perceive
reason

the
display
of
her
choice


attraction

not
a

spectator

the

for

never

thus
Madame

laugh

perhaps
you
be
all
right

and
perhaps
,
circumstance
like
I
,


you
would
have
be
,
like
I
,
wrong
.
the
first
month
be
,
indeed
,
a


long
,
black
,
heavy
month
to
I
.




the
cretin
do
not
seem
unhappy
.
I
do
my
good
to
feed
she
well
and


keep
she
warm
,
and
she
only
ask
food
and
sunshine
,
or
when
that


lack
,
fire
.
her
weak
faculty
approve
of
inertion
:
her
brain
,
she


eye
,
her
ear
,
her
heart
sleep
content
;
they
could
not
wake
to
work
,


so
lethargy
be
their
Paradise
.




three
week
of
that
vacation
be
hot
,
fair
,
and
dry
,
but
the
fourth


and
fifth
be
tempestuous
and
wet
.
I
do
not
know
why
that
change
in


the
atmosphere
make
a
cruel
impression
on
I
,
why
the
rage
storm
and


beat
rain
crush
I
with
a
deadly
paralysis
than
I
have


experienced
while
the
air
have
remain
serene
;
but
so
it
be
;
and
my


nervous
system
could
hardly
support
what
it
have
for
many
day
and


night
to
undergo
in
that
huge
empty
house
.
how
I
use
to
pray
to


Heaven
for
consolation
and
support
!
with
what
dread
force
the


conviction
would
grasp
I
that
Fate
be
my
permanent
foe
,
never
to
be


conciliate
.
I
do
not
,
in
my
heart
,
arraign
the
mercy
or
justice
of


God
for
this
;
I
conclude
it
to
be
a
part
of
his
great
plan
that
some


must
deeply
suffer
while
they
live
,
and
I
thrill
in
the
certainty


that
of
this
number
,
I
be
one
.




it
be
some
relief
when
an
aunt
of
the
cretin
,
a
kind
old
woman
,
come


one
day
,
and
take
away
my
strange
,
deform
companion
.
the
hapless


creature
have
be
at
time
a
heavy
charge
;
I
could
not
take
she
out


beyond
the
garden
,
and
I
could
not
leave
she
a
minute
alone
:
for
she


poor
mind
,
like
her
body
,
be
warp
:
its
propensity
be
to
evil
.
a


vague
bent
to
mischief
,
an
aimless
malevolence
,
make
constant
vigilance


indispensable
.
as
she
very
rarely
speak
,
and
would
sit
for
hour


together
mope
and
mow
,
and
distort
her
feature
with


indescribable
grimace
,
it
be
more
like
be
prisone
with
some


strange
tameless
animal
,
than
associate
with
a
human
being
.
then


there
be
personal
attention

which
require
the
nerve


of
a
hospital
nurse
;
my
resolution
be
so
tried
,
it
sometimes
fall


dead
-
sick
.
these
duty
should
not
have
fall
on
I
;
a
servant
,
now


absent
,
have
render
they
hitherto
,
and
in
the
hurry
of
holiday


departure
,
no
substitute
to
fill
this
office
have
be
provide
.
this


tax
and
trial
be
by
no
means
the
least
I
have
know
in
life
.
still
,


menial
and
distasteful
as
they
be
,
my
mental
pain
be
far
more


waste
and
wear
.
attendance
on
the
cretin
deprive
I
often
of
the


power
and
inclination
to
swallow
a
meal
,
and
send
I
faint
to
the
fresh


air
,
and
the
well
or
fountain
in
the
court
;
but
this
duty
never
wring


my
heart
,
or
brim
my
eye
,
or
scald
my
cheek
with
tear
hot
as


molten
metal
.




the
cretin
be
go
,
I
be
free
to
walk
out
.
at
first
I
lack


courage
to
venture
very
far
from
the
Rue
Fossette
,
but
by
degree
I


seek
the
city
gate
,
and
pass
they
,
and
then
go
wander
away


far
along
chaussee
,
through
field
,
beyond
cemetery
,
catholic
and


protestant
,
beyond
farmstead
,
to
lane
and
little
wood
,
and
I
know


not
where
.
a
goad
thrust
I
on
,
a
fever
forbid
I
to
rest
;
a
want
of


companionship
maintain
in
my
soul
the
craving
of
a
most
deadly


famine
.
I
often
walk
all
day
,
through
the
burn
noon
and
the
arid


afternoon
,
and
the
dusk
evening
,
and
come
back
with
moonrise
.




while
wander
in
solitude
,
I
would
sometimes
picture
the
present


probable
position
of
other
,
my
acquaintance
.
there
be
Madame
Beck
at


a
cheerful
watering
-
place
with
her
child
,
her
mother
,
and
a
whole


troop
of
friend
who
have
seek
the
same
scene
of
relaxation
.
Zelie
St.


Pierre
be
at
Paris
,
with
her
relative
;
the
other
teacher
be
at


their
home
.
there
be
Ginevra
Fanshawe
,
whom
certain
of
she


connection
have
carry
on
a
pleasant
tour
southward
.
Ginevra
seem
to


I
the
happy
.
she
be
on
the
route
of
beautiful
scenery
;
these


September
sun
shine
for
she
on
fertile
plain
,
where
harvest
and


vintage
mature
under
their
mellow
beam
.
these
gold
and
crystal
moon


rise
on
her
vision
over
blue
horizon
wave
in
mount
line
.




but
all
this
be
nothing
;
I
too
feel
those
autumn
sun
and
see
those


harvest
moon
,
and
I
almost
wish
to
be
cover
in
with
earth
and


turf
,
deep
out
of
their
influence
;
for
I
could
not
live
in
their
light
,


nor
make
they
comrade
,
nor
yield
they
affection
.
but
Ginevra
have
a


kind
of
spirit
with
she
,
empower
to
give
constant
strength
and


comfort
,
to
gladden
daylight
and
embalm
darkness
;
the
good
of
the
good


genius
that
guard
humanity
curtain
she
with
his
wing
,
and
canopy


her
head
with
his
bend
form
.
by
True
Love
be
Ginevra
follow
:


never
could
she
be
alone
.
be
she
insensible
to
this
presence
?
it


seem
to
I
impossible
:
I
could
not
realize
such
deadness
.
I
imagine


her
grateful
in
secret
,
love
now
with
reserve
;
but
purpose
one
day


to
show
how
much
she
love
:
I
picture
her
faithful
hero
half
conscious


of
her
coy
fondness
,
and
comfort
by
that
consciousness
:
I
conceive


an
electric
chord
of
sympathy
between
they
,
a
fine
chain
of
mutual


understanding
,
sustain
union
through
a
separation
of
a
hundred


league
--
carry
,
across
mound
and
hollow
,
communication
by
prayer
and


wish
.
Ginevra
gradually
become
with
I
a
sort
of
heroine
.
one
day
,


perceive
this
grow
illusion
,
I
say
,
"
I
really
believe
my
nerve


be
getting
overstretch
:
my
mind
have
suffer
somewhat
too
much
a


malady
be
grow
upon
it
--
what
shall
I
do
?
how
shall
I
keep
well
?
"




indeed
there
be
no
way
to
keep
well
under
the
circumstance
.
at
last
a


day
and
night
of
peculiarly
agonize
depression
be
succeed
by


physical
illness
,
I
take
perforce
to
my
bed
.
about
this
time
the
indian


summer
close
and
the
equinoctial
storm
begin
;
and
for
nine
dark
and


wet
day
,
of
which
the
hour
rush
on
all
turbulent
,
deaf
,


dishevel
--
bewildered
with
sound
hurricane
--
I
lie
in
a
strange


fever
of
the
nerve
and
blood
.
Sleep
go
quite
away
.
I
use
to
rise
in


the
night
,
look
round
for
she
,
beseech
she
earnestly
to
return
.
a


rattle
of
the
window
,
a
cry
of
the
blast
only
reply
---
sleep
never


come
!




I
err
.
she
come
once
,
but
in
anger
.
Impatient
of
my
importunity
she


bring
with
she
an
avenge
dream
.
by
the
clock
of
St.
Jean
Baptiste
,


that
dream
remain
scarce
fifteen
minute
--
a
brief
space
,
but


suffice
to
wring
my
whole
frame
with
unknown
anguish
;
to
confer
a


nameless
experience
that
have
the
hue
,
the
mien
,
the
terror
,
the
very


tone
of
a
visitation
from
eternity
.
between
twelve
and
one
that
night
a


cup
be
force
to
my
lip
,
black
,
strong
,
strange
,
draw
from
no
well
,


but
fill
up
seethe
from
a
bottomless
and
boundless
sea
.
suffering
,


brew
in
temporal
or
calculable
measure
,
and
mix
for
mortal
lip
,


taste
not
as
this
suffering
taste
.
having
drank
and
wake
,
I
think


all
be
over
:
the
end
come
and
past
by
.
tremble
fearfully
--
as


consciousness
return
--
ready
to
cry
out
on
some
fellow
-
creature
to


help
I
,
only
that
I
know
no
fellow
-
creature
be
near
enough
to
catch


the
wild
summon
--
Goton
in
her
far
distant
attic
could
not
hear
--
I
rise


on
my
knee
in
bed
.
some
fearful
hour
go
over
I
:
indescribably
be


I
tear
,
rack
and
oppress
in
mind
.
amidst
the
horror
of
that
dream


I
think
the
bad
lie
here
.
methought
the
well
-
love
dead
,
who
have


love
_
I
_
well
in
life
,
meet
I
elsewhere
,
alienated
:
gall
be
my


inmost
spirit
with
an
unutterable
sense
of
despair
about
the
future
.


Motive
there
be
none
why
I
should
try
to
recover
or
wish
to
live
;
and


yet
quite
unendurable
be
the
pitiless
and
haughty
voice
in
which
death


challenge
I
to
engage
his
unknown
terror
.
when
I
try
to
pray
I


could
only
utter
these
word
:
"
from
my
youth
up
Thy
terror
have
I


suffer
with
a
troubled
mind
.
"




most
true
be
it
.




on
bring
I
my
tea
next
morning
Goton
urge
I
to
call
in
a
doctor
.


I
would
not
:
I
think
no
doctor
could
cure
I
.




one
evening
--
and
I
be
not
delirious
:
I
be
in
my
sane
mind
,
I
get


up
--
I
dress
myself
,
weak
and
shake
.
the
solitude
and
the
stillness


of
the
long
dormitory
could
not
be
bear
any
long
;
the
ghastly
white


bed
be
turn
into
spectre
--
the
coronal
of
each
become
a


death's
-
head
,
huge
and
sun
-
bleach
--
dead
dream
of
an
eld
world
and


mighty
race
lie
freeze
in
their
wide
gape
eyehole
.
that
evening


more
firmly
than
ever
fasten
into
my
soul
the
conviction
that
Fate


be
of
stone
,
and
hope
a
false
idol
--
blind
,
bloodless
,
and
of
granite


core
.
I
feel
,
too
,
that
the
trial
God
have
appoint
I
be
gain
its


climax
,
and
must
now
be
turn
by
my
own
hand
,
hot
,
feeble
,
tremble


as
they
be
.
it
rain
still
,
and
blow
;
but
with
more
clemency
,
I


think
,
than
it
have
pour
and
rage
all
day
.
Twilight
be
fall
,


and
I
deem
its
influence
pitiful
;
from
the
lattice
I
see
come


night
-
cloud
trail
low
like
banner
droop
.
it
seem
to
I
that


at
this
hour
there
be
affection
and
sorrow
in
Heaven
above
for
all


pain
suffer
on
earth
beneath
;
the
weight
of
my
dreadful
dream
become


alleviate
--
that
insufferable
thought
of
be
no
more
love
--
no
more


own
,
half
-
yield
to
hope
of
the
contrary
--
I
be
sure
this
hope
would


shine
clear
if
I
get
out
from
under
this
house
-
roof
,
which
be


crush
as
the
slab
of
a
tomb
,
and
go
outside
the
city
to
a
certain


quiet
hill
,
a
long
way
distant
in
the
field
.
cover
with
a
cloak
(
I


could
not
be
delirious
,
for
I
have
sense
and
recollection
to
put
on
warm


clothing
)
,
forth
I
set
.
the
bell
of
a
church
arrest
I
in
pass
;


they
seem
to
call
I
in
to
the
_
salut
_
,
and
I
go
in
.
any
solemn


rite
,
any
spectacle
of
sincere
worship
,
any
opening
for
appeal
to
God


be
as
welcome
to
I
then
as
bread
to
one
in
extremity
of
want
.
I
knelt


down
with
other
on
the
stone
pavement
.
it
be
an
old
solemn
church
,


its
pervading
gloom
not
gild
but
purple
by
light
shed
through


stained
glass
.




few
worshipper
be
assemble
,
and
,
the
_
salut
_
over
,
half
of
they


depart
.
I
discover
soon
that
those
leave
remain
to
confess
.
I
do


not
stir
.
carefully
every
door
of
the
church
be
shut
;
a
holy
quiet


sink
upon
,
and
a
solemn
shade
gather
about
we
.
after
a
space
,


breathless
and
spend
in
prayer
,
a
penitent
approach
the
confessional
.


I
watch
.
she
whisper
her
avowal
;
her
shrift
be
whisper
back
;
she


return
console
.
another
go
,
and
another
.
a
pale
lady
,
kneel


near
I
,
say
in
a
low
,
kind
voice:--"go
you
now
,
I
be
not
quite


prepare
.
"




mechanically
obedient
,
I
rise
and
go
.
I
know
what
I
be
about
;
my


mind
have
run
over
the
intent
with
lightning
-
speed
.
to
take
this
step


could
not
make
I
more
wretched
than
I
be
;
it
might
soothe
I
.




the
priest
within
the
confessional
never
turn
his
eye
to
regard
I
;


he
only
quietly
incline
his
ear
to
my
lip
.
he
might
be
a
good
man
,


but
this
duty
have
become
to
he
a
sort
of
form
:
he
go
through
it
with


the
phlegm
of
custom
.
I
hesitate
;
of
the
formula
of
confession
I
be


ignorant
:
instead
of
commence
,
then
,
with
the
prelude
usual
,
I


said:--"Mon
pere
,
je
suis
Protestante
.
"




he
directly
turn
.
he
be
not
a
native
priest
:
of
that
class
,
the
cast


of
physiognomy
be
,
almost
invariably
,
grovel
:
I
see
by
his
profile


and
brow
he
be
a
frenchman
;
though
grey
and
advanced
in
year
,
he
do


not
,
I
think
,

as
soon

I
have

of
walk
into
a


babylonish
furnace

that
priest

a

french
kindness

to
whose


softness
I

impervious

some


sort

hardly
any

a
fibre

I
could
rely
on
my
force
wholly
to
withstand
.
have
I
go


to
he
,
he
would
have
show
I
all
that
be
tender
,
and
comforting
,
and


gentle
,
in
the
honest
popish
superstition
.
then
he
would
have
try
to


kindle
,
blow
and
stir
up
in
I
the
zeal
of
good
work
.
I
know
not
how


it
would
all
have
end
.
we
all
think
ourselves
strong
in
some
point
;


we
all
know
ourselves
weak
in
many
;
the
probability
be
that
have
I


visit

at
the
hour

I


might
just
now
,
instead

write
this
heretic
narrative
,
be
count


my
bead
in
the
cell
of
a
certain
Carmelite
convent
on
the
Boulevard
of


Crecy
,
in
Villette
.
there
be
something
of
Fenelon
about
that
benign


old
priest
;
and
whatever
most
of
his
brother
may
be
,
and
whatever
I


may
think
of
his
Church
and
creed
(
and
I
like
neither
)
,
of
himself
I


must
ever
retain
a
grateful
recollection
.
he
be
kind
when
I
need


kindness
;
he
do
I
good
.
may
Heaven
bless
he

Twilight
have
pass
into
night
,
and
the
lamp
be
light
in
the
street


ere
I
issue
from
that
sombre
church
.
to
turn
back

now
become


possible
to
I

the


little
hill
far
without

have
cease
to
be
an
imperative


impulse
,
and
be
soften
into
a
wish
with
which
reason
could
cope
:
she


put
it
down
,
and
I
turn
,
as
I
think
,
to
the
Rue
Fossette
.
but
I
have


become
involved
in
a
part
of
the
city
with
which
I
be
not
familiar
;
it


be
the
old
part
,
and
full
of
narrow
street
of
picturesque
,
ancient
,


and
moulder
house
.
I
be
much
too
weak
to
be
very
collect
,
and
I


be
still
too
careless
of
my
own
welfare
and
safety
to
be
cautious
;
I


grow
embarrassed
;
I
got
immeshe
in
a
network
of
turn
unknown
.
I
be


lose
and
have
no
resolution
to
ask
guidance
of
any
passenger
.




if
the
storm
have
lull
a
little
at
sunset
,
it
make
up
now
for
lose


time
.
strong
and
horizontal
thunder
the
current
of
the
wind
from


north
-
west
to
south
-
east
;
it
bring
rain
like
spray
,
and
sometimes
a


sharp
hail
,
like
shoot
:
it
be
cold
and
pierce
I
to
the
vital
.
I
bend


my
head
to
meet
it
,
but
it
beat
I
back
.
my
heart
do
not
fail
at
all


in
this
conflict
;
I
only
wish
that
I
have
wing
and
could
ascend
the


gale
,
spread
and
repose
my
pinion
on
its
strength
,
career
in
its


course
,
sweep
where
it
sweep
.
while
wish
this
,
I
suddenly
feel


colder
where
before
I
be
cold
,
and
more
powerless
where
before
I
be


weak
.
I
try
to
reach
the
porch
of
a
great
building
near
,
but
the
mass


of
frontage
and
the
giant
spire
turn
black
and
vanish
from
my
eye
.


instead
of
sink
on
the
step
as
I
intend
,
I
seem
to
pitch


headlong
down
an
abyss
.
I
remember
no
more

greet
each

,
not
in
an
embrace
,
but
a


rack
sort
of
struggle
.
the
return

upon

as
if

blood

suspend
hearing
rush
back
loud
,

thunder

consciousness
revive
in
fear

I
sit
up
appalled
,
wonder


into
what
region
,
amongst
what
strange
being
I
be
wake
.
at
first
I


know
nothing
I
look
on
:
a
wall
be
not
a
wall
--
a
lamp
not
a
lamp
.
I


should
have
understand
what
we
call
a
ghost
,
as
well
as
I
do
the


common
object
:
which
be
another
way
of
intimating
that
all
my
eye


rest
on
strike
it
as
spectral
.
but
the
faculty
soon
settle
each
in


his
place
;
the
life

machine
presently
resume

still
,
I
know
not
where
I
be

only
in
time
I
see
I
have
be
remove


from
the
spot

I
fall

I
lie
on
no

into
some
house

have


be
carry

but
what
house
?




I
could
only
think
of
the
pensionnat
in
the
Rue
Fossette
.
still


half
-
dream
,
I
try
hard
to
discover
in
what
room
they
have
put
I
;


whether
the
great
dormitory
,
or
one
of
the
little
dormitory
.
I
be


puzzle
,
because
I
could
not
make
the
glimpse
of
furniture
I
see


accord
with
my
knowledge
of
any
of
these

the
empty
white


bed

other
seat

to

on
I
by
degree

at
last
I


take
in
the
complete
fact
of
a
pleasant
parlour
,
with
a
wood
fire
on
a


clear

shine
hearth

a
carpet

arabesque
of
bright

relieve


a
ground

shaded
fawn

with

this
mirror

myself
lay

in

on
a
sofa

I
look
spectral

eye


large

hollow
,
my
hair
dark
than
be
natural
,
by
contrast


with
my
thin
and
ashen
face
.
it
be
obvious
,
not
only
from
the


furniture
,
but
from
the
position
of
window
,
door
,
and
fireplace
,
that


this
be
an
unknown
room
in
an
unknown
house
.




hardly
less
plain
be
it
that
my
brain
be
not
yet
settle
;
for
,
as
I


gaze
at
the
blue
arm
-
chair
,
it
appear
to
grow
familiar
;
so
do
a


certain
scroll
-
couch
,
and
not
less
so
the
round
centre
-
table
,
with
a


blue
-
covering
,
border
with
autumn
-
tint
foliage
;
and
,
above
all
,
two


little
footstool
with
work
cover
,
and
a
small
ebony
-
frame
chair
,


of
which
the
seat
and
back
be
also
work
with
group
of
brilliant


flower
on
a
dark
ground
.




strike
with
these
thing
,
I
explore
far
.
strange
to
say
,
old


acquaintance
be
all
about
I
,
and
"
auld
lang
syne
"
smile
out
of


every
nook
.
there
be
two
oval
miniature
over
the
mantel
-
piece
,
of


which
I
know
by
heart
the
pearl
about
the
high
and
powdered
"
head
;
"


the
velvet
circle
the
white
throat
;
the
swell
of
the
full
muslin


kerchief
:
the
pattern
of
the
lace
sleeve
-
ruffle
.
upon
the


mantel
-
shelf
there
be
two
china
vase
,
some
relic
of
a
diminutive


tea
-
service
,
as
smooth
as
enamel
and
as
thin
as
egg
-
shell
,
and
a
white


centre
ornament
,
a
classic
group
in
alabaster
,
preserve
under
glass
.


of
all
these
thing
I
could
have
tell
the
peculiarity
,
number
the


flaw
or
crack
,
like
any
_
clairvoyante
_
.
above
all
,
there
be
a
pair


of
handscreen
,
with
elaborate
pencil
-
drawing
finish
like
line


engraving
;
these
,
my
very
eye
ache
at
beholding
again
,
recall


hour
when
they
have
follow
,
stroke
by
stroke
and
touch
by
touch
,
a


tedious
,
feeble
,
finical
,
school
-
girl
pencil
hold
in
these
finger
,
now


so
skeleton
-
like
.




where
be
I
?
not
only
in
what
spot
of
the
world
,
but
in
what
year
of


our
Lord
?
for
all
these
object
be
of
past
day
,
and
of
a
distant


country
.
ten
year
ago
I
bid
they
good
-
by
;
since
my
fourteenth
year


they
and
I
have
never
meet
.
I
gasp
audibly
,
"
where
be
I
?
"




a
shape
hitherto
unnoticed
,
stir
,
rise
,
come
forward
:
a
shape


inharmonious
with
the
environment
,
serve
only
to
complicate
the


riddle
far
.
this
be
no
more
than
a
sort
of
native
bonne
,
in
a


common
-
place
bonne
's
cap
and
print
-
dress
.
she
speak
neither
french
nor


English
,
and
I
could
get
no
intelligence
from
she
,
not
understand


her
phrase
of
dialect
.
but
she
bathe
my
temple
and
forehead
with


some
cool
and
perfume
water
,
and
then
she
heighten
the
cushion
on


which
I
recline
,
make
sign
that
I
be
not
to
speak
,
and
resume
she


post
at
the
foot
of
the
sofa
.




she
be
busy
knitting
;
her
eye
thus
draw
from
I
,
I
could
gaze
on
she


without
interruption
.
I
do
mightily
wonder
how
she
come
there
,
or
what


she
could
have
to
do
among
the
scene
,
or
with
the
day
of
my
girlhood
.


still
more
I
marvel
what
those
scene
and
day
could
now
have
to
do


with
I
.




too
weak
to
scrutinize
thoroughly
the
mystery
,
I
try
to
settle
it
by


say
it
be
a
mistake
,
a
dream
,
a
fever
-
fit
;
and
yet
I
know
there


could
be
no
mistake
,
and
that
I
be
not
sleep
,
and
I
believe
I
be


sane
.
I
wish
the
room
have
not
be
so
well
light
,
that
I
might
not


so
clearly
have
see
the
little
picture
,
the
ornament
,
the
screen
,


the
work
chair
.
all
these
object
,
as
well
as
the
blue
-
damask


furniture
,
be
,
in
fact
,
precisely
the
same
,
in
every
minute
detail
,


with
those
I
so
well
remember
,
and
with
which
I
have
be
so


thoroughly
intimate
,
in
the
drawing
-
room
of
my
godmother
's
house
at


Bretton
.
methought
the
apartment
only
be
change
,
be
of
different


proportion
and
dimension
.




I
think
of
Bedreddin
Hassan
,
transport
in
his
sleep
from
Cairo
to


the
gate
of
Damascus
.
have
a
Genius
stoop
his
dark
wing
down
the


storm
to
whose
stress
I
have
succumb
,
and
gather
I
from
the


church
-
step
,
and
"
rise
high
into
the
air
,
"
as
the
eastern
tale
say
,


have
he
bear
I
over
land
and
ocean
,
and
lay
I
quietly
down
beside
a


hearth
of
Old
England
?
but
no
;
I
know
the
fire
of
that
hearth
burn


before
its
Lares
no
more
--
it
go
out
long
ago
,
and
the
household
god


have
be
carry
elsewhere
.




the
bonne
turn
again
to
survey
I
,
and
see
my
eye
wide
open
,
and
,


I
suppose
,
deem
their
expression
perturb
and
excited
,
she
put
down


her
knitting
.
I
see
she
busy
for
a
moment
at
a
little
stand
;
she


pour
out
water
,
and
measured
drop
from
a
phial
:
glass
in
hand
,
she


approach
I
.
what
dark
-
tinge
draught
might
she
now
be
offer
?
what


genii
-
elixir
or
Magi
-
distillation
?




it
be
too
late
to
inquire
--
I
have
swallow
it
passively
,
and
at
once
.


a
tide
of
quiet
thought
now
come
gently
caress
my
brain
;
soft
and


soft
rise
the
flow
,
with
tepid
undulation
smooth
than
balm
.
the


pain
of
weakness
leave
my
limb
,
my
muscle
sleep
.
I
lose
power
to
move
;


but
,
lose
at
the
same
time
wish
,
it
be
no
privation
.
that
kind
bonne


place
a
screen
between
I
and
the
lamp
;
I
see
her
rise
to
do
this
,
but


do
not
remember
see
she
resume
her
place
:
in
the
interval
between


the
two

the
leaden
gloom
of
raw
and

I
feel
sure
now
that
I
be
in
the
pensionnat

sure


by
the
beat
rain
on

whiteness

solitude

which
I
lie

I

_
whiteness_--for
the


dimity
curtain

before
a
french
bed
,
bound
my
view

lift

look
out

of

long

reader
;
I
feel
alarmed

why
?
you
will
ask
.
what
be
there
in
this


simple
and
somewhat
pretty
sleep
-
closet
to
startle
the
most
timid
?


merely
this
--
these
article
of

could
not
be
real
,
solid


arm
-
chair
,
look
-
glass
,
and
washstand
--
they
must
be
the
ghost
of


such
article
;

,
if
this
be
deny
as
too
wild
an
hypothesis
--
and
,


confound
as
I
be
,
I
_
do
_
deny
it
--
there
remain
but
to
conclude


that
I
have
myself
pass
into
an
abnormal
state
of
mind
;
in
short
,
that


I
be
very
ill
and
delirious
:
and
even
then
,
mine
be
the
strange


figment
with
which
delirium
have
ever
harass
a
victim
.




I
know
--
I
be
oblige
to
know
--
the
green
chintz
of
that
little
chair
;


the
little
snug
chair
itself
,
the
carved
,
shine

black
,
foliated
frame


of

the
smooth

of
the
china
vessel
on
the

the
very
stand
too
,
with
its
top
of
grey
marble
,
splinter
at


one
corner;--all
these
I
be
compel
to
recognise

to
hail
,

last
night
I
have
,
perforce

recognise

hail
the
rosewood

Bretton
!
Bretton
!
and
ten
year

shine
reflect
in
that

and


why
do
Bretton
and
my
fourteenth
year
haunt
I
thus
?
why
,
if
they
come


at
all
,
do
they
not
return
complete
?
why
hover
before
my
distemper


vision
the
mere
furniture
,
while
the
room

the
locality
be
go

have
make
it
myself

rise
with
a
start
from
the


bed

I
take
the

it

I
mutter
;
and
hastily
pull
up


the
blind
with
which
the
lattice
be
shroud
,
I
look
out
to
try
and


discover
_
where
_
I
be
;
half
-
prepared
to
meet
the
calm
,
old
,
handsome


building
and
clean
grey
pavement
of
St.
Ann

at


the

,
if
otherwise

fully
expectant
of


a
town

somewhere
,
a
rue
in
Villette
,
if
not
a
street
in
a
pleasant


and
ancient
english
city

I
look
,
on
the
contrary
,
through
a
frame
of
leafage
,
cluster
round


the
high
lattice
,
and
forth
thence
to
a
grassy
mead

terrace
with

from
the

for
many
a
day
.
they
be
now


groan
under
the
gale
of
October
,
and
between
their
trunk
I
trace


the
line
of
an
avenue
,
where
yellow
leave
lie
in
heap
and
drift
,
or


be
whirl
singly
before
the
sweeping
west
wind
.
whatever
landscape


might
lie
far
must
have
be
flat
,
and
these
tall
beech
shut
it


out
.
the
place
seem
seclude
,
and
be
to
I
quite
strange
:

do
not


know
it
at
all
.




once
more
I
lie
down

my
bed
stand
in
a
little
alcove
;
on
turn
my


face
to
the
wall

the
room
with
its
bewildering
accompaniment
become


exclude
.

no
!
for
as
I
arrange
my
position
in
this
hope

behold
,
on
the
green
space
between
the
divided

up

a
sketch

in

colour

a
head
,
a


boy
's
head
,
fresh
,
life
-
like
,
speak
,
and
animate
.
it
seem
a
youth


of
sixteen
,
fair

complexion
,
with
sanguine
health
in
his
cheek
;
hair


long
,
not
dark
,
and
with
a
sunny
sheen
;
penetrate
eye
,
an
arch


mouth
,
and
a
gay
smile
.
on
the
whole
a
most
pleasant
face
to
look
at
,

for
,
those

a
right
to
that
youth
's


affection
--
parent
,
for
instance
,

sister
.
any
romantic
little


school
-
girl
might
almost
have
love
it
in
its
frame
.
those
eye
look


as
if
when
somewhat
old
they
would
flash
a
lightning
-
response
to


love
:
I
can
not
tell
whether
they
keep
in
store
the
steady
-
beam
shine


of
faith
.
for
whatever
sentiment
meet
he
in
form
too
facile
,
his
lip


menace
,
beautifully
but
surely
,
caprice
and
light
esteem
.




strive
to
take
each
new
discovery
as
quietly
as
I
could
,
I
whisper


to
myself--




"
ah

portrait

hang
in
the
breakfast

room

mantel

piece

somewhat
too
high

I
think
.
I
well
remember
how
I


use
to
mount
a
music

stool

the
purpose
of
unhook
it
,
hold
it


in

search
into
those
bonny
well
of
eye
,
whose
glance


under
their
hazel
lash
seem
like
a
pencil
laugh
;

well
I


like
to
note
the
colouring
of
the
cheek
,

the
expression
of
the


mouth
.
"
I
hardly
believe
fancy
could
improve
on
the
curve
of
that


mouth

of
the
chin

even
_
my
_
ignorance
know
that
both
be


beautiful

ponder
perplexed
over
this
doubt
:
"
how
it

long

at

tremble
through
her
sensitive
eye

portly
,
she


be
alert
,

be
at

good
health

excellent
temperament

she
listen

listen
for
her
son

she
be


not
the
woman
ever
to
confess
herself
uneasy
,

there
be
yet
no
lull


in
the
weather

if
Graham
be
out
in
that
hoarse
wind

still
unsatisfied

I
well
know

she

at

then
,
in


another
minute
,
a
lifting
of
her
eye
from
the
page
,
and
a
slight


inclination
of
her
head
towards
the
door

denote
that
she
hear
some


sound

presently
her
brow
clear
;

then
even
my
ear
,
less

catch
the
iron
clash

there

it

I
ascertain
this
identity
scarcely
with
surprise
.
what
be


more
,
when
I
hear
Graham
's
step
on
the
stair
,
I
know
what
manner
of


figure
would
enter
,
and
for
whose
aspect
to
prepare
my
eye

the


discovery
be
not
of
to
-
day
,
its
dawn
have
penetrate
my
perception


long
since
.
of
course
I
remember
young
Bretton
well
;
and
though
ten


year
(
from
sixteen
to
twenty
-
six
)
may
greatly
change
the
boy
as
they


mature
he
to
the
man
,
yet
they
could
bring
no
such
utter
difference
as


would
suffice
wholly
to
blind
my
eye
,
or
baffle
my
memory
.
Dr.
John


Graham
Bretton
retain
still
an
affinity
to
the
youth
of
sixteen
:
he


have
his
eye
;
he
have
some
of
his
feature
;
to
wit
,
all
the


excellently
-
mould
low
half
of
the
face
;
I
find
he
out
soon
.
I


first
recognise
he
on
that
occasion
,
note
several
chapter
back
,


when
my
unguardedly
-
fix
attention
have
draw
on
I
the
mortification


of
an
imply
rebuke
.
subsequent
observation
confirm
,
in
every
point
,


that
early
surmise
.
I
trace
in
the
gesture
,
the
port
,
and
the
habit


of
his
manhood
,
all
his
boy
's
promise
.
I
hear
in
his
now
deep
tone


the
accent
of
former
day
.
certain
turn
of
phrase
,
peculiar
to
he
of


old
,
be
peculiar
to
he
still
;
and
so
be
many
a
trick
of
eye
and


lip
,
many
a
smile
,
many
a
sudden
ray
level
from
the
irid
,
under
his


well
-
character
brow
.




to
_
say
_
anything
on
the
subject
,
to
_
hint
_
at
my
discovery
,
have
not


suit
my
habit
of
thought
,
or
assimilate
with
my
system
of
feeling
.


on
the
contrary
,
I
have
prefer
to
keep
the
matter
to
myself
.
I
like


enter
his
presence
cover
with
a
cloud
he
have
not
see
through
,


while
he
stand
before
I
under
a
ray
of
special
illumination
which


shine
all
partial
over
his
head
,
tremble
about
his
foot
,
and
cast


light
no
far
.




well
I
know
that
to
he
it
could
make
little
difference
,
be
I
to
come


forward
and
announce
,
"

so
I
keep
back
in
my


teacher

place
;

as
he
never
ask
my
name

so
I
never
give
it

he


hear
I

wonder
what
personal
or
facial
enormity
in
I
prove
so
magnetic
to


your
usually
avert
eye

you

how
it
be
now

and
here
Mrs.
Bretton
break
in
with
many
,
many
question
about
past


time
;
and
for
her
satisfaction
I
have
to
recur
to
go
-
by
trouble
,
to


explain
cause
of
seem
estrangement
,
to
touch
on
single
-
handed


conflict
with
Life
,
with
Death
,
with
Grief
,
with
Fate
.
Dr.
John


listen
,
say
little
.
he
and
she
then
tell
I
of
change
they
have


know
:
even
with
they
all
have
not
go
smoothly
,
and
fortune
have


retrench
she
once
abundant
gift
.
but
so
courageous
a
mother
,
with


such
a
champion
in
her
son
,
be
well
fit
to
fight
a
good
fight
with


the
world
,
and
to
prevail
ultimately
.
Dr.
John
himself
be
one
of
those


on
whose
birth
benign
planet
have
certainly
smile
.
adversity
might


set
against
he
her
most
sullen
front
:
he
be
the
man
to
beat
she
down


with
smile
.
strong
and
cheerful
,
and
firm
and
courteous
;
not
rash
,
yet


valiant
;
he
be
the
aspirant
to
woo
Destiny
herself
,
and
to
win
from


her
stone
eyeball
a
beam
almost
love
.




in
the
profession
he
have
adopt
,
his
success
be
now
quite
decide
.


within
the
last
three
month
he
have
take
this
house
(
a
small
chateau
,


they
tell
I
,
about
half
a
league
without
the
Porte
de
Crecy
)
;
this


country
site
be
choose
for
the
sake
of
his
mother
's
health
,
with


which
town
air
do
not
now
agree
.
hither
he
have
invite
Mrs.
Bretton
,


and
she
,
on
leave
England
,
have
bring
with
her
such
residue


furniture
of
the
former
St.
Ann
's
Street
mansion
as
she
have
think
fit


to
keep
unsold
.
hence
my
bewilderment
at
the
phantom
of
chair
,
and


the
wraith
of
look
-
glass
,
tea
-
urn
,
and

.




as
the

stop

"
Miss

he
say
;
"
she
be
begin
to
look
very


pale
.
to

morrow
I
will
venture
to
put
some
question
respect
the


cause
of
her
loss
of
health
.
she
be
much
changed
,
indeed
,
since
last


July
,
when
I
see
her
enact
with
no
little
spirit
the
part
of
a
very


kill
fine
gentleman
.
as
to
last
night
's
catastrophe
,
I
be
sure


thereby
hang
a
tale
,
but
we
will
inquire
no
far
this
evening
.


good
-
night
,
Miss
Lucy
.
"




and
so
he
kindly
lead
I
to
the
door
,
and
hold
a
wax
-
candle
,

I
up
the
one
flight
of

.




when
I
have
say
my
prayer
,
and
when
I
be
undressed
and
lay
down
,
I


feel
that
I
still
have
friend
.

not
profess
vehement


attachment
,
not
offer
the
tender
solace
of
well

match

congenial
relationship
;
on
whom
,
therefore
,

demand

be
to
be
make
,
of

form
;

towards
whom
my
heart
soften
instinctively
,
and
yearn
with
an


importunate
gratitude
,
which
I
entreat
Reason
betime
to
check
.




"

not

I

go
by,--those
hour
which
always
bring
,
even


to
the
necessarily
unoccupied

a
sense
of
business
to
be
do
,
of
task


wait
fulfilment

a
vague
impression

when
this
stir
time
be
past
,
and
the
silent
descent
of


afternoon
hush
housemaid
step
on
the
stair
and
in
the
chamber
,
I


then
pass
into
a
dreamy
mood
,
not
unpleasant
.




my
calm
little
room
seem
somehow
like
a
cave
in
the
sea
.
there
be
no


colour
about
it
,
except
that
white
and
pale
green
,
suggestive
of
foam


and
deep
water
;
the
blanch
cornice
be
adorn
with
shell
-
shape


ornament
,
and
there
be
white
moulding
like
dolphin
in
the


ceiling
-
angle
.
even
that
one
touch
of
colour
visible
in
the
red
satin


pincushion
bore
affinity
to
coral
;
even
that
dark
,
shine
glass
might


have
mirror
a
mermaid
.
when
I
close
my
eye
,
I
hear
a
gale
,


subsiding
at
last
,
bear
upon
the
house
-
front
like
a
settling
swell


upon
a
rock
-
base
.
I
hear
it
draw
and
withdraw
far
,
far
off
,
like
a


tide
retire
from
a
shore
of
the
upper
world
--
a
world
so
high
above


that
the
rush
of
its
large
wave
,
the
dash
of
its
fierce
breaker
,


could
sound
down
in
this
submarine
home
,
only
like
murmur
and
a


lullaby
.




amidst
these
dream
come
evening
,

somewhat

somewhat

in
the
sense
I
painfully
anticipate

an
invisible

a
cold
something

very
slight

very
transparent

very
chill

sort

warm

this

give
note

dissolution

day

continue
friend

he
never
in


discourse
stand
on

ceremony
with
I
.
he
seem
to
know
that


if
he
would
but
talk
about
himself
,
and
about
that
in
which
he
be
most


interested
,
my
expectation
would
always
be
answer
,
my
wish
always


satisfied
.
it
follow
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
that
I
continue
to
hear


much
of
"
Ginevra

sweetness

innocence

,
in

my
plain
prose


knowledge
of
the
reality

a
kind

reflect
glow

to
settle
on


her
idea

still
,
reader

I
be
free
to
confess
,
that
he


often
talk
nonsense
;
but
I
strove
to
be
unfailingly
patient
with
he
.


I
have
have
my
lesson

I
have
learn
how
severe
for
I
be
the
pain
of


crossing
,

grieving

disappoint

in
a
strange
and
new


sense
,
I
grow
most
selfish
,

quite
powerless
to
deny
myself
the


delight
of
indulge
his
mood
,
and
be
pliant
to
his
will
.
he
still


seem
to
I
most
absurd
when
he
obstinately
doubt
,

despond


about
his
power
to
win
in
the
end

can
hardly
tell

he
manage
his

be
numerous

by
dint

he
class
they
in
an
order

leave
he
a
daily
period
of
liberty

I
often
see
he
hard

work
,
yet


seldom
over
-
drive
,
and
never
irritated
,
confused
,

oppress
.
what


he
do
be
accomplish
with
the
ease
and
grace
of
all
-
sufficing


strength
;
with
the
bountiful
cheerfulness
of
high
and
unbroken


energy

under
his
guidance
I
see
,
in
that
one
happy
fortnight
,
more


of
Villette
,
its
environ
,
and
its
inhabitant
,

I
have
see
in
the


whole
eight
month
of
my
previous
residence

he
take
I
to
place

interest

the
town

whose
name
I
have
not
before
so
much
as
hear
;


with
willingness
and
spirit
he
communicate
much
noteworthy


information
.
he
never
seem
to
think
it
a
trouble
to
talk
to
I
,
and
,


I
be
sure
,
it
be
never
a
task
to
I
to
listen
.
it
be
not
his
way
to


treat
subject
coldly
and
vaguely
;
he
rarely
generalize
,
never
prose
.


he
seem
to
like
nice
detail
almost
as
much
as
I
like
they
myself
:


he
seem
observant
of
character
:
and
not
superficially
observant
,


either
.
these
point
give
the
quality
of
interest
to
his
discourse
;
and


the
fact
of
his
speak
direct
from
his
own
resource
,
and
not


borrow
or
steal
from

another

to

a

to

from

yield
of
nutriment
to
his
masculine
self

his
delight

to


feed
that
ravenous
sentiment
,
without

of
the

of

the

be
request
to
note
a
seeming
contradiction
in

Graham

the
public

the
out

in

show
oblivious

consciousness

what
he

what

it
be
hardly
possible
to

Dr.

quietly

in
secret
.
when


you
think
that
the
fabrication
of
some
trifle
dedicated
to
his
use


have
be
achieve
unnoticed
,
and
that
,
like
other
man
,
he
would
use
it


when
place
ready
for
his
use
,
and
never
ask
whence
it
come
,
he
amaze


you
by
a
smilingly
-
uttered
observation
or
two
,
prove
that
his
eye
have


be
on
the
work
from
commencement
to
close
:
that
he
have
note
the


design
,
trace
its
progress
,
and
mark
its
completion
.
it
please
he


to
be
thus
serve
,
and
he
let
his
pleasure
beam
in
his
eye
and
play


about
his
mouth
.




this
would
have
be
all
very
well
,
if
he
have
not
add
to
such
kindly


and
unobtrusive
evidence
a
certain
wilfulness
in
discharge
what
he


call
debt

when
his

a
cordon

themselves

queen

infallibly
turn

fourteen

sixteen

extremely
well
fed

meat

to
say
nothing
of
bread
,

she
have
consume
to
attain
that
breadth

height

that


wealth
of
muscle

affluence
of

lie
half

,

would
be

to

no

I
soon


tired

betook
myself
for
refreshment
to
the
contemplation
of
some


exquisite
little
picture

still
life

flower

water

all
hang
modestly
beneath
that
coarse

preposterous
canvas

suddenly
a
light
tap
visit
my

in

I
have
catch
a
glimpse
of
a
head
too
pretty
to
belong
to
any


other
than
the
redoubte
Colonel
de
Hamal
.
what
a
very
finished
,
highly


polished
little
pate
it
be
!
what
a
figure
,
so
trim
and
natty
!
what


womanish
foot
and
hand
!
how
daintily
he
hold
a
glass
to
one
of
his


optic
!
with
what
admiration
he
gaze
upon
the
Cleopatra
!
and
then
,
how


engagingly
he
titter
and
whisper
a
friend
at
his
elbow
!
oh
,
the
man


of
sense
!
oh
,
the
refined
gentleman
of
superior
taste
and
tact
!
I


observe
he
for
about
ten
minute
,
and
perceive
that
he
be


exceedingly
take
with
this
dusk
and
portly
Venus
of
the
Nile
.
so
much


be
I
interested
in
his
bearing
,
so
absorb
in
divine
his
character


by
his
look
and
movement
,
I
temporarily
forget
M.
Paul
;
in
the


interim
a
group
come
between
that
gentleman
and
I
;

possibly
his


scruple
might
have
receive
another
and
bad
shock
from
my
present


abstraction
,
cause
he
to
withdraw
voluntarily
:
at
any
rate
,
when
I


again
look
round
,
he
be
go
.




my
eye
,
pursuant
of
the
search
,
meet
not
he
,

another
and
dissimilar


figure
,

see
amidst
the
crowd

for
the
height
as
well
as

each
its
distinction
.
this
way
come
Dr.
John
,
in
visage
,
in
shape
,


in
hue
,
as
unlike
the
dark
,
acerb
,
and
caustic
little
professor
,
as
the


fruit
of
the
Hesperides
might
be
unlike
the
sloe
in
the
wild
thicket
;


as
the
high
-
courage
but
tractable
Arabian

rude
and


stubborn
"
sheltie

the

have
just
put
I

I
remain
quiet

yet


another
minute
I
would
watch
.




he
approach
de

he
pause
near
he

I
think
he
have
a
pleasure


in
look
over
his
head
;
Dr.
Bretton
,
too
,
gaze
on
the
Cleopatra
.
I


doubt
if
it
be
to
his
taste
:
he
do
not
simper
like
the
little
Count
;


his
mouth
look
fastidious
,
his
eye
cool
;
without
demonstration
he


step
aside
,
leave
room
for
other
to
approach
.
I
see
now
that
he


be
wait
,
and
,
rise
,
I
join
he
.




we
take
one
turn
round
the
gallery
;
with
Graham
it
be
very
pleasant
to


take
such
a
turn
.
I
always
like
dearly
to
hear
what
he
have
to
say


about
either
picture
or
book
;
because
without
pretend
to
be
a


connoisseur
,
he
always
speak
his
thought
,
and
that
be
sure
to
be


fresh
:
very
often
it
be
also
just
and
pithy
.
it
be
pleasant
also
to


tell
he
some
thing
he
do
not
know
--
he
listen
so
kindly
,
so


teachably
;
unformalize
by
scruple
lest
so
to
bend
his
bright
handsome


head
,
to
gather
a
woman
's
rather
obscure
and
stammering
explanation
,


should
imperil
the
dignity
of
his
manhood
.
and
when
he
communicate


information
in
return
,
it
be
with
a
lucid
intelligence
that
leave
all


his
word
clear
graven
on
the
memory
;
no
explanation
of
his
giving
,
no


fact

his
narrating
,
do
I
ever
forget

as
we
leave

I
ask
he
what
he
think

a
very
vague


notion

its
nature

snug


comfort

the
close

fine
night

cheerful

friendly

sight

the
star

forth

chaussee

passage
through

burn

inspection

we
there
submit

amuse
we
so

these
small

I

peculiarly
exhilarate
charm

how
much
of
it
lie
in
the
atmosphere

friendship
diffuse

animatedly
with
each
other
the

frankly


kind

good
street

brightly
light

more
lively

flow

sobriety

we
alight
under
a
portico
where
there
be
a
great
bustle
and
a
great


crowd
,
but
I
do
not
distinctly
remember
further
detail
,
until
I
find


myself
mount
a
majestic
staircase
wide
and
easy
of
ascent
,
deeply


and
softly
carpet
with
crimson
,
lead
up
to
great
door
close


solemnly
,
and
whose
panel
be
also
crimson
-
clothe
.




I
hardly
notice
by
what
magic
these
door
be
make
to
roll
back
--
Dr.


John
manage
these
point
;
roll
back
they
do
,
however
,
and
within
be


disclose
a
hall
--
grand
,
wide
,
and
high
,
whose
sweeping
circular
wall
,


and
dome
hollow
ceiling
,
seem
to
I
all
dead
gold
(
thus
with
nice


art
be
it
stain
)
,
relieve
by
cornice
,
fluting
,
and
garlandry
,


either
bright
,
like
gold
burnish
,
or
snow
-
white
,
like
alabaster
,
or


white
and
gold
mingle
in
wreath
of
gild
leave
and
spotless
lily
:


wherever
drapery
hang
,
wherever
carpet
be
spread
,
or
cushion


place
,
the
sole
colour
employ
be
deep
crimson
.
pendent
from
the


dome
,
flame
a
mass
that
dazzle
I
--
a
mass
,
I
think
,
of


rock
-
crystal
,
sparkle
with
facet
,
stream
with
drop
,
ablaze
with


star
,
and
gorgeously
tinge
with
dew
of
gem
dissolve
,
or
fragment


of
rainbow
shiver
.
it
be
only
the
chandelier
,
reader
,
but
for
I
it


seem
the
work
of
eastern
genii
:
I
almost
look
to
see
if
a
huge
,


dark
,
cloudy
hand
--
that
of
the
Slave
of
the
Lamp
--
be
not
hover
in


the
lustrous
and
perfume
atmosphere
of
the
cupola
,
guard
its


wondrous
treasure
.




we
move
on
--
I
be
not
at
all
conscious
whither
--
but
at
some
turn
we


suddenly
encounter
another
party
approach
from
the
opposite


direction
.
I
just
now
see
that
group
,
as
it
flash
--
upon
I
for
one


moment
.
a
handsome
middle
-
aged
lady
in
dark
velvet
;
a
gentleman
who


might
be
her
son
--
the
good
face
,
the
fine
figure
,
I
think
,
I
have


ever
see
;
a
third
person
in
a
pink
dress
and
black
lace
mantle
.




I
note
they
all
--
the
third
person
as
well
as
the
other
two
--
and
for


the
fraction
of
a
moment
believe
they
all
stranger
,
thus
receive
an


impartial
impression
of
their
appearance
.
but
the
impression
be
hardly


feel
and
not
fix
,
before
the
consciousness
that
I
face
a
great


mirror
,
fill
a
compartment
between
two
pillar
,
dispel
it
:
the


party
be
our
own
party
.
thus
for
the
first
,
and
perhaps
only
time
in


my
life
,
I
enjoy
the
"
giftie
"
of
see
myself
as
other
see
I
.
no


need
to
dwell
on
the
result
.
it
bring
a
jar
of
discord
,
a
pang
of


regret
;
it
be
not
flattering
,
yet
,
after
all
,
I
ought
to
be
thankful
;


it
might
have
be
bad
.




at
last
,
we
be
seat
in
place
command
a
good
general
view
of


that
vast
and
dazzling
,
but
warm
and
cheerful
hall
.
already
it
be


fill
,
and
fill
with
a
splendid
assemblage
.
I
do
not
know
that
the


woman
be
very
beautiful
,
but
their
dress
be
so
perfect
;
and


foreigner
,
even
such
as
be
ungraceful
in
domestic
privacy
,
seem
to


posse
the
art
of
appear
graceful
in
public
:
however
blunt
and


boisterous
those
every
-
day
and
home
movement
connect
with
peignoir


and
papillote
,
there
be
a
slide
,
a
bend
,
a
carriage
of
the
head
and


arm
,
a
mien
of
the
mouth
and
eye
,
keep
nicely
in
reserve
for
gala


use
--
always
bring
out
with
the
grande
toilette
,
and
duly
put
on
with


the
"
parure
.
"




some
fine
form
there
be
here
and
there
,
model
of
a
peculiar
style


of
beauty
;
a
style
,
I
think
,
never
see
in
England
;
a
solid
,
firm
-
set
,


sculptural
style
.
these
shape
have
no
angle
:
a
caryatid
in
marble
be


almost
as
flexible
;
a
phidian
goddess
be
not
more
perfect
in
a
certain


still
and
stately
sort
.
they
have
such
feature
as
the
dutch
painter


give
to
their
madonna
:
low
-
country
classic
feature
,
regular
but


round
,
straight
but
stolid
;
and
for
their
depth
of
expressionless
calm
,


of
passionless
peace
,
a
polar
snow
-
field
could
alone
offer
a
type
.


woman
of
this
order
need
no
ornament
,
and
they
seldom
wear
any
;
the


smooth
hair
,
closely
braid
,
supply
a
sufficient
contrast
to
the


smooth
cheek
and
brow
;
the
dress
can
not
be
too
simple
;
the
rounded


arm
and
perfect
neck
require
neither
bracelet
nor
chain
.




with
one
of
these
beauty
I
once
have
the
honour
and
rapture
to
be


perfectly
acquaint
:
the
inert
force
of
the
deep
,
settle
love
she


bear
herself
,
be
wonderful
;
it
could
only
be
surpass
by
her
proud


impotency
to
care
for
any
other
living
thing
.
of
blood
,
her
cool
vein


conduct
no
flow

placid
lymph
fill
and
almost
obstruct
she


artery

a
Juno

I

describe
sit
full
in
our

a
sort
of
mark


for
all
eye
,

quite
conscious
that
so
she
be

but
proof
to
the


magnetic
influence
of
gaze

glance

cold
,
rounded
,
blonde
,

beauteous

he


could
not
outshine
,
he
flee
.




and
now
all
be
prepare
:
but
one
compartment
of
the
hall
wait
to
be


fill
--
a
compartment
cover
with
crimson
,
like
the
grand
staircase


and
door
,
furnish
with
stuff
and
cushioned
bench
,
range
on
each


side
of
two
regal
chair
,
place
solemnly
under
a
canopy
.




a
signal
be
give
,
the
door
roll
back
,
the
assembly
stand
up
,
the


orchestra
burst
out
,
and
,
to
the
welcome
of
a
choral
burst
,
enter
the


King
,
the
Queen
,
the
Court
of
Labassecour
.




till
then
,
I
have
never
set
eye
on
live
king
or
queen
;
it
may


consequently
be
conjecture
how
I
strain
my
power
of
vision
to
take


in
these
specimen
of
european
royalty
.
by
whomsoever
majesty
be
beheld


for
the
first
time
,
there
will
always
be
experience
a
vague
surprise


border
on
disappointment
,
that
the
same
do
not
appear
seat
,
en


permanence
,
on
a
throne
,
bonnet
with
a
crown
,
and
furnish
,
as
to


the
hand
,
with
a
sceptre
.
look
out
for
a
king
and
queen
,
and
see


only
a
middle
-
aged
soldier
and
a
rather
young
lady
,
I
feel
half


cheat
,
half
pleased
.




well
do
I
recall
that
King
--
a
man
of
fifty
,
a
little
bow
,
a
little


grey
:
there
be
no
face
in
all
that
assembly
which
resemble
his
.
I
have


never
read
,
never
be
tell
anything
of
his
nature
or
his
habit
;
and


at
first
the
strong
hieroglyphic
grave
as
with
iron
stylet
on
his


brow
,
round
his
eye
,
beside
his
mouth
,
puzzle
and
baffle
instinct
.


Ere
long
,
however
,
if
I
do
not
know
,
at
least
I
feel
,
the
meaning
of


those
character
write
without
hand
.
there
sit
a
silent
sufferer
--
a


nervous
,
melancholy
man
.
those
eye
have
look
on
the
visit
of
a


certain
ghost
--
have
long
wait
the
coming
and
going
of
that
strange


spectre
,
Hypochondria
.
perhaps
he
see
she
now
on
that
stage
,
over


against
he
,
amidst
all
that
brilliant
throng
.
Hypochondria
have
that


wo
nt
,
to
rise
in
the
midst
of
thousand
--
dark
as
Doom
,
pale
as
Malady
,


and
well
-
nigh
strong
as
Death
.
her
comrade
and
victim
think
to
be


happy
one
moment--"not
so
,
"
say
she
;
"
I
come
.
"
and
she
freeze
the


blood
in
his
heart
,
and
becloud
the
light
in
his
eye
.




some
might
say
it
be
the
foreign
crown
press
the
King
's
brow
which


bend
they
to
that
peculiar
and
painful
fold
;
some
might
quote
the


effect
of
early
bereavement
.
something
there
might
be
of
both
these
;


but
these
be
embitter
by
that
dark
foe
of


humanity
--
constitutional
melancholy
.
the
Queen
,
his
wife
,
know
this
:
it


seem
to
I
,
the
reflection
of
her
husband
's
grief
lay
,
a
subduing


shadow
,
on
her
own
benignant
face
.
a
mild
,
thoughtful
,
graceful
woman


that
princess
seem
;
not
beautiful
,
not
at
all
like
the
woman
of
solid


charm
and
marble
feeling
describe
a
page
or
two
since
.
Hers
be
a


somewhat
slend
shape
;
her
feature
,
though
distinguish
enough
,
be


too
suggestive
of
reign
dynasty
and
royal
line
to
give


unqualified
pleasure
.
the
expression
clothing
that
profile
be


agreeable
in
the
present
instance
;
but
you
could
not
avoid
connect


it
with
remembered
effigy
,
where
similar
line
appear
,
under
phase


ignoble
;
feeble
,
or
sensual
,
or
cunning
,
as
the
case
might
be
.
the


Queen
's
eye
,
however
,
be
her
own
;
and
pity
,
goodness
,
sweet
sympathy
,


bless
it
with
divinest
light
.
she
move
no
sovereign
,
but
a


lady
--
kind
,
loving
,
elegant
.
her
little
son
,
the
Prince
of
Labassecour
,


and
young
Duc
de
Dindonneau
,
accompany
she
:
he
lean
on
his
mother
's


knee
;
and
,
ever
and
anon
,
in
the
course
of
that
evening
,
I
see
she


observant
of
the
monarch
at
her
side
,
conscious
of
his
beclouded


abstraction
,
and
desirous
to
rouse
he
from
it
by
draw
his
attention


to
their
son
.
she
often
bend
her
head
to
listen
to
the
boy
's
remark
,


and
would
then
smilingly
repeat
they
to
his
sire
.
the
moody
King


start
,
listen
,
smile
,
but
invariably
relapse
as
soon
as
his
good


angel
cease
speak
.
full
mournful
and
significant
be
that


spectacle
!
not
the
less
so
because
,
both
for
the
aristocracy
and
the


honest
bourgeoisie
of
Labassecour
,
its
peculiarity
seem
to
be
wholly


invisible
:
I
could
not
discover
that
one
soul
present
be
either
strike


or
touch
.




with
the
King
and
Queen
have
enter
their
court
,
comprise
two
or


three
foreign
ambassador
;
and
with
they
come
the
elite
of
the


foreigner
then
resident
in
Villette
.
these
take
possession
of
the


crimson
bench
;
the
lady
be
seat
;
most
of
the
man
remain


stand
:
their
sable
rank
,
line
the
background
,
look
like
a
dark


foil
to
the
splendour
display
in
front
.
nor
be
this
splendour


without
vary
light
and
shade
and
gradation
:
the
middle
distance
be


fill
with
matron
in
velvet
and
satin
,
in
plume
and
gem
;
the


bench
in
the
foreground
,
to
the
Queen
's
right
hand
,
seem
devoted


exclusively
to
young
girl
,
the
flower
--
perhaps
,
I
should
rather
say
,


the
bud
--
of
Villette
aristocracy
.
here
be
no
jewel
,
no
head

dress
,


no
velvet
pile
or
silken
sheen

to

but
that
would
have
be
quite


untrue
:
several

more

sixteen

I
know
a

at

,
of
these

specimen
of
humanity

a

Angelique

pupil

,

last
year
at

,
ought
to
have
be
in
the
first
class
,
but
whose


brain
never
get
they
beyond
the
second
division
.
in
English
,
they
have


be
under
my
own
charge
,
and
hard
work
it
be
to
get
they
to
translate


rationally
a
page
of
_
the
Vicar
of
Wakefield
_
.
also
during
three
month


I
have
one
of
they
for
my

a

,
and
the
quantity
of

,
she
would
habitually
consume


at

"
be
a
real
world
's
wonder
--
to
be
exceed
only
by


the
fact
of
her
actually
pocket
slice
she
could
not
eat
.
here
be


truth
--
wholesome
truth
,
too
.




I
know
another
of
these
seraph
--
the
prettiest
,
or
,
at
any
rate
,
the


least
demure
and
hypocritical
looking
of
the
lot
:
she
be
seat
by
the


daughter
of
an
english
peer
,
also
an
honest
,
though
haughty
-
look


girl
:
both
have
enter
in
the
suite
of
the
british
embassy
.
she
(
_
i.e.
_


my
acquaintance
)
have
a
slight
,
pliant
figure
,
not
at
all
like
the
form


of
the
foreign
damsel
:
her
hair
,
too
,
be
not
close
-
braid
,
like
a


shell
or
a
skull
-
cap
of
satin
;
it
look
_
like
_
hair
,
and
wave
from


her
head
,
long
,
curl
,
and
flow
.
she
chat
away
volubly
,
and


seem
full
of
a
light
-
head
sort
of
satisfaction
with
herself
and
she


position
.
I
do
not
look
at
Dr.
Bretton
;
but
I
know
that
he
,
too
,
see


Ginevra
Fanshawe
:
he
have
become
so
quiet
,
he
answer
so
briefly
his


mother
's
remark
,
he
so
often
suppress
a
sigh
.
why
should
he
sigh
?
he


have
confess
a
taste
for
the
pursuit
of
love
under
difficulty
;
here


be
full
gratification
for
that
taste
.
his
lady
-
love
beam
upon
he


from
a
sphere
above
his
own
:
he
could
not
come
near
she
;
he
be
not


certain
that
he
could
win
from
she
a
look
.
I
watch
to
see
if
she


would
so
far
favour
he
.
our
seat
be
not
far
from
the
crimson
bench
;


we
must
inevitably
be
see
thence
,
by
eye
so
quick
and
rove
as
Miss


Fanshawe
's
,
and
very
soon
those
optic
of
hers
be
upon
we
:
at
least
,


upon
Dr.
and
Mrs.
Bretton
.
I
keep
rather
in
the
shade
and
out
of
sight
,


not
wish
to
be
immediately
recognise
:
she
look
quite
steadily
at


Dr.
John
,
and
then
she
raise
a
glass
to
examine
his
mother
;
a
minute


or
two
afterwards
she
laughingly
whisper
her
neighbour
;
upon
the


performance
commence
,
her
ramble
attention
be
attract
to
the


platform
.




on
the
concert
I
need
not
dwell
;
the
reader
would
not
care
to
have
my


impression
thereanent
:
and
,
indeed
,
it
would
not
be
worth
while
to


record
they
,
as
they
be
the
impression
of
an
ignorance
crasse
.
the


young
lady
of
the
Conservatoire
,
be
very
much
frightened
,
make


rather
a
tremulous
exhibition
on
the
two
grand
piano
.
M.
Josef
Emanuel


stand
by
they
while
they
play
;
but
he
have
not
the
tact
or
influence


of
his
kinsman
,
who
,
under
similar
circumstance
,
would
certainly
have


_
compel
_
pupil
of
his
to
demean
themselves
with
heroism
and


self
-
possession
.
M.
Paul
would
have
place
the
hysteric
debutante


between
two
fire
--
terror
of
the
audience
,
and
terror
of
himself
--
and


would
have
inspire
they
with
the
courage
of
desperation
,
by
make
the


latter
terror
incomparably
the
great
:
M.
Josef
could
not
do
this
.




follow
the
white
muslin
pianiste
,
come
a
fine
,
full
-
grown
,
sulky


lady
in
white
satin
.
she
sing
.
her
singing
just
affect
I
like
the


trick
of
a
conjuror
:
I
wonder
how
she
do
it
--
how
she
make
her
voice


run
up
and
down
,
and
cut
such
marvellous
caper
;
but
a
simple
Scotch


melody
,
play
by
a
rude
street
minstrel
,
have
often
move
I
more


deeply
.




afterwards
step
forth
a
gentleman
,
who
,
bend
his
body
a
good
deal


in
the
direction
of
the
King
and
Queen
,
and
frequently
approach
his


white
-
gloved
hand
to
the
region
of
his
heart
,
vent
a
bitter
outcry


against
a
certain
"
fausse
Isabelle
.
"
I
think
he
seem
especially
to


solicit
the
Queen
's
sympathy
;

block

rather
at
my
pink
dress

sardonic


comment
on
which
gleam
in
his
eye
.
now
it
be
his
habit
to
indulge
in


stricture
on
the
dress
,
both
of
the
teacher
and
pupil
,
at
Madame


beck's
--
a
habit
which
the
former
,
at
least
,
hold
to
be
an
offensive


impertinence
:
as
yet
I
have
not
suffer
from
it
--
my
sombre
daily
attire


not
be
calculate
to
attract
notice

I
be
in
no
mood
to
permit
any


new
encroachment
to

night

rather
than
accept
his
banter
,
I
would


ignore
his
presence
,
and
accordingly
steadily
turn
my
face
to
the


sleeve
of
Dr.
John
's
coat
;
find
in
that
same
black
sleeve
a
prospect


more
redolent
of
pleasure
and
comfort
,
more
genial
,
more
friendly

by
the
dark
little
Professor

Dr.

unconsciously
to
sanction
the
preference

look
down

in

kind
voice

at
that
moment
I
be
nearly
throw
down
amongst
the
foot
of


the
crowd
.
M.
Paul
have
rudely
push
past
,
and
be
elbow
his
way


with
such
utter
disregard
to
the
convenience
and
security
of
all


around

a
very
uncomfortable

Dr.

I

so

slowly

with
difficulty
we
make
our

regain

nearly
an


hour

an
animating
and
amusing
scene
;

as
we
each
hold


ticket

we
share
in
the
alternation
of
hope

fear
raise
by

of
small
value

fall
out
that


Dr.

each
gain
one

a
cigar

case

his
a
lady
's


head

dress

a
most
airy
sort
of
blue
and
silver
turban
,
with
a
streamer


of
plumage
on
one
side
,
like
a
snowy
cloud
.
he
be
excessively
anxious


to
make
an
exchange
;
but
I
could
not
be
bring
to
hear
reason
,
and
to


this
day
I
keep
my
cigar
-
case
:
it
serve
,
when
I
look
at
it
,
to
remind


I
of
old
time
,
and
one
happy
evening
.




Dr.
John
,
for
his
part
,
hold
his
turban
at
arm
's
length
between
his


finger
and
thumb
,
and
look
at
it
with
a
mixture
of
reverence
and


embarrassment
highly
provocative
of
laughter
.
the
contemplation
over
,


he
be
about
coolly
to
deposit
the
delicate
fabric
on
the
ground


between
his
foot
;
he
seem
to
have
no
shadow
of
an
idea
of
the


treatment
or
stowage
it
ought
to
receive
:
if
his
mother
have
not
come
to


the
rescue
,
I
think
he
would
finally
have
crush
it
under
his
arm
like


an
opera
-
hat
;
she
restore
it
to
the
band
-
box
whence
it
have
issue
.




Graham
be
quite
cheerful
all
the
evening
,
and
his
cheerfulness
seem


natural
and
unforced
.
his
demeanour
,
his
look
,
be
not
easily
describe
;


there
be
something
in
it
peculiar
,
and
,
in
its
way
,
original
.
I
read


in
it
no
common
mastery
of
the
passion
,
and
a
fund
of
deep
and
healthy


strength
which
,
without
any
exhausting
effort
,
bear
down
Disappointment


and
extract
her
fang
.
his
manner
,
now
,
remind
I
of
quality
I
have


notice
in
he
when
professionally
engage
amongst
the
poor
,
the


guilty
,
and
the
suffering
,
in
the
Basse
-
Ville
:
he
look
at
once


determine
,
enduring
,
and
sweet
-
temper
.
who
could
help
like
he
?


_
he
_
betray
no
weakness
which
harass
all
your
feeling
with


consideration
as
to
how
its
faltering
must
be
prop
;
from
_
he
_


break
no
irritability
which
startle
calm
and
quench
mirth
;
_
his
_


lip
let
fall
no
caustic
that
burn
to
the
bone
;
_
his
_
eye
shoot
no


morose
shaft
that
go
cold
,
and
rusty
,
and
venome
through
your


heart
:
beside
he
be
rest
and
refuge
--
around
he
,
foster
sunshine
.




and
yet
he
have
neither
forgive
nor
forget
Miss
Fanshawe
.
once


anger
,
I
doubt
if
Dr.
Bretton
be
to
be
soon
propitiated
--
once


alienated
,
whether
he
be
ever
to
be
reclaim
.
he
look
at
she
more


than
once
;
not
stealthily
or
humbly
,
but
with
a
movement
of
hardy
,
open


observation
.
De
Hamal
be
now
a
fixture
beside
she
;
Mrs.
Cholmondeley


sit
near
,
and
they
and
she
be
wholly
absorb
in
the
discourse
,


mirth
,
and
excitement
,
with
which
the
crimson
seat
be
as
much
astir


as
any
plebeian
part
of
the
hall
.
in
the
course
of
some
apparently


animate
discussion
,
Ginevra
once
or
twice
lift
her
hand
and
arm
;
a


handsome
bracelet
gleam
upon
the
latter
.
I
see
that
its
gleam


flicker
in
Dr.
John
's
eye

quicken
therein
a
derisive
,
ireful


sparkle

laughed:----




"

will
lay
my

any

be
certain

I
experience
a
happy
feeling
--
a
glad
emotion


which
go
warm
to
my
heart
,
and
run
lively
through
all
my
vein
.
for


once
a
hope
be
realize
.
I
hold
in
my
hand
a
morsel
of
real
solid
joy
:


not
a
dream
,
not
an
image
of
the
brain
,
not
one
of
those
shadowy


chance
imagination
picture
,
and
on
which
humanity
starve
but
can
not


live
;
not
a
mess
of
that
manna
I
drearily
eulogize
awhile
ago
--
which
,


indeed
,
at
first
melt
on
the
lip
with
an
unspeakable
and


preternatural
sweetness
,
but
which
,
in
the
end
,
our
soul
full
surely


loathe
;
long
deliriously
for
natural
and
earth
-
grow
food
,
wildly


pray
Heaven
's
spirit
to
reclaim
their
own
spirit
-
dew
and


essence
--
an
aliment
divine
,
but
for
mortal
deadly
.
it
be
neither


sweet
hail
nor
small
coriander
-
seed
--
neither
slight
wafer
,
nor
luscious


honey

I
have
light
on
;
it
be
the
wild
,
savoury
mess
of
the
hunter
,


nourishing
and
salubrious
meat
,
forest
-
feed
or
desert
-
rear
,
fresh
,


healthful
,
and
life

what
the
old
die
patriarch

of
his
son
Esau

promise
in
requital
the
blessing
of
his


last
breath

be
a
godsend
;
and
I
inwardly
thank
the
God
who
have


vouchsafe
it
.
outwardly
I
only
thank
man

Monsieur
curl
his
lip
,
give
I
a
vicious
glance
of
the
eye

strode
to
his
estrade

not

all
a
good
little
man

good
point

I
read
my
letter
there
and
then

do
I
consume
the
venison
at
once


and
with
haste
,
as
if
Esau

shaft
fly
every
day

I
know
well
.

cover
with

seal
,
with
its
three


clear
letter

be
bounty
and
abundance
for
the
present
.
I
steal
from


the
room
,
I
procure
the
key
of
the
great
dormitory
,
which
be
keep


lock
by
day
.
I
go
to
my
bureau
;
with
a
sort
of
haste
and
tremble


lest
Madame
should
creep
up

stair

spy
I
,
I
open
a
drawer

unlock
a
box

take
out
a
case

and
--
having
feast
my
eye
with


one
more
look
,
and
approach
the
seal
with
a
mixture
of
awe
and
shame


and
delight
,
to
my
lip

I
fold
the
untasted
treasure
,
yet
all
fair


and
inviolate
,
in
silver
paper

commit
it
to
the

shut
up

reclose

relocke
the
dormitory

return
to

feel
as
if
fairy
tale
be
true
,

fairy
gift
no

.
strange
,


sweet
insanity

and
this
letter
,
the
source
of
my
joy
,
I
have
not

read

do
not

when
I
re
-
enter
the
schoolroom
,
behold
M.
Paul
rage
like
a


pestilence
!
some
pupil
have
not
speak
audibly
or
distinctly
enough
to


suit
his
ear
and
taste
,
and
now
she
and
other
be
weep
,
and
he
be


rave
from
his
estrade
,
almost
livid
.
curious
to
mention
,
as
I


appear
,
he
fall
on
I
.




"
be
I
the
mistress
of
these
girl
?
do
I
profess
to
teach
they
the


conduct
befitting
ladies?--and
do
I
permit
and
,
he
doubt
not
,


encourage
they
to
strangle
their
mother
-
tongue
in
their
throat
,
to


mince
and
mash
it
between
their
tooth
,
as
if
they
have
some
base
cause


to
be
ashamed
of
the
word
they
utter
?
be
this
modesty
?
he
know


well
.
it
be
a
vile
pseudo
sentiment
--
the
offspring
or
the
forerunner


of
evil
.
rather
than
submit
to
this
mopping
and
mow
,
this
mince


and
grimace
,
this
,
grind
of
a
noble
tongue
,
this
general


affectation
and
sicken
stubbornness
of
the
pupil
of
the
first


class
,
he
would
throw
they
up
for
a
set
of
insupportable
petite


maitresse
,
and
confine
himself
to
teach
the
ABC
to
the
baby
of


the
third
division
.
"




what
could
I
say
to
all
this
?
really
nothing
;
and
I
hope
he
would


allow
I
to
be
silent
.
the
storm
recommence
.

answer

his

it
seem
to
be

in
_
that

place

that
conceited
boudoir
of
a
first

with
its
pretentious
book

case
,
its
green

desk
,
its
rubbish
of

,
its
trash
of
frame
picture
and
map
,
and
its
foreign


surveillante
,
forsooth!--it
seem
to
be
the
fashion
to
think
_
there
_


that
the
Professor
of
Literature
be
not
worthy
of
a

lull
the

weep
a


tear
for
the

of
any

all

like


snow

before
the
intemperate
heat
of
M.

much


shake

sit
down

venture
to
resume
my
work

in
my
continued
silence

in
the

"

say
he
to
I
,
in
a


low

furious
voice
,

he
thus
outrage
,
under
pretence
of

I
do
not
intend
my
voice
to
falter

but
it
do

more
,
I
think
,
through


the
agitation
of
late
delight
than
in
any
spasm
of
present
fear
.
still


there
certainly
be
something
in
M.
Paul
's
anger
--
a
kind
of
passion
of


emotion
--
that
specially
tend
to
draw
tear
.
I
be
not
unhappy
,
nor


much
afraid
,
yet
I
weep

"

say
he
presently
,
look
round

see
the


deluge
universal
.
"
decidedly
I
be
a
monster

a
ruffian

I
have
only


one
pocket

handkerchief

he
add
,

he
take
forth

hold
out
to
I
a
clean
silk
handkerchief

now
a


person
who
do
not
know
M.
Paul
,
who
be
unused
to
he
and
his


impulse

would
naturally
have
bungle
at
this
offer
--
decline


accept
the
same

et

.
but
I
too
plainly
feel
this
would
never


do
:
the
slight
hesitation
would
have
be
fatal
to
the
incipient


treaty
of
peace
.
I
rise

meet
the
handkerchief
half

way

receive
it


with
decorum

wipe
therewith

my

the
flag

especial


care

M.

hate

mortally

sew

source


of
distraction

the
letter
.






when
all
be
still
in
the
house
;
when
dinner
be
over
and
the
noisy


recreation
-
hour
past
;
when
darkness
have
set
in
,
and
the
quiet
lamp
of


study
be
light
in
the
refectory
;
when
the
externe
be
go
home
,
the


clash
door
and
clamorous
bell
hush
for
the
evening
;
when
Madame


be
safely
settle
in
the
salle
-
a
-
manger
in
company
with
her
mother
and


some
friend
;
I
then
glide
to
the
kitchen
,
beg
a
bougie
for
one


half
-
hour
for
a
particular
occasion
,
find
acceptance
of
my
petition
at


the
hand
of
my
friend
Goton
,
who
answer
,
"
mais
certainement
,

chou
,

"
and
,
light
in
hand
,
I


mount
noiseless
to
the
dormitory
.




great
be
my
chagrin
to
find
in
that
apartment
a
pupil
go
to
bed


indisposed,--greater
when
I
recognise
,
amid
the
muslin
nightcap


border
,
the
"
figure
chiffonnee
"
of
Mistress
Ginevra
Fanshawe
;
supine


at
this
moment
,
it
be
true
--
but
certain
to
wake
and
overwhelm
I
with


chatter
when
the
interruption
would
be
least
acceptable
:
indeed
,
as
I


watch
she
,
a
slight
twinkling
of
the
eyelid
warn
I
that
the


present
appearance
of
repose
might
be
but
a
ruse
,
assume
to
cover
sly


vigilance
over
"
Timon
's
"
movement
;
she
be
not
to
be
trust
.
and
I


have
so
wish
to
be
alone
,
just
to
read
my
precious
letter
in
peace
.




well
,
I
must
go
to
the
class
.
having
seek
and
find
my
prize
in
its


casket

descend

to
hebdomadal


custom
:

on

air

dust

housemaid
instead

the
floor
;
all
be
hopeless
confusion
.
baffle
,


but
not
beat
,
I
withdraw
,
bent
as
resolutely
as
ever
on

solitude

.




take
a
key
whereof
I
know
the
repository

mount
three

in
succession

reach
a
dark
,
narrow
,
silent
landing

a


worm

and
dive
into
the
deep
,
black
,
cold
garret
.
here
none


would
follow
I
--
none
interrupt
--
not
madame
herself
.
I
shut
the


garret

door
;
I
place
my
light
on
a
dodder
and
mouldy
chest
of


drawer
;
I
put
on
a
shawl
,
for
the
air
be
ice

cold

I
take
my
letter
;


tremble
with
sweet
impatience
,
I
break
its
seal
.




"
will
it
be
long
--
will
it
be
short

"
think
I
,
pass
my
hand
across


my
eye
to
dissipate
the
silvery
dimness
of
a
suave
,
south

wind
shower

it
be
kind

to
my
checked
,
bridle
,
discipline
expectation
,
it
seem
very
kind
:


to
my
longing
and
famished
think
it
seem
,
perhaps
,
kind
than
it


be
.




so
little
have
I
hope
,
so
much
have
I
fear
;
there
be
a
fulness
of


delight
in
this
taste
of
fruition
--
such
,
perhaps
,
as
many
a
human
being


pass
through
life
without
ever
know

the
poor
english
teacher
in


the
frosty
garret
,
read
by
a
dim
candle
gutter
in
the
wintry
air
,


a
letter
simply
good
-
natured
--
nothing
more
;
though
that
good
-
nature


then
seem
to
I
godlike
--
be
happy
than
most
queen
in
palace
.




of
course
,
happiness
of
such
shallow
origin
could
be
but
brief
;
yet
,


while
it
last
it
be
genuine
and
exquisite

a
bubble

but
a
sweet


bubble

of
real
honey

afterwards
:
forgive

every
ill
--
freely
forgive

for


the
sake
of
that
one
dear

good
!




be
there
wicked
thing
,
not
human
,
which
envy
human
bliss

there


evil
influence

something
in
that
vast
solitary
garret
sound
strangely
.
most
surely


and
certainly
I
hear
,
as
it
seem
,
a
stealthy
foot
on
that
floor
:
a


sort
of
glide
out
from
the
direction
of
the
black
recess
haunt
by


the
malefactor
cloak
.
I
turn
:
my
light
be
dim
;
the
room
be


long
--
but
as
I
live
!
I
see
in
the
middle
of
that
ghostly
chamber
a


figure
all
black
and
white
;
the
skirt
straight
,
narrow
,
black
;
the


head
bandage
,
veil
,
white
.




say
what
you
will
,
reader
--
tell
I
I
be
nervous
or
mad
;
affirm
that
I


be
unsettle
by
the
excitement
of
that
letter
;
declare
that
I
dream
;


this
I
vow
--
I
see
there
--
in
that
room
--
on
that
night
--
an
image
like
--
a


NUN
.




I
cry
out
;
I
sicken
.
have
the
shape
approach
I
I
might
have


swoon
.
it
recede
:
I
make
for
the
door
.
how
I
descend
all
the


stair
I
know
not
.
by
instinct
I
shun
the
refectory
,
and
shape
my


course
to
Madame
's
sitting
-
room
:
I
burst
in
.
I
said--




"
there
be
something
in
the
grenier
;
I
have
be
there
:
I
see
something
.


go
and
look
at
it
,
all
of
you
!
"




I
say
,
"
all
of
you
;
"
for
the
room
seem
to
I
full
of
people
,
though


in
truth
there
be
but
four
present
:
Madame
Beck
;
her
mother
,
Madame


Kint
,
who
be
out
of
health
,
and
now
stay
with
she
on
a
visit
;
she


brother
,
M.
Victor
Kint
,
and
another
gentleman
,
who
,
when
I
enter
the


room
,
be
converse
with
the
old
lady
,
and
have
his
back
towards
the


door
.




my
mortal
fear
and
faintness
must
have
make
I
deadly
pale
.
I
feel
cold


and
shake
.
they
all
rise
in
consternation
;
they
surround
I
.
I


urge
they
to
go
to
the
grenier
;
the
sight
of
the
gentleman
do
I
good


and
give
I
courage
:
it
seem
as
if
there
be
some
help
and
hope
,


with
man
at
hand
.
I
turn
to
the
door
,
beckon
they
to
follow
.
they


want
to
stop
I
,
but
I
say
they
must
come
this
way
:
they
must
see


what
I
have
see
--
something
strange
,
stand
in
the
middle
of
the


garret
.
and
,
now
,
I
remember
my
letter
,
leave
on
the
drawer
with
the


light

this
precious
letter

fast

Lo

garret

pit

one

her
usual
calm


sense

lamp
from

room

come
up

ray

the
opaque
blackness

there
stand
the
bougie


quench
on
the
drawer
;

where
be
the
letter

away

never

check
,
reader
,
by
the
thought
which
perhaps
at
this
moment


check
you
:
namely
,
that
to
go
anywhere
with
Graham
and
without
Mrs.


Bretton
could
be
objectionable
.
I
could
not
have
conceive
,
much
less


have
express
to
Graham
,
such
thought
--
such
scruple
--
without
risk
of


exciting
a
tyrannous
self
-
contempt
:
of
kindle
an
inward
fire
of
shame


so
quenchless
,
and
so
devouring
,
that
I
think
it
would
soon
have
lick


up
the
very
life
in
my
vein
.
besides
,
my
godmother
,
know
her
son
,


and
know
I
,
would
as
soon
have
think
of
chaperone
a
sister
with


a
brother
,
as
of
keep
anxious
guard
over
our
incoming
and
outgoing
.




the
present
be
no
occasion
for
showy
array
;
my
dun
mist
crape
would


suffice
,
and
I
seek
the
same
in
the
great
oak
-
wardrobe
in
the


dormitory
,
where
hang
no
less
than
forty
dress
.
but
there
have
be


change
and
reform
,
and
some
innovate
hand
have
prune
this
same


crowded
wardrobe
,
and
carry
diver
garment
to
the
grenier
--
my
crape


amongst
the
rest
.
I
must
fetch
it
.
I
get
the
key
,
and
go
aloft


fearless
,
almost
thoughtless
.
I
unlock
the
door
,
I
plunge
in
.
the


reader
may
believe
it
or
not
,
but
when
I
thus
suddenly
enter
,
that


garret
be
not
wholly
dark
as
it
should
have
be
:
from
one
point
there


shine
a
solemn
light
,
like
a
star
,
but
broad
.
so
plainly
it
shine
,


that
it
reveal
the
deep
alcove
with
a
portion
of
the
tarnished


scarlet
curtain
draw
over
it
.
instantly
,
silently
,
before
my
eye
,
it


vanish
;
so
do
the
curtain
and
alcove
:
all
that
end
of
the
garret


become
black
as
night
.
I
venture
no
research
;
I
have
not
time
nor
will
;


snatch
my
dress
,
which
hang
on
the
wall
,
happily
near
the
door
,
I


rush
out
,
relocke
the
door
with
convulse
haste
,
and
dart


downward
to
the
dormitory
.




but
I
tremble
too
much
to
dress
myself
:
impossible
to
arrange
hair
or


fasten
hook
-
and
-
eye
with
such
finger
,
so
I
call
Rosine
and
bribe


she
to
help
I
.
Rosine
like
a
bribe
,
so
she
do
her
good
,
smoothed
and


plait
my
hair
as
well
as
a
coiffeur
would
have
do
,
place
the
lace


collar
mathematically
straight
,
tie
the
neck
-
ribbon
accurately
--
in


short
,
do
she
work
like
the
neat
-
handed
Phillis
she
could
be
when
she


choose
.
having
give
I
my
handkerchief
and
glove
,
she
take
the
candle


and
light
I
down
-
stair
.
after
all
,
I
have
forget
my
shawl
;
she


run
back
to
fetch
it
;
and
I
stand
with
Dr.
John
in
the
vestibule
,


wait
.




"
what
be
this
,
Lucy
?
"
say
he
,
look
down
at
I
narrowly
.
"
here
be


the
old
excitement
.
ha
!
the
nun
again
?
"




but
I
utterly
deny
the
charge
:
I
be
vex
to
be
suspect
of
a


second
illusion
.
he
be
sceptical
.




"
she
have
be
,
as
sure
as
I
live
,
"
say
he
;
"
her
figure
cross
your


eye
leave
on
they
a
peculiar
gleam
and
expression
not
to
be
mistaken
.
"




"
she
have
_
not
_
be
,
"
I
persist
:
for
,
indeed
,
I
could
deny
she


apparition
with
truth
.




"
the
old
symptom
be
there
,
"
he
affirm
:
"
a
particular
pale
,
and
what


the
Scotch
call
a
'
raise
'
look
.
"




he
be
so
obstinate
,
I
think
it
well
to
tell
he
what
I
really


_
have
_
see
.
of
course
with
he
it
be
hold
to
be
another
effect
of
the


same
cause
:
it
be
all
optical
illusion
--
nervous
malady
,
and
so
on
.
not


one
bit
do
I
believe
he
;
but
I
dare
not
contradict
:
doctor
be
so


self
-
opinionate
,
so
immovable
in
their
dry
,
materialist
view
.




rosine
bring
the
shawl

the
theatre
be
full
--
crammed
to
its
roof
:
royal
and
noble
be
there
:


palace
and
hotel
have
empty
their
inmate
into
those
tier
so
throng


and
so
hush
.
deeply
do
I
feel
myself
privileged
in
have
a
place


before
that
stage
;
I
long
to
see
a
being
of
whose
power
I
have
hear


report
which
make
I
conceive
peculiar
anticipation
.
I
wonder
if


she
would
justify
she
renown
:
with
strange
curiosity
,
with
feeling


severe
and
austere
,
yet
of
rivet
interest
,
I
wait
.
she
be
a
study


of
such
nature
as
have
not
encounter
my
eye
yet
:
a
great
and
new


planet
she
be
:
but
in
what
shape
?
I
wait
she
rise
.




she
rise
at
nine
that
December
night
:
above
the
horizon
I
see
she
come
.


she
could
shine
yet
with
pale
grandeur
and
steady
might
;
but
that
star


verge
already
on
its
judgment
-
day
.
see
near
,
it
be
a
chaos
--
hollow
,


half
-
consume
:
an
orb
perish
or
perish
--
half
lava
,
half
glow
.




I
have
hear
this
woman
term
"
plain
,
"
and
I
expect
bony
harshness


and
grimness
--
something
large
,
angular
,
sallow
.
what
I
see
be
the


shadow
of
a
royal
vashti
:
a
queen
,
fair
as
the
day
once
,
turn
pale


now
like
twilight
,
and
waste
like
wax
in
flame
.




for
awhile
--
a
long
while
--
I
think
it
be
only
a
woman
,
though
an


unique
woman
,
who
move
in
might
and
grace
before
this
multitude
.


by
-
and
-
by
I
recognise
my
mistake
.
behold
!
I
find
upon
her
something


neither
of
woman
nor
of
man
:
in
each
of
her
eye
sit
a
devil
.
these


evil
force
bear
she
through
the
tragedy
,
keep
up
her
feeble


strength
--
for
she
be
but
a
frail
creature
;
and
as
the
action
rise
and


the
stir
deepen
,
how
wildly
they
shake
she
with
their
passion
of
the


pit
!
they
write
HELL
on
her
straight
,
haughty
brow
.
they
tune
she


voice
to
the
note
of
torment
.
they
writhe
her
regal
face
to
a
demoniac


mask
.
hate
and
Murder
and
Madness
incarnate
she
stand
.




it
be
a
marvellous
sight
:
a
mighty
revelation
.




it
be
a
spectacle
low
,
horrible
,
immoral
.




Swordsmen
thrust
through
,
and
die
in
their
blood
on
the
arena

;


bull
gore
horse
disembowel
,

a
meeker
vision
for
the


public

a
milder
condiment
for
a
people
's
palate
--
than
Vashti

by


seven
devil
:
devil

cry
sore

rent
the
tenement
they


haunted
,

still
refuse
to
be
exorcise
.




suffering
have
strike
that

neither
yield

,

enduring
,
nor
,

finite
measure

resent
it

she
stand
lock
in
struggle
,
rigid
in
resistance
.
she


stand
,
not
dressed
,

drape
in
pale
antique
fold
,
long
and
regular


like
sculpture
.
a
background
and
entourage
and
flooring
of
deep


crimson
throw
she
out
,
white
like
alabaster
--
like
silver
:
rather
,
be
it


say
,
like
death
.




where
be
the
artist
of
the
Cleopatra
?
let
he
come
and
sit
down
and


study
this
different
vision
.
let
he
seek
here
the
mighty
brawn
,
the


muscle
,
the
abound
blood
,
the
full

flesh

let
all


materialist
draw
nigh

look
on
.




I
have
say
that
she
do
not
_
resent
_
her
grief
.
no
;
the
weakness
of


that
word
would
make
it
a
lie
.
to
she
,
what
hurt
become
immediately


embody

she
look
on
it
as
a
thing
that
can
be
attack
,
worry


down
,
tear
in
shred
.
scarcely
a
substance
herself
,
she
grapple
to


conflict
with
abstraction
.
before
calamity
she
be
a
tigress
;
she
rend


her
woe
,
shiver
they
in
convulse
abhorrence
.
Pain
,
for
she
,
have
no


result
in
good
:
tear
water
no
harvest
of
wisdom
:
on
sickness
,
on
death


itself
,
she
look
with
the
eye
of
a
rebel
.
Wicked
,
perhaps
,
she
be
,
but


also
she
be
strong
;
and
her
strength
have
conquer
Beauty
,
have
overcome


grace
,
and
bind
both
at
her
side
,
captive
peerlessly
fair
,
and

Miss

her
usual
ripeness

judgment

pronounce
Dr.

a
serious

impassioned

grave

impressible

I
ever

no
such

I
lay
to
his


charge

his
natural
attitude
be
not
the
meditative
,

his
natural


mood
the
sentimental
;
_
impressionable

he
be
as
dimple
water
,

,


almost

unimpressible

Dr.

_
could
_
think

think
well

he
be
rather
a
man

action

of
thought
;
he
_
could
_
feel
,

feel
vividly
in
his
way

his
heart
have
no
chord
for
enthusiasm
:
to
bright
,
soft
,
sweet


influence
his
eye

lip
give
bright
,
soft
,
sweet
welcome

beautiful

dangerous

no

hold
with
it
no

I
take
time

intense
curiosity

of
horror

to
know

opinion

I


put

wander
round
his

critical

near

no
less
skilled
in
surgery

medicine

,
on
examination

find


that
no
further
advice

his
own

necessary
to
the
treatment

the

a
room
shadowy
with
pale

blue
hanging
,
vaporous
with


curtaining
and
veiling
of
muslin
;
the
bed
seem
to
I
like


snow

drift
and
mist

spotless

soft
,

gauzy

the

apart

undress
their
mistress

their
well

meaning

clumsy
aid

I
be
not
in
a
sufficiently
collect
mood
to
note
with


separate
distinctness
every
detail
of
the
attire
I
remove
,
but
I


receive
a
general
impression
of
refinement
,
delicacy
,
and
perfect


personal
cultivation
;
which
,
in
a
period
of
after
-
thought
,
offer
in


my
reflection
a
singular
contrast
to
note
retain
of
Miss
Ginevra


Fanshawe
's
appointment
.




the
girl
be
herself
a
small
,
delicate
creature
,
but
make
like
a
model
.


as
I
fold
back
her
plentiful
yet
fine
hair
,
so
shining
and
soft
,
and


so
exquisitely
tend
,
I
have
under
my
observation
a
young
,
pale
,
weary
,


but
high
-
breed
face
.
the
brow
be
smooth
and
clear
;
the
eyebrow
be


distinct
,
but
soft
,
and
melt
to
a
mere
trace
at
the
temple
;
the


eye
be
a
rich
gift
of
nature
--
fine
and
full
,
large
,
deep
,
seem
to


hold
dominion
over
the
slighter
subordinate
feature
--
capable
,


probably
,
of
much
significance
at
another
hour
and
under
other


circumstance
than
the
present
,
but
now
languid
and
suffering
.
her
skin


be
perfectly
fair
,
the
neck
and
hand
vein
finely
like
the
petal
of


a
flower
;
a
thin
glazing
of
the
ice
of
pride
polish
this
delicate


exterior
,
and
her
lip
wear
a
curl
--
I
doubt
not
inherent
and


unconscious
,
but
which
,
if
I
have
see
it
first
with
the
accompaniment


of
health
and
state
,
would
have
strike
I
as
unwarranted
,
and
prove


in
the
little
lady
a
quite
mistaken
view
of
life
and
her
own


consequence
.




her
demeanour
under
the
doctor
's
hand
at
first
excited
a
smile
;
it
be


not
puerile
--
rather
,
on
the
whole
,
patient
and
firm
--
but
yet
,
once
or


twice
she
address
he
with
suddenness
and
sharpness
,
say
that
he


hurt
she
,
and
must
contrive
to
give
she
less
pain
;
I
see
her
large


eye
,
too
,
settle
on
his
face
like
the
solemn
eye
of
some
pretty
,


wonder
child
.
I
know
not
whether
Graham
feel
this
examination
:
if
he


do
,
he
be
cautious
not
to
check
or
discomfort
it
by
any
retaliatory


look
.
I
think
he
perform
his
work
with
extreme
care
and
gentleness
,


spare
she
what
pain
he
could
;
and
she
acknowledge
as
much
,
when
he


have
do
,
by
the
words:--"thank
you
,
doctor
,
and
good
-
night
,
"
very


gratefully
pronounce
as
she
utter
they
,
however
,
it
be
with
a


repetition
of
the
serious
,
direct
gaze
,
I
think
,
peculiar
in
its


gravity
and
intentness
.




the
injury
,
it
seem
,
be
not
dangerous
:
an
assurance
which
she


father
receive
with
a
smile
that
almost
make
one
his
friend
--
it
be
so


glad
and
gratified
.
he
now
express
his
obligation
to
Graham
with
as


much
earnestness
as
be
befit
an
Englishman
address
one
who
have


serve
he
,
but
be
yet
a
stranger
;
he
also
beg
he
to
call
the
next


day
.




"
Papa
,
"
say
a
voice
from
the
veiled
couch
,
"
thank
the
lady
,
too
;
be


she
there
?
"




I
open
the
curtain
with
a
smile
,
and
look
in
at
she
.
she
lie
now
at


comparative
ease
;
she
look
pretty
,
though
pale
;
her
face
be


delicately
design
,
and
if
at
first
sight
it
appear
proud
,
I
believe


custom
might
prove
it
to
be
soft
.




"
I
thank
the
lady
very
sincerely

say
her
father
:
"

very
good

her
work

spirit

liable
to
be
suddenly
and
for
a
long
while
drop
out
of
the
memory
of


their
friend
,
the
denizen
of
a
free
world

unaccountably
,
perhaps
,


and
close
upon
some
space
of
unusually
frequent
intercourse

some


congerie
of
rather
exciting
little
circumstance
,

natural
sequel


would
rather
seem
to
be
the
quickening

a

pause

a
wordless
silence

long


blank
of
oblivion

Unbroken

be
this
blank
;
alike
entire
and


unexplained

the
letter

ball

creep
into
a
hole
of
life

the
drift

up

preserve
he
in
ice

the


season

he

,
perhaps
,
one
day
his
snow

sepulchre

open

spring

softness


will
return

sun

that
eventful
evening
at
the
theatre
,
come
for
I
seven
week


as
bare
as
seven
sheet
of
blank
paper
:
no
word
be
write
on
one
of


they
;
not
a
visit
,
not
a
token
.




about
the
middle
of
that
time
I
entertain
fancy
that
something
have


happen
to
my
friend
at
La
Terrasse
.
the
mid
-
blank
be
always
a


beclouded
point
for
the
solitary
:
his
nerve
ache
with
the
strain
of


long
expectancy
;
the
doubt
hitherto
repel
gather
now
to
a
mass


and
--
strong
in
accumulation
--
roll
back
upon
he
with
a
force
which


savour
of
vindictiveness
.
night
,
too
,
become
an
unkindly
time
,
and


sleep
and
his
nature
can
not
agree
:
strange
start
and
struggle
harass


his
couch
:
the
sinister
band
of
bad
dream
,
with
horror
of
calamity
,


and
sick
dread
of
entire
desertion
at
their
head
,
join
the
league


against
he
.
poor
wretch
!
he
do
his
good
to
bear
up
,
but
he
be
a


poor
,
pallid
,
waste
wretch
,
despite
that
good
.




towards
the
last
of
these
long
seven
week
I
admit
,
what
through
the


other
six
I
have
jealously
exclude
--
the
conviction
that
these
blank


be
inevitable
:
the
result
of
circumstance
,
the
fiat
of
fate
,
a
part


of
my
life
's
lot
and
--
above
all
--
a
matter
about
whose
origin
no


question
must
ever
be
ask
,
for
whose
painful
sequence
no
murmur
ever


utter
.
of
course
I
do
not
blame
myself
for
suffer
:
I
thank
God
I


have
a
truer
sense
of
justice
than
to
fall
into
any
imbecile


extravagance
of
self
-
accusation
;
and
as
to
blame
other
for
silence
,


in
my
reason
I
well
know
they
blameless
,
and
in
my
heart
acknowledge


they
so
:
but
it
be
a
rough
and
heavy
road
to
travel
,
and
I
long
for


well
day
.




I
try
different
expedient
to
sustain
and
fill
existence
:
I
commence


an
elaborate
piece
of
lace
-
work
,
I
study
german
pretty
hard
,
I


undertake
a
course
of
regular
reading
of
the
driest
and
thick
book


in
the
library
;
in
all
my
effort
I
be
as
orthodox
as
I
know
how
to


be
.
be
there
error
somewhere
?
very
likely
.
I
only
know
the
result
be


as
if
I
have
gnaw
a
file
to
satisfy
hunger
,
or
drank
brine
to
quench


thirst
.




my
hour
of
torment
be
the
post
-
hour
.
unfortunately
,
I
know
it
too


well
,
and
try
as
vainly
as
assiduously
to
cheat
myself
of
that


knowledge
;
dread
the
rack
of
expectation
,
and
the
sick
collapse
of


disappointment
which
daily
precede
and
follow
upon
that


well
-
recognise
ring
.




I
suppose
animal
keep
in
cage
,
and
so
scantily
feed
as
to
be
always


upon
the
verge
of
famine
,
await
their
food
as
I
await
a
letter
.


Oh!--to
speak
truth
,
and
drop
that
tone
of
a
false
calm
which
long
to


sustain
,
outwear
nature
's
endurance
--
I
undergo
in
those
seven
week


bitter
fear
and
pain
,
strange
inward
trial
,
miserable
defection
of


hope
,
intolerable
encroachment
of
despair
.
this
last
come
so
near
I


sometimes
that
her
breath
go
right
through
I
.
I
use
to
feel
it
like


a
baleful
air
or
sigh
,
penetrate
deep
,
and
make
motion
pause
at
my


heart
,
or
proceed
only
under
unspeakable
oppression
.
the
letter
--
the


well
-
beloved
letter
--
would
not
come
;
and
it
be
all
of
sweetness
in


life
I
have
to
look
for
.




in
the
very
extremity
of
want
,
I
have
recourse
again
,
and
yet
again
,
to


the
little
packet
in
the
case
--
the
five
letter
.

splendid
that


month
seem

sky

of

,

not
dare
to
ask

evening


for
a
candle
in
the
kitchen
,
I
buy
a
wax
taper
and
match
to
light


it
,
and
at
the
study
-
hour
steal
up
to
the
dormitory

feast
on
my


crust

be
not

somewhat
late

evening

incessant
perusal

wither
to

my

over

"




thrill
with
exasperation
,
to
which
it
would
have
be
sheer
folly
to


have
give
vent
--
for
there
be
no
contending
with
that
unsubstantial


feather
,
that
mealy
-
wing
moth
--
I
extinguish
my
taper
,
lock
my


bureau
,
and
leave
she
,
since
she
would
not

half

be
over

I
have


withdraw
to
the
first

.
the
dreaded
hour
,
the
post
-
hour
,
be


near
,
and
I
sat
wait
it
,
much
as
a
ghost
-
seer
might
wait
his


spectre
.
Less
than
ever
be
a
letter
probable
;
still
,
strive
as
I


would
,
I
could
not
forget
that
it
be
possible
.
as
the
moment


lessened
,
a
restlessness
and
fear
almost
beyond
the
average
assail


I
.
it
be
a
day
of
winter
east
wind
,
and
I
have
now
for
some
time


enter
into
that
dreary
fellowship
with
the
wind
and
their
change
,


so
little
known
,
so
incomprehensible
to
the
healthy
.
the
north
and
east


own
a
terrific
influence
,
make
all
pain
more
poignant
,
all
sorrow


sad
.
the
south
could
calm
,
the
west
sometimes
cheer
:
unless
,
indeed
,


they
bring
on
their
wing
the
burden
of
thunder
-
cloud
,
under
the


weight
and
warmth
of
which
all
energy
die
.




bitter
and
dark
as
be
this
January
day
,
I
remember
leave
the
classe
,


and
run
down
without
bonnet
to
the
bottom
of
the
long
garden
,
and


then
linger
amongst
the
strip
shrub
,
in
the
forlorn
hope
that


the
postman
's
ring
might
occur
while
I
be
out
of
hearing
,
and
I
might


thus
be
spare
the
thrill
which
some
particular
nerve
or
nerve
,
almost


gnaw
through
with
the
unremitting
tooth
of
a
fix
idea
,
be


become
wholly
unfit
to
support
.
I
linger
as
long
as
I
dare
without


fear
of
attract
attention
by
my
absence
.
I
muffle
my
head
in
my


apron
,
and
stop
my
ear
in
terror
of
the
torture
clang
,
sure
to
be


follow
by
such
blank
silence
,
such
barren
vacuum
for
I
.
at
last
I


venture
to
re
-
enter
the
first
classe
,
where
,
as
it
be
not
yet
nine


o'clock
,
no
pupil
have
be
admit
.
the
first
thing
see
be
a
white


object
on
my
black
desk
,
a
white
,
flat
object
.
the
post
have
,
indeed
,


arrive
;
by
I
unheard
.
rosine
have
visit
my
cell
,
and
,
like
some


angel
,
have
leave
behind
she
a
bright
token
of
her
presence
.
that
shine


thing
on
the
desk
be
indeed
a
letter
,
a
real
letter
;
I
see
so
much
at


the
distance
of
three
yard
,
and
as
I
have
but
one
correspondent
on


earth
,
from
that
one
it
must
come
.
he
remember
I
yet
.
how
deep
a


pulse
of
gratitude
send
new
life
through
my
heart
.




draw
near
,
bend
and
look
on
the
letter
,
in
trembling
but


almost
certain
hope
of
see
a
known
hand
,
it
be
my
lot
to
find
,
on


the
contrary
,
an
autograph
for
the
moment
deem
unknown
--
a
pale
female


scrawl
,
instead
of
a
firm
,
masculine
character
.
I
then
think
fate
be


_
too
_
hard
for
I
,
and
I
say
,
audibly
,
"
this
be
cruel
.
"




but
I
get
over
that
pain
also
.
life
be
still
life
,
whatever
its
pang
:


our
eye
and
ear
and
their
use
remain
with
we
,
though
the
prospect
of


what
please
be
wholly
withdraw
,
and
the
sound
of
what
console
be


quite
silenced
.




I
open
the
billet
:
by
this
time
I
have
recognise
its
handwriting
as


perfectly
familiar
.
it
be
date

it
run
thus:--

DEAR

occur
to
I
to
inquire
what
you
have
be
do
with


yourself
for
the
last
month
or
two
?
not
that
I
suspect
you
would
have


the
least
difficulty
in
give
an
account
of
your
proceeding
.
I


daresay
you
have
be
just
as
busy
and
as
happy
as
ourselves
at
La


terrasse
.
as
to
Graham
,

professional
connection
extend
daily
:
he


be
so
much
seek
after
,
so
much
engaged
,
that
I
tell
he
he
will
grow


quite
conceited
.
like
a
right
good
mother
,
as
I
be
,
I
do
my
good
to


keep
he
down
:
no
flattery
do
he
get
from
I
,
as
you
know
.
and
yet
,


Lucy
,
he
be
a
fine
fellow
:
his
mother
's
heart
dance
at
the
sight
of


he
.
after
be
hurry
here
and
there
the
whole
day
,
and
pass
the


ordeal
of
fifty
sort
of
temper
,
and
combat
a
hundred
caprice
,
and


sometimes
witness
cruel
suffering
--
perhaps
,
occasionally
,
as
I
tell


he
,
inflict
they
--
at
night
he
still
come
home
to
I
in
such


kindly
,
pleasant
mood
,
that
really
,
I
seem
to
live
in
a
sort
of
moral


antipode
,

on
these
January
evening
my
day
rise
when
other


people

night
set
in

still
he
need
keep
in
order
,

correct
,
and
repress
,

I


do
he
that
good
service

the
boy
be
so
elastic
there
be
no
such

vex
he
thoroughly

I
think
I
have
at
last
drive
he


to
the
sullen
,
he
turn
on
I
with
joke
for
retaliation
:
but
you
know


he
and
all
his
iniquity
,
and
I
be
but
an
elderly
simpleton
to
make


he
the
subject
of
this
epistle
.




"
as
for
I
,
I
have
have
my
old

on

be
plunge
overhead

matter

I
do
so

to


regain
for
Graham

some
part
of
what
his
father

point

look

how


he
can
provide

I
too

the

possibly
want

she
have

about
sky

I
of
an
ambition

wear
diamond
,
keep
livery

,
have


an
hotel

after
I
have
give
he
his

he
throw
himself
into

gingerly
precaution

set
one
to
right

I
might
still
be
sad
after


read
that
letter
,

I
be
more
compose
;
not
exactly

relieved

in
people

in
an
exceptional


position
to
hold
their
tongue

not

declare
how

the

nameless
agony

then
sink
to
palsy

be
a
subject
too
intricate
for
examination
,
too


abstract
for
popular
comprehension
.
speak
of
it
!
you
might
almost
as


well
stand
up
in
an
european
market
-
place
,
and
propound
dark
saying
in


that
language
and
mood
wherein
Nebuchadnezzar
,
the
imperial


hypochondriac
,

with
his

a
winter
spirit

I
declare
,

something

its

an
evergreen

lash

dark
as

they
soften

the

never

have
a
constant
fear
that


he

accept
some

he
never

warn

because
,

too

so
tease

I
will
just
tell
tale
about
he
.
Mrs.


Bretton
and
all
of
you
listen
:
about
five
year
ago
,
when
I
be
twelve


year
old
,
he
take
it
into
his
head
that
he
be
spoil
I
;
that
I
be


grow
unfitted
for
the
world
,
and
I
do
n't
know
what
,
and
nothing


would
serve
or
satisfy
he
,
but
I
must
go
to
school
.
I
cry
,
and
so


on
;
but
M.
de
Bassompierre
prove
hard
-
hearted
,
quite
firm
and
flinty
,


and
to
school
I
go
.
what
be
the
result
?
in
the
most
admirable


manner
,
papa
come
to
school
likewise
:
every
other
day
he
call
to
see


I
.
Madame
Aigredoux
grumble
,
but
it
be
of
no
use
;
and
so
,
at
last
,


papa
and
I
be
both
,
in
a
manner
,
expel
.
Lucy
can
just
tell
Madame


beck
this
little
trait
:
it
be
only
fair
to
let
she
know
what
she
have
to


expect
.
"




Mrs.
Bretton
ask
Mr.
Home
what
he
have
to
say
in
answer
to
this


statement
.
as
he
make
no
defence
,
judgment
be
give
against
he
,
and


Paulina
triumph
.




but
she
have
other
mood
besides
the
arch
and
naive
.
after
breakfast
;


when
the
two
elder
withdraw
--
I
suppose
to
talk
over
certain
of
Mrs.


Bretton
's
business
matter
--
and
the
Countess
,
Dr.
Bretton
,
and
I
,
be


for
a
short
time
alone
together
--
all
the
child
leave
she
;
with
we
,
more


nearly
her
companion
in
age
,
she
rise
at
once
to
the
little
lady
:
she


very
face
seem
to
alter
;
that
play
of
feature
,
and
candour
of
look
,


which
,
when
she
speak
to
her
father
,
make
it
quite
dimpled
and
round
,


yield
to
an
aspect
more
thoughtful
,
and
line
distincter
and
less


_
mobile
_
.




no
doubt
Graham
note
the
change
as
well
as
I.
he
stand
for
some


minute
near
the
window
,
look
out
at
the
snow
;
presently
he
,


approach
the
hearth
,
and
enter
into
conversation
,
but
not
quite


with
his
usual
ease
:
fit
topic
do
not
seem
to
rise
to
his
lip
;
he


choose
they
fastidiously
,
hesitatingly
,
and
consequently
infelicitously
:


he
speak
vaguely
of
Villette
--
its
inhabitant
,
its
notable
sight
and


building
.
he
be
answer
by
Miss
de
Bassompierre
in
quite
womanly


sort
;
with
intelligence
,
with
a
manner
not
indeed
wholly


disindividualize
:
a
tone
,
a
glance
,
a
gesture
,
here
and
there
,
rather


animated
and
quick
than
measure
and
stately
,
still
recall
little


polly
;
but
yet
there
be
so
fine
and
even
a
polish
,
so
calm
and


courteous
a
grace
,
gilding
and
sustain
these
peculiarity
,
that
a


less
sensitive
man
than
Graham
would
not
have
venture
to
seize
upon


they
as
vantage
point
,
lead
to
franker
intimacy
.




yet
while
Dr.
Bretton
continue
subdue
,
and
,
for
he
,
sedate
,
he
be


still
observant
.
not
one
of
those
petty
impulse
and
natural
break


escape
he
.
he
do
not
miss
one
characteristic
movement
,
one


hesitation
in
language
,
or
one
lisp
in
utterance
.
at
time
,
in
speak


fast
,
she
still
lisp
;
but
colour
whenever
such
lapse
occur
,
and


in
a
painstaking
,
conscientious
manner
,
quite
as
amusing
as
the
slight


error
,
repeat
the
word
more
distinctly
.




whenever
she
do
this
,
Dr.
Bretton
smile
.
gradually
,
as
they


converse
,
the
restraint
on
each
side
slacken
:
might
the
conference


have
but
be
prolong
,
I
believe
it
would
soon
have
become
genial
:


already
to
Paulina
's
lip
and
cheek
return
the
wreathing
,
dimple


smile
;
she
lisp
once
,
and
forget
to
correct
herself
.
and
Dr.
John
,
I


know
not
how
_
he
_
change
,
but
change
he
do
.
he
do
not
grow
gayer
--
no


raillery
,
no
levity
sparkle
across
his
aspect
--
but
his
position
seem


to
become
one
of
more
pleasure
to
himself
,
and
he
speak
his
augment


comfort
in
readier
language
,
in
tone
more
suave
.
ten
year
ago
this


pair
have
always
find
abundance
to
say
to
each
other
;
the
intervene


decade
have
not
narrow
the
experience
or
impoverish
the
intelligence


of
either
:
besides
,
there
be
certain
nature
of
which
the
mutual


influence
be
such
,
that
the
more
they
say
,
the
more
they
have
to
say
.


for
these
out
of
association
grow
adhesion
,
and
out
of
adhesion
,


amalgamation
.




Graham
,
however
,
must
go
:
his
be
a
profession
whose
claim
be
neither


to
be
ignore
nor
deferred
.
he
leave
the
room
;
but
before
he
could
leave


the
house
there
be
a
return
.
I
be
sure
he
come
back
--
not
for
the


paper
,
or
card
in
his
desk
,
which
form
his
ostensible
errand
--
but
to


assure
himself
,
by
one
more
glance
,
that
Paulina
's
aspect
be
really


such
as
memory
be
bear
away
:
that
he
have
not
be
view
she


somehow
by
a
partial
,
artificial
light
,
and
make
a
fond
mistake
.
no
!


he
find
the
impression
true
--
rather
,
indeed
,
he
gain
than
lose
by


this
return
:
he
take
away
with
he
a
parting
look
--
shy
,
but
very


soft
--
as
beautiful
,
as
innocent
,
as
any
little
fawn
could
lift
out
of


its
cover
of
fern
,
or
any
lamb
from
its
meadow
-
bed
.




be
leave
alone
,
Paulina
and
I
keep
silence
for
some
time
:
we
both


take
out
some
work
,
and
ply
a
mute
and
diligent
task
.
the
white
-
wood


workbox
of
old
day
be
now
replace
by
one
inlay
with
precious


mosaic
,
and
furnish
with
implement
of
gold
;
the
tiny
and
tremble


finger
that
could
scarce
guide
the
needle
,
though
tiny
still
,
be
now


swift
and
skilful
:
but
there
be
the
same
busy
knitting
of
the
brow
,


the
same
little
dainty
mannerism
,
the
same
quick
turn
and


movement
--
now
to
replace
a
stray
tress
,
and
anon
to
shake
from
the


silken
skirt
some
imaginary
atom
of
dust
--
some
cling
fibre
of
thread
.




that
morning
I
be
disposed
for
silence
:
the
austere
fury
of
the


winter
-
day
have
on
I
an
awing
,
hush
influence
.
that
passion
of


January
,
so
white
and
so
bloodless
,
be
not
yet
spend
:
the
storm
have


rave
itself
hoarse
,
but
seem
no
nearer
exhaustion
.
have
Ginevra


Fanshawe
be
my
companion
in
that
drawing
-
room
,
she
would
not
have


suffer
I
to
muse
and
listen
undisturbed
.
the
presence
just
go
from


we
would
have
be
her
theme
;
and
how
she
would
have
ring
the
change


on
one
topic
!
how
she
would
have
pursue
and
pester
I
with
question


and
surmise
--
worried
and
oppress
I
with
comment
and
confidence
I


do
not
want
,
and
long
to
avoid
.




Paulina
Mary
cast
once
or
twice
towards
I
a
quiet
but
penetrate


glance
of
her
dark
,
full
eye
;
her
lip
half
open
,
as
if
to
the


impulse
of
come
utterance
:
but
she
see
and
delicately
respect
my


inclination
for
silence
.




"
this
will
not
hold
long
,
"
I
think
to
myself
;
for
I
be
not


accustomed
to
find
in
woman
or
girl
any
power
of
self
-
control
,
or


strength
of
self
-
denial
.
as
far
as
I
know
they
,
the
chance
of
a
gossip


about
their
usually
trivial
secret
,
their
often
very
washy
and
paltry


feeling
,
be
a
treat
not
to
be
readily
foregone
.




the
little
Countess
promise
an
exception
:
she
sew
till
she
be
tired


of
sewing
,
and
then
she
take
a
book
.




as
chance
would
have
it
,
she
have
seek
it
in
Dr.
Bretton
's
own


compartment
of
the
bookcase
;
and
it
prove
to
be
an
old
Bretton


book
--
some
illustrate
work
of
natural
history
.
often
have
I
see
she


stand
at
Graham
's
side
,
rest
that
volume
on
his
knee
,
and
read


to
his
tuition
;
and
,
when
the
lesson
be
over
,
beg
,
as
a
treat
,


that
he
would
tell
she
all
about
the
picture
.
I
watch
she
keenly
:


here
be
a
true
test
of
that
memory
she
have
boast
;
would
she


recollection
now
be
faithful
?




faithful
?
it
could
not
be
doubted
.
as
she
turn
the
leave
,
over
she


face
pass
gleam
after
gleam
of
expression
,
the
least
intelligent
of


which
be
a
full
greeting
to
the
Past
.
and
then
she
turn
to
the


title
-
page
,
and
look
at
the
name
write
in
the
schoolboy
hand
.
she


look
at
it
long
;
nor
be
she
satisfied
with
merely
look
:
she


gently
pass
over
the
character
the
tip
of
her
finger
,
accompany


the
action
with
an
unconscious
but
tender
smile
,
which
convert
the


touch
into
a
caress
.
Paulina
love
the
past
;
but
the
peculiarity
of


this
little
scene
be
,
that
she
_
say
_
nothing
:
she
could
feel
without


pour
out
her
feeling
in
a
flux
of
word
.




she
now
occupy
herself
at
the
bookcase
for
nearly
an
hour
;
take


down
volume
after
volume
,
and
renew
her
acquaintance
with
each
.
this


do
,
she
seat
herself
on
a
low
stool
,
rest
her
cheek
on
her
hand
,


and
think
,
and
still
be
mute
.




the
sound
of
the
front
door
open
below
,
a
rush
of
cold
wind
,
and
she


father
's
voice
speak
to
Mrs.
Bretton
in
the
hall
,
startle
she
at


last
.
she
spring
up
:
she
be
down

in
one
second

"

then
I
hear

provide
against
the

to
be
quite
snugly
sheltered

,

short
,

the
door
close

the

roll
softly
through
the
snow
;
and


back
return
the
Countess
,
pensive

anxious

evening
close

it
be
in


still
sort
:
walk
the
drawing
-
room
with
quite
noiseless
step
.
she


check
at
interval
her
velvet
march
;
incline
her
ear
,
and
consult


the
night
sound
:
I
should
rather
say
,
the
night
silence
;
for
now
,
at


last
,
the
wind
be
fall
.
the
sky
,
relieve
of
its
avalanche
,
lie


naked
and
pale
:
through
the
barren
bough
of
the
avenue
we
could
see
it


well
,
and
note
also
the
polar
splendour
of
the
new
-
year
moon
--
an
orb


white
as
a
world
of
ice
.
nor
be
it
late
when
we
see
also
the
return
of


the
carriage
.




Paulina
have
no
dance
of
welcome
for
this
evening
.
it
be
with
a
sort
of


gravity
that
she
take
immediate
possession
of
her
father
,
as
he
enter


the
room
;
but
she
at
once
make
he
her
entire
property
,
lead
he
to
the


seat
of
her
choice
,
and
,
while
softly
shower
round
he
honeyed
word


of
commendation
for
be
so
good
and
come
home
so
soon
,
you
would


have
think
it
be
entirely
by
the
power
of
her
little
hand
he
be


put
into
his
chair
,
and
settle
and
arrange
;
for
the
strong
man
seem


to
take
pleasure
in
wholly
yield
himself
to
this
dominion
-
potent


only
by
love
.




Graham
do
not
appear
till
some
minute
after
the
Count
.
Paulina
half


turn
when
his
step
be
hear
:
they
speak
,
but
only
a
word
or
two
;


their
finger
meet
a
moment
,
but
obviously
with
slight
contact
.
Paulina


remain
beside
her
father
;
Graham
throw
himself
into
a
seat
on
the


other
side
of
the
room
.




it
be
well
that
Mrs.
Bretton
and
Mr.
Home
have
a
great
deal
to
say
to


each
other
--
almost
an
inexhaustible
fund
of
discourse
in
old


recollection
;
otherwise
,
I
think
,
our
party
would
have
be
but
a


still
one
that
evening
.




after
tea
,
Paulina
's
quick
needle
and
pretty
golden
thimble
be
busily


ply
by
the
lamp
-
light
,
but
her
tongue
rest
,
and
her
eye
seem


reluctant
to
raise
often
their
lid
,
so
smooth
and
so
full
-
fringed
.


Graham
,
too
,
must
have
be
tired
with
his
day
's
work
:
he
listen


dutifully
to
his
elder
and
better
,
say
very
little
himself
,
and


follow
with
his
eye
the
gild
glance
of
Paulina
's
thimble
;
as
if
it


have
be
some
bright
moth
on
the
wing
,
or
the
golden
head
of
some


dart
little
yellow
serpent

from
this
date
my
life
do
not
want
variety
;
I
go
out
a
good
deal
,


with
the
entire
consent
of
Madame
Beck
,
who
perfectly
approve
the


grade
of
my
acquaintance
.
that
worthy
directress
have
never
from
the


first
treat
I
otherwise
than
with
respect
;
and
when
she
find
that
I


be
liable
to
frequent
invitation
from
a
chateau
and
a
great
hotel
,


respect
improve
into
distinction
.




not
that
she
be
fulsome
about
it
:
Madame
,
in
all
thing
worldly
,
be


in
nothing
weak
;
there
be
measure
and
sense
in
her
hot
pursuit
of


self
-
interest
,
calm
and
considerateness
in
her
close
clutch
of
gain
;


without
,
then
,
lay
herself
open
to
my
contempt
as
a
time
-
server
and


a
toadie
,
she
mark
with
tact
that
she
be
pleased
people
connect


with
her
establishment
should
frequent
such
associate
as
must


cultivate
and
elevate
,
rather
than
those
who
might
deteriorate
and


depress
.
she
never
praise
either
I
or
my
friend
;
only
once
when
she


be
sit
in
the
sun
in
the
garden
,
a
cup
of
coffee
at
her
elbow
and


the

her
hand

look
very
comfortable
,
and
I
come
up
and


ask
leave
of
absence
for
the
evening

deliver
herself
in
this


gracious
sort:--

to
I

such
delight

she
think
of
the
few
kind
word

not
thickly

the
diamond

sparely

my


little
hut
and
field
forlorn
and
sand
-
dry
,
pour
its
wealth
of
water


far
away
.
the
change
be
right
,
just
,
natural
;
not
a
word
could
be


say
:
but
I
love
my
Rhine
,
my
Nile
;
I
have
almost
worship
my
Ganges
,


and
I
grieve
that
the
grand
tide
should
roll
estranged
,
should
vanish


like
a
false
mirage
.
though
stoical
,
I
be
not
quite
a
stoic
;
drop


stream
fast
on
my
hand
,
on
my
desk
:
I
weep
one
sultry
shower
,
heavy


and
brief
.




but
soon
I
say
to
myself
,
"
the
Hope
I
be
bemoan
suffer
and
make


I
suffer
much
:
it
do
not
die
till
it
be
full
time
:
follow
an


agony
so
linger
,
death
ought
to
be
welcome
.
"




welcome
I
endeavour
to
make
it
.
indeed
,
long
pain
have
make
patience
a


habit
.
in
the
end
I
close
the
eye
of
my
dead
,
cover
its
face
,
and


compose
its
limb
with
great
calm
.




the
letter
,
however
,
must
be
put
away
,
out
of
sight
:
people
who
have


undergone
bereavement
always
jealously
gather
together
and
lock
away


memento
:
it
be
not
supportable
to
be
stab
to
the
heart
each
moment


by
sharp
revival
of
regret
.




one
vacant
holiday
afternoon
(
the
Thursday
)
go
to
my
treasure
,
with


intent
to
consider
its
final
disposal
,
I
perceive
--
and
this
time
with


a
strong
impulse
of
displeasure
--
that
it
have
be
again
tamper
with
:


the
packet
be
there
,
indeed
,
but
the
ribbon
which
secure
it
have
be


untie
and
retie
;
and
by
other
symptom
I
know
that
my
drawer
have
be


visit
.




this
be
a
little
too
much
.
Madame
Beck
herself
be
the
soul
of


discretion
,
besides
have
as
strong
a
brain
and
sound
a
judgment
as


ever
furnish
a
human
head
;
that
she
should
know
the
content
of
my


casket
,
be
not
pleasant
,
but
might
be
bear
.
Little
Jesuit


inquisitress
as
she
be
,
she
could
see
thing
in
a
true
light
,
and


understand
they
in
an
unperverted
sense
;
but
the
idea
that
she
have


venture
to
communicate
information
,
thus
gain
,
to
other
;
that
she


have
,
perhaps
,
amuse
herself
with
a
companion
over
document
,
in
my


eye
most
sacred
,
shock
I
cruelly
.
yet
,
that
such
be
the
case
I
now


see
reason
to
fear
;
I
even
guess
her
confidant
.
her
kinsman
,
M.
Paul


Emanuel
,
have
spend
yesterday
evening
with
she
:
she
be
much
in
the


habit
of
consult
he
,
and
of
discuss
with
he
matter
she


broach
to
no
one
else
.
this
very
morning
,
in
class
,
that
gentleman


have
favour
I
with
a
glance
which
he
seem
to
have
borrow
from


vashti
,
the
actress
;
I
have
not
at
the
moment
comprehend
that
blue
,


yet
lurid
,
flash
out
of
his
angry
eye
;
but
I
read
its
meaning
now
.


_
he
_
,
I
believe
,
be
not
apt
to
regard
what
concern
I
from
a
fair


point
of
view
,
nor
to
judge
I
with
tolerance
and
candour
:
I
have
always


find
he
severe
and
suspicious
:
the
thought
that
these
letter
,
mere


friendly
letter
as
they
be
,
have
fall
once
,
and
might
fall
again
,


into
his
hand
,
jar
my
very
soul
.




what
should
I
do
to
prevent
this
?
in
what
corner
of
this
strange
house


be
it
possible
to
find
security
or
secresy
?
where
could
a
key
be
a


safeguard
,
or
a
padlock
a
barrier
?




in
the
grenier
?
no
,
I
do
not
like
the
grenier
.
besides
,
most
of
the


box
and
drawer
there
be
moulder
,
and
do
not
lock
.
rat
,
too
,


gnaw
their
way
through
the
decayed
wood
;
and
mouse
make
nest
amongst


the
litter
of
their
content
:
my
dear
letter
(
most
dear
still
,
though


Ichabod
be
write
on
their
cover
)
might
be
consume
by
vermin
;


certainly
the
writing
would
soon
become
obliterate
by
damp
.
no
;
the


grenier
would
not
do
--
but
where
then
?




while
ponder
this
problem
,
I
sit
in
the
dormitory
window
-
seat
.
it


be
a
fine
frosty
afternoon
;
the
winter
sun
,
already
set
,
gleam


pale
on
the
top
of
the
garden
-
shrub
in
the
"
allee
defendue
.
"
one


great
old
pear
-
tree
--
the
nun
's
pear
-
tree
--
stand
up
a
tall
dryad


skeleton
,
grey
,
gaunt
,
and
strip
.
a
thought
strike
I
--
one
of
those


queer
fantastic
thought
that
will
sometimes
strike
solitary
people
.
I


put
on
my
bonnet
,
cloak
,
and
fur
,
and
go
out
into
the
city
.




bend
my
step
to
the
old
historical
quarter
of
the
town
,
whose
hoax


and
overshadow
precinct
I
always
seek
by
instinct
in
melancholy


mood
,
I
wander
on
from
street
to
street
,
till
,
having
cross
a
half


deserted
"
place
"
or
square
,
I
find
myself
before
a
sort
of
broker
's


shop
;
an
ancient
place
,
full
of
ancient
thing
.
what
I
want
be
a


metal
box
which
might
be
solder
,
or
a
thick
glass
jar
or
bottle
which


might
be
stopper
or
seal
hermetically
.
amongst
miscellaneous
heap
,


I
find
and
purchase
the
latter
article
.




I
then
make
a
little
roll
of
my
letter
,
wrap
they
in
oil
silk
,


bind
they
with
twine
,
and
,
having
put
they
in
the
bottle
,
get
the
old


Jew
broker
to
stopper
,
seal
,
and
make
it
air
-
tight
.
while
obey
my


direction
,
he
glance
at
I
now
and
then
suspiciously
from
under
his


frost
-
white
eyelash
.
I
believe
he
think
there
be
some
evil
deed
on


hand
.
in
all
this
I
have
a
dreary
something
--
not
pleasure
--
but
a
sad
,


lonely
satisfaction
.
the
impulse
under
which
I
act
,
the
mood


control
I
,
be
similar
to
the
impulse
and
the
mood
which
have


induce
I
to
visit
the
confessional
.
with
quick
walking
I
regain
the


pensionnat
just
at
dark
,
and
in
time
for
dinner
.




at
seven
o'clock
the
moon
rise
.
at
half
-
past
seven
,
when
the
pupil
and


teacher
be
at
study
,
and
Madame
Beck
be
with
her
mother
and


child
in
the
salle
-
a
-
manger
,
when
the
half
-
boarder
be
all
go


home
,
and
Rosine
have
leave
the
vestibule
,
and
all
be
still
--
I
shawle


myself
,
and
,
take
the
seal
jar
,
steal
out
through
the
first
-
classe


door
,
into
the
berceau
and
thence
into
the
"
allee
defendue
.
"




Methusaleh
,
the
pear
-
tree
,
stand
at
the
further
end
of
this
walk
,
near


my
seat
:
he
rise
up
,
dim
and
gray
,
above
the
low
shrub
round
he
.


now
Methusaleh
,
though
so
very
old
,
be
of
sound
timber
still
;
only


there
be
a
hole
,
or
rather
a
deep
hollow
,
near
his
root
.
I
know
there


be
such
a
hollow
,
hide
partly
by
ivy
and
creeper
grow
thick


round
;
and
there
I
meditate
hide
my
treasure
.
but
I
be
not
only


go
to
hide
a
treasure
--
I
mean
also
to
bury
a
grief
.
that
grief
over


which
I
have
lately
be
weep
,
as
I
wrap
it
in
its
winding
-
sheet
,


must
be
inter
.




well
,
I
clear
away
the
ivy
,
and
find
the
hole
;
it
be
large
enough


to
receive
the
jar
,
and
I
thrust
it
deep
in
.
in
a
tool
-
shed
at
the


bottom
of
the
garden
,
lie
the
relic
of
building
-
material
,
leave
by


mason
lately
employ
to
repair
a
part
of
the
premise
.
I
fetch


thence
a
slate
and
some
mortar
,
put
the
slate
on
the
hollow
,
secure
it


with
cement
,
cover
the
hole
with
black
mould
,
and
,
finally
,
replace


the
ivy
.
this
do
,
I
rest
,
lean
against
the
tree
;
linger
,
like


any
other
mourner
,
beside
a
newly
-
sod
grave
.




the
air
of
the
night
be
very
still
,
but
dim
with
a
peculiar
mist
,


which
change
the
moonlight
into
a
luminous
haze
.
in
this
air
,
or
this


mist
,
there
be
some
quality
--
electrical
,
perhaps
--
which
act
in


strange
sort
upon
I
.
I
feel
then
as
I
have
feel
a
year
ago
in


England
--
on
a
night
when
the
aurora
boreali
be
stream
and
sweep


round
heaven
,
when
,
belate
in
lonely
field
,
I
have
pause
to
watch


that
mustering
of
an
army
with
banner
--
that
quivering
of
serrie


lance
--
that
swift
ascent
of
messenger
from
below
the
north
star
to


the
dark
,
high
keystone
of
heaven
's
arch
.
I
feel
,
not
happy
,
far


otherwise
,
but
strong
with
reinforce
strength
.




if
life
be
a
war
,
it
seem
my
destiny
to
conduct
it
single
-
handed
.
I


ponder
now
how
to
break
up
my
winter
-
quarter
--
to
leave
an
encampment


where
food
and
forage
fail
.
perhaps
,
to
effect
this
change
,
another


pitch
battle
must
be
fight
with
fortune
;
if
so
,
I
have
a
mind
to
the


encounter
:
too
poor
to
lose
,
God
might
destine
I
to
gain
.
but
what


road
be
open?--what
plan
available
?




on
this
question
I
be
still
pause
,
when
the
moon
,
so
dim
hitherto
,


seem
to
shine
out
somewhat
bright
:
a
ray
gleam
even
white
before


I
,
and
a
shadow
become
distinct
and
mark
.
I
look
more
narrowly
,
to


make
out
the
cause
of
this
well
-
define
contrast
appear
a
little


suddenly
in
the
obscure
alley
:
whiter
and
blacker
it
grow
on
my
eye
:
it


take
shape
with
instantaneous
transformation
.
I
stand
about
three
yard


from
a
tall
,
sable
-
robed
,
snowy
-
veiled
woman
.




five
minute
pass
.
I
neither
flee
nor
shriek
.
she
be
there
still
.


I
speak
.




"
who
be
you
?
and
why
do
you
come
to
I
?
"




she
stand
mute
.
she
have
no
face
--
no
feature
:
all
below
her
brow
be


mask
with
a
white
cloth
;
but
she
have
eye
,
and
they
view
I
.




I
feel
,
if
not
brave
,
yet
a
little
desperate
;
and
desperation
will


often
suffice
to
fill
the
post
and
do
the
work
of
courage
.
I
advance


one
step
.
I
stretch
out
my
hand
,
for
I
mean
to
touch
she
.
she
seem


to
recede
.
I
draw
near
:
her
recession
,
still
silent
,
become
swift
.
a


mass
of
shrub
,
full
-
leave
evergreen
,
laurel
and
dense
yew
,


intervene
between
I
and
what
I
follow
.
having
pass
that
obstacle
,


I
look
and
see
nothing
.
I
wait
.
I
said,--"if

I
have
not
that

to

private
governess

be
unnatural
to


I

rather
than
fill
the
former

deliberately

have
go
wrong
finding

as
to
Mary

,
I
visit
she
with
pleasure
,

I
would


not

long
be

M.
de
Bassompierre
,
for
his
part
,
seem
impervious
to
this
conjecture

blind
to
this
possibility

unconscious
as
any

fitful

up

scientific

keen

intent

somewhat
oppugnant
in
what
concern
his
favourite


pursuit

unsuspicious

trustful
in
the
ordinary
affair
of


life

could
gather
,
he
seem
to

Mr.
Home
,
a
model


teacher
,
the
essence
of
the
sedate
and
discreet
:
somewhat
conventional
,


perhaps
,
too
strict
,
limited
,
and
scrupulous
,
but
still
the
pink
and


pattern
of
governess
-
correctness
;
whilst
another
person
,
Professor
Paul


Emanuel
,
to
wit
,
never
lose
an
opportunity
of
intimate
his
opinion


that
mine
be
rather
a
fiery
and
rash
nature
--
adventurous
,
indocile
,


and
audacious
.
I
smile
at
they
all
.
if
any
one
know
I

little


Paulina

as
I
would
not
be
Paulina
's
nominal
and
pay
companion
,
genial
and


harmonious
as
I
begin
to
find
her
intercourse
,
she
persuade
I
to
join


she
in
some
study
,
as
a
regular

settle
mean
of
sustain


communication

she
propose
the
german
language
,
which
,
like
myself
,


she
find
difficult
of
mastery
.
we
agree
to
take
our
lesson
in
the


rue
Crecy
of
the
same
mistress

this
arrangement
throw
we
together
for


some
hour
of
every
week
.
M.
de
Bassompierre
seem
quite
pleased
:
it


perfectly
meet
his
approbation
,
that
Madame
Minerva
Gravity
should


associate
a
portion
of
her
leisure
with
that
of
his
fair
and
dear
child
.




that
other
self
-
elect
judge
of
mine
,
the
professor
in
the
Rue


Fossette
,
discover
by
some
surreptitious
spying
mean
,
that
I
be
no


long
so
stationary
as
hitherto
,
but
go
out
regularly
at
certain


hour
of
certain
day
,
take
it
upon
himself
to
place
I
under


surveillance
.

say
M.

have
be

up
amongst

should
more
readily
have
accredit
this
report

his


manoeuvre

well
mask
.
as
it
be
,
I
doubt
it
.
never
be
a


more
undisguised
schemer
,
a
franker
,
loose
intriguer
.
he
would
analyze


his
own
machination
:
elaborately
contrive
plot
,
and
forthwith
indulge


in
explanatory
boast
of
their
skill
.
I
know
not
whether
I
be
more


amused
or
provoke
,
by
his
stepping
up
to
I
one
morning
and
whisper


solemnly
that
he
"

his
eye
on

_
he
_
at

would
discharge
the


duty
of
a
friend
,

not
leave
I
entirely
to
my
own
device

my


proceeding
seem
at
present
very
unsettled

he
do
not
know
what
to


make
of
they

he
think
his
cousin
Beck
very
much
to
blame
in


suffer
this
sort
of
flutter
inconsistency
in
a
teacher
attach


to
her
house
.

have
a
person
devote
to
a
serious
calling

education

of
greatness

feverishly
athirst

the
pomp

no

a
worthy
,
hearty
woman

of
about
forty

five

she
ought
,
perhaps
,
to
have
live
in
the
day
of


Queen
Elizabeth
,
as
she
habitually
consume
,
for
her
first
and
second


breakfast
,
beer
and
beef
:
also
,
her
direct
and
downright
Deutsch


nature
seem
to
suffer
a
sensation
of
cruel
restraint
from
what
she


call
our
English
reserve
;
though
we
think
we
be
very
cordial
with


she
:
but
we
do
not
slap
she
on
the
shoulder
,
and
if
we
consent
to


kiss
her
cheek
,
it
be
do
quietly
,

without
any
explosive
smack

omission
oppress

the

on
very
well

accustomed
to
instruct
foreign
girl
,

hardly
ever
will
think
and
study
for
themselves

who
have
no
idea
of


grapple
with
a
difficulty
,

overcome
it
by
dint
of
reflection

application
--
our
progress
,

in
truth
be
very
leisurely

to


astound

the
young

_
a

proud

little
fastidious

perhaps
,
with
her
native
delicacy
and
beauty
,
she
have
a
right
to
these


feeling
;
but
I
think
it
be
a
total
mistake
to
ascribe
they
to
I

I


never
evade
the

always
keep
it
clear

bright

rough
german
sally

Honest

Braun

some
measure

this
difference

while
she


half

fear

half
-
worshipped
Paulina
,
as
a
sort
of
dainty
nymph

take
refuge

I

be
all
mortal

of
easy


mood
.




a
book
we
like
well
to
read
and
translate
be
Schiller

ballad
;


Paulina
soon
learn
to
read
they
beautifully
;
the
Fraeulein
would


listen
to
she
with
a
broad
smile
of
pleasure
,

say
her
voice
sound


like
music

she
translate
they
,
too

with
a
facile
flow
of
language
,

in
a
strain
of
kindre
and
poetic
fervour

flush

lip
tremblingly

learn
the
good

would
often
recite

plaintive

in
the

sense
she
would
criticise

she
murmur
,

we
sit


over

evening:--

very
right
in
its
view
,
yet
believe
also
that
I
be
not
quite
wrong


in
mine
.




there
be
people
whom
a
lower
position
degrade
morally
,
to
whom
loss


of
connection
cost
loss
of
self
-
respect
:
be
not
these
justified
in


place
the
high
value
on
that
station
and
association
which
be


their
safeguard
from
debasement
?
if
a
man
feel
that
he
would
become


contemptible
in
his
own
eye
be
it
generally
know
that
his
ancestry


be
simple
and
not
gentle
,
poor
and
not
rich
,
worker
and
not


capitalist
,
would
it
be
right
severely
to
blame
he
for
keep
these


fatal
fact
out
of
sight
--
for
start
,
tremble
,
quail
at
the


chance
which
threaten
exposure
?
the
long
we
live
,
the
more
out


experience
widen
;
the
less
prone
be
we
to
judge
our
neighbour
's


conduct
,
to
question
the
world
's
wisdom
:
wherever
an
accumulation
of


small
defence
be
find
,
whether
surround
the
prude
's
virtue
or
the


man
of
the
world
's
respectability
,
there
,
be
sure
,
it
be
need
.




we
reach
the
Hotel
Crecy
;
Paulina
be
ready
;
Mrs.
Bretton
be
with


she
;
and
,
under
her
escort
and
that
of
M.
de
Bassompierre
,
we
be
soon


conduct
to
the
place
of
assembly
,
and
seat
in
good
seat
,
at
a


convenient
distance
from
the
Tribune
.
the
youth
of
the
Athenee
be


marshal
before
we
,
the
municipality
and
their
bourgmestre
be
in


place
of
honour
,
the
young
prince
,
with
their
tutor
,
occupy
a


conspicuous
position
,
and
the
body
of
the
building
be
crowd
with
the


aristocracy
and
first
burgher
of
the
town
.




concern
the
identity
of
the
professor
by
whom
the
"
discour
"
be
to


be
deliver
,
I
have
as
yet
entertain
neither
care
nor
question
.
some


vague
expectation
I
have
that
a
savant
would
stand
up
and
deliver
a


formal
speech
,
half
dogmatism
to
the
Athenians
,
half
flattery
to
the


prince
.




the
Tribune
be
yet
empty
when
we
enter
,
but
in
ten
minute
after
it


be
fill
;
suddenly
,
in
a
second
of
time
,
a
head
,
chest
,
and
arm
grow


above
the
crimson
desk
.
this
head
I
know
:
its
colour
,
shape
,
port
,


expression
,
be
familiar
both
to
I
and
Miss
Fanshawe
;
the
blackness


and
closeness
of
cranium
,
the
amplitude
and
paleness
of
brow
,
the


blueness
and
fire
of
glance
,
be
detail
so
domesticate
in
the


memory
,
and
so
knit
with
many
a
whimsical
association
,
as
almost
by


this
their
sudden
apparition
,
to
tickle
fancy
to
a
laugh
.
indeed
,
I


confess
,
for
my
part
,
I
do
laugh
till
I
be
warm
;
but
then
I
bend
my


head
,
and
make
my
handkerchief
and
a
lowered
veil
the
sole
confidant


of
my
mirth
.




I
think
I
be
glad
to
see
M.
Paul
;
I
think
it
be
rather
pleasant
than


otherwise
,
to
behold
he
set
up
there
,
fierce
and
frank
,
dark
and


candid
,
testy
and
fearless
,
as
when
regnant
on
his
estrade
in
class
.


his
presence
be
such
a
surprise
:
I
have
not
once
think
of
expect


he
,
though
I
know
he
fill
the
chair
of
Belles
Lettres
in
the


college
.
with
_
he
_
in
that
Tribune
,
I
feel
sure
that
neither
formalism


nor
flattery
would
be
our
doom
;
but
for
what
be
vouchsafe
we
,
for


what
be
pour
suddenly
,
rapidly
,
continuously
,
on
our
head
--
I
own
I


be
not
prepare
.




he
speak
to
the
prince
,
the
noble
,
the
magistrate
,
and
the
burgher
,


with
just
the
same
ease
,
with
almost
the
same
pointed
,
choleric


earnestness
,
with
which
he
be
wo
nt
to
harangue
the
three
division
of


the
Rue
Fossette
.
the
collegian
he
address
,
not
as
schoolboy
,
but


as
future
citizen
and
embryo
patriot
.
the
time
which
have
since
come


on
Europe
have
not
be
foretell
yet
,
and
M.
Emanuel
's
spirit
seem
new


to
I
.
who
would
have
think
the
flat
and
fat
soil
of
Labassecour


could
yield
political
conviction
and
national
feeling
,
such
as
be


now
strongly
express
?
of
the
bearing
of
his
opinion
I
need
here
give


no
special
indication
;
yet
it
may
be
permit
I
to
say
that
I


believe
the
little
man
not
more
earnest
than
right
in
what
he
say
:


with
all
his
fire
he
be
severe
and
sensible
;
he
trample
utopian


theory
under
his
heel
;
he
reject
wild
dream
with
scorn;--but
when


he
look
in
the
face
of
tyranny
--
oh
,
then
there
open
a
light
in
his


eye
worth
see
;
and
when
he
speak
of
injustice
,
his
voice
give
no


uncertain
sound
,
but
remind
I
rather
of
the
band
-
trumpet
,
ring
at


twilight
from
the
park
.




I
do
not
think
his
audience
be
generally
susceptible
of
share
his


flame
in
its
purity
;
but
some
of
the
college
youth
catch
fire
as
he


eloquently
tell
they
what
should
be
their
path
and
endeavour
in
their


country
's
and
in
Europe
's
future
.
they
give
he
a
long
,
loud
,
ring


cheer
,
as
he
conclude
:
with
all
his
fierceness
,
he
be
their
favourite


professor
.




as
our
party
leave
the
Hall
,
he
stand
at
the
entrance
;
he
see
and
know


I
,
and
lift
his
hat
;
he
offer
his
hand
in
pass
,
and
utter
the


word
"
Qu'en
dite
vous?"--question
eminently
characteristic
,
and


remind
I
,
even
in
this
his
moment
of
triumph
,
of
that
inquisitive


restlessness
,
that
absence
of
what
I
consider
desirable
self
-
control
,


which
be
amongst
his
fault
.
he
should
not
have
care
just
then
to


ask
what
I
think
,
or
what
anybody
think
,
but
he
_
do
_
care
,
and
he


be
too
natural
to
conceal
,
too
impulsive
to
repress
his
wish
.
well
!
if


I
blame
his
over
-
eagerness
,
I
like
his
_
naivete
_
.
I
would
have


praise
he
:
I
have
plenty
of
praise
in
my
heart
;
but
,
alas
!
no
word
on


my
lip
.
who
_
have
_
word
at
the
right
moment
?
I
stammer
some
lame


expression
;
but
be
truly
glad
when
other
people
,
come
up
with


profuse
congratulation
,
cover
my
deficiency
by
their
redundancy
.




a
gentleman
introduce
he
to
M.
de
Bassompierre
;
and
the
Count
,
who


have
likewise
be
highly
gratify
,
ask
he
to
join
his
friend
(
for


the
most
part
M.
Emanuel
's
likewise
)
,
and
to
dine
with
they
at
the


Hotel
Crecy
.
he
decline
dinner
,
for
he
be
a
man
always
somewhat
shy


at
meet
the
advance
of
the
wealthy
:
there
be
a
strength
of
sturdy


independence
in
the
stringing
of
his
sinew
--
not
obtrusive
,
but


pleasant
enough
to
discover
as
one
advance
in
knowledge
of
his


character
;
he
promise
,
however
,
to
step
in
with
his
friend
,
M.
A----
,


a
French
Academician
,
in
the
course
of
the
evening
.




at
dinner
that
day
,
Ginevra
and
Paulina
each
look
,
in
her
own
way
,


very
beautiful
;
the
former
,
perhaps
,
boast
the
advantage
in
material


charm
,
but
the
latter
shine
pre
-
eminent
for
attraction
more
subtle


and
spiritual
:
for
light
and
eloquence
of
eye
,
for
grace
of
mien
,
for


win
variety
of
expression
.
Ginevra
's
dress
of
deep
crimson
relieve


well
her
light
curl
,
and
harmonize
with
her
rose
-
like
bloom
.


Paulina
's
attire
--
in
fashion
close
,
though
faultlessly
neat
,
but
in


texture
clear
and
white
--
make
the
eye
grateful
for
the
delicate
life
of


her
complexion
,
for
the
soft
animation
of
her
countenance
,
for
the


tender
depth
of
her
eye
,
for
the
brown
shadow
and
bounteous
flow
of


her
hair
--
dark
than
that
of
her
Saxon
cousin
,
as
be
also
she


eyebrow
,
her
eyelash
,
her
full
irid
,
and
large
mobile
pupil
.


nature
having
trace
all
these
detail
slightly
,
and
with
a
careless


hand
,
in
Miss
Fanshawe
's
case
;
and
in
Miss
de
Bassompierre
's
,
work


they
to
a
high
and
delicate
finish
.




Paulina
be
awe
by
the
savant
,
but
not
quite
to
mutism
:
she
converse


modestly
,
diffidently
;
not
without
effort
,
but
with
so
true
a


sweetness
,
so
fine
and
penetrate
a
sense
,
that
her
father
more
than


once
suspend
his
own
discourse
to
listen
,
and
fix
on
she
an
eye
of


proud
delight
.
it
be
a
polite
frenchman
,
M.
Z----
,
a
very
learn
,
but


quite
a
courtly
man
,
who
have
draw
she
into
discourse
.
I
be
charm


with
her
French
;
it
be
faultless
--
the
structure
correct
,
the
idiom


true
,
the
accent
pure
;
Ginevra
,
who
have
live
half
her
life
on
the


continent
,
could
do
nothing
like
it
not
that
word
ever
fail
Miss


Fanshawe
,
but
real
accuracy
and
purity
she
neither
possess
,
nor
in


any
number
of
year
would
acquire
.
here
,
too
,
M.
de
Bassompierre
be


gratify
;
for
,
on
the
point
of
language
,
he
be
critical
.




another
listener
and
observer
there
be
;
one
who
,
detain
by
some


exigency
of
his
profession
,
have
come
in
late
to
dinner
.
both
lady


be
quietly
scan
by
Dr.
Bretton
,
at
the
moment
of
take
his
seat


at
the
table
;
and
that
guard
survey
be
more
than
once
renew
.
his


arrival
rouse
Miss
Fanshawe
,
who
have
hitherto
appear
listless
:
she


now
became
smile
and
complacent
,
talk
--
though
what
she
say
be


rarely
to
the
purpose
--
or
rather
,
be
of
a
purpose
somewhat


mortifyingly
below
the
standard
of
the
occasion
.
her
light
,


disconnect
prattle
might
have
gratify
Graham
once
;
perhaps
it


please
he
still
:
perhaps
it
be
only
fancy
which
suggest
the


think
that
,
while
his
eye
be
fill
and
his
ear
feed
,
his
taste
,
his


keen
zest
,
his
lively
intelligence
,
be
not
equally
consult
and


regale
.
it
be
certain
that
,
restless
and
exact
as
seem
the
demand


on
his
attention
,
he
yield
courteously
all
that
be
require
:
his


manner
show
neither
pique
nor
coolness
:
Ginevra
be
his
neighbour
,


and
to
she
,
during
dinner
,
he
almost
exclusively
confine
his
notice
.


she
appear
satisfied
,
and
pass
to
the
drawing
-
room
in
very
good


spirit
.




yet
,
no
soon
have
we
reach
that
place
of
refuge
,
than
she
again


become
flat
and
listless
:
throw
herself
on
a
couch
,
she
denounce


both
the
"
discour
"
and
the
dinner
as
stupid
affair
,
and
inquire
of


her
cousin
how
she
could
hear
such
a
set
of
prosaic
"
gro
-
bonnet
"
as


her
father
gather
about
he
.
the
moment
the
gentleman
be

,
her
railing
cease
:
she
start
up
,
fly
to
the
piano
,
and


dash
at
it
with
spirit
.
Dr.
Bretton
entering
,
one
of
the
first
,
take


up
his
station
beside
she
.
I
think
he
would
not
long
maintain
that


post
:
there
be
a
position
near
the
hearth
to
which
I
expect
to
see


he
attract
:
this
position
he
only
scan
with
his
eye
;
while
_
he
_


look
,
other
draw
in
.
the
grace
and
mind
of
Paulina
charm
these


thoughtful
frenchman
:
the
fineness
of
her
beauty
,
the
soft
courtesy
of


her
manner
,
her
immature
,
but
real
and
inbred
tact
,
please
their


national
taste
;
they
cluster
about
she
,
not
indeed
to
talk
science
;


which
would
have
render
she
dumb
,
but
to
touch
on
many
subject
in


letter
,
in
art
,
in
actual
life
,
on
which
it
soon
appear
that
she


have
both
read
and
reflect
.
I
listen
.
I
be
sure
that
though
Graham


stand
aloof
,
he
listen
too
:
his
hearing
as
well
as
his
vision
be


very
fine
,
quick
,
discriminate
.
I
know
he
gather
the
conversation
;


I
feel
that
the
mode
in
which
it
be
sustain
suit
he


exquisitely
--
please
he
almost
to
pain
.




in
Paulina
there
be
more
force
,
both
of
feeling
and
character
;
than


most
people
think
--
than
Graham
himself
imagine
--
than
she
would
ever


show
to
those
who
do
not
wish
to
see
it
.
to
speak
truth
,
reader
,
there


be
no
excellent
beauty
,
no
accomplished
grace
,
no
reliable
refinement
,


without
strength
as
excellent
,
as
complete
,
as
trustworthy
.
as
well


might
you
look
for
good
fruit
and
blossom
on
a
rootless
and
sapless


tree
,
as
for
charm
that
will
endure
in
a
feeble
and
relaxed
nature
.


for
a
little
while
,
the
bloom
semblance
of
beauty
may
flourish
round


weakness
;
but
it
can
not
bear
a
blast
:
it
soon
fade
,
even
in
serenest


sunshine
.
Graham
would
have
start
have
any
suggestive
spirit
whisper


of
the
sinew
and
the
stamina
sustain
that
delicate
nature
;
but
I
who


have
know
she
as
a
child
,
know
or
guess
by
what
a
good
and
strong


root
her
grace
hold
to
the
firm
soil
of
reality
.




while
Dr.

listen
,
and
wait

opening
in
the
magic
circle
,


his
glance
restlessly

chance

I

I
I

I
also
have
my
own
smile
at
my
own

:
it
be
now
about
three
month
since
Dr.

have
speak
to


I
--
a
lapse
of
which
he
be
not
even
conscious
.
he
sit
down
,
and
become


silent
.
his
wish
be
rather
to
look
than
converse
.
Ginevra
and
Paulina


be
now
opposite
to

:
he
could
gaze

in
for
the
evening
conversation
;

amongst
the


gentleman
,
I
may
incidentally
observe
,
I
have
already
notice
by


glimpse
,
a
severe
,
dark
,
professorial
outline
,
hover
aloof
in
an


inner
saloon
,
see
only
in
vista
.
M.
Emanuel
know
many
of
the
gentleman


present
,
but
I
think
be
a
stranger
to
most
of
the
lady
,
except


myself
;
in
look
towards
the
hearth
,
he
could
not

see
I
,

naturally
make
a
movement
to
approach
;
see
,
however
,
Dr.
Bretton


also
,
he
change
his
mind
and
hold
back
.
if
that
have
be
all
,
there


would
have
be
no
cause
for
quarrel
;
but
not
satisfied
with
hold


back
,
he
pucker
up
his
eyebrow
,
protrude
his
lip
,
and
look
so


ugly

I
avert
my
eye
from
the
displeasing
spectacle
.
M.

ah
,
Graham
!
I
have
give
more
than
one


solitary
moment
to
thought
and
calculation
of
your
estimate
of
Lucy


Snowe
:
be
it
always
kind
or
just
?
have
Lucy
be
intrinsically
the
same


but
possess
the
additional
advantage
of
wealth
and
station
,
would


your
manner
to
she
,
your
value
for
she
,
have
be
quite
what
they


actually
be
?
and
yet
by
these
question
I
would
not
seriously
infer


blame

no
;
you
might
sadden

sometimes

before
the

more

I


could
,
and
do
say
without
difficulty
.
this
distinction
exist
not
for


he
,
however
,
and
he
be
quite
satisfied
with
the
english
phrase
.
he


smile
.
you
should
have
see
he
smile
,
reader
;
and
you
should
have


mark
the
difference
between
his
countenance
now
,
and
that
he
wear


half
an
hour
ago
.
I
can
not
affirm
that
I
have
ever
witness
the
smile


of
pleasure
,

content
,
or
kindness
round
M.

's
lip
,

in
his


eye
before

the
ironic
,
the
sarcastic
,
the
disdainful
,
the


passionately
exultant
,
I
have
hundred
of
time
see
he
express
by
what


he
call
a
smile
,
but
any
illuminated
sign
of
milder
or
warm


feeling
strike
I
as
wholly
new
in
his
visage
.
it
change
it
as
from
a


mask
to
a
face
:
the
deep
line
leave
his
feature
;
the
very
complexion


seem
clear
and
fresher
;
that
swart
,
sallow
,
southern
darkness
which


speak
his
spanish
blood
,
became
displace
by
a
light
hue
.
I
know
not


that
I
have
ever
see
in
any
other
human
face
an
equal
metamorphosis


from
a
similar
cause
.
he
now
take
I
to
the
carriage

the

moment
M.

pretty
humour

Mistress
Fanshawe

she
have
find
the
evening
a


grand
failure
:
completely
upset
as
to
temper
,
she
give
way
to
the
most


uncontrolled
moroseness
as
soon
as
we
be

,
and
the

closed

her
invective
against
Dr.

something


venomous
in

having
find
herself
impotent
either
to
charm
or


ste
he
,
hatred
be
her
only
resource
;
and
this
hatred
she
express


in
term
so
unmeasured
and
proportion
so
monstrous
,
that
,
after


listen
for
a
while
with
assume
stoicism

my
outraged
sense
of


justice
at
last

suddenly
catch
fire

an
explosion
ensue
:
for
I


could
be
passionate
,
too
;
especially
with
my
present
fair
but
faulty


associate
,
who
never
fail
to
stir
the
bad
dreg
of
I
.
it
be
well


that
the
carriage

make
a
tremendous
rattle
over
the
flinty


Choseville

I
can
assure
the
reader
there
be
neither
dead


silence
nor
calm
discussion
within
the
vehicle
.
half
in
earnest
,
half


in
seeming
,
I
make
it
my
business
to
storm
down
Ginevra
.
she
have
set


out
rampant
from
the
Rue
Crecy
;
it
be
necessary
to
tame
she
before
we


reach
the
Rue
Fossette
:
to
this
end
it
be
indispensable
to
show
up


her
sterling
value
and
high
desert
;
and
this
must
be
do
in
language


of
which
the
fidelity
and
homeliness
might
challenge
comparison
with


the
compliment
of
a
John
Knox
to
a
Mary
Stuart
.
this
be
the
right


discipline
for
Ginevra
;
it
suit
she
.
I
be
quite
sure
she
go
to
bed


that
night
all
the
well
and
more

my

at
the
frame

my
ear
regale
themselves


with
listen
to
the
crescendo
and
cadence
of
a
voice
harangue
in


the
neighbouring
classe
,
in
tone
that
wax
momentarily
more
unquiet
,


more
ominously
varied

there
be
a
good
strong
partition

wall
between


I
and
the
gathering
storm

against

be
sure
to
revolt

however
,
I
accept
the
responsibility

not

certainly
,
without
fear

fear
blent
with
other

unsteady
hand
would
permit

to

slow

bustling

rattle
a
latch

be
aggravation
of
crime


often
more
disastrous
in
result
than
the
main
crime
itself
.
there
I


stand
then
,
and
there
he
sit
;
his
humour
be
visibly
bad
--
almost
at
its


worst
;
he
have
be
give
a
lesson
in
arithmetic
--
for
he
give
lesson


on
any
and
every
subject
that
strike
his
fancy
--
and
arithmetic
be
a


dry
subject
,
invariably
disagree
with
he
:
not
a
pupil
but
tremble


when
he
speak
of
figure
.
he
sit
,
bend
above
his
desk
:
to
look
up
at


the
sound
of
an
entrance
,
at
the
occurrence
of
a
direct
breach
of
his


will
and
law
,
be
an
effort
he
could
not
for
the
moment
bring
himself


to
make
.
it
be
quite
as
well
:
I
thus
gain
time
to
walk
up
the
long


classe
;
and
it
suit
my
idiosyncracy
far
well
to
encounter
the
near


burst
of
anger
like
his
,
than
to
bear
its
menace
at
a
distance
.




at
his
estrade
I
pause
,
just
in
front
;
of
course
I
be
not
worthy
of


immediate
attention
:
he
proceed
with
his
lesson
.
disdain
would
not


do
:
he
must
hear
and
he
must
answer
my
message
.




not
be
quite
tall
enough
to
lift
my
head
over
his
desk
,
elevate


upon
the
estrade
,
and
thus
suffer
eclipse
in
my
present
position
,
I


venture
to
peep
round
,
with
the
design
,
at
first
,
of
merely
get
a


well
view
of
his
face
,
which
have
strike
I
when
I
enter
as
bear


a
close
and
picturesque
resemblance
to
that
of
a
black
and
sallow


tiger
.
twice
do
I
enjoy
this
side
-
view
with
impunity
,
advance
and


recede
unseen
;
the
third
time
my
eye
have
scarce
dawn
beyond
the


obscuration
of
the
desk
,
when
it
be
catch
and
transfix
through
its


very
pupil
--
transfix
by
the
"
lunette
.
"
rosine
be
right
;
these


utensil
have
in
they
a
blank
and
immutable
terror
,
beyond
the
mobile


wrath
of
the
wearer
's
own
unglazed
eye
.




I
now
find
the
advantage
of
proximity
:
these
short
-
sighted
"
lunette
"


be
useless
for
the
inspection
of
a
criminal
under
Monsieur
's
nose
;


accordingly
,
he
doff
they
,
and
he
and
I
stand
on
more
equal
term
.




I
be
glad
I
be
not
really
much
afraid
of
he
--
that
,
indeed
,
close
in


his
presence
,
I
feel
no
terror
at
all
;
for
upon
his
demand
cord
and


gibbet
to
execute
the
sentence
recently
pronounce
,
I
be
able
to


furnish
he
with
a
needleful
of
embroider
thread
with
such


accommodate
civility
as
could
not
but
allay
some
portion
at
least
of


his
surplus
irritation
.
of
course
I
do
not
parade
this
courtesy
before


public
view
:
I
merely
hand
the
thread
round
the
angle
of
the
desk
,


and
attach
it
,
ready
noosed
,
to
the
bar
back
of
the
Professor
's


chair
.




"
Que
I
voulez

say
he
in
a
growl
of
which
the
music
be
wholly


confine
to
his
chest
and
throat
,
for
he
keep
his

deliver

its

his

an
immediate

the
summon

stand

wait
in
silence

not

he
wave
an
impatient
negative

venture
to
stretch
my
hand

the
bonnet

lie
in
grim


repose

daring
movement

his


eye

mixed
pity

mutter

with
great
respect

lay
the
bonnet
on

its
tassel


seem
to
give
I
an
awful
nod

he
,
still
bent
on


evasion
.




know
well

would
_
not

gently
push

Lucy


Snowe

have

they
so
fall

each
clear
pebble

bereaved
Professor

under
the

patient
as

he
have
take
a

up

clear
the

it

Monsieur

perseveringly
for
minute


together

have
see
he
give
she
a
quarter

of
-
an
-
hour
's
gaze
,
while


the

be
silently
compose

he
sit
throne
on
his
estrade
,


unoccupied
.
conscious
always
of
this
basilisk
attention
,
she
would


writhe
under
it
,
half

flattered
,
half
-
puzzle
,
and
Monsieur
would


follow
her
sensation
,
sometimes
look
appallingly
acute
;
for
in
some


case
,
he
have
the
terrible
unerre
penetration
of
instinct
,
and


pierce
in
its
hiding
-
place
the
last
lurk
thought
of
the
heart
,
and


discern
under
florid
veiling
the
bare
;
barren
place
of
the
spirit
:


yes
,
and
its
perverted
tendency
,
and
its
hide
false
curve
--
all


that
man
and
woman
would
not
have
know
--
the
twisted
spine
,
the


malforme
limb
that
be
bear
with
they
,

far
bad
,
the
stain
or


disfigurement
they
have
perhaps
bring
on
themselves
.
no
calamity
so


accurse
but
M.
Emanuel
could
pity
and
forgive
,
if
it
be
acknowledge


candidly
;
but
where
his
questioning
eye
meet
dishonest
denial
--
where


his
ruthless
research
find
deceitful
concealment
--
oh
,
then
,
he
could


be
cruel
,
and
I
think
wicked
!
he
would
exultantly
snatch
the
screen


from
poor
shrink
wretch
,
passionately
hurry
they
to
the
summit
of


the
mount
of
exposure
,
and
there
show
they
all
naked
,
all
false
--
poor


live
lie
--
the
spawn
of
that
horrid
truth
which
can
not
be

on

.
he
think
he
do
justice
;
for
my
part
I
doubt
whether
man


have
a
right
to
do
such
justice
on
man
:
more
than
once
in
these

I
have
felt
compel
to
give
tear
to
his
victim
,
and


not
spare
ire
and
keen
reproach
to
himself
.
he
deserve
it
;
but
it
be


difficult
to
shake
he
in
his
firm
conviction
that
the
work
be


righteous
and
need
.

be
over
and

the

bell
rang

I
look
on
they
as
thing
rootless

perishable

their

solitary
symbolic

somewhere

some
small
knot
of


violet

something

win
myself

possess
a
duplicate
key

I
wonder
still
more
,
on


approach
,
to
hear
a
vague
movement
as
of
life
--
a
step
,
a
chair


stir
,
a
sound
like
the
opening
of
a

"
it
be
only
Madame
Beck
do
inspection
duty
,
"
be
the
conclusion


follow
a
moment
's
reflection
.
the
partially
-
open
door
give


opportunity
for
assurance
on
this
point
.
I
look
.
behold
!
not
the


inspect
garb
of
Madame
Beck
--
the
shawl
and
the
clean
cap
--
but
the


coat
,
and
the
close
-
shorn
,
dark
head
of
a
man
.
this
person
occupy
my


chair
;
his
olive
hand
hold
my
desk
open
,
his
nose
be
lose
to
view


amongst
my
paper
.
his
back
be
towards
I
,
but
there
could
not
be
a


moment
's
question
about
identity
.
already
be
the
attire
of

cherished

just

hand

on


the
most
intimate
term

my
desk

it
raise

lower
the


lid
,
ransack
and
arrange
the
content
,
almost
as
familiarly
as
my


own
.
the
fact
be
not
dubious
,
nor
do
he
wish
it
to
be
so
:
he
leave


sign

each

palpable

unmistakable
;
hitherto
,
however
,
I
have


never
catch
he
in
the
act
:
watch
as
I
would
,
I
could
not
detect
the


hour
and
moment
of
his
coming

I
see
the
brownie
's
work
in
exercise


leave
overnight
full
of
fault
,
and
find
next
morning
carefully


correct
:
I
profit
by
his
capricious
good
-
will
in
loan
full
welcome


and
refreshing
.
between
a
sallow
dictionary
and
worn
-
out
grammar
would


magically
grow
a
fresh
interesting
new
work
,
or
a
classic
,
mellow
and


sweet
in
its
ripe
age
.
out
of
my
work

basket
would
laughingly
peep
a


romance

with

peccant
brochure
forth
to

purify
breeze

be

that


formality

the


inference

instantly
relieve
my
hand

its
burden
,
and
,
in
another


moment
,
would
have
thrust
the

into
the
glowing
stove

I

glad

glad

a
smile

the

so
serious
a
misunderstanding
have
formerly
arise
,
I
take
good


care
not
to
make
too
much
room
for
he

he
watch
with
a
jealous

side

long
look
,
to
see
whether
I
shrink
away

I
do
not

the


bench

crowded

lose
the

recoil

no

formidable

restrained

meet
the
punishment

perhaps
merit

be
both
indulgent

good

M.
PAUL
.






yet
the
reader
be
advise
not
to
be
in
any
hurry
with
his
kindly


conclusion
,

to
suppose
,
with
an
over
-
hasty
charity
,
that
from
that


day
M.
Paul
become
a
changed
character
--
easy
to
live
with
,
and
no


long
apt
to
flash
danger
and
discomfort
round
he
.




no
;
he
be
naturally
a
little
man
of
unreasonable
mood
.
when


over
-
wrought
,
which
he
often
be
,
he
become
acutely
irritable
;
and
,


besides
,
his
vein
be
dark
with
a
livid
belladonna
tincture
,
the


essence
of
jealousy
.
I
do
not
mean
merely
the
tender
jealousy
of
the


heart
,
but
that
sterner
,
narrow
sentiment
whose
seat
be
in
the
head
.




I
use
to
think
,
as
I
sat
look
at
M.
Paul
,
while
he
be
knit
his


brow
or
protrude
his
lip
over
some
exercise
of
mine
,
which
have
not
as


many
fault
as
he
wish
(
for
he
like
I
to
commit
fault
:
a
knot
of


blunder
be
sweet
to
he
as
a
cluster
of
nut
)
,
that
he
have
point
of


resemblance
to
Napoleon
Bonaparte
.
I
think
so
still
.




in
a
shameless
disregard
of
magnanimity
,
he
resemble
the
great


emperor
.
M.
Paul
would
have
quarrel
with
twenty
learn
woman
,
would


have
unblushingly
carry
on
a
system
of
petty
bickering
and


recrimination
with
a
whole
capital
of
coterie
,
never
trouble
himself


about
loss
or
lack
of
dignity
.
he
would
have
exile
fifty
Madame
de


stael
,
if
,
they
have
annoy
,
offend
,
outrivalle
,
or
oppose
he
.




I
well
remember
a
hot
episode
of
his
with
a
certain
Madame
Panache
--
a


lady
temporarily
employ
by
Madame
Beck
to
give
lesson
in
history
.


she
be
clever
--
that
is
,
she
know
a
good
deal
;
and
,
besides
,
thoroughly


possess
the
art
of
make
the
most
of
what
she
know
;
of
word
and


confidence
she
hold
unlimited
command
.
her
personal
appearance
be
far


from
destitute
of
advantage
;
I
believe
many
people
would
have


pronounce
she
"
a
fine
woman
;
"
and
yet
there
be
point
in
her
robust


and
ample
attraction
,
as
well
as
in
her
bustling
and
demonstrative


presence
,
which
,
it
appear
,
the
nice
and
capricious
taste
of
M.
Paul


could
not
away
with
.
the
sound
of
her
voice
,
echo
through
the
carre
,


would
put
he
into
a
strange
taking
;
her
long
free
step
--
almost


stride
--
along
the
corridor
,
would
often
make
he
snatch
up
his
paper


and
decamp
on
the
instant
.




with
malicious
intent
he
bethink
himself
,
one
day
,
to
intrude
on
she


class
;
as
quick
as
lightning
he
gather
her
method
of
instruction
;
it


differ
from
a
pet
plan
of
his
own
.
with
little
ceremony
,
and
less


courtesy
,
he
point
out
what
he
term
her
error
.
whether
he
expect


submission
and
attention
,
I
know
not
;
he
meet
an
acrid
opposition
,


accompany
by
a
round
reprimand
for
his
certainly
unjustifiable


interference
.




instead
of
withdraw
with
dignity
,
as
he
might
still
have
do
,
he


throw
down
the
gauntlet
of
defiance
.
Madame
Panache
,
bellicose
as
a


Penthesilea
,
pick
it
up
in
a
minute
.
she
snap
her
finger
in
the


intermeddler
's
face
;
she
rush
upon
he
with
a
storm
of
word
.
m.


Emanuel
be
eloquent
;
but
Madame
Panache
be
voluble
.
a
system
of


fierce
antagonism
ensue
.
instead
of
laugh
in
his
sleeve
at
his
fair


foe
,
with
all
her
sore
amour
-
propre
and
loud
self
-
assertion
,
M.
Paul


detest
she
with
intense
seriousness
;
he
honour
she
with
his
earnest


fury
;
he
pursue
she
vindictively
and
implacably
,
refuse
to
rest


peaceably
in
his
bed
,
to
derive
due
benefit
from
his
meal
,

even


serenely
to
relish
his
cigar
,
till
she
be
fairly
rooted
out
of
the


establishment
.
the
Professor
conquer
,
but
I
can
not
say
that
the


laurel
of
this
victory
shadow
gracefully
his
temple
.
once
I


venture
to
hint
as
much
.
to
my
great
surprise
he
allow
that
I
might


be
right
,
but
aver
that
when
bring
into
contact
with
either
man
or


woman
of
the
coarse
,
self
-
complacent
quality
,
whereof
Madame
Panache


be
a
speciman
,
he
have
no
control
over
his
own
passion
;
an
unspeakable


and
active
aversion
impel
he
to
a
war
of
extermination
.




three
month
afterwards
,
hear
that
his
vanquish
foe
have
meet
with


reverse
,
and
be
likely
to
be
really
distressed
for
want
of


employment
,
he
forget
his
hatred
,
and
alike
active
in
good
and
evil
,
he


move
heaven
and
earth
till
he
find
she
a
place
.
upon
she
come
to


make
up
former
difference
,
and
thank
he
for
his
recent
kindness
,
the


old
voice
--
a
little
loud
--
the
old
manner
--
a
little
forward
--
so
act


upon
he
that
in
ten
minute
he
start
up
and
bow
she
,
or
rather


himself
,
out
of
the
room
,
in
a
transport
of
nervous
irritation
.




to
pursue
a
somewhat
audacious
parallel
,
in
a
love
of
power
,
in
an


eager
grasp
after
supremacy
,
M.
Emanuel
be
like
Bonaparte
.
he
be
a


man
not
always
to
be
submit
to
.
sometimes
it
be
needful
to
resist
;


it
be
right
to
stand
still
,
to
look
up
into
his
eye
and
tell
he
that


his
requirement
go
beyond
reason
--
that
his
absolutism
verge
on


tyranny
.




the
dawning
,
the
first
development
of
peculiar
talent
appear


within
his
range
,
and
under
his
rule
,
curiously
excited
,
even
disturb


he
.
he
watch
its
struggle
into
life
with
a
scowl
;
he
hold
back
his


hand
--
perhaps
say
,
"
come
on
if
you
have
strength
,
"
but
would
not
aid


the
birth
.




when
the
pang
and
peril
of
the
first
conflict
be
over
,
when
the


breath
of
life
be
draw
,
when
he
see
the
lung
expand
and
contract
,


when
he
feel
the
heart
beat
and
discover
life
in
the
eye

do
not


yet
offer
to
foster
.




"

yourself
true

cherish
you

be
his
ordinance
;
and
how


difficult
he
make
that
proof
!
what
thorn
and
brier
,
what
flint
,
he


strew
in
the
path
of
foot
not
inure
to
rough
travel
!
he
watch


tearlessly
--
ordeal
that
he
exact
should
be
pass


through
--
fearlessly
.
he
follow
footprint
that
,
as
they
approach


the
bourne
,
be
sometimes
mark
in
blood

follow
they
grimly
,


hold
the
austere
police
-
watch
over
the
pain
-
pressed
pilgrim
.
and


when
at
last
he
allow
a
rest
,
before
slumber
might
close
the
eyelid
,


he
open
those
same
lid
wide
,
with
pitiless
finger
and
thumb
,
and


gaze
deep
through
the
pupil
and
the
irid
into
the
brain
,
into
the


heart
,
to
search
if
Vanity
,
or
Pride
,
or
Falsehood
,
in
any
of
its


subtle
form
,
be
discoverable
in
the
furth
recess
of
existence
.


if
,
at
last
,
he
let
the
neophyte
sleep
,
it
be
but
a
moment
;
he
wake


he
suddenly
up
to
apply
new
test
:
he
send
he
on
irksome
errand
when


he
be
stagger
with
weariness
;
he
try
the
temper
,
the
sense
,
and


the
health
;
and
it
be
only
when
every
severest
test
have
be
apply


and
endure
,
when
the
most
corrosive
aquafortis
have
be
use
,
and


fail
to
tarnish
the
ore
,
that
he
admit
it
genuine
,
and
,
still
in


clouded
silence
,
stamp
it
with
his
deep
brand
of
approval
.




I
speak
not
ignorant
of
these
evil
.




till
the
date
at
which
the
last
chapter
close
,
M.
Paul
have
not
be
my


professor

he
have
not
give
I
lesson
,
but
about
that
time
,


accidentally
hear
I
one
day
acknowledge
an
ignorance
of
some
branch


of
education
(
I
think
it
be
arithmetic
)
,
which
would
have
disgrace
a


charity
-
school
boy
,
as
he
very
truly
remark
,
he
take
I
in
hand
,


examine
I
first
,
find
I
,
I
need
not
say
,
abundantly
deficient
,
give


I
some
book
and
appoint
I
some
task
.




he
do
this
at
first
with
pleasure
,
indeed
with
unconcealed
exultation
,


condescend
to
say
that
he
believe
I
be
"
bonne

(
i.e.
well
enough
disposed

development

the
beginning
of
all
effort
have
indeed
with
I
be
mark
by
a


preternatural
imbecility
.
I
never
could
,
even
in
form
a
common


acquaintance
,
assert
or
prove
a
claim
to
average
quickness
.
a


depressing
and
difficult
passage
have
preface
every
new
page
I
have


turn
in
life
.




so
long
as
this
passage
last
,
M.
Paul
be
very
kind
,
very
good
,
very


forbear
;
he
see
the
sharp
pain
inflict
,
and
feel
the
weighty


humiliation
impose
by
my
own
sense
of
incapacity
;
and
word
can
hardly


do
justice
to
his
tenderness
and
helpfulness
.
his
own
eye
would


moisten
,
when
tear
of
shame
and
effort
cloud
mine
;
burden
as
he


be
with
work
,
he
would
steal
half
his
brief
space
of
recreation
to


give
to
I
.




but
,
strange
grief
!
when
that
heavy
and
overcast
dawn
begin
at
last
to


yield
to
day
;
when
my
faculty
begin
to
struggle
themselves
,
free
,
and


my
time
of
energy
and
fulfilment
come
;
when
I
voluntarily
double
,


treble
,
quadruple
the
task
he
set
,
to
please
he
as
I
think
,
his


kindness
become
sternness
;
the
light
change
in
his
eye
from
a
beam
to


a
spark
;
he
fret
,
he
oppose
,
he
curb
I
imperiously
;
the
more
I


do
,
the
hard
I
work
,
the
less
he
seem
content
.
sarcasm
of
which


the
severity
amazed
and
puzzle
I
,
harass
my
ear
;
then
flow
out


the
bitter
inuendoe
against
the
"
pride
of
intellect
.
"
I
be
vaguely


threaten
with
I
know
not
what
doom
,
if
I
ever
trespass
the
limit


proper
to
my
sex
,
and
conceive
a
contraband
appetite
for
unfeminine


knowledge
.
alas
!
I
have
no
such
appetite
.
what
I
love
,
it
joy
I
by


any
effort
to
content
;
but
the
noble
hunger
for
science
in
the


abstract
--
the
godlike
thirst
after
discovery
--
these
feeling
be
know


to
I
but
by
briefest
flash
.




yet
,
when
M.
Paul
sneer
at
I
,
I
want
to
possess
they
more
fully
;


his
injustice
stir
in
I
ambitious
wish
--
it
impart
a
strong


stimulus
--
it
give
wing
to
aspiration
.




in
the
beginning
,
before
I
have
penetrate
to
motive
,
that


uncomprehended
sneer
of
his
make
my
heart
ache
,
but
by
-
and
-
by
it
only


warm
the
blood
in
my
vein
,
and
send
add
action
to
my
pulse
.


whatever
my
power
--
feminine
or
the
contrary
--
God
have
give
they
,
and
I


feel
resolute
to
be
ashamed
of
no
faculty
of
his
bestowal
.




the
combat
be
very
sharp
for
a
time
.
I
seem
to
have
lose
M.
Paul
's


affection
;
he
treat
I
strangely
.
in
his
most
unjust
moment
he
would


insinuate
that
I
have
deceive
he
when
I
appear
,
what
he
call


"
faible"--that
be
incompetent
;
he
say
I
have
feign
a
false


incapacity
.
again
,
he
would
turn
suddenly
round
and
accuse
I
of
the


most
far
-
fetched
imitation
and
impossible
plagiarism
,
assert
that


I
have
extract
the
pith
out
of
book
I
have
not
so
much
as
hear


of
--
and
over
the
perusal
of
which
I
should
infallibly
have
fall
down


in
a
sleep
as
deep
as
that
of
Eutychus
.




once
,
upon
his
preferring
such
an
accusation
,
I
turn
upon
he
--
I
rise


against
he
.
gather
an
armful
of
his
book
out
of
my
desk
,
I
fill


my
apron
and
pour
they
in
a

his

return
to
my
desk

I
lay
my
head
on
my

his
peace
somehow

too
readily

in
M.
Emanuel
's
soul
rankle
a
chronic
suspicion
that
I
know
both
Greek


and
Latin
.
as
monkey
be
say
to
have
the
power
of
speech
if
they


would
but
use
it
,
and
be
report
to
conceal
this
faculty
in
fear
of


its
be
turn
to
their
detriment
,
so
to
I
be
ascribe
a

of


knowledge

I
be
suppose
criminally

craftily
to
conceal

the


privilege
of
a
"
classical
education
,
"
it
be
insinuate
,
have
be


mine
;
on
flower
of
Hymettus
I
have
revel
;
a
golden
store
,
hive
in


memory
,
now
silently
sustain
my
effort
,
and
privily
nurture
my
wit
.




a
hundred
expedient
do
M.
Paul
employ
to
surprise
my
secret
--
to


wheedle
,
to
threaten
,
to
startle
it
out
of
I
.
sometimes
he
place


greek
and
latin
book
in
my
way
,
and
then
watch
I
,
as
Joan

Arc
's


jailor
tempt
she
with
the
warrior
's
accoutrement
,
and
lie
in
wait


for
the
issue
.
again
he
quote
I
know
not
what
author
and
passage
,


and
while
roll
out
their
sweet
and
sound
line
(
the
classic
tone


fall
musically
from
his
lip
--
for
he
have
a
good
voice
--
remarkable
for


compass
,
modulation
,
and
matchless
expression
)
,
he
would
fix
on
I
a


vigilant
,
pierce
,
and
often
malicious
eye
.
it
be
evident
he


sometimes
expect
great
demonstration
;
they
never
occur
,
however
;


not
comprehend
,
of
course
I
could
neither
be
charm
nor
annoyed
.




baffle
--
almost
angry
--
he
still
clung
to
his
fix
idea
;
my


susceptibility
be
pronounce
marble
--
my
face
a
mask
.
it
appear
as


if
he
could
not
be
bring
to
accept
the
homely
truth
,
and
take
I
for


what
I
be
:
man
,
and
woman
too
,
must
have
delusion
of
some
sort
;
if
not


make
ready
to
their
hand
,
they
will
invent
exaggeration
for
themselves
.




at
moment
I
_
do
_
wish
that
his
suspicion
have
be
well
found
.


there
be
time
when
I
would
have
give
my
right
hand
to
possess
the


treasure
he
ascribe
to
I
.
he
deserve
condign
punishment
for
his


testy
crotchet
.
I
could
have
glory
in
bring
home
to
he
his
bad


apprehension
astoundingly
realize
.
I
could
have
exult
to
burst
on


his
vision
,
confront
and
confound
his
"
lunette
,
"
one
blaze
of


acquirement

oh
!
why
do
nobody
undertake

make
I
clever
while
I


be
young
enough

sudden
,
inhuman


revelation

one
cold
,

from

tone
.




if
I
have
reply
meekly
by
an
unqualified
affirmative

I
believe
he


would
have
stretch
out
his

we
should
have

friend
on

I
answered--

he
inquire

sharply
.




unable
to
answer
this
question
in
a
breath
,
I
evade
it
by
change
of


subject

he
have
now
finish
his
half
of
the
brioche
feel
sure
that


on
so
trifle
a
fragment
he
could
not

satisfy
his
appetite

indeed
I
have
not
appease
mine
,

inhale
the
fragrance
of
baked


apple
afar
from

refectory

I
venture
to
inquire
whether
he
do


not
also
perceive
that
agreeable

he
confess
that
he

I


say
if
he
would
let
I
out
by
the
garden

door
,
and
permit
I
just
to


run
across
the
court
,
I
would
fetch
he
a
plateful

and
add
that
I


believe
they
be
excellent
,
as
Goton
have
a
very
good
method
of

two
of

go

"

he

quickly

"




and
at
last
he
liberate
I
on
parole
.
my
own
plan
be
to
go
and
return


with
speed
and
good
faith
,
to
put
the
plate
in
at
the
door
,
and
then
to


vanish
incontinent
,
leave
all
consequence
for
future
settlement
.




that
intolerably
keen
instinct
of
his
seem
to
have
anticipate
my


scheme
:
he
meet
I
at
the
threshold
,
hurry
I
into
the
room
,
and
fix


I
in
a
minute
in
my
former
seat
.
take
the
plate
of
fruit
from
my


hand
,
he
divide
the
portion
intend
only
for
himself
,
and
order
I


to
eat
my
share
.
I
comply
with
no
good
grace
,
and
vex
,
I
suppose
,


by
my
reluctance
,
he
open
a
masked
and
dangerous
battery
.
all
he
have


yet
say
,
I
could
count
as
mere
sound
and
fury
,
signify
nothing
:
not


so
of
the
present
attack
.




it
consist
in
an
unreasonable
proposition
with
which
he
have
before


afflict
I
:
namely
,
that
on
the
next
public
examination
-
day
I
should


engage
--
foreigner
as
I
be
--
to
take
my
place
on
the
first
form
of


first
-
class
pupil
,
and
with
they
improvise
a
composition
in
French
,
on


any
subject
any
spectator
might
dictate
,
without
benefit
of
grammar
or


lexicon
.




I
know
what
the
result
of
such
an
experiment
would
be
.
I
,
to
whom


nature
have
deny
the
impromptu
faculty
;
who
,
in
public
,
be
by
nature


a
cypher
;
whose
time
of
mental
activity
,
even
when
alone
,

not
under


the
meridian
sun
;
who
need
the
fresh
silence
of
morning
,
or
the


recluse
peace
of
evening
,
to
win
from
the
Creative
Impulse
one
evidence


of
his
presence

one
proof
of
his
force

whom
that
Impulse

the
most
intractable
,
the
most
capricious
,
the
most
maddening
of


master
(
he
before
I
always

deity

sometimes
,

circumstance

propitious

not

carven

stone
face

again

some
turn

some
sound
,
some


long

tremble
sob
of
the
wind
,
at
some
rush
past
of
an
unseen


stream
of
electricity

the
irrational
demon
would
wake
unsolicited
,


would
stir
strangely
alive
,
would
rush
from
its
pedestal
like
a


perturb
Dagon
,
call
to
its
votary
for
a
sacrifice
,
whatever
the


hour

its
victim
for
some
blood
,

some
breath

whatever
the


circumstance

scene

rouse
its
priest
,
treacherously
promise


vaticination
,
perhaps
fill
its
temple
with
a
strange
hum
of
oracle
,


but
sure
to
give
half
the
significance
to
fateful
wind
,
and
grudge


to
the
desperate
listener
even
a
miserable
remnant

yield
it


sordidly
,
as
though
each
word
have
be
a
drop
of
the
deathless
ichor
of


its
own
dark
vein

this
tyrant

be

M.

do
battle

battle

exhausted

refuge

solitary
sanctuary

down

to

a
pillow

awhile
I
listen
to
the
lullaby
of
bee
hum
in
the

watch
,
through

Madame

my

attraction

this

lay
,
I
remember
,


in
one
figure

that
of
a
handsome
young
girl

I
have
see
before
as


a
visitor
at
Madame
Beck

of

I

not


of
the
holiday
band

day

I
have
see
this
young
girl
with
he
ere


now
,
and
as
far
as
distant
observation
could
enable
I
to
judge
,
she


seem
to
enjoy
he
with
the
frank
ease
of
a
ward
with
an
indulgent


guardian
.
I
have
see
she
run
up
to
he
,
put
her
arm
through
his
,
and


hang
upon
he
.
once
,
when
she
do
so
,
a
curious
sensation
have
strike


through
I
--
a
disagreeable
anticipatory
sensation
--
one
of
the
family
of


presentiment
,
I
suppose
--
but
I
refuse
to
analyze
or
dwell
upon
it
.


while
watch
this
girl
,
Mademoiselle
Sauveur
by
name
,

follow


the
gleam
of
her
bright
silk
robe

always
richly
dress
,
for


she
be
say
to
be
wealthy

through
the
flower
and
the
glance
leave


of
tender
emerald
,
my
eye
become
dazzle
--
they
close
;
my
lassitude
,


the
warmth
of
the
day
,
the
hum
of
bee

bird
,

lull

,

at


last
I
sleep
.




two
hour

over
I
.
ere
I
wake

the

the
flower
be
close
;
the
party
of
guest
,
too
,


have
vanish
;
each
alley
be
void
.




on
waking
,
I
feel
much
at
ease
--
not
chill
,
as
I
ought
to
have
be


after
sit
so
still
for
at
least
two
hour
;
my
cheek
and
arm
be


not
benumb
by
pressure
against
the
hard
desk
.
no
wonder
.
instead
of


the
bare
wood
on
which
I
have
lay
they
,
I
find
a
thick
shawl
,


carefully
fold
,
substitute
for
support
,
and
another
shawl
(
both


take
from
the
corridor
where
such
thing
hang
)
wrap
warmly
round
I
.




who
have
do
this
?
who
be
my
friend
?
which
of
the
teacher
?
which
of


the
pupil
?
none
,
except
St.
Pierre
,
be
inimical
to
I
;
but
which
of


they
have
the
art
,
the
thought
,
the
habit
,
of
benefit
thus
tenderly
?


which
of
they
have
a
step
so
quiet
,
a
hand
so
gentle
,
but
I
should
have


hear
or
feel
she
,
if
she
have
approach
or
touch
I
in
a
day
-
sleep
?




as
to
Ginevra
Fanshawe
,
that
bright
young
creature
be
not
gentle
at


all
,
and
would
certainly
have
pull
I
out
of
my
chair
,
if
she
have


meddle
in
the
matter
.
I
say
at
last
:
"
it
be
Madame
Beck
's
doing
;
she


have
come
in
,
see
I
asleep
,
and
think
I
might
take
cold
.
she


consider
I
a
useful
machine
,
answer
well
the
purpose
for
which
it


be
hire
;
so
would
not
have
I
needlessly
injure
.
and
now
,
"


methought
,
"
I
'll
take
a
walk
;
the
evening
be
fresh
,
and
not
very
chill
.
"




so
I
open
the
glass
door
and
step
into
the
berceau
.




I
go
to
my
own
alley
:
have
it
be
dark
,
or
even
dusk
,
I
should
have


hardly
venture
there
,
for
I
have
not
yet
forget
the
curious
illusion


of
vision
(
if
illusion
it
be
)
experience
in
that
place
some
month


ago
.
but
a
ray
of
the
set
sun
burnish
still
the
grey
crown
of


Jean
Baptiste
;
nor
have
all
the
bird
of
the
garden
yet
vanish
into


their
nest
amongst
the
tufte
shrub
and
thick
wall
-
ivy
.
I
pace
up


and
down
,
think
almost
the
same
thought
I
have
ponder
that
night


when
I
bury
my
glass
jar
--
how
I
should
make
some
advance
in
life
,


take
another
step
towards
an
independent
position
;
for
this
train
of


reflection
,
though
not
lately
pursue
,
have
never
by
I
be
wholly


abandon
;
and
whenever
a
certain
eye
be
avert
from
I
,
and
a


certain
countenance
grow
dark
with
unkindness
and
injustice
,
into
that


track
of
speculation
do
I
at
once
strike
;
so
that
,
little
by
little
,
I


have
lay
half
a
plan

England

less
worried
about

emulous

nobody

in

as


homely

I
will
take

often

her

secure

a

"
Courage
,
Lucy
Snowe

with
self

and
economy
now
,
and
steady


exertion
by

and
-
by
,
an
object
in
life
need
not
fail
you
.
venture
not
to


complain
that
such
an
object
be
too
selfish
,
too
limited
,
and
lack


interest
;
be
content
to
labour
for
independence

you
have
prove
,


by
win
that
prize
,
your
right
to
look
high
.
but
afterwards
,
be


there
nothing
more
for
I
in
life
--
no
true
home
--
nothing
to
be
dearer


to
I
than
myself
,

by
its
paramount
preciousness
,
to
draw
from
I


well
thing

nothing
,
at
whose


foot
I
can
willingly
lay
down
the
whole
burden
of
human
egotism
,

gloriously
take
up
the
nobler
charge

I
suppose
,
Lucy

the
orb
of
your
life
be
not
to
be
so


rounded
:
for
you
,
the
crescent

phase
must
suffice
.
very
good
.
I
see
a


huge
mass
of
my
fellow
-
creature
in
no
well
circumstance
.
I
see
that


a
great
many
man
,

more
woman
,
hold
their
span
of
life
on
condition


of
denial

privation
.
I
find
no
reason
why
I
should
be
of
the
few


favour
.
I
believe
in
some
blending
of
hope
and
sunshine

dozen

for

a
note
address
to


Miss

I
spy
it
at
once
,
amidst
all

the


handwriting

not
strange

directly

Papa

be
another
letter
from
Dr.

;

but
the

Miss

strike
I
mute
.
I
actually
never
receive
a
letter
from
a
gentleman


before
.
ought
I
to
have
show
it
to
papa
,
and
let
he
open
it
and
read


it
first
?
I
could
not
for
my
life
,
Lucy
.
I
know
so
well
papa
's
idea


about
I
:
he
forget
my
age
;
he
think
I
be
a
mere
school
-
girl
;
he
be


not
aware
that
other
people
see
I
be
grow
up
as
tall
as
I
shall
be
;


so
,
with
a
curious
mixture
of
feeling
,
some
of
they
self
-
reproachful
,


and
some
so
fluttering
and
strong
,
I
can
not
describe
they
,
I
give
papa


his
twelve
letter
--
his
herd
of
possession
--
and
keep
back
my
one
,
my


ewe
-
lamb
.
it
lie
in
my
lap
during
breakfast
,
look
up
at
I
with
an


inexplicable
meaning
,
make
I
feel
myself
a
thing
double
-
existent
--
a


child
to
that
dear
papa
,
but
no
more
a
child
to
myself
.
after
breakfast


I
carry
my
letter
up
-
stair
,
and
having
secure
myself
by
turn
the


key
in
the
door
,
I
begin
to
study
the
outside
of
my
treasure
:
it
be


some
minute
before
I
could
get
over
the
direction
and
penetrate
the


seal
;
one
do
not
take
a
strong
place
of
this
kind
by
instant


storm
--
one
sit
down
awhile
before
it
,
as
beleaguer
say
.
Graham
's
hand


be
like
himself
,
Lucy
,
and
so
be
his
seal
--
all
clear
,
firm
,
and


rounded
--
no
slovenly
splash
of
wax
--
a
full
,
solid
,
steady
drop
--
a


distinct
impress
;
no
pointed
turn
harshly
prick
the
optic
nerve
,


but
a
clean
,
mellow
,
pleasant
manuscript
,
that
soothe
you
as
you
read
.


it
be
like
his
face
--
just
like
the
chiselling
of
his
feature
:
do
you


know
his
autograph

"
the
seal
be
too
beautiful
to
be
break
,
so
I
cut
it
round
with
my


scissor
.
on
the
point
of
read
the
letter
at
last
,
I
once
more
draw


back
voluntarily

it

soon

to
drink
that
draught

the


sparkle
in
the
cup
be
so
beautiful
--
I
would
watch
it
yet
a
minute
.


then
I
remember
all
at
once
that
I
have
not
say
my
prayer
that


morning
.
having
hear
papa
go
down
to
breakfast
a
little
early
than


usual

he
wait
,
and
have
hasten
to


join
he
as
soon
as
dress
,
think
no
harm
to
put
off
prayer
till


afterwards
.
some
people
would
say
I
ought
to
have
serve
God
first
and


then
man
;
but
I
do
n't
think
heaven
could
be
jealous
of
anything
I
might


do
for
papa

believe
I
be
superstitious

voice
seem
now
to

that
another
feeling
than
filial
affection
be
in
question

to
urge
I


to
pray
before
I
dare
to
read
what
I
so
long
to
read

to
deny
myself


yet
a
moment
,

first
a
great
duty
.
I
have
have
these


impulse
ever
since
I
can

put
the
letter
down
and
say
my


prayer

add
,
at
the
end

a
strong
entreaty
that
whatever
happen

I
might
not

tempt

to
cause
papa
any
sorrow
,

never

rather
the

on
my

napoleonic
compliment

,
be
enough
,


so
I
make
up
my
mind
to
be
of
the
party
.




the
morning
break
calm
as
summer
,
with
singing
of
bird
in
the
garden
,


and
a
light
dew
-
mist
that
promise
heat
.
we
all
say
it
would
be
warm
,


and
we
all
feel
pleasure
in
fold
away
heavy
garment
,
and
in


assume
the
attire
suit
a
sunny
season
.
the
clean
fresh
print


dress
,
and
the
light
straw

,
each
make
and
trim
as
the
french


workwoman
alone
can
make

trim
,
so
as
to
unite
the
utterly


unpretende
with
the
perfectly
become
,
be
the
rule
of
costume
.


nobody
flaunt
in
faded
silk
;
nobody
wear
a
second
-
hand
good
article
.




at
six
the
bell
ring
merrily
,
and
we
pour
down
the
staircase
,
through


the
carre
,
along
the
corridor
,
into
the
vestibule
.
there
stand
our


Professor
,
wear
,
not
his
savage

look
paletot
and
severe


bonnet
-
grec
,
but
a
young

look
belt
blouse
and
cheerful
straw
hat
.


he
have
for
we
all
the
kind
good
-
morrow
,
and
most
of
we
for
he
have
a


thanksgive
smile
.
we
be
marshal
in
order
and
soon
start
.




the
street
be
yet
quiet
,
and
the
boulevard
be
fresh
and
peaceful


as
field
.
I
believe
we
be
very
happy
as
we
walk
along
.
this
chief


of
our
have
the
secret
of
give
a
certain
impetus
to
happiness
when
he


would
;
just
as
,
in
an
opposite
mood

he
could
give

thrill

he
do
not
lead
nor
follow
we
,

walk
along
the
line
,
give
a
word


to
every
one
,
talk
much
to
his
favourite
,
and
not
wholly
neglect


even
those
he
dislike
.
it
be
rather
my
wish
,
for
a
reason
I
have
,
to


keep
slightly
aloof
from
notice
,
and
be
pair
with
Ginevra


Fanshawe
,
bear
on
my
arm
the
dear
pressure
of
that
angel
's
not


unsubstantial
limb--(she
continue
in
excellent
case
,
and
I
can
assure


the
reader
it
be
no
trifling
business
to
bear
the
burden
of
she


loveliness
;
many
a
time
in
the
course
of
that
warm
day
I
wish
to


goodness
there
have
be
less
of
the
charming
commodity)--however

as
I

,
I
try
to
make

useful

I


hear
he
come
up
to
the
right
hand
or
the
left
.
my
private
motive


for
this
manoeuvre
might
be
trace
to
the
circumstance
of
the
new
print

wear

pink

fact

,

present

make
I
feel
something

I
have
feel
,
when
,
clothe
in
a
shawl


with
a
red
border

necessitate
to
traverse
a
meadow

awhile

shift
system

together
with
some
modification
in


the
arrangement
of
a
black
silk
scarf

answer
my
purpose
;

out
,

whether
he
come
to
this
side
or
to
that
,


Miss
Fanshawe
be
still
his
neighbour
.
the
course
of
acquaintance


between
Ginevra
and
he
have
never
run
so
smooth
that
his
temper
do
not


undergo
a
certain
crisping
process
whenever
he
hear
her
English


accent

nothing

their
disposition

at

about
the
sixth

still
the

untoward
result

the
experiment

thrust
his


head
forward

his

always
a

business

at

I

through

the
felicitation
remain
to
be

to

I
rather

the
prospect
of
a
long
walk
,
deep
into
the
old
and
grim


Basse

I
like
it
no
bad

the
evening

settle

sullen

thick
snow

resignation

you
a
quiet
path

city

transform
a
Villette

let
,
then
,


the
rain
fall
,

the
flood
descend

must
first
get

Madame
Beck

give
I


the
address

it
be
no
street
at
all

it
seem
rather
to
be
part

a


square

it
be
quiet
,
grass
grow
between
the
broad
grey
flag
,
the


house

large

look
very
old

rise
the
appearance


of
tree
,

garden
at
the
back

antiquity
brood
above
this


region
,
business
be
banish
thence
.
rich
man
have
once
possess
this


quarter
,
and
once
grandeur
have
make
her
seat
here
.
that
church
,
whose


dark
,
half

ruinous
turret
overlook
the
square
,
be
the
venerable
and


formerly
opulent
shrine
of
the
Magi
.
but
wealth
and
greatness
have
long


since
stretch
their
gilded
pinion
and
flee
hence
,
leave
these


their
ancient
nest
,
perhaps
to
house
Penury
for
a
time
,
or
perhaps
to


stand
cold
and
empty
,
moulder
untenanted
in
the
course
of
winter
.




as
I
cross
this
deserted
"
place
,
"
on
whose
pavement
drop
almost
as


large
as
a
five
-
franc
piece
be
now
slowly
darken
,
I
see
,
in
its


whole
expanse
,
no
symptom
or
evidence
of
life
,
except
what
be
give
in


the
figure
of
an
infirm
old
priest
,
who
go
past
,
bend
and
prop


on
a
staff
--
the
type
of
eld
and
decay
.




he
have
issue
from
the
very
house
to
which
I
be
direct
;
and
when
I


pause
before
the
door
just
close
after
he
,
and
ring
the
bell
,
he


turn
to
look
at
I
.
nor
do
he
soon
avert
his
gaze
;
perhaps
he


think
I
,
with
my
basket
of
summer
fruit
,
and
my
lack
of
the
dignity


age
confer
,
an
incongruous
figure
in
such
a
scene
.
I
know
,
have
a
young


ruddy
-
face
bonne
open
the
door
to
admit
I
,
I
should
have
think


such
a
one
little
in
harmony
with
her
dwelling
;
but
,
when
I
find


myself
confront
by
a
very
old
woman
,
wear
a
very
antique
peasant


costume
,
a
cap
alike
hideous
and
costly
,
with
long
flap
of
native


lace
,
a
petticoat
and
jacket
of
cloth
,
and
sabot
more
like
little


boat
than
shoe
,
it
seem
all
right
,
and
soothingly
in
character
.




the
expression
of
her
face
be
not
quite
so
soothing
as
the
cut
of
she


costume
;
anything
more
cantankerous
I
have
seldom
see
;
she
would


scarcely
reply
to
my
inquiry
after
Madame
Walravens
;
I
believe
she


would
have
snatch
the
basket
of
fruit
from
my
hand
,
have
not
the
old


priest
,
hobble
up
,
check
she
,
and
himself
lend
an
ear
to
the


message
with
which
I
be
charge
.




his
apparent
deafness
render
it
a
little
difficult
to
make
he
fully


understand
that
I
must
see
Madame
Walravens
,
and
consign
the
fruit
into


her
own
hand
.
at
last
,
however
,
he
comprehend
the
fact
that
such


be
my
order
,
and
that
duty
enjoin
their
literal
fulfilment
.


address
the
aged
bonne
,
not
in
French
,
but
in
the
aboriginal
tongue


of
Labassecour
,
he
persuade
she
,
at
last
,
to
let
I
cross
the


inhospitable
threshold
,
and
himself
escort
I
up
-
stair
,
I
be


usher
into
a
sort
of
salon
,
and
there
leave
.




the
room
be
large
,
and
have
a
fine
old
ceiling
,
and
almost
church
-
like


window
of
colour
-
glass
;
but
it
be
desolate
,
and
in
the
shadow
of
a


come
storm
,
looked
strangely
lower
.
within
--
open
a
small
room
;


there
,
however
,
the
blind
of
the
single
casement
be
close
;
through


the
deep
gloom
few
detail
of
furniture
be
apparent
.
these
few
i


amuse
myself
by
puzzle
to
make
out
;
and
,
in
particular
,
I
be


attract
by
the
outline
of
a
picture
on
the
wall
.




by
-
and
-
by
the
picture
seem
to
give
way
:
to
my
bewilderment
,
it
shake
,


it
sink
,
it
roll
back
into
nothing
;
its
vanishing
leave
an
opening


arch
,
lead
into
an
arched
passage
,
with
a
mystic
wind
stair
;


both
passage
and
stair
be
of
cold
stone
,
uncarpeted
and
unpainted
.


down
this
donjon
stair
descend
a
tap
,
tap
,
like
a
stick
;
soon
there


fall
on
the
step
a
shadow
,
and
last
of
all
,
I
be
aware
of
a
substance
.




yet
,
be
it
actual
substance
,
this
appearance
approach
I
?
this


obstruction
,
partially
darken
the
arch
?




it
draw
near
,
and
I
see
it
well
.
I
begin
to
comprehend
where
I
be
.


well
might
this
old
square
be
name
quarter
of
the
Magi
--
well
might
the


three
tower
,
overlook
it
,
own
for
godfather
three
mystic
sage
of


a
dead
and
dark
art

Hoar
enchantment
here
prevail
;
a
spell
have


open
for
I
elf

that
cell

picture
,


that
arch
and
passage
,
and
stair
of
stone
,
be
all
part
of
a
fairy


tale
.
distincter
even
than
these
scenic
detail
stand
the
chief


figure
--
Cunegonde
,
the
sorceress

Malevola
,
the
evil
fairy
.
how
be
she
?




she
might
be
three
foot
high
,
but
she
have
no
shape
;
her
skinny
hand


rest
upon
each
other
,
and
press
the
gold
knob
of
a
wand

like
ivory


staff

her
face
be
large
,

not
upon
her
shoulder
,

before
she


breast
;
she
seem
to
have
no
neck
;
I
should
have
say
there
be
a


hundred
year
in
her
feature
,
and
more
perhaps
in
her
eye
--
she


malign
,
unfriendly
eye
,
with
thick
grey
brow
above
,
and
livid
lid


all
round
.
how
severely
they
view
I
,
with
a
sort
of
dull
displeasure
!




this
be
wear
a
gown
of
brocade
,
dye
bright
blue
,
full

tint
as
the


gentianella
flower
,
and
cover
with
satin
foliage
in
a
large
pattern
;


over
the
gown
a
costly
shawl
,
gorgeously
border
,
and
so
large
for


she
,
that
its
many
-
colour
fringe
sweep
the
floor
.
but
her
chief


point
be
her
jewel
:
she
have
long
,
clear
earring
,
blaze
with
a


lustre
which
could

staircase

a
seat
on
the
landing

there
I
wait
.


somebody
come
glide
along
the
gallery
just
above
;
it
be
the
old


priest
.




"
indeed
Mademoiselle

not

he
beg
I
so
earnestly
to
return
to
the
salon
,
that
,
without


discourtesy
,
I
could
not
but
comply
.
the
small
room
be
well


furnished
and
more
habitable
than
the
large
;
thither
he
introduce
I
.


partially
withdraw
the
blind
,
he
disclose
what
seem
more
like
an


oratory
than
a
boudoir
,
a
very
solemn
little
chamber
,
look
as
if
it


be
a
place
rather
dedicated
to
relic
and
remembrance
,
than
design


for
present
use
and
comfort
.




the
good
father
sit
down
,
as
if
to
keep
I
company
;
but
instead
of


conversing
,
he
take
out
a
book
,
fasten
on
the
page
his
eye
,
and


employ
his
lip
in
whispering
--
what
sound
like
a
prayer
or
litany
.


a
yellow
electric
light
from
the
sky
gild
his
bald
head
;
his
figure


remain
in
shade
--
deep
and
purple
;
he
sit
still
as
sculpture
;
he


seem
to
forget
I
for
his
prayer
;
he
only
look
up
when
a
fiercer


bolt
,
or
a
harsh
,
close
rattle
tell
of
near
danger
;
even
then
,
it


be
not
in
fear
,
but
in
seem
awe
,
he
raise
his
eye
.
I
too
be


awe
-
strike
;
be
,
however
,
under
no
pressure
of
slavish
terror
,
my


thought
and
observation
be
free
.




to
speak
truth
,
I
be
begin
to
fancy
that
the
old
priest
resemble


that
Pere
Silas
,
before
whom
I
have
kneel
in
the
church
of
the


beguinage
.
the
idea
be
vague
,
for
I
have
see
my
confessor
only
in
dusk


and
in
profile
,
yet
still
I
seem
to
trace
a
likeness
:
I
think
also


I
recognize
the
voice
.
while
I
watch
he
,
he
betray
,
by
one
lift


look
,
that
he
feel
my
scrutiny
;
I
turn
to
note
the
room
;
that
too
have


its
half
mystic
interest
.




beside
a
cross
of
curiously
carve
old
ivory
,
yellow
with
time
,
and


slope

a
dark

rich
missal


and
ebon

hang
the
picture
whose
dim
outline
have
draw
my
eye


before
--
the
picture
which
move
,
fall
away
with
the
wall
and
let
in


phantom
.
imperfectly
see
,
I
have
take
it
for
a
Madonna
;
reveal
by


clear
light
,
it
prove
to
be
a
woman
's
portrait
in
a
nun
's
dress
.
the


face
,
though
not
beautiful
,
be
pleasing
;
pale
,
young
,
and
shade
with


the
dejection
of
grief
or
ill
health
.
I
say
again
it
be
not
beautiful
;


it
be
not
even
intellectual
;
its
very
amiability
be
the
amiability
of


a
weak
frame
,
inactive
passion
,
acquiescent
habit
:
yet
I
look
long


at
that
picture
,
and
could
not
choose
but
look
.




the
old
priest
,
who
at
first
have
seem
to
I
so
deaf
and
infirm
,
must


yet
have
retain
his
faculty
in
tolerable
preservation
;
absorb
in


his
book
as
he
appear
,
without
once
lift
his
head
,
or
,
as
far
as
I


know
,
turn
his
eye
,
he
perceive
the
point
towards
which
my


attention
be
draw
,
and
,
in
a
slow
distinct
voice
,
drop
,
concern


it
,
these
four
observations:--




"

much
beloved

"

give
herself
to
God

I
inquire
,
fancy
that
I
have


discover
in
the
incurable
grief
of
bereavement
,
a
key
to
that

aged
lady

desperate

her
sorrow

only
the

Fate

Death

trebly

I
think
the
father
rather
wish

question
,

therefore
I


inquire
who
have
lose

who
still

"
Justine

.
"
I
get
,
in


reply
,
quite
a
little
romantic
narrative
,
tell
not
unimpressively
,
with


the
accompaniment
of
the
now
subside
storm
.
I
be
bind
to
say
it


might
have
be
make
much
more
truly
impressive
,
if
there
have
be
less


french
,
rousseau
-
like
sentimentalizing
and
wire
-
drawing
;
and
rather


more
healthful
carelessness
of
effect
.
but
the
worthy
father
be


obviously
a
frenchman
bear
and
breed
(
I
become
more
and
more
persuaded


of
his
resemblance
to
my
confessor)--he
be
a
true
son
of
Rome
;
when
he


do
lift
his
eye
,
he
look
at
I
out
of
their
corner
,
with
more
and


sharp
subtlety
than
,
one
would
have
think
,
could
survive
the
wear


and
tear
of
seventy
year
.
yet
,
I
believe
,
he
be
a
good
old
man
.




the
hero
of
his
tale
be
some
former
pupil
of
his
,
whom
he
now
call


his
benefactor
,
and
who
,
it
appear
,
have
love
this
pale
Justine
Marie
,


the
daughter
of
rich
parent
,
at
a
time
when
his
own
worldly
prospect


be
such
as
to
justify
his
aspiring
to
a
well
-
dower
hand
.
the


pupil
's
father
--
once
a
rich
banker
--
have
fail
,
die
,
and
leave
behind


he
only
debt
and
destitution
.
the
son
be
then
forbid
to
think
of


Marie
;
especially
that
old
witch
of
a
grand
-
dame
I
have
see
,
Madame


Walravens
,
oppose
the
match
with
all
the
violence
of
a
temper
which


deformity
make
sometimes
demoniac
.
the
mild
Marie
have
neither
the


treachery
to
be
false
,
nor
the
force
to
be
quite
staunch
to
her
lover
;


she
give
up
her
first
suitor
,
but
,
refuse
to
accept
a
second
with
a


heavy
purse
,
withdraw
to
a
convent
,
and
there
die
in
her
noviciate
.




last
anguish
,
it
seem
,
have
take
possession
of
the
faithful
heart

worship

the
truth
of
that
love
and
grief
have
be


show
in
a
manner
which
touch
even
I
,

I
listen
.




some
year
after
Justine

come
on
her

also

I
have
see
.
and
they
,
Pere
Silas
and


Modeste
Maria
Beck
(
that
these
two
work
in
concert
I
could
not


doubt
)
open
up
the
adytum
of
his
heart
--
show
I
one
grand
love
,
the


child
of
this
southern
nature
's
youth
,
bear
so
strong
and
perfect
,
that


it
have
laugh
at
Death
himself
,
despise
his
mean
rape
of
matter
,


clung
to
immortal
spirit
,
and
in
victory
and
faith
,
have
watch
beside


a
tomb
twenty
year
.




this
have
be
do
--
not
idly
:
this
be
not
a
mere
hollow
indulgence
of


sentiment
;
he
have
prove
his
fidelity
by
the
consecration
of
his
good


energy
to
an
unselfish
purpose
,
and
attest
it
by
limitless
personal


sacrifice
:
for
those
once
dear
to
she
he
prize
--
he
have
lay
down


vengeance
,
and
take
up
a
cross
.




now
,
as
for
Justine
Marie
,
I
know
what
she
be
as
well
as
if
I
have
see


she
.
I
know
she
be
well
enough
;
there
be
girl
like
she
in
Madame


Beck
's
school
--
phlegmatic
--
pale
,
slow
,
inert
,
but
kind
-
natured
,


neutral
of
evil
,
undistinguished
for
good
.




if
she
wear
angel
'
wing
,
I
know
whose
poet
-
fancy
confer
they
.
if


her
forehead
shine
luminous
with
the
reflex
of
a
halo
,
I
know
in
the


fire
of
whose
irid
that
circlet
of
holy
flame
have
generation
.




be
I
,
then
,
to
be
frighten
by
Justine
Marie
?
be
the
picture
of
a


pale
dead
nun
to
rise
,
an
eternal
barrier
?
and
what
of
the
charity


which
absorb
his
worldly
good
?
what
of
his
heart
swear
to
virginity
?




Madame
Beck
--
Pere
Silas
--
you
should
not
have
suggest
these
question
.


they
be
at
once
the
deep
puzzle
,
the
strong
obstruction
,
and


the
keen
stimulus
,
I
have
ever
feel
.
for
a
week
of
night
and
day
I


fall
asleep
--
I
dream
,
and
I
wake
upon
these
two
question
.
in
the


whole
world
there
be
no
answer
to
they
,
except
where
one
dark
little


man
stand
,
sit
,
walk
,
lecture
,
under
the
head
-
piece
of
a
bandit


bonnet
-
grec
,
and
within
the
girth
of
a
sorry
paletot
,
much
be
-
ink
,


and
no
little
adust
.




after
that
visit
to
the
Rue
des
Mages
,
I
_
do
_
want
to
see
he
again
.
I


feel
as
if
--
know
what
I
now
know
--
his
countenance
would
offer
a
page


more
lucid
,
more
interesting
than
ever
;
I
feel
a
longing
to
trace
in
it


the
imprint
of
that
primitive
devotedness
,
the
sign
of
that


half
-
knightly
,
half
-
saintly
chivalry
which
the
priest
's
narrative


impute
to
his
nature
.
he
have
become
my
christian
hero
:
under
that


character
I
want
to
view
he
.




nor
be
opportunity
slow
to
favour
;
my
new
impression
undergo
she


test
the
next
day
.
yes
:
I
be
grant
an
interview
with
my
"
Christian


hero"--an
interview
not
very
heroic
,
or
sentimental
,
or
biblical
,
but


lively
enough
in
its
way
.




about
three
o'clock
of
the
afternoon
,
the
peace
of
the
first


classe
--
safely
establish
,
as
it
seem
,
under
the
serene
sway
of


Madame
Beck
,
who
,
_
in
propria
persona
_
be
give
one
of
her
orderly


and
useful
lesson
--
this
peace
,
I
say
,
suffer
a
sudden
fracture
by


the
wild
inburst
of
a
paletot
.




nobody
at
the
moment
be
quieter
than
myself
.
ease
of
responsibility


by
Madame
Beck
's
presence
,
soothe
by
her
uniform
tone
,
pleased
and


edify
with
her
clear
exposition
of
the
subject
in
hand
(
for
she


teach
well
)
,
I
sit
bent
over
my
desk
,
draw
--
that
is
,
copy
an


elaborate
line
engraving
,
tediously
work
up
my
copy
to
the
finish
of


the
original
,
for
that
be
my
practical
notion
of
art
;
and
,
strange
to


say
,
I
take
extreme
pleasure
in
the
labour
,
and
could
even
produce


curiously
finical
chinese
facsimile
of
steel
or
mezzotint


plate
--
thing
about
as
valuable
as
so
many
achievement
in


worst
-
work
,
but
I
think
pretty
well
of
they
in
those
day
.




what
be
the
matter
?
my
drawing
,
my
pencil
,
my
precious
copy
,
gather


into
one
crush
-
up
handful
,
perish
from
before
my
sight
;
I
myself


appear
to
be
shake
or
empty
out
of
my
chair
,
as
a
solitary
and


withered
nutmeg
might
be
empty
out
of
a
spice
-
box
by
an
excited
cook
.


that
chair
and
my
desk
,
seize
by
the
wild
paletot
,
one
under
each


sleeve
,
be
bear
afar
;
in
a
second
,
I
follow
the
furniture
;
in
two


minute
they
and
I
be
fix
in
the
centre
of
the
grand
salle

a
vast


adjoining
room
,
seldom
use
save
for
dancing
and
choral


singing

lesson
--

with
an
emphasis
which
seem
to
prohibit
the


remote
hope
of
our
ever
be
permit
to
stir
thence
again
.




having
partially
collect
my
scared
wit
,
I
find
myself
in
the


presence
of
two
man
,
gentleman
,
I
suppose
I
should
say
--
one
dark
,
the


other
light
--
one
have
a
stiff
,
half
-
military
air
,
and
wear
a


braid
surtout
;
the
other
partaking
,
in
garb
and
bearing
,
more
of
the


careless
aspect
of
the
student
or
artist
class
:
both
flourish
in


full
magnificence
of
moustache
,
whisker
,
and
imperial
.
M.
Emanuel


stand
a
little
apart
from
these

his
countenance
and
eye
express


strong
choler

forth
his

his

its

now
to

with
classic
.
a
dead
blank
.
they
go
on
to
french
history
.


I
hardly
know
Merovee
from
Pharamond
.
they
try
I
in
various


'
ology
,
and
still
only
get
a
shake
of
the
head
,

an
unchanging
"

n'en

after
an
expressive
pause
,

to
matter

general


information
,
broach
one
or
two
subject
which
I
know
pretty
well
,

on
which
I
have
often
reflect

M.
Emanuel
,
who
have
hitherto
stand


look
on
,
dark
as
the
winter
-
solstice

brighten
up
somewhat

I
should
now

myself

no
fool

learn
his
error

answer
to
the
question
surge
up
fast

my
mind

there

not
word

I


either

I
be
not
sure

:
partly
,


I
think
,
my
nerve
have
get
wrong

partly
my
humour

cross

I
hear
one
of
my
examiner

he
of
the
braid

whisper
to
his


co

you

suffer

suffer
cruelly
;
I
see
the
damp
gather
on
M.
Paul
's


brow
,

his
eye
speak
a
passionate
yet
sad
reproach
.
he
would
not


believe
in
my
total
lack
of
popular
cleverness

I

be


prompt
if
I

.




at
last
,
to
relieve
he
,
the
professor
,
and
myself
,
I
stammer
out
:




"
gentleman
,
you
have
well
let
I
go

you
will
get
no
good

as


you
say

be
an
idiot

I
wish
I
could
have
speak
with
calm
and
dignity
,
or
I
wish
my
sense


have
suffice
to
make
I
hold
my
tongue
;
that
traitor
tongue
trip
,


falter
.
behold
the
judge
cast
on
M.
Emanuel
a
hard
look
of


triumph
,
and
hear
the
distressed
tremor
of
my
own
voice
,
out
I
burst


in
a
fit
of
choke
tear
.
the
emotion
be
far
more
of
anger
than


grief
;
have
I
be
a
man
and
strong
,
I
could
have
challenge
that
pair


on
the
spot

but
it
_
be
_
emotion
,
and
I
would
rather
have
be


scourge
than
betray
it
.




the
incapable
!
could
they
not
see
at
once
the
crude
hand
of
a
novice


in
that
composition
they
call
a
forgery
?
the
subject
be
classical
.


when
M.
Paul
dictate
the
trait
on
which
the
essay
be
to
turn
,
I
hear


it
for
the
first
time
;
the
matter
be
new
to
I
,
and
I
have
no
material


for
its
treatment
.
but
I
get
book
,
read
up
the
fact
,
laboriously


construct
a
skeleton
out
of
the
dry
bone
of
the
real
,
and
then


clothe
they
,
and
try
to
breathe
into
they
life
,
and
in
this
last
aim


I
have
pleasure
.
with
I
it
be
a
difficult
and
anxious
time
till
my


fact
be
find
,
select
,
and
properly
jointed
;
nor
could
I
rest
from


research
and
effort
till
I
be
satisfied
of
correct
anatomy
;
the


strength
of
my
inward
repugnance
to
the
idea
of
flaw
or
falsity


sometimes
enable
I
to
shun
egregious
blunder
;
but
the
knowledge
be


not
there
in
my
head
,
ready
and
mellow
;
it
have
not

"
have
he
not
long
be
a
friend
to
you
?
have
he
not
give
proof
on
proof


of
a
certain
partiality
in
his
feeling
?
"




yes
,
he
have
;
but
still
I
like
to
hear
he
say
so
earnestly
--
that
he


be
my
close
,
true
friend
;
I
like
his
modest
doubt
,
his
tender


deference
--
that
trust
which
long
to
rest
,
and
be
grateful
when


teach
how
.
he
have
call
I
"
sister
.
"
it
be
well
.
yes
;
he
might
call


I
what
he
please
,
so
long
as
he
confide
in
I
.
I
be
willing
to
be


his
sister
,
on
condition
that
he
do
not
invite
I
to
fill
that


relation
to
some
future
wife
of
his
;
and
tacitly
vow
as
he
be
to


celibacy
,
of
this
dilemma
there
seem
little
danger
.




through
most
of
the
succeed
night
I
ponder
that
evening
's


interview
.
I
want
much
the
morning
to
break
,
and
then
listen
for


the
bell
to
ring
;
and
,
after
rise
and
dress
,
I
deem
prayer
and


breakfast
slow
,
and
all
the
hour
linger
,
till
that
arrive
at
last


which
bring
I
the
lesson
of
literature
.
my
wish
be
to
get
a
more


thorough
comprehension
of
this
fraternal
alliance
:
to
note
with
how


much
of
the
brother
he
would
demean
himself
when
we
meet
again
;
to
prove


how
much
of
the
sister
be
in
my
own
feeling
;
to
discover
whether
I


could
summon
a
sister
's
courage
,
and
he
a
brother
's
frankness
.




he
come
.
life
be
so
constructed
,
that
the
event
do
not
,
can
not
,
will


not
,
match
the
expectation
.
that
whole
day
he
never
accost
I
.
his


lesson
be
give
rather
more
quietly
than
usual
,
more
mildly
,
and
also


more
gravely
.
he
be
fatherly
to
his
pupil
,
but
he
be
not
brotherly


to
I
.
ere
he
leave
the
classe
,
I
expect
a
smile
,
if
not
a
word
;
I
get


neither
:
to
my
portion
fall
one
nod
--
hurried
,
shy
.




this
distance
,
I
argue
,
be
accidental
--
it
be
involuntary
;
patience
,


and
it
will
vanish
.
it
vanish
not
;
it
continue
for
day
;
it


increase
.
I
suppress
my
surprise
,
and
swallow
whatever
other


feeling
begin
to
surge
.




well
might
I
ask
when
he
offer
fraternity--"dare
I
rely
on
you
?
"
well


might
he
,
doubtless
know
himself
,
withhold
all
pledge
.
true
,
he
have


bid
I
make
my
own
experiment
--
tease
and
try
he
.
vain
injunction
!


privilege
nominal
and
unavailable
!
some
woman
might
use
it
!
nothing
in


my
power
or
instinct
place
I
amongst
this
brave
band
.
leave
alone
,
I


be
passive
;
repulse
,
I
withdraw
;
forget
--
my
lip
would
not
utter
,


nor
my
eye
dart
a
reminder
.
it
seem
there
have
be
an
error


somewhere
in
my
calculation
,
and
I
want
for
time
to
disclose
it
.




but
the
day
come
when
,
as
usual
,
he
be
to
give
I
a
lesson
.
one


evening
in
seven
he
have
long
generously
bestow
on
I
,
devote
it
to


the
examination
of
what
have
be
do
in
various
study
during
the


past
week
,
and
to
the
preparation
of
work
for
the
week
in
prospect
.
on


these
occasion
my
schoolroom
be
anywhere
,
wherever
the
pupil
and
the


other
teacher
happen
to
be
,
or
in
their
close
vicinage
,
very
often


in
the
large
second
division
,
where
it
be
easy
to
choose
a
quiet
nook


when
the
crowding
day
pupil
be
absent
,
and
the
few
boarder
gather


in
a
knot
about
the
surveillante
's
estrade
.




on
the
customary
evening
,
hear
the
customary
hour
strike
,
I


collect
my
book
and
paper
,
my
pen
and
ink
,
and
seek
the
large


division
.




in
classe
there
be
no
one
,
and
it
lie
all
in
cool
deep
shadow
;
but


through
the
open
double
door
be
see
the
carre
,
fill
with
pupil


and
with
light
;
over
hall
and
figure
blush
the
westere
sun
.
it


blush
so
ruddily
and
vividly
,
that
the
hue
of
the
wall
and
the


variegate
tint
of
the
dress
seem
all
fuse
in
one
warm
glow
.
the


girl
be
seat
,
work
or
study
;
in
the
midst
of
their
circle


stand
M.
Emanuel
,
speak
good
-
humouredly
to
a
teacher
.
his
dark


paletot
,
his
jetty
hair
,
be
tinge
with
many
a
reflex
of
crimson
;
his


spanish
face
,
when
he
turn
it
momentarily
,
answer
the
sun
's


animate
kiss
with
an
animated
smile
.
I
take
my
place
at
a
desk
.




the
orange
-
tree
,
and
several
plant
,
full
and
bright
with
bloom
,


bask
also
in
the
sun
's
laugh
bounty
;
they
have
partake
it
the


whole
day
,
and
now
ask
water
.
M.
Emanuel
have
a
taste
for
gardening
;


he
like
to
tend
and
foster
plant
.
I
use
to
think
that
work


amongst
shrub
with
a
spade
or
a
watering
-
pot
soothe
his
nerve
;
it


be
a
recreation
to
which
he
often
have
recourse
;
and
now
he
look
to


the
orange
-
tree
,
the
geranium
,
the
gorgeous
cactus
,
and
revive


they
all
with
the
refreshment
their
drought
need
.
his
lip
meantime


sustain
his
precious
cigar
,
that
(
for
he
)
first
necessary
and
prime


luxury
of
life
;
its
blue
wreath
curl
prettily
enough
amongst
the


flower
,
and
in
the
evening
light
.
he
speak
no
more
to
the
pupil
,
nor


to
the
mistress
,
but
give
many
an
endear
word
to
a
small


spanieless
(
if
one
may
coin
a
word
)
,
that
nominally
belong
to
the


house
,
but
virtually
own
he
as
master
,
be
fonder
of
he
than
any


inmate
.
a
delicate
,
silky
,
love
,
and
lovable
little
doggie
she
be
,


trot
at
his
side
,
look
with
expressive
,
attach
eye
into
his


face
;
and
whenever
he
drop
his
bonnet
-
grec
or
his
handkerchief
,


which
he
occasionally
do
in
play
,
crouch
beside
it
with
the
air
of


a
miniature
lion
guard
a
kingdom
's
flag
.




there
be
many

as
the
amateur
gardener
fetch
all
the


water
from
the
well
in
the
court
,
with
his
own

on
to
some
length
.
the
great
school

clock
tick
on
.
another

.
my
lesson
,
I
perceive
,
must
to

night
be
very
short
;


but
the
orange

tree
,
the
cacti
,

camelia
be
all
serve
now
.
be


it
my
turn
?




alas
!
in
the
garden
be
more

to
be
look
after,--favourite

Sylvie
's
glad
bark
and


whine
follow
the
recede
paletot
down
the
alley
.
I
put
up
some
of


my
book
;
I
should
not
want
they
all
;
I
sit
and
think
;
and
wait
,


involuntarily
deprecate
the
creep
invasion
of
twilight

Monsieur
wash
his
hand
in


a
little
stone
bowl
.
there
be
no
long
time
for
a
lesson
now
;
ere


long
the
prayer
-
bell
must
ring
;
but
still
we
should
meet
;
he
would


speak
;
a
chance
would
be
offer
of
read
in
his
eye
the
riddle
of


his
shyness
.
his
ablution
over
,
he
stand
,
slowly
re
-
arrange
his


cuff
,
look
at
the
horn
of
a
young
moon
,
set
pale
in
the
opal
sky
,


and
glimmer
faint
on
the
oriel
of
Jean
Baptiste
.
Sylvie
watch
the


mood
contemplative
;
its
stillness
irk
she
;
she
whine
and
jump
to


break
it
.
he
look
down
.




"
petite
exigeante
,
"
say
he
;
"
you
must
not

one
moment

"




he
stop
,
lift
she
in
his
arm
,
saunter
across
the
court
,
within


a
yard
of
the
line
of
window
near
one
of
which
I
sit
:
he
saunter


lingeringly
,
fondle
the
spaniel
in
his
bosom
,
call
her
tender


name
in
a
tender
voice
.
on
the
front
-
door
step
he
turn
;
once
again


he
look
at
the
moon
,
at
the
grey
cathedral
,
over
the
remoter
spire


and
house
-
roof
fade
into
a
blue
sea
of
night
-
mist
;
he
taste
the


sweet
breath
of
dusk
,
and
note
the
fold
bloom
of
the
garden
;
he


suddenly
look
round
;
a
keen
beam
out
of
his
eye
rase
the
white


facade
of
the
class
,
sweep
the
long
line
of
croisee
.
I
think
he


bow
;
if
he
do
,
I
have
no
time
to
return
the
courtesy
.
in
a
moment
he


be
go
;
the
moonlit
threshold
lie
pale
and
shadowless
before
the


close
front
door
.




gather
in
my
arm
all
that
be
spread
on
the
desk
before
I
,
I


carry
back
the
unused
heap
to
its
place
in
the
third
classe
.
the


prayer
-
bell
rang
;
I
obey
its
summon
.




the
morrow
would
not
restore
he
to
the
Rue
Fossette
,
that
day
be


devote
entirely
to
his
college
.
I
get
through
my
teaching
;
I
get
over


the
intermediate
hour
;
I
see
evening
approach
,
and
arm
myself
for


its
heavy
ennuis
.
whether
it
be
bad
to
stay
with
my
co
-
inmate
,
or


to
sit
alone
,
I
have
not
consider
;
I
naturally
take
up
the
latter


alternative
;
if
there
be
a
hope
of
comfort
for
any
moment
,
the
heart


or
head
of
no
human
being
in
this
house
could
yield
it
;
only
under
the


lid
of
my
desk
could
it
harbour
,
nestle
between
the
leave
of
some


book
,
gild
a
pencil
-
point
,
the
nib
of
a
pen
,
or
tinge
the
black


fluid
in
that
ink
-
glass
.
with
a
heavy
heart
I
open
my
desk
-
lid
;
with


a
weary
hand
I
turn
up
its
content
.




one
by
one
,
well
-
accustom
book
,
volume

in
familiar
cover

be
take
out
and
put
back
hopeless
:
they
have
no
charm
;
they
could
not


comfort

this
something
new
,
this
pamphlet
in
lilac
?
I
have
not
see


it
before
,
and
I
re
-
arrange
my
desk
this
very
day

this
very


afternoon

the
tract

introduce
within
the
last
hour

while
we
be
at
dinner
.




I
open
it
.
what
be
it
?
what
would
it
say
to
I
?




it
be
neither
tale
nor
poem
,
neither
essay
nor
history
;
it
neither


sing
,
nor
relate
,
not
discuss
.
it
be
a
theological

I
lend
to
it
my
ear
very
willingly
,
for
,
small
as
it
be
,
it
possess


its
own
spell
,
and
bind
my
attention
at
once
.
it
preach
romanism
;
it


persuade
to
conversion
.
the
voice
of
that
sly
little
book
be
a


honeyed
voice
;
its
accent
be
all
unction
and
balm
.
here
roar
no


utterance
of
Rome
's
thunder
,
no
blasting

displeasure

the

turn
Papist

not
so
much
in
fear
of


the
heretic

as
on
account
of
the
comfort
,
the
indulgence
,
the


tenderness
Holy
Church
offer
:
far
be
it
from
she
to
threaten
or
to


coerce
;
her
wish
be
to
guide

_
persecute
?
oh
dear
no
!
not


on
any
account
!




this
meek
volume
be
not
address
to
the
hardened
and
worldly
;
it
be


not
even
strong
meat
for
the
strong
:
it
be
milk
for
babe
:
the
mild


effluence
of
a
mother
's
love
towards
her
tender
and
her
young
;


intend
wholly
and
solely
for
those
whose
head
be
to
be
reach


through
the
heart
.
its
appeal
be
not
to
intellect
;
it
seek
to
win


the
affectionate
through
their
affection
,
the
sympathizing
through


their
sympathy
:
St.
Vincent
de
Paul
,
gather
his
orphan
about
he
,


never
speak
more
sweetly
.




I
remember
one
capital
inducement
to
apostacy
be
hold
out
in
the
fact


that
the
Catholic
who
have
lose
dear
friend
by
death
could
enjoy
the


unspeakable
solace
of
pray
they
out
of
purgatory
.
the
writer
do
not


touch
on
the
firm
peace
of
those
whose
belief
dispense
with


purgatory
altogether
:
but
I
think
of
this
;
and
,
on
the
whole
,


prefer
the
latter
doctrine
as
the
most
consolatory
.
the
little
book


amused
,
and
do
not
painfully
displease
I
.
it
be
a
canting
,


sentimental
,
shallow
little
book
,
yet
something
about
it
cheer
my


gloom
and
make
I
smile
;
I
be
amuse
with
the
gambol
of
this
unlicked


wolf
-
cub
muffle
in
the
fleece
,
and
mimic
the
bleat
of
a
guileless


lamb
.
portion
of
it
remind
I
of
certain
Wesleyan
Methodist
tract
I


have
once
read
when
a
child
;
they
be
flavour
with
about
the
same


seasoning
of
excitation
to
fanaticism
.
he
that
have
write
it
be
no


bad
man
,
and
while
perpetually
betray
the
train
cunning
--
the


cloven
hoof
of
his
system
--
I
should
pause
before
accuse
himself
of


insincerity
.
his
judgment
,
however
,
want
surgical
prop
;
it
be


rickety
.




I
smile
then
over
this
dose
of
maternal
tenderness
,
come
from
the


ruddy
old
lady
of
the
Seven
Hills
;
smile
,
too
,
at
my
own


disinclination
,
not
to
say
disability
,
to
meet
these
melting
favour
.


glance
at
the
title
-
page
,
I
find
the
name
of
"
Pere
Silas
.
"
a


fly
-
leaf
bore
in
small
,
but
clear
and
well
-
know
pencil
character
:


"
from
P.
C.
D.
E.
to
l
--
y.
"
and
when
I
see
this
I
laugh
:
but
not
in


my
former
spirit
.
I
be
revive
.




a
mortal
bewilderment
clear
suddenly
from
my
head
and
vision
;
the


solution
of
the
Sphinx
-
riddle
be
win
;
the
conjunction
of
those
two


name
,
Pere
Silas
and
Paul
Emanuel
,
give
the
key
to
all
.
the
penitent


have
be
with
his
director
;
permit
to
withhold
nothing
;
suffer
to


keep
no
corner
of
his
heart
sacred
to
God
and
to
himself
;
the
whole


narrative
of
our
late
interview
have
be
draw
from
he
;
he
have
avow


the
covenant
of
fraternity
,
and
speak
of
his
adopted
sister
.
how
could


such
a
covenant
,
such
adoption
,
be
sanction
by
the
Church
?
Fraternal


communion
with
a
heretic
!
I
seem
to
hear
Pere
Silas
annul
the


unholy
pact
;
warn
his
penitent
of
its
peril
;
entreating
,
enjoin


reserve
,
nay
,
by
the
authority
of
his
office
,
and
in
the
name
,
and
by


the
memory
of
all
M.
Emanuel
hold
most
dear
and
sacred
,
command
the


enforcement
of
that
new
system
whose
frost
have
pierce
to
the
marrow
of


my
bone
.




these
may
not
seem
pleasant
hypothesis
;
yet
,
by
comparison
,
they
be


welcome
.
the
vision
of
a
ghostly
troubler
hover
in
the
background
,


be
as
nothing
,
match
with
the
fear
of
spontaneous
change
arise
in


M.
Paul
himself
.




at
this
distance
of
time
,
I
can
not
be
sure
how
far
the
above


conjecture
be
self
-
suggest
:
or
in
what
measure
they
owe
their


origin
and
confirmation
to
another
quarter
.
help
be
not
want
.




this
evening
there
be
no
bright
sunset
:
west
and
east
be
one
cloud
;


no
summer
night
-
mist
,
blue
,
yet
rise
-
tinge
,
soften
the
distance
;
a


clammy
fog
from
the
marsh
creep
grey
round
Villette
.
to
-
night
the


watering
-
pot
might
rest
in
its
niche
by
the
well
:
a
small
rain
have
be


drizzle
all
the
afternoon
,
and
still
it
fall
fast
and
quietly
.
this


be
no
weather
for
ramble
in
the
wet
alley
,
under
the
dripping


tree
;
and
I
start
to
hear
Sylvie
's
sudden
bark
in
the
garden
--
she


bark
of
welcome
.
surely
she
be
not
accompany
and
yet
this
glad
,


quick
bark
be
never
utter
,
save
in
homage
to
one
presence
.




through
the
glass
door
and
the
arch
berceau
,
I
command
the
deep


vista
of
the
allee
defendue
:
thither
rush
Sylvie
,
glisten
through


its
gloom
like
a
white
guelder
-
rise
.
she
run
to
and
fro
,
whine
,


spring
,
harass
little
bird
amongst
the
bush
.
I
watch
five


minute
;
no
fulfilment
follow
the
oman
.
I
return
to
my
book
;


Sylvie
's
sharp
bark
suddenly
cease
.
again
I
look
up
.
she
be


stand
not
many
yard
distant
,
wag
her
white
feathery
tail
as


fast
as
the
muscle
would
work
,
and
intently
watch
the
operation
of


a
spade
,
ply
fast
by
an
indefatigable
hand
.
there
be
M.
Emanuel
,


bent
over
the
soil
,
dig
in
the
wet
mould
amongst
the
rain
-
laden
and


streaming
shrub
,
work
as
hard
as
if
his
day
's
pittance
be
yet
to


earn
by
the
literal
sweat
of
his
brow
.




in
this
sign
I
read
a
ruffled
mood
.
he
would
dig
thus
in
frozen
snow
on


the
cold
winter
day
,
when
urge
inwardly
by
painful
emotion
,
whether


of
nervous
excitation
,
or
,
sad
thought
of
self
-
reproach
.
he
would
dig


by
the
hour
,
with
knit
brow
and
set
tooth
,
nor
once
lift
his
head
,
or


open
his
lip
.




sylvie
watch
till
she
be
tired
.
again
scamper
devious
,
bound


here
,
rush
there
,
snuff
and
sniff
everywhere
;
she
at
last


discover
I
in
classe
.
instantly
she
flew
bark
at
the
pane
,
as
if


to
urge
I
forth
to
share
her
pleasure
or
her
master
's
toil
;
she
have


see
I
occasionally
walk
in
that
alley
with
M.
Paul
;
and
I
doubt


not
,
consider
it
my
duty
to
join
he
now
,
wet
as
it
be
.




she
make
such
a
bustle
that
M.
Paul
at
last
look
up
,
and
of
course


perceive
why
,
and
at
whom
she
bark
.
he
whistle
to
call
she
off
;
she


only
bark
the
loud
.
she
seem
quite
bent
upon
have
the
glass


door
open
.
tired
,
I
suppose
,
with
her
importunity
,
he
throw
down
his


spade
,
approach
,
and
push
the
door
ajar
.
sylvie
burst
in
all


impetuous
,
spring
to
my
lap
,
and
with
her
paw
at
my
neck
,
and
she


little
nose
and
tongue
somewhat
overpoweringly
busy
about
my
face
,


mouth
,
and
eye
,
flourish
her
bushy
tail
over
the
desk
,
and
scatter


book
and
paper
far
and
wide
.




M.
Emanuel
advance
to
still
the
clamour
and
repair
the
disarrangement
.


having
gather
up
the
book
,
he
capture
Sylvie
,
and
stow
she
away


under
his
paletot
,
where
she
nestle
as
quiet
as
a
mouse
,
her
head
just


peep
forth
.
she
be
very
tiny
,
and
have
the
prettiest
little
innocent


face
,
the
silky
long
ear
,
the
fine
dark
eye
in
the
world
.
I


never
see
she
,
but
I
think
of
Paulina
de
Bassompierre
:
forgive
the


association
,
reader
,
it
_
would
_
occur
.




M.
Paul
pet
and
pat
she
;
the
endearment
she
receive
be
not
to


be
wonder
at
;
she
invite
affection
by
her
beauty
and
her
vivacious


life
.




while
caress
the
spaniel
,
his
eye
rove
over
the
paper
and
book


just
replace
;
it
settle
on
the
religious
tract
.
his
lip
move
;
he


half
check
the
impulse
to
speak
.
what
!
have
he
promise
never
to


address
I
more
?
if
so
,
his
well
nature
pronounce
the
vow
"
more


honour
in
the
breach
than
in
the
observance
,
"
for
with
a
second


effort
,
he
spoke.--"you
have
not
yet
read
the
brochure
,
I
presume
?
it


be
not
sufficiently
invite
?
"




I
reply
that
I
have
read
it
.




he
wait
,
as
if
wish
I
to
give
an
opinion
upon
it
unasked
.


unasked
,
however
,
I
be
in
no
mood
to
do
or
say
anything
.
if
any


concession
be
to
be
make
--
if
any
advance
be
demand
--
that
be


the
affair
of
the
very
docile
pupil
of
Pere
Silas
,
not
mine
.
his
eye


settle
upon
I
gently
:
there
be
mildness
at
the
moment
in
its
blue


ray
--
there
be
solicitude
--
a
shade
of
pathos
;
there
be
meaning


composite
and
contrasted
--
reproach
melt
into
remorse
.
at
the
moment


probably
,
he
would
have
be
glad
to
see
something
emotional
in
I
.
I


could
not
show
it
.
in
another
minute
,
however
,
I
should
have
betray


confusion
,
have
I
not
bethought
myself
to
take
some
quill
-
pen
from
my


desk
,
and
begin
soberly
to
mend
they
.




I
know
that
action
would
give
a
turn
to
his
mood
.
he
never
like
to
see


I
mend
pen
;
my
knife
be
always
dull
-
edge
--
my
hand
,
too
,
be


unskilful
;
I
hack
and
chip
.
on
this
occasion
I
cut
my
own


finger
--
half
on
purpose
.
I
want
to
restore
he
to
his
natural
state
,


to
set
he
at
his
ease
,
to
get
he
to
chide
.




"
Maladroit
!
"
he
cry
at
last
,
"
she
will
make
mincemeat
of
her
hand
.
"




he
put
Sylvie
down
,
make
she
lie
quiet
beside
his
bonnet
-
grec
,
and
,


deprive
I
of
the
pen
and
penknife
,
proceed
to
slice
,
nib
,
and

the

have
darkly
stigmatize
Protestants

myself

closely
watch
I

ascertain


that
I
go
by
turn
,

indiscriminately
,
to
the
three
protestant


Chapels
of
Villette

the
french

tolerate

now
,
it
happen
that
I
have
often
secretly


wonder
at
the
minute
and
unimportant
character
of
the
difference


between
these
three
sect

at
the
unity
and
identity
of
their
vital


doctrine
:
I
see
nothing
to
hinder
they
from
be
one
day
fuse
into


one
grand
Holy
Alliance
,
and
I
respect
they
all
,
though
I
think


that
in
each
there
be
fault
of
form
,
incumbrance
,
and
triviality
.


just
what
I
think
,
that
do
I
tell
M.
Emanuel
,
and
explain
to
he


that
my
own
last
appeal
,
the
guide
to
which
I
look
,
and
the
teacher


which
I
own
,
must
always
be
the
Bible
itself
,
rather
than
any
sect
,


of
whatever
name
or
nation
.




he
leave
I
soothe
,
yet
full
of
solicitude
,
breathe
a
wish
,
as
strong


as
a
prayer
,
that
if
I
be
wrong
,
Heaven
would
lead
I
right
.
I
hear
,


pour
forth
on
the
threshold
,
some
fervid
murmuring
to
"
Marie
,
Reine


du
Ciel
,
"
some
deep
aspiration
that
_
his
_
hope

have
no
such
feverish

from
the

I
think
romanism
wrong
,
a
great
mixed
image
of
gold
and


clay
;

it
seem
to
I
that
_
this
_
Romanist
hold
the
purer
element


of
his
creed
with
an
innocency

heart

God
must
love

huge

priest
with
relic

an
obese
and
aged
archbishop
,
habit
in
cambric
and
lace

look
strangely
like
a

a

fantastically
robe

there

it
be
very
well
for
Paulina
to
decline
further
correspondence
with


Graham
till
her
father
have
sanction
the
intercourse

far

in

grow
in

with
his
past
admiration
of
Miss


Fanshawe

I
suppose
his
intellect
have
little
to
do
,

his
whole


intellect

his
high
taste

in
question
now

these
,

all
his

for

alive

I
can
not
say
that
Paulina
designedly
lead
he
to
talk

formally
propose
to

hear

he

I

now
united

all

blessing

yes
;
it
be
so
.
without
any
colouring
of
romance

any
exaggeration

fancy
,
it
be
so
.
some
real
life
do
--
for
some
certain
day
or


year
--
actually
anticipate
the
happiness
of
Heaven
;

,
I
believe
,
if


such
perfect
happiness
be
once
feel
by
good
people
(
to
the
wicked
it


never

whatever
trial


follow

sickness

the
keen

the

I
will
go
far

human
being

,


so

from
a

no
excessive

no
tempestuous


blackness
overcast
their

for

other


spring
healthy

replace
the

that

more
himself
.


lady

instead
of
the
usual
lesson
with
M.

,
you
will
,
this


morning
,
read

Mademoiselle
Lucy
.

she
bend
her
head
courteously
,
draw
close
the
fold
of
her
shawl
,
and


pass
from
the
classe
.




a
great
silence
fall
:
then
a
murmur
go
round
the
room
:
I
believe
some


pupil
weep
.




some
time
elapse
.
the
noise
,
the
whispering
,
the
occasional
sobbing


increase
.
I
become
conscious
of
a
relaxation
of
discipline
,
a
sort
of


grow
disorder
,
as
if
my
girl
feel
that
vigilance
be
withdraw
,
and


that
surveillance
have
virtually
leave
the
classe
.
habit
and
the
sense
of


duty
enable
I
to
rally
quickly
,
to
rise
in
my
usual
way
,
to
speak
in


my
usual
tone
,
to
enjoin
,
and
finally
to
establish
quiet
.
I
make
the


english
reading
long
and
close
.
I
keep
they
at
it
the
whole
morning
.
I


remember
feel
a
sentiment
of
impatience
towards
the
pupil
who


sob
.
indeed
,
their
emotion
be
not
of
much
value
:
it
be
only
an


hysteric
agitation
.
I
tell
they
so
unsparingly
.
I
half
ridicule
they
.


I
be
severe
.
the
truth
be
,
I
could
not
do
with
their
tear
,
or
that


gasp
sound
;
I
could
not
bear
it
.
a
rather
weak
-
minded
,
low
-
spirited


pupil
keep
it
up
when
the
other
have
do
;
relentless
necessity
oblige


and
assist
I
so
to
accost
she
,
that
she
dared
not
carry
on
the


demonstration
,
that
she
be
force
to
conquer
the
convulsion
.




that
girl
would
have
have
a
right
to
hate
I
,
except
that
,
when
school


be
over
and
her
companion
depart
,
I
order
she
to
stay
,
and
when


they
be
go
,
I
do
what
I
have
never
do
to
one
among
they


before
--
press
she
to
my
heart
and
kiss
her
cheek
.
but
,
this
impulse


yield
to
,
I
speedily
put
she
out
of
the
classe
,
for
,
upon
that


poignant
strain
,
she
weep
more
bitterly
than
ever
.




I
fill
with
occupation
every
minute
of
that
day
,
and
should
have


like
to
sit
up
all
night
if
I
might
have
keep
a
candle
burning
;
the


night
,
however
,
prove
a
bad
time
,
and
leave
bad
effect
,
prepare
I


ill
for
the
next
day
's
ordeal
of
insufferable
gossip
.
of
course
this


news
fall
under
general
discussion
.
some
little
reserve
have
accompany


the
first
surprise
:
that
soon
wear
off
;
every
mouth
open
;
every


tongue
wag
;

very
servant

the
name
of


"

.
"
he
,
whose
connection
with
the
school
be
contemporary
with


its
commencement
,
thus
suddenly
to
withdraw
!
all
feel
it
strange
.




they
talk
so
much
,
so
long
,
so
often
,
that
,
out
of
the
very
multitude


of
their
word
and
rumour
,
grow
at
last
some
intelligence
.
about
the


third
day
I
hear
it
say
that
he
be
to
sail
in
a
week
;
then
--
that
he


be
bind
for
the
West
Indies
.
I
look
at
Madame
Beck
's
face
,
and
into


her
eye
,
for
disproof
or
confirmation
of
this
report
;
I
peruse
she


all
over
for
information
,
but
no
part
of
she
disclose
more
than
what


be
unperturbe
and
commonplace
.




"
this
secession
be
an
immense
loss
to
she
,
"
she
allege
.
"
she
do
not


know
how
she
should
fill
up
the
vacancy

she
be
so
used
to
she


kinsman
,
he
have
become
her
right
hand
;
what
should
she
do
without
he
?


she
have
oppose
the
step
,
but
M.
Paul
have
convince
she
it
be
his


duty

"




she
say
all
this
in
public
,
in

at
the
dinner

table

audibly
to

I
could

ask
she
that

I
have
impulse
to


take
hold
of
she
suddenly
,
as
she
calmly
pass
I
in
classe

to


stretch
out
my
hand

grasp
she
fast
,
and
say
,

stop

let
we
hear
the


conclusion
of
the
whole
matter
.
_
why
_
be
it
his
duty
to
go
into


banishment

"
but
Madame
always
address
some
other
teacher

never


look
at
I
,
never
seem
conscious
I
could
have
a
care
in
the


question
.




the
week
wear
on

nothing
more

about
M.
Emanuel
come
to
bid


we
good

by

and
none
seem
anxious
for
his
coming
;
none
question


whether
or
not
he
would
come
;
none
betray
torment
lest
he
should


depart
silent
and
unseen

incessantly

they
talk
,

never
,
in
all


their

this
vital
point

to
Madame

course


could
see
he

say
to
he
as

what
should

she

whether

M.

kind

kind
.
it
be
now
a
month
since
we
have
settle
the


theological
difference
,
and
in
all
that
time
there
have
be
no
quarrel
.


nor
have
our
peace
be
the
cold
daughter
of

not

aloof

come
oftener

talk
with

half

passionate

substitute
a

,
a
fond
guidance
,

a
tender


forbearance
which
forgave
but
never

there
be
time
when
he


would
sit
for
many
minute
and
not
speak
at
all
;
and
when
dusk
or
duty


bring
separation
,
he
would
leave
with
word
like
these
,

one
evening

join
I

walk
in


my
alley

he
take
my
hand
.
I
look
up
in
his
face
.
I
think
he
mean


to
arrest
my
attention
.




"
Bonne
petite
amie
!
"
say
he
,
softly
;
"
douce
consolatrice

"
but
through


his
touch
,
and
with
his
word
,
a
new
feeling
and
a
strange
thought


find
a
course
.
could
it
be
that
he
be
become
more
than
friend
or


brother
?
do
his
look
speak
a
kindness
beyond
fraternity
or
amity

his
eloquent
look
have
more
to
say
,
his
hand
draw
I
forward
,
his


interpret
lip
stir
.
no
.
not
now
.
here
into
the
twilight
alley


break
an
interruption
:
it
come
dual
and
ominous
:
we
face
two
bodeful


form
--
a
woman
's
and
a
priest's
--
Madame
Beck
and
Pere
Silas
.




the
aspect
of
the
latter
I
shall
never
forget
.
on
the
first
impulse
it


express
a
Jean
-
Jacques
sensibility
,
stir
by
the
sign
of
affection


just
surprised
;
then
,
immediately
,
darken
over
it
the
jaundice
of


ecclesiastical
jealousy
.
he
speak
to
_
I
_
with
unction
.
he
look
on


his
pupil
with
sternness
.
as
to
Madame
Beck
,
she
,
of
course
,
see


nothing
--
nothing
;
though
her
kinsman
retain
in
her
presence
the
hand


of
the
heretic
foreigner
,
not
suffer
withdrawal
,
but
clasp
it


close
and
fast
.




follow
these
incident
,
that
sudden
announcement
of
departure
have


strike
I
at
first
as
incredible
.
indeed
,
it
be
only
frequent


repetition
,
and
the
credence
of
the
hundred
and
fifty
mind
round
I
,


which
force
on
I
its
full
acceptance
.
as
to
that
week
of
suspense
,


with
its
blank
,
yet
burn
day
,
which
bring
from
he
no
word
of


explanation
--
I
remember
,
but
I
can
not
describe
its
passage
.




the
last
day
break
.
now
would
he
visit
we
.
now
he
would
come
and
speak


his
farewell
,
or
he
would
vanish
mute
,
and
be
see
by
we
nevermore
.




this
alternative
seem
to
be
present
in
the
mind
of
not
a
live


creature
in
that
school
.
all
rise
at
the
usual
hour
;
all
breakfast
as


usual
;
all
,
without
reference
to
,
or
apparent
thought
of
their
late


Professor
,
betook
themselves
with
wonted
phlegm
to
their
ordinary


duty
.




so
oblivious
be
the
house
,
so
tame
,
so
train
its
proceeding
,
so


inexpectant
its
aspect
--
I
scarce
know
how
to
breathe
in
an
atmosphere


thus
stagnant
,
thus
smother
.
would
no
one
lend
I
a
voice
?
have
no


one
a
wish
,
no
one
a
word
,
no
one
a
prayer
to
which
I
could
say
--
amen
?




I
have
see
they
unanimous
in
demand
for
the
mere
trifle
--
a
treat
,
a


holiday
,
a
lesson
's
remission
;
they
could
not
,
they
_
would
_
not
now


band
to
besiege
Madame
Beck
,
and
insist
on
a
last
interview
with
a


Master
who
have
certainly
be
love
,
at
least
by
some
--
love
as
_
they
_


could
love
--
but
,
oh
!
what
_
be
_
the
love
of
the
multitude
?




I
know
where
he
live
:
I
know
where
he
be
to
be
hear
of
,
or


communicate
with
;
the
distance
be
scarce
a
stone's
-
throw
:
have
it
be


in
the
next
room
--
unsummone
,
I
could
make
no
use
of
my
knowledge
.
to


follow
,
to
seek
out
,
to
remind
,
to
recall
--
for
these
thing
I
have
no


faculty
.




M.
Emanuel
might
have
pass
within
reach
of
my
arm
:
have
he
pass


silent
and
unnoticing
,
silent
and
stirless
should
I
have
suffer
he


to
go
by
.




Morning
waste
.
Afternoon
come
,
and
I
think
all
be
over
.
my
heart


tremble
in
its
place
.
my
blood
be
trouble
in
its
current
.
I
be


quite
sick
,
and
hardly
know
how
to
keep
at
my
post
--
or
do
my
work
.
yet


the
little
world
round
I
plod
on
indifferent
;
all
seem
jocund
,


free
of
care
,
or
fear
,
or
think
:
the
very
pupil
who
,
seven
day


since
,
have
weep
hysterically
at
a
startling
piece
of
news
,
appear


quite
to
have
forget
the
news
,
its
import
,
and
their
emotion
.




a
little
before
five
o'clock
,
the
hour
of
dismissal
,
Madame
Beck
send


for
I
to
her
chamber
,
to
read
over
and
translate
some
english
letter


she
have
receive
,
and
to
write
for
she
the
answer
.
before
settle
to


this
work
,
I
observe
that
she
softly
close
the
two
door
of
she


chamber
;
she
even
shut
and
fasten
the
casement
,
though
it
be
a
hot


day
,
and
free
circulation
of
air
be
usually
regard
by
she
as


indispensable
.
why
this
precaution
?
a
keen
suspicion
,
an
almost
fierce


distrust
,
suggest
such
question
.
do
she
want
to
exclude
sound
?
what


sound
?




I
listen
as
I
have
never
listen
before
;
I
listen
like
the
evening


and
winter
-
wolf
,
snuff
the
snow
,
scent
prey
,
and
hear
far
off


the
traveller
's
tramp
.
yet
I
could
both
listen
and
write
.
about
the


middle
of
the
letter
I
hear
--
what
check
my
pen
--
a
tread
in
the


vestibule
.
no
door
-
bell
have
ring
;
rosine
--
acting
doubtless
by


order
--
have
anticipate
such
reveillee
.
Madame
see
I
halt
.
she


cough
,
make
a
bustle
,
speak
louder
.
the
tread
have
pass
on
to
the


class
.




"
proceed
,
"
say
Madame
;
but
my
hand
be
fetter
,
my
ear
enchain
,
my


thought
be
carry
off
captive
.




the
class
form
another
building
;
the
hall
part
they
from
the


dwelling
-
house
:
despite
distance
and
partition
,
I
hear
the
sudden
stir


of
number
,
a
whole
division
rise
at
once
.




"
they
be
put
away
work
,
"
say
Madame
.




it
be
indeed
the
hour
to
put
away
work
,
but
why
that
sudden
hush
--
that


instant
quell
of
the
tumult
?




"
wait
,
Madame
--
I
will
see
what
it
be
.
"




and
I
put
down
my
pen
and
leave
she
.
leave
she
?
no
:
she
would
not
be


leave
:
powerless
to
detain
I
,
she
rise
and
follow
,
close
as
my


shadow
.
I
turn
on
the
last
step
of
the
stair
.




"
be
you
come
,
too
?
"
I
ask
.




"
yes
,
"
say
she
;
meet
my
glance
with
a
peculiar
aspect
--
a
look
,


clouded
,
yet
resolute
.




we
proceed
then
,
not
together
,
but
she
walk
in
my
step
.




he
be
come
.
enter
the
first
classe
,
I
see
he
.
there
,
once
more


appear
the
form
most
familiar
.
I
doubt
not
they
have
try
to
keep
he


away
,
but
he
be
come
.




the
girl
stand
in
a
semicircle
;
he
be
pass
round
,
give
his


farewell
,
press
each
hand
,
touch
with
his
lip
each
cheek
.
this


last
ceremony
,
foreign
custom
permit
at
such
a
parting
--
so
solemn
,


to
last
so
long
.




I
feel
it
hard
that
Madame
Beck
should
dog
I
thus
;
follow
and


watch
I
close
;
my

,

passage

that
night

:
all
night
--
even
the
starless
night
before


dissolution
--
must
wear
away
.
about
six
o'clock
,
the
hour
which
call


up
the
household
,
I
go
out
to
the
court
,
and
wash
my
face
in
its


cold
,
fresh
well

in

oaken
cabinet

my
image

I
be

:
my


cheek
and
lip
be
sodden
white
,
my
eye
be
glassy
,
and
my
eyelid


swollen
and
purple
.




on

my
companion
,
I
know
they
all
look
at
I
--
my
heart


seem
discover
to
they
:
I
believe
myself
self
-
betray
.
hideously


certain
do
it
seem
that
the
very
young
of
the
school
must
guess
why

for
whom
I
despair

she
,

her
finger
in
her
mouth
,
and
stare
with
a
wistful


stupidity
which
at
the
moment

to
I
more
beautiful

keen
intelligence

not
long

alone

before
the
day

over

cause
of
gratitude
towards
the


whole
blind
household

the
multitude

something
else
to

keep
his

on
proof

that

that
my

what
I

call
illness

a

what
bodily

to

what
wonder
that
the
second
evening
find
I
like


the
first

untamed
,
torture
,
again
pace
a
solitary
room
in
an


unalterable
passion
of
silent
desolation

Madame
Beck
do
not
herself
summon
I
to
bed
that
night
--
she
do
not


come
near
I
:
she
send
Ginevra

a
more
efficient

"
(
for
Ginevra
,
like
the
rest
,

I
have


a
headache
--
an
intolerable
headache
which
make
I
frightfully
white
in


the
face
,
and
insanely
restless
in
the
foot)--her
first
word
,
I
say
,


inspire
the
impulse
to
flee
anywhere
,
so
that
it
be
only
out
of


reach
.
and
soon
,
what
follow

plaint
about
her
own


headache

complete
the
business

I
go
up

stair
.
presently
I
be
in
my
bed

my
miserable
bed

haunt


with
quick
scorpion
.
I
have
not

lay
down
five
minute
,

another
emissary
arrive

Goton

I
something
to
drink

I

consume
with
thirst

I
drink
eagerly
;
the
beverage
be
sweet
,
but


I
taste
a
drug
.




"
Madame

ah
!
the
sedative
have
be
administer
.
in
fact
,
they
have
give
I
a


strong
opiate
.
I
be
to
be

quiet
for
one
night

night

an
easy


supremacy

by
the
unquiet
.




the

I
know
not
whether
Madame

overcharge
or


under

charge
the
dose
;
its
result
be
not
that
she
intend
.
instead


of
stupor
,
come
excitement
.
I
become
alive
to
new
thought
--
to
reverie


peculiar
in
colour
.
a
gathering
call
run
among
the
faculty
,
their


bugle
sing
,
their
trumpet
ring
an
untimely
summon
.
Imagination
be


rouse
from
her
rest
,
and
she
come
forth
impetuous
and
venturous
.
with


scorn
she
look
on
Matter
,
her
mate--"rise
!
"
she
say
.
"
Sluggard
!
this


night
I
will
have

thou
prevail
.
"




"
look
forth
and
view
the
night
!
"
be
her
cry
;
and
when
I
lift
the


heavy
blind
from
the
casement
close
at
hand
--
with
her
own
royal


gesture
,
she
show
I
a
moon
supreme
,
in
an
element
deep
and
splendid
.




to
my
gasp
sense
she
make
the
glimmering
gloom
,
the
narrow
limit
,


the
oppressive
heat
of
the
dormitory
,
intolerable
.
she
lure
I
to


leave
this
den
and
follow
she
forth
into
dew
,
coolness
,
and
glory
.




she
bring
upon
I
a
strange
vision
of
Villette
at
midnight
.


especially
she
show
the
park
,
the
summer
-
park
,
with
its
long
alley


all
silent
,
lone
and
safe
;
among
these
lie
a
huge
stone
basin
--
that


basin
I
know
,
and
beside
which
I
have
often
stand
--
deep
-
set
in
the


tree
-
shadow
,
brim
with
cool
water
,
clear
,
with
a
green
,
leafy
,


rushy
bed
.
what
of
all
this
?
the
park
-
gate
be
shut
up
,
lock
,


sentinelle
:
the
place
could
not
be
enter
.




could
it
not
?
a
point
worth
consider
;
and
while
revolve
it
,
I


mechanically
dress
.
utterly
incapable
of
sleep
or
lie


still
--
excited
from
head
to
foot
--
what
could
I
do
well
than
dress
?




the
gate
be
lock
,
soldier
set
before
they
:
be
there
,
then
,
no


admission
to
the
park
?




the
other
day
,
in
walk
past
,
I
have
see
,
without
then
attend
to


the
circumstance
,
a
gap
in
the
pale
--
one
stake
break
down
:
I
now
see


this
gap
again
in
recollection
--
see
it
very
plainly
--
the
narrow
,


irregular
aperture
visible
between
the
stem
of
the
linden
,
plant


orderly
as
a
colonnade
.
a
man
could
not
have
make
his
way
through
that


aperture
,
nor
could
a
stout
woman
,
perhaps
not
Madame
Beck
;
but
I


think
I
might
:
I
fancy
I
should
like
to
try
,
and
once
within
,
at


this
hour
the
whole
park
would
be
mine
--
the
moonlight
,
midnight
park
!




how
soundly
the
dormitory
sleep
!
what
deep
slumber
!
what
quiet


breathe
!
how
very
still
the
whole
large
house
!
what
be
the
time
?
I


feel
restless
to
know
.
there
stand
a
clock
in
the
classe
below
:
what


hinder
I
from
venture
down
to
consult
it
?
by
such
a
moon
,
its


large
white
face
and
jet
black
figure
must
be
vividly
distinct
.




as
for
hindrance
to
this
step
,
there
offer
not
so
much
as
a
creaking


hinge
or
a
click
latch
.
on
these
hot
July
night
,
close
air
could


not
be
tolerate
,
and
the
chamber
-
door
stand
wide
open
.
will
the


dormitory
-
plank
sustain
my
tread
untraitorous
?
yes
.
I
know
wherever
a


board
be
loose
,
and
will
avoid
it
.
the
oak
staircase
creak
somewhat
as


I
descend
,
but
not
much:--i
be
in
the
carre
.




the
great
classe
-
door
be
close
shut
:
they
be
bolt
.
on
the
other


hand
,
the
entrance
to
the
corridor
stand
open
.
the
class
seem
to
my


think
,
great
dreary
jail
,
bury
far
back
beyond
thoroughfare
,
and


for
I
,
fill
with
spectral
and
intolerable
Memories
,
lay
miserable


amongst
their
straw
and
their
manacle
.
the
corridor
offer
a
cheerful


vista
,
lead
to
the
high
vestibule
which
open
direct
upon
the
street
.




hush!--the
clock
strike
.
ghostly
deep
as
be
the
stillness
of
this


convent
,
it
be
only
eleven
.
while
my
ear
follow
to
silence
the
hum
of


the
last
stroke
,
I
catch
faintly
from
the
build
-
out
capital
,
a
sound


like
bell
or
like
a
band
--
a
sound
where
sweetness
,
where
victory
,


where
mourning
blend
.
oh
,
to
approach
this
music
nearer
,
to
listen
to


it
alone
by
the
rushy
basin
!
let
I
go
--
oh
,
let
I
go
!
what
hinder
,


what
do
not
aid
freedom
?




there
,
in
the
corridor
,
hang
my
garden
-
costume
,
my
large
hat
,
my


shawl
.
there
be
no
lock
on
the
huge
,
heavy
,
porte
-
cochere
;
there
be
no


key
to
seek
:
it
fasten
with
a
sort
of
spring
-
bolt
,
not
to
be
open


from
the
outside
,
but
which
,
from
within
,
may
be
noiselessly
withdraw
.


can
I
manage
it
?
it
yield
to
my
hand
,
yield
with
propitious
facility
.


I
wonder
as
that
portal
seem
almost
spontaneously
to
unclose
--
I
wonder


as
I
cross
the
threshold
and
step
on
the
paved
street
,
wonder
at
the


strange
ease
with
which
this
prison
have
be
force
.
it
seem
as
if
I


have
be
pioneer
invisibly
,
as
if
some
dissolve
force
have
go


before
I
:
for
myself
,
I
have
scarce
make
an
effort
.




Quiet
Rue
Fossette
!
I
find
on
this
pavement
that
wanderer
-
woo
summer


night
of
which
I
muse
;
I
see
its
moon
over
I
;
I
feel
its
dew
in
the


air
.
but
here
I
can
not
stay
;
I
be
still
too
near
old
haunt
:
so
close


under
the
dungeon
,
I
can
hear
the
prisoner
moan
.
this
solemn
peace
be


not
what
I
seek
,
it
be
not
what
I
can
bear
:
to
I
the
face
of
that
sky


bear
the
aspect
of
a
world
's
death
.
the
park
also
will
be
calm
--
I


know
,
a
mortal
serenity
prevail
everywhere
--
yet
let
I
seek
the
park
.




I
take
a
route
well
known
,
and
go
up
towards
the
palatial
and
royal


Haute
-
Ville
;
thence
the
music
I
have
hear
certainly
float
;
it
be


hush
now
,
but
it
might
re
-
waken
.
I
go
on
:
neither
band
nor
bell


music
come
to
meet
I
;
another
sound
replace
it
,
a
sound
like
a
strong


tide
,
a
great
flow
,
deepen
as
I
proceed
.
light
break
,
movement


gather
,
chime
peal
--
to
what
be
I
come
?
enter
on
the
level
of


a
Grande
Place
,
I
find
myself
,
with
the
suddenness
of
magic
,
plunge


amidst
a
gay
,
live
,
joyous
crowd
.




Villette
be
one
blaze
,
one
broad
illumination
;
the
whole
world
seem


abroad
;
moonlight
and
heaven
be
banish
:
the
town
,
by
her
own


flambeaux
,
behold
her
own
splendour
--
gay
dress
,
grand
equipage
,


fine
horse
and
gallant
rider
throng
the
bright
street
.
I
see
even


score
of
mask
.
it
be
a
strange
scene
,
strange
than
dream
.
but
where


be
the
park?--I
ought
to
be
near
it
.
in
the
midst
of
this
glare
the


park
must
be
shadowy
and
calm--_there
_
,
at
least
,
be
neither
torch
,


lamp
,
nor
crowd
?




I
be
ask
this
question
when
an
open
carriage
pass
I
fill
with


know
face
.
through
the
deep
throng
it
could
pass
but
slowly
;
the


spirited
horse
fret
in
their
curb
ardour
.
I
see
the
occupant
of


that
carriage
well
:
I
they
could
not
see
,
or
,
at
least
,
not
know
,


fold
close
in
my
large
shawl
,
screen
with
my
straw
hat
(
in
that


motley
crowd
no
dress
be
noticeably
strange
)
.
I
see
the
Count
de


Bassompierre
;
I
see
my
godmother
,
handsomely
apparelle
,
comely
and


cheerful
;
I
see
,
too
,
Paulina
Mary
,
compass
with
the
triple
halo
of


her
beauty
,
her
youth
,
and
her
happiness
.
in
look
on
her
countenance


of
joy
,
and
eye
of
festal
light
,
one
scarce
remember
to
note
the


gala
elegance
of
what
she
wear
;
I
know
only
that
the
drapery
float


about
she
be
all
white
and
light
and
bridal
;
seat
opposite
to
she
I


see
Graham
Bretton
;
it
be
in
look
up
at
he
her
aspect
have
catch


its
lustre
--
the
light
repeat
in
_
she
_
eye
beam
first
out
of
his
.




it
give
I
strange
pleasure
to
follow
these
friend
viewlessly
,
and
I


_
do
_
follow
they
,
as
I
think
,
to
the
park
.
I
watch
they
alight


(
carriage
be
inadmissible
)
amidst
new
and
unanticipated
splendour
.


Lo
!
the
iron
gateway
,
between
the
stone
column
,
be
span
by
a


flame
arch
build
of
mass
star
;
and
,
follow
they
cautiously


beneath
that
arch
,
where
be
they
,
and
where
be
I
?




in
a
land
of
enchantment
,
a
garden
most
gorgeous
,
a
plain
sprinkle


with
coloured
meteor
,
a
forest
with
spark
of
purple
and
ruby
and


golden
fire
gem
the
foliage
;
a
region
,
not
of
tree
and
shadow
,
but


of
strange
architectural
wealth
--
of
altar
and
of
temple
,
of
pyramid
,


obelisk
,
and
sphinx
:
incredible
to
say
,
the
wonder
and
the
symbol
of


Egypt
teem
throughout
the
park
of
Villette
.




no
matter
that
in
five
minute
the
secret
be
mine
--
the
key
of
the


mystery
pick
up
,
and
its
illusion
unveil
--
no
matter
that
I
quickly


recognise
the
material
of
these
solemn
fragment
--
the
timber
,
the


paint
,
and
the
pasteboard
--
these
inevitable
discovery
fail
to
quite


destroy
the
charm
,
or
undermine
the
marvel
of
that
night
.
no
matter


that
I
now
seize
the
explanation
of
the
whole
great
fete
--
a
fete
of


which
the
conventual
Rue
Fossette
have
not
taste
,
though
it
have
open


at
dawn
that
morning
,
and
be
still
in
full
vigour
near
midnight
.




in
past
day
there
have
be
,
say
history
,
an
awful
crisis
in
the
fate


of
Labassecour
,
involve
I
know
not
what
peril
to
the
right
and


liberty
of
her
gallant
citizen
.
rumour
of
war
there
have
be
,
if


not
war
themselves
;
a
kind
of
struggle
in
the
street
--
a
bustle
--
a


run
to
and
fro
,
some
rearing
of
barricade
,
some
burgher
-
rioting
,


some
call
out
of
troop
,
much
interchange
of
brickbat
,
and
even
a


little
of
shot
.
tradition
hold
that
patriot
have
fall
:
in
the
old


Basse
-
Ville
be
show
an
enclosure
,
solemnly
build
in
and
set
apart
,


hold
,
it
be
say
,
the
sacred
bone
of
martyr
.
be
this
as
it
may
,
a


certain
day
in
the
year
be
still
keep
as
a
festival
in
honour
of
the


say
patriot
and
martyr
of
somewhat
apocryphal
memory
--
the
morning


be
give
to
a
solemn
Te
Deum
in
St.
Jean
Baptiste
,
the
evening


devoted
to
spectacle
,
decoration
,
and
illumination
,
such
as
these
I


now
see
.




while
look
up
at
the
image
of
a
white
ibis
,
fix
on
a
column
--
while


fathom
the
deep
,
torch
-
light
perspective
of
an
avenue
,
at
the
close
of


which
be
couch
a
sphinx
--
I
lose
sight
of
the
party
which
,
from
the


middle
of
the
great
square
,
I
have
follow
--
or
,
rather
,
they
vanish


like
a
group
of
apparition
.
on
this
whole
scene
be
impressed
a


dream
-
like
character
:
every
shape
be
waver
,
every
movement


float
,
every
voice
echo
-
like
--
half
-
mocking
,
half
-
uncertain
.
Paulina


and
her
friend
be
go
,
I
scarce
could
avouch
that
I
have
really


see
they
;
nor
do
I
miss
they
as
guide
through
the
chaos
,
far
less


regret
they
as
protector
amidst
the
night
.




that
festal
night
would
have
be
safe
for
a
very
child
.
half
the


peasantry
have
come
in
from
the
outlying
environ
of
Villette
,
and
the


decent
burgher
be
all
abroad
and
around
,
dress
in
their
good
.
my


straw
-
hat
pass
amidst
cap
and
jacket
,
short
petticoat
,
and
long


calico
mantle
,
without
,
perhaps
,
attract
a
glance
;
I
only
take
the


precaution
to
bind
down
the
broad
leaf
gipsy
-
wise
,
with
a
supplementary


ribbon
--
and
then
I
feel
safe
as
if
mask
.




safe
I
pass
down
the
avenue
--
safe
I
mix
with
the
crowd
where
it


be
deep
.
to
be
still
be
not
in
my
power
,
nor
quietly
to
observe
.
I


take
a
revel
of
the
scene
;
I
drink
the
elastic
night
-
air
--
the
swell
of


sound
,
the
dubious
light
,
now
flash
,
now
fade
.
as
to
Happiness
or


Hope
,
they
and
I
have
shake
hand
,
but
just
now
--
I
scorn
despair
.




my
vague
aim
,
as
I
go
,
be
to
find
the
stone
-
basin
,
with
its
clear


depth
and
green
lining
:
of
that
coolness
and
verdure
I
think
,
with


the
passionate
thirst
of
unconscious
fever
.
amidst
the
glare
,
and


hurry
,
and
throng
,
and
noise
,
I
still
secretly
and
chiefly
long
to


come
on
that
circular
mirror
of
crystal
,
and
surprise
the
moon
glass


therein
her
pearly
front
.




I
know
my
route
,
yet
it
seem
as
if
I
be
hinder
from
pursue
it


direct
:
now
a
sight
,
and
now
a
sound
,
call
I
aside
,
lure
I
down


this
alley
and
down
that
.
already
I
see
the
thick
-
plant
tree
which


frame
this
tremulous
and
ripple
glass
,
when
,
choir
out
of
a
glade


to
the
right
,
break
such
a
sound
as
I
think
might
be
hear
if
Heaven


be
to
open
--
such
a
sound
,
perhaps
,
as
_
be
_
hear
above
the
plain
of


Bethlehem
,
on
the
night
of
glad
tiding
.




the
song
,
the
sweet
music
,
rise
afar
,
but
rush
swiftly
on


fast
-
strengthen
pinion
--
there
sweep
through
these
shade
so
full
a


storm
of
harmony
that
,
have
no
tree
be
near
against
which
to
lean
,
I


think
I
must
have
drop
.
voice
be
there
,
it
seem
to
I
,


unnumbere
;
instrument
varied
and
countless
--
bugle
,
horn
,
and
trumpet


I
know
.
the
effect
be
as
a
sea
break
into
song
with
all
its
wave
.




the
sway
tide
sweep
this
way
,
and
then
it
fall
back
,
and
I
follow


its
retreat
.
it
lead
I
towards
a
byzantine
building
--
a
sort
of
kiosk


near
the
park
's
centre
.
round
about
stand
crowd
thousand
,
gather


to
a
grand
concert
in
the
open
air
.
what
I
have
hear
be
,
I
think
,
a


wild
Jaeger
chorus
;
the
night
,
the
space
,
the
scene
,
and
my
own
mood
,


have
but
enhance
the
sound
and
their
impression
.




here
be
assemble
lady
,
look
by
this
light
most
beautiful
:
some


of
their
dress
be
gauzy
,
and
some
have
the
sheen
of
satin
,
the


flower
and
the
blond
tremble
,
and
the
veil
wave
about
their


decorate
bonnet
,
as
that
host
-
like
chorus
,
with
its
greatly
-
gather


sound
,
sunder
the
air
above
they
.
Most
of
these
lady
occupy
the


little
light
park
-
chair
,
and
behind
and
beside
they
stand
guardian


gentleman
.
the
outer
rank
of
the
crowd
be
make
up
of
citizen
,


plebeian
and
police
.




in
this
outer
rank
I
take
my
place
.
I
rather
like
to
find
myself
the


silent
,
unknown
,
consequently
unaccosted
neighbour
of
the
short


petticoat
and
the
sabot
;
and
only
the
distant
gazer
at
the
silk
robe
,


the
velvet
mantle
,
and
the
plume
chapeau
.
amidst
so
much
life
and
joy
,


too
,
it
suit
I
to
be
alone
--
quite
alone
.
have
neither
wish
nor


power
to
force
my
way
through
a
mass
so
close
-
pack
,
my
station
be
on


the
farth
confine
,
where
,
indeed
,
I
might
hear
,
but
could
see


little
.




"
Mademoiselle
be
not
well
place
,
"
say
a
voice
at
my
elbow
.
who
dare


accost
_
I
_
,
a
being
in
a
mood
so
little
social
?
I
turn
,
rather
to


repel
than
to
reply
.
I
see
a
man
--
a
burgher
--
an
entire
stranger
,
as
I


deem
he
for
one
moment
,
but
the
next
,
recognise
in
he
a
certain


tradesman
--
a
bookseller
,
whose
shop
furnish
the
Rue
Fossette
with
its


book
and
stationery
;
a
man
notorious
in
our
pensionnat
for
the


excessive
brittleness
of
his
temper
,
and
frequent
snappishness
of
his


manner
,
even
to
we
,
his
principal
customer
:
but
whom
,
for
my
solitary


self
,
I
have
ever
be
dispose
to
like
,
and

some
troublesome
little

of
foreign
money

a
good

hearted
man

sometimes
cross
I
,
that
a
part
of
his
nature
bore


affinity
to
a
part
of
M.
Emanuel
's
(
whom
he
know
well
,
and
whom
I
have


often
see
sit
on
Miret
's
counter
,
turn
over
the
current
month
's


publication
)
;
and
it
be
in
this
affinity
I
read
the
explanation
of


that
conciliatory
feeling
with
which
I
instinctively
regard
he
.




strange
to
say
,
this
man
know
I
under
my
straw
-
hat
and
closely
-
fold


shawl
;
and
,
though
I
deprecate
the
effort
,
he
insist
on
make
a
way


for
I
through
the
crowd
,
and
find
I
a
well
situation
.
he
carry


his
disintereste
civility
far
;
and
,
from
some
quarter
,
procure
I


a
chair
.
once
and
again
,
I
have
find
that
the
most
cross
-
grained
be


by
no
means
the
bad
of
mankind
;
nor
the
humblest
in
station
,
the


least
polished
in
feeling
.
this
man
,
in
his
courtesy
,
seem
to
find


nothing
strange
in
my
being
here
alone
;
only
a
reason
for
extend
to


I
,
as
far
as
he
could
,
a
retiring
,
yet
efficient
attention
.
have


secure
I
a
place
and
a
seat
,
he
withdraw
without
ask
a
question
,


without
obtrude
a
remark
,
without
add
a
superfluous
word
.
no


wonder
that
Professor
Emanuel
like
to
take
his
cigar
and
his
lounge
,


and
to
read
his
feuilleton
in
M.
Miret
's
shop
--
the
two
must
have
suit
.




I
have
not
be
seat
five
minute
,
ere
I
become
aware
that
chance
and


my
worthy
burgher
friend
have
bring
I
once
more
within
view
of
a


familiar
and
domestic
group
.
right
before
I
sit
the
Brettons
and
de


bassompierre
.
within
reach
of
my
hand
--
have
I
choose
to
extend
it
--
sit


a
figure
like
a
fairy
-
queen
,
whose
array
,
lily
and
their
leave


seem
to
have
suggest
;
whatever
be
not
spotless
white
,
be


forest
-
green
.
my
godmother
,
too
,
sit
so
near
,
that
,
have
I
lean


forward
,
my
breath
might
have
stir
the
ribbon
of
her
bonnet
.
they


be
too
near
;
having
be
just
recognise
by
a
comparative
stranger
,
I


feel
uneasy
at
this
close
vicinage
of
intimate
acquaintance
.




it
make
I
quite
start
when
Mrs.
Bretton
,
turn
to
Mr.
Home
,
and


speak
out
of
a
kind
impulse
of
memory
,
said,--"i
wonder
what
my


steady
little
Lucy
would
say
to
all
this
if
she
be
here
?
I
wish
we


have
bring
she
,
she
would
have
enjoy
it
much
.
"




"
so
she
would
,
so
she
would
,
in
her
grave
sensible
fashion
;
it
be
a


pity
but
we
have
ask
she
,
"
rejoin
the
kind
gentleman
;
and
add
,
"
I


like
to
see
she
so
quietly
pleased
;
so
little
move
,
yet
so
content
.
"




Dear
be
they
both
to
I
,
dear
be
they
to
this
day
in
their


remember
benevolence
.
little
know
they
the
rack
of
pain
which
have


drive
Lucy
almost
into
fever
,
and
bring
she
out
,
guideless
and


reckless
,
urge
and
drug
to
the
brink
of
frenzy
.
I
have
half
a
mind


to
bend
over
the
elder
'
shoulder
,
and
answer
their
goodness
with
the


thank
of
my
eye
.
M.
de
Bassompierre
do
not
well
know
_
I
_
,
but
I


know
_
he
_
,
and
honour
and
admire
his
nature
,
with
all
its
plain


sincerity
,
its
warm
affection
,
and
unconscious
enthusiasm
.
possibly
I


might
have
speak
,
but
just
then
Graham
turn
;
he
turn
with
one
of


his
stately
firm
movement
,
so
different
from
those
,
of
a


sharp
-
temper
under
-
sized
man
:
there
be
behind
he
a
throng
,
a


hundred
rank
deep
;
there
be
thousand
to
meet
his
eye
and
divide
its


scrutiny
--
why
then
do
he
concentrate
all
on
I
--
oppress
I
with
the


whole
force
of
that
full
,
blue
,
steadfast
orb
?
why
,
if
he
_
would
_
look
,


do
not
one
glance
satisfy
he
?
why
do
he
turn
on
his
chair
,
rest
his


elbow
on
its
back
,
and
study
I
leisurely
?
he
could
not
see
my
face
,
I


hold
it
down
;
surely
,
he
_
could
_
not
recognise
I
:
I
stoop
,
I
turn
,


I
_
would
_
not
be
know
.
he
rise
,
by
some
mean
he
contrive
to


approach
,
in
two
minute
he
would
have
have
my
secret
:
my
identity
would


have
be
grasp
between
his
,
never
tyrannous
,
but
always
powerful


hand
.
there
be
but
one
way
to
evade
or
to
check
he
.
I
imply
,
by
a


sort
of
supplicatory
gesture
,
that
it
be
my
prayer
to
be
let
alone
;


after
that
,
have
he
persist
,
he
would
perhaps
have
see
the
spectacle


of
Lucy
incense
:
not
all
that
be
grand
,
or
good
,
or
kind
in
he
(
and


Lucy
feel
the
full
amount
)
should
have
keep
she
quite
tame
,
or


absolutely
inoffensive
and
shadowlike
.
he
look
,
but
he
desist
.
he


shake
his
handsome
head
,
but
he
be
mute
.
he
resume
his
seat
,
nor
do


he
again
turn
or
disturb
I
by
a
glance
,
except
indeed
for
one
single


instant
,
when
a
look
,
rather
solicitous
than
curious
,
steal
my


way
--
speak
what
somehow
still
my
heart
like
"
the
south
-
wind


quiet
the
earth
.
"
Graham
's
thought
of
I
be
not
entirely
those
of


a
frozen
indifference
,
after
all
.
I
believe
in
that
goodly
mansion
,
his


heart
,
he
keep
one
little
place
under
the
sky
-
light
where
Lucy
might


have
entertainment
,
if
she
choose
to
call
.
it
be
not
so
handsome
as
the


chamber
where
he
lodge
his
male
friend
;
it
be
not
like
the
hall


where
he
accommodate
his
philanthropy
,
or
the
library
where
he


treasure
his
science
,
still
less
do
it
resemble
the
pavilion
where


his
marriage
feast
be
splendidly
spread
;
yet
,
gradually
,
by
long
and


equal
kindness
,
he
prove
to
I
that
he
keep
one
little
closet
,
over


the
door
of
which
be
write
"
Lucy
's
Room
.
"
I
keep
a
place
for
he
,


too
--
a
place
of
which
I
never
take
the
measure
,
either
by
rule
or


compass
:
I
think
it
be
like
the
tent
of
Peri
-
Banou
.
all
my
life
long
I


carry
it
fold
in
the
hollow
of
my
hand
yet
,
release
from
that
hold


and
constriction
,
I
know
not
but
its
innate
capacity
for
expanse
might


have
magnify
it
into
a
tabernacle
for
a
host
.




forbear
as
he
be
to
-
night
,
I
could
not
stay
in
this
proximity
;
this


dangerous
place
and
seat
must
be
give
up
:
I
watch
my
opportunity
,


rise
,
and
steal
away
.
he
might
think
,
he
might
even
believe
that
Lucy


be
contain
within
that
shawl
,
and
shelter
under
that
hat
;
he
never


could
be
certain
,
for
he
do
not
see
my
face
.




surely
the
spirit
of
restlessness
be
by
this
time
appeased
?
have
I
not


have
enough
of
adventure
?
do
I
not
begin
to
flag
,
quail
,
and
wish
for


safety
under
a
roof
?
not
so
.
I
still
loathe
my
bed
in
the
school


dormitory
more
than
word
can
express
:
I
clung
to
whatever
could


distract
think
.
somehow
I
feel
,
too
,
that
the
night
's
drama
be
but


begin
,
that
the
prologue
be
scarce
speak
:
throughout
this
woody
and


turfy
theatre
reign
a
shadow
of
mystery
;
actor
and
incident


unlooked
-
for
,
wait
behind
the
scene
:
I
think
so
foreboding
tell
I


as
much
.




stray
at
random
,
obey
the
push
of
every
chance
elbow
,
I
be


bring
to
a
quarter
where
tree
plant
in
cluster
,
or
tower


singly
,
break
up
somewhat
the
dense
packing
of
the
crowd
,
and
give
it
a


more
scatter
character
.
these
confine
be
far
from
the
music
,
and


somewhat
aloof
even
from
the
lamp
,
but
there
be
sound
enough
to


soothe
,
and
with
that
full
,
high
moon
,
lamp
be
scarce
need
.
here


have
chiefly
settle
family
-
group
,
burgher
-
parent
;
some
of
they
,
late


as
be
the
hour
,
actually
surround
by
their
child
,
with
whom
it


have
not
be
think
advisable
to
venture
into
the
close
throng
.




three
fine
tall
tree
grow
close
,
almost
twine
stem
within
stem
,


lift
a
thick
canopy
of
shade
above
a
green
knoll
,
crown
with
a


seat
--
a
seat
which
might
have
hold
several
,
yet
it
seem
abandon
to


one
,
the
remain
member
of
the
fortunate
party
in
possession
of
this


site

dutifully
round
;
yet
,
amongst
this
reverend
circle
be
a


lady
,
hold
by
the
hand
a
little
girl
.




when
I
catch
sight
of
this
little
girl
,
she
be
twist
herself
round


on
her
heel
,
swinge
from
her
conductress
's
hand
,
fling
herself


from
side
to
side
with
wanton
and
fantastic
gyration
.
these
perverse


movement
arrest
my
attention
,
they
strike
I
as
of
a
character


fearfully
familiar
.
on
close
inspection
,
no
less
so
appear
the


child
's
equipment
;
the
lilac
silk
pelisse
,
the
small
swansdown
boa
,
the


white
bonnet
--
the
whole
holiday
toilette
,
in
short
,
be
the
gala
garb


of
a
cherub
but
too
well
know
,
of
that
tadpole
,
Desiree
Beck

and


Desiree
Beck
it

she
,

an
imp
in
her
likeness
.




I
might
have
take
this
discovery
as
a
thunder
-
clap
,
but
such
hyperbole


would
have
be
premature
;
discovery
be
destine
to
rise
more
than
one


degree
,
ere
it
reach
its
climax
.




on
whose
hand
could
the
amiable
desiree
swing
thus
selfishly
,
whose


glove
could
she
tear
thus
recklessly
,
whose
arm
thus
strain
with


impunity
,
or
on
the
border
of
whose
dress
thus
turn
and
trample


insolently
,
if
not
the
hand
,
glove
,
arm
,
and
robe
of
her
lady

mother

and
there
,
in
an
indian
shawl

a
pale

crape
bonnet

!




the
fact
be
,
Madame
be
only
act
accord
to
she
quite
justifiable


wo
nt
.
I
remember
now
I
have
hear
it
say
among
the
teacher
--
though


without
at
the
time
particularly
notice
the
gossip
--
that
often
,
when


we
think
Madame
in
her
chamber
,
sleep
,
she
be
go
,
full
-
dressed
,


to
take
her
pleasure
at
opera
,
or
play
,
or
ball
.
Madame
have
no
sort


of
taste
for
a
monastic
life
,
and
take
care
--
largely
,
though


discreetly
--
to
season
her
existence
with
a
relish
of
the
world
.




half
a
dozen
gentleman
of
her
friend
stand
about
she
.
amongst
these
,
I


be
not
slow
to
recognise
two
or
three
.
there
be
her
brother
,
M.


victor
Kint
;
there
be
another
person
,
moustached
and
with
long
hair
--
a


calm
,
taciturn
man
,
but
whose
trait
bear
a
stamp
and
a
semblance
I


could
not
mark
unmoved
.
amidst
reserve
and
phlegm
,
amidst
contrast
of


character
and
of
countenance
,
something
there
still
be
which
recall


a
face
--
mobile
,
fervent
,
feeling
--
a
face
changeable
,
now
clouded
,
and


now
alight
--
a
face
from
my
world
take
away
,
for
my
eye
lose
,
but


where
my
good
spring
-
hour
of
life
have
alternate
in
shadow
and
in


glow
;
that
face
,
where
I
have
often
see
movement
so
near
the
sign
of


genius
--
that
why
there
do
not
shine
fully
out
the
undoubted
fire
,
the


thing
,
the
spirit
,
and
the
secret
itself
--
I
could
never
tell
.
yes
--
this


Josef
Emanuel
--
this
man
of
peace
--
remind
I
of
his
ardent
brother
.




besides
Messieurs
Victor
and
Josef
,
I
know
another
of
this
party
.
this


third
person
stand
behind
and
in
the
shade
,
his
attitude
too
be


stoop
,
yet
his
dress
and
bald
white
head
make
he
the
most


conspicuous
figure
of
the
group
.
he
be
an
ecclesiastic
:
he
be
Pere


Silas
.
do
not
fancy
,
reader
,
that
there
be
any
inconsistency
in
the


priest
's
presence
at
this
fete
.
this
be
not
consider
a
show
of


Vanity
Fair
,
but
a
commemoration
of
patriotic
sacrifice
.
the
Church


patronise
it
,
even
with
ostentation
.
there
be
troop
of
priest
in


the
park
that
night
.




Pere
Silas
stoop
over
the
seat
with
its
single
occupant
,
the
rustic


bench
and
that
which
sit
upon
it
:
a
strange
mass
it
be
--
bear
no


shape
,
yet
magnificent
.
you
see
,
indeed
,
the
outline
of
a
face
,
and


feature
,
but
these
be
so
cadaverous
and
so
strangely
place
,
you


could
almost
have
fancy
a
head
sever
from
its
trunk
,
and
fling
at


random
on
a
pile
of
rich
merchandise
.
the
distant
lamp
-
ray
glance
on


clear
pendant
,
on
broad
ring
;
neither
the
chasteness
of
moonlight
,


nor
the
distance
of
the
torch
,
could
quite
subdue
the
gorgeous
dye


of
the
drapery
.
hail
,
Madame
Walravens
!
I
think
you
look
more


witch
-
like
than
ever
.
and
presently
the
good
lady
prove
that
she
be


indeed
no
corpse
or
ghost
,
but
a
harsh
and
hardy
old
woman
;
for
,
upon


some
aggravation
in
the
clamorous
petition
of
Desiree
Beck
to
she


mother
,
to
go
to
the
kiosk
and
take
sweetmeat
,
the
hunchback
suddenly


fetch
she
a
resounding
rap
with
her
gold
-
knobbed
cane
.




there
,
then
,
be
Madame
Walravens
,
Madame
Beck
,
Pere
Silas
--
the
whole


conjuration
,
the
secret
junta
.
the
sight
of
they
thus
assemble
do
I


good
.
I
can
not
say
that
I
feel
weak
before
they
,
or
abash
,
or


dismayed
.
they
outnumber
I
,
and
I
be
worst
and
under
their
foot
;


but
,
as
yet
,
I
be
not
dead

ACQUAINTANCE
.






fascinated
as
by
a
basilisk
with
three
head
,
I
could
not
leave
this


clique
;
the
ground
near
they
seem
to
hold
my
foot
.
the
canopy
of


entwine
tree
hold
out
shadow
,
the
night
whisper
a
pledge
of


protection
,
and
an
officious
lamp
flash
just
one
beam
to
show
I
an


obscure
,
safe
seat
,
and
then
vanish
.
let
I
now
briefly
tell
the


reader
all
that
,
during
the
past
dark
fortnight
,
I
have
be
silently


gather
from
Rumour
,
respect
the
origin
and
the
object
of
M.


Emanuel
's
departure
.
the
tale
be
short
,
and
not
new
:
its
alpha
be


Mammon
,
and
its
omega
interest
.




if
Madame
Walravens
be
hideous
as
a
Hindoo
idol
,
she
seem
also
to


possess
,
in
the
estimation
of
these
her
votary
,
an
idol
's


consequence
.
the
fact
be
,
she
have
be
rich
--
very
rich
;
and
though
,


for
the
present
,
without
the
command
of
money
,
she
be
likely
one
day


to
be
rich
again
.
at
Basseterre
,
in
Guadaloupe
,
she
possess
a
large


estate
,
receive
in
dowry
on
her
marriage
sixty
year
ago
,
sequester


since
her
husband
's
failure
;
but
now
,
it
be
suppose
,
clear
of


claim
,
and
,
if
duly
look
after
by
a
competent
agent
of
integrity
,


consider
capable
of
be
make
,
in
a
few
year
,
largely
productive
.




Pere
Silas
take
an
interest
in
this
prospective
improvement
for
the


sake
of
religion
and
the
church
,
whereof
Magliore
Walravens
be
a


devout
daughter
.
Madame
Beck
,
distantly
relate
to
the
hunchback
and


know
she
to
be
without
family
of
her
own
,
have
long
brood
over


contingency
with
a
mother
's
calculate
forethought
,
and
,
harshly


treat
as
she
be
by
Madame
Walravens
,
never
cease
to
court
she
for


interest
's
sake
.
Madame
Beck
and
the
priest
be
thus
,
for
money


reason
,
equally
and
sincerely
interested
in
the
nursing
of
the
West


indian
estate
.




but
the
distance
be
great
,
and
the
climate
hazardous
.
the
competent


and
upright
agent
want
,
must
be
a
devoted
man
.
just
such
a
man
have


Madame
Walravens
retain
for
twenty
year
in
her
service
,
blight


his
life
,
and
then
live
on
he
,
like
an
old
fungus
;
such
a
man
have


Pere
Silas
train
,
teach
,
and
bind
to
he
by
the
tie
of
gratitude
,


habit
,
and
belief
.
such
a
man
Madame
Beck
know
,
and
could
in
some


measure
influence
.
"
my
pupil
,
"
say
Pere
Silas
,
"
if
he
remain
in


Europe
,
run
risk
of
apostacy
,
for
he
have
become
entangled
with
a


heretic
.
"
Madame
Beck
make
also
her
private
comment
,
and
prefer
in


her
own
breast
her
secret
reason
for
desire
expatriation
.
the
thing


she
could
not
obtain
,
she
desire
not
another
to
win
:
rather
would
she


destroy
it
.
as
to
Madame
Walravens
,
she
want
her
money
and
her
land
,


and
know
Paul
,
if
he
like
,
could
make
the
good
and
faithfull


steward
:
so
the
three
self
-
seeker
band
and
beset
the
one
unselfish
.


they
reason
,
they
appeal
,
they
implore
;
on
his
mercy
they
cast


themselves
,
into
his
hand
they
confidingly
thrust
their
interest
.


they
ask
but
two
or
three
year
of
devotion
--
after
that
,
he
should


live
for
himself
:
one
of
the
number
,
perhaps
,
wish
that
in
the


meantime
he
might
die
.




no
living
be
ever
humbly
lay
his
advantage
at
M.
Emanuel
's
foot
,

confidingly
put
it
into
his
hand
,
that
he
spurn
the
trust
or


repulse
the
repository
.
what
might
be
his
private
pain
or
inward


reluctance
to
leave
Europe
--
what
his
calculation
for
his
own


future
--
none
ask
,
or
know
,
or
report
.
all
this
be
a
blank
to
I
.


his
conference
with
his
confessor
I
might
guess
;
the
part
duty
and


religion
be
make
to
play
in
the
persuasion
use

I
might
conjecture

with

on

sit
amidst

I
be

enough

for
some
time

there
be
scarce
motive
to
attend

about

the

more
than

at

determined
to

aloud
this

a
phrase
brief
enough

simple
enough

it
send
a
shock

me--"Messieurs

this
ghostly
Justine
Marie
--
dead
or
alive
--
be
concern
.
this


family
-
junta
seem
grasp
at
she
somehow
,
for
some
reason
;
there


seem
question
of
a
marriage
,
of
a
fortune
--
for
whom
I
could
not
quite


make
out
--
perhaps
for
Victor
Kint
,
perhaps
for
Josef
Emanuel
--
both
be


bachelor
.
once
I
think
the
hint
and
jest
rain
upon
a
young


fair
-
haired
foreigner
of
the
party
,
whom
they
call
Heinrich
Muehler
.


amidst
all
the
badinage
,
Madame
Walravens
still
obtrude
from
time
to


time
,
hoarse
,
cross
-
grained
speech
;
her
impatience
be
divert


only
by
an
implacable
surveillance
of
Desiree
,
who
could
not
stir
but


the
old
woman
menace
she
with
her
staff
.




"
la
voila
!
"
suddenly
cry
one
of
the
gentleman
,
"
voila
Justine
Marie


qui
arrive
!
"




this
moment
be
for
I
peculiar
.
I
call
up
to
memory
the
picture
nun


on
the
panel
;
present
to
my
mind
be
the
sad
love
-
story
;
I
see
in


think
the
vision
of
the
garret
,
the
apparition
of
the
alley
,
the


strange
birth
of
the
berceau
;
I
undergo
a
presentiment
of
discovery
,


a
strong
conviction
of
come
disclosure
.
ah
!
when
imagination
once


run
riot
where
do
we
stop
?
what
winter
tree
so
bare
and


branchless
--
what
way
-
side
,
hedge
-
munch
animal
so
humble
,
that
Fancy
,


a
pass
cloud
,
and
a
struggle
moonbeam
,
will
not
clothe
it
in


spirituality
,
and
make
of
it
a
phantom
?




with
solemn
force
press
on
my
heart
,
the
expectation
of
mystery


break
up
:
hitherto
I
have
see
this
spectre
only
through
a
glass


darkly
;
now
be
I
to
behold
it
face
to
face
.
I
lean
forward
;
I
look
.




"
she
come
!
"
cry
Josef
Emanuel
.




the
circle
open
as
if
open
to
admit
a
new
and
welcome
member
.
at


this
instant
a
torch
chance
to
be
carry
past
;
its
blaze
aid
the


pale
moon
in
do
justice
to
the
crisis
,
in
lighting
to
perfection
the


denouement
press
on
.
surely
those
near
I
must
have
feel
some
little


of
the
anxiety
I
feel
,
in
degree
so
unmeted
.
of
that
group
the
cool


must
have
"
hold
his
breath
for
a
time

"
as
for
I
,
my
life

still
.




it
be
over
.
the
moment
and
the
nun
be
come
.
the
crisis
and
the


revelation
be
pass
by
.




the
flambeau
glare
still
within
a
yard
,
hold
up
in
a
park
-
keeper
's


hand
;
its
long
eager
tongue
of
flame
almost
lick
the
figure
of
the


expect
--
there
--
where
she
stand
full
in
my
sight
.
what

what
do
she
wear

how
do
she
look

there
be
many
mask
in
the
park
to

night
,
and
as
the
hour
wear
late
,


so
strange
a
feeling
of
revelry
and
mystery
begin
to
spread
abroad
,


that
scarce
would
you
discredit
I
,
reader
,
be
I
to
say
that
she
be


like
the
nun
of
the
attic
,
that
she
wear
black
skirt
and
white


head
-
clothe
,
that
she
look
the
resurrection
of
the
flesh
,
and
that


she
be
a
risen
ghost
.




all
falsity
--
all
figment
!
we
will
not
deal
in
this
gear
.
let
we
be


honest
,
and
cut
,
as
heretofore
,
from
the
homely
web
of
truth
.




_
homely
_
,
though
,
be
an
ill
-
choose
word
.
what
I
see
be
not
precisely


homely
.
a
girl
of
Villette
stand
there
--
a
girl
fresh
from
she


pensionnat
.
she
be
very
comely
,
with
the
beauty
indigenous
to
this


country
.
she
look
well
-
nourish
,
fair
,
and
fat
of
flesh
.
her
cheek


be
round
,
her
eye
good
;
her
hair
be
abundant
.
she
be
handsomely


dress
.
she
be
not
alone
;
her
escort
consist
of
three
person
--
two


be
elderly
;
these
she
address
as
"
Mon
Oncle
"
and
"
Ma
Tante
.
"
she


laugh
,
she
chat
;
good
-
humour
,
buxom
,
and
blooming
,
she
look
,
at


all
point
,
the
bourgeoise
belle
.




"
so
much
for
Justine
Marie
;
"
so
much
for
ghost
and
mystery
:
not
that


this
last
be
solve
--
this
girl
certainly
be
not
my
nun
:
what
I
see
in


the
garret
and
garden
must
have
be
tall
by
a
span
.




we
have
look
at
the
city
belle
;
we
have
cursorily
glance
at
the


respectable
old
uncle
and
aunt
.
have
we
a
stray
glance
to
give
to
the


third
member
of
this
company
?
can
we
spare
he
a
moment
's
notice
?
we


ought
to
distinguish
he
so
far
,
reader
;
he
have
claim
on
we
;
we
do
not


now
meet
he
for
the
first
time
.
I
clasp
my
hand
very
hard
,
and
I


draw
my
breath
very
deep
:
I
hold
in
the
cry
,
I
devour
the


ejaculation
,
I
forbid
the
start
,
I
speak
and
I
stir
no
more
than
a


stone
;
but
I
know
what
I
look
on
;
through
the
dimness
leave
in
my
eye


by
many
night
'
weeping
,
I
know
he
.
they
say
he
be
to
sail
by
the


_
Antigua
_
.
Madame
Beck
say
so
.
she
lie
,
or
she
have
utter
what
be


once
truth
,
and
fail
to
contradict
it
when
it
become
false
.
the


_
Antigua
_
be
go
,
and
there
stand
Paul
Emanuel
.




be
I
glad
?
a
huge
load
leave
I
.
be
it
a
fact
to
warrant
joy
?
I
know


not
.
ask
first
what
be
the
circumstance
attendant
on
this
respite
?


how
far
do
this
delay
concern
_
I
?
_
be
there
not
those
whom
it
might


touch
more
nearly
?




after
all
,
who
may
this
young
girl
,
this
Justine
Marie
,
be
?
not
a


strange
,
reader
;
she
be
know
to
I
by
sight
;
she
visit
at
the
Rue


fossette
:
she
be
often
of
Madame
Beck
's
Sunday
party
.
she
be
a


relation
of
both
the
Becks
and
Walravens
;
she
derive
her
baptismal


name
from
the
sainted
nun
who
would
have
be
her
aunt
have
she
live
;


her
patronymic
be
Sauveur
;
she
be
an
heiress
and
an
orphan
,
and
M.


Emanuel
be
her
guardian
;
some
say
her
godfather
.




the
family
junta
wish
this
heiress
to
be
married
to
one
of
their


band
--
which
be
it
?
vital
question
--
which
be
it
?




I
feel
very
glad
now
,
that
the
drug
administer
in
the
sweet
draught


have
fill
I
with
a
possession
which
make
bed
and
chamber
intolerable
.


I
always
,
through
my
whole
life
,
like
to
penetrate
to
the
real
truth
;


I
like
seek
the
goddess
in
her
temple
,
and
handle
the
veil
,
and


dare
the
dread
glance
.
o
titaness
among
deity
!
the
cover
outline


of
thine
aspect
sicken
often
through
its
uncertainty
,
but
define
to
we


one
trait
,
show
we
one
lineament
,
clear
in
awful
sincerity
;
we
may
gasp


in
untold
terror
,
but
with
that
gasp
we
drink
in
a
breath
of
thy


divinity
;
our
heart
shake
,
and
its
current
sway
like
river
lift
by


earthquake
,
but
we
have
swallow
strength
.
to
see
and
know
the
bad


be
to
take
from
fear
her
main
advantage
.




the
Walravens
'
party
,
augment
in
number
,
now
become
very
gay
.
the


gentleman
fetch
refreshment
from
the
kiosk
,
all
sit
down
on
the
turf


under
the
tree
;
they
drink
health
and
sentiment
;
they
laugh
,
they


jest
.
M.
Emanuel
undergo
some
raillery
,
half
good
-
humoured
,
half
,
I


think
,
malicious
,
especially
on
Madame
Beck
's
part
.
I
soon
gather


that
his
voyage
have
be
temporarily
defer
of
his
own
will
,
without


the
concurrence
,
even
against
the
advice
,
of
his
friend
;
he
have
let


the
_
Antigua
_
go
,
and
have
take
his
berth
in
the
_
Paul
et
Virginie
_
,


appoint
to
sail
a
fortnight
later
.
it
be
his
reason
for
this
resolve


which
they
tease
he
to
assign
,
and
which
he
would
only
vaguely


indicate
as
"
the
settlement
of
a
little
piece
of
business
which
he
have


set
his
heart
upon
.
"
what
_
be
_
this
business
?
nobody
know
.
yes
,
there


be
one
who
seem
partly
,
at
least
,
in
his
confidence
;
a
meaning
look


pass
between
he
and
Justine
Marie
.
"
La
petite
va
m'aider
--
n'est
-
ce


pas
?
"
say
he
.
the
answer
be
prompt
enough
,
God
know
?




"
Mais
oui
,
je
vous
aiderai
de
tout
mon
coeur
.
Vous
ferez
de
moi
tout
ce


que
vous
voudrez
,
mon
parrain
.
"




and
this
dear
"
parrain
"
take
her
hand
and
lift
it
to
his
grateful


lip
.
upon
which
demonstration
,
I
see
the
light
-
complexion
young


Teuton
,
Heinrich
Muehler
,
grow
restless
,
as
if
he
do
not
like
it
.
he


even
grumble
a
few
word
,
whereat
M.
Emanuel
actually
laugh
in
his


face
,
and
with
the
ruthless
triumph
of
the
assured
conqueror
,
he
draw


his
ward
nearer
to
he
.




M.
Emanuel
be
indeed
very
joyous
that
night
.
he
seem
not
one
whit


subdue
by
the
change
of
scene
and
action
impend
.
he
be
the
true


life
of
the
party
;
a
little
despotic
,
perhaps
,
determined
to
be
chief


in
mirth
,
as
well
as
in
labour
,
yet
from
moment
to
moment
prove


indisputably
his
right
of
leadership
.
his
be
the
witty
word
,
the


pleasantest
anecdote
,
the
frank
laugh
.
restlessly
active
,
after
his


manner
,
he
multiply
himself
to
wait
on
all
;
but
oh
!
I
see
which
be


his
favourite
.
I
see
at
whose
foot
he
lie
on
the
turf
,
I
see
whom
he


fold
carefully
from
the
night
air
,
whom
he
tend
,
watch
,
and


cherish
as
the
apple
of
his
eye
.




still
,
hint
and
raillery
fly
thick
,
and
still
I
gather
that
while
M.


Paul
should
be
absent
,
work
for
other
,
these
other
,
not
quite


ungrateful
,
would
guard
for
he
the
treasure
he
leave
in
Europe
.
let
he


bring
they
an
indian
fortune
:
they
would
give
he
in
return
a
young


bride
and
a
rich
inheritance
.
as
for
the
saintly
consecration
,
the
vow


of
constancy
,
that
be
forget
:
the
bloom
and
charming
Present


prevail
over
the
past
;
and
,
at
length
,
his
nun
be
indeed
bury
.




thus
it
must
be
.
the
revelation
be
indeed
come
.
Presentiment
have
not


be
mistaken
in
her
impulse
:
there
be
a
kind
of
presentiment
which


never
_
be
_
mistaken
;
it
be
I
who
have
for
a
moment
miscalculate
;
not


see
the
true
bearing
of
the
oracle
,
I
have
think
she
mutter
of


vision
when
,
in
truth
,
her
prediction
touch
reality
.




I
might
have
pause
long
upon
what
I
see
;
I
might
have
deliberate


ere
I
draw
inference
.
some
,
perhaps
,
would
have
hold
the
premise


doubtful
,
the
proof
insufficient
;
some
slow
sceptic
would
have


incredulously
examine
ere
they
conclusively
accept
the
project
of
a


marriage
between
a
poor
and
unselfish
man
of
forty
,
and
his
wealthy


ward
of
eighteen
;
but
far
from
I
such
shift
and
palliative
,
far
from


I
such
temporary
evasion
of
the
actual
,
such
coward
fleeing
from
the


dread
,
the
swift
-
footed
,
the
all
-
overtake
fact
,
such
feeble
suspense


of
submission
to
she
the
sole
sovereign
,
such
palter
and
falter


resistance
to
the
Power
whose
errand
be
to
march
conquering
and
to


conquer
,
such
traitor
defection
from
the
truth
.




no
.
I
hasten
to
accept
the
whole
plan
.
I
extend
my
grasp
and
take


it
all
in
.
I
gather
it
to
I
with
a
sort
of
rage
of
haste
,
and
fold


it
round
I
,
as
the
soldier
strike
on
the
field
fold
his
colour
about


his
breast
.
I
invoke
conviction
to
nail
upon
I
the
certainty
,


abhor
while
embrace
,
to
fix
it
with
the
strong
spike
she


strong
stroke
could
drive
;
and
when
the
iron
have
enter
well
my


soul
,
I
stand
up
,
as
I
think
,
renovate
.




in
my
infatuation
,
I
say
,
"
truth
,
you
be
a
good
mistress
to
your


faithful
servant
!
while
a
lie
press
I
,
how
I
suffer
!
even
when


the
Falsehood
be
still
sweet
,
still
flatter
to
the
fancy
,
and
warm


to
the
feeling
,
it
waste
I
with
hourly
torment
.
the
persuasion
that


affection
be
win
could
not
be
divorce
from
the
dread
that
,
by
another


turn
of
the
wheel
,
it
might
be
lose
.
truth
strip
away
Falsehood
,
and


flattery
,
and
Expectancy
,
and
here
I
stand
--
free
!
"




nothing
remain
now
but
to
take
my
freedom
to
my
chamber
,
to
carry
it


with
I
to
my
bed
and
see
what
I
could
make
of
it
.
the
play
be
not


yet
,
indeed
,
quite
play
out
.
I
might
have
wait
and
watch
long


that
love
-
scene
under
the
tree
,
that
sylvan
courtship
.
have
there
be


nothing
of
love
in
the
demonstration
,
my
Fancy
in
this
hour
be
so


generous
,
so
creative
,
she
could
have
model
for
it
the
most
salient


lineament
,
and
give
it
the
deep
life
and
high
colour
of


passion
.
but
I
_
would
_
not
look
;
I
have
fix
my
resolve
,
but
I
would


not
violate
my
nature
.
and
then
--
something
tear
I
so
cruelly
under
my


shawl
,
something
so
dig
into
my
side
,
a
vulture
so
strong
in
beak
and


talon
,
I
must
be
alone
to
grapple
with
it
.
I
think
I
never
feel


jealousy
till
now
.
this
be
not
like
endure
the
endearment
of
Dr.


John
and
Paulina
,
against
which
while
I
seal
my
eye
and
my
ear
,


while
I
withdraw
thence
my
thought
,
my
sense
of
harmony
still


acknowledge
in
it
a
charm
.
this
be
an
outrage
.
the
love
bear
of


beauty
be
not
mine
;
I
have
nothing
in
common
with
it
:
I
could
not
dare


to
meddle
with
it
,
but
another
love
,
venture
diffidently
into
life


after
long
acquaintance
,
furnace
-
try
by
pain
,
stamp
by
constancy
,


consolidate
by
affection
's
pure
and
durable
alloy
,
submit
by


intellect
to
intellect
's
own
test
,
and
finally
work
up
,
by
his
own


process
,
to
his
own
unflawed
completeness
,
this
Love
that
laugh
at


passion
,
his
fast
frenzy
and
his
hot
and
hurried
extinction
,
in


_
this
_
Love
I
have
a
vested
interest
;
and
whatever
tend
either
to
its


culture
or
its
destruction
,
I
could
not
view
impassibly
.




I
turn
from
the
group
of
tree
and
the
"
merrie
companie
"
in
its


shade
.
Midnight
be
long
past
;
the
concert
be
over
,
the
crowd
be


thinning
.
I
follow
the
ebb
.
leave
the
radiant

,
I
seek
the

Dim
I
should
not

,
for
the

stainlessly
she

the

the

she

I
at

the
type

witness
of
truth


all
regnant
.
the

like

these

these

be
soon

.


so
well
do
I
love
Villette
under
her
present
aspect
,
not
willingly


would
I
re
-
enter
under
a
roof
,
but
that
I
be
bent
on
pursue
my


strange
adventure
to
a
successful
close
,
and
quietly
regain
my
bed


in
the
great
dormitory
,
before
Madame
Beck
come
home
.




only
one
street
lie
between
I
and
the
Rue
Fossette
;
as
I
enter
it
,


for
the
first
time
,
the
sound
of
a
carriage
tear
up
the
deep
peace
of


this
quarter
.
it
come
this
way
--
come
very
fast
.
how
loud
sound
its


rattle
on
the
paved
path
!
the
street
be
narrow
,
and
I
keep
carefully
to


the
causeway
.
the
carriage
thunder
past
,
but
what
do
I
see
,
or
fancy
i


see
,
as
it
rush
by
?
surely
something
white
flutter
from
that


window
--
surely
a
hand
wave
a
handkerchief
.
be
that
signal
mean
for


I
?
be
I
know
?
who
could
recognise
I
?
that
be
not
M.

Bassompierre
's
carriage
,
nor
Mrs.
Bretton
's
;
and
besides
,
neither
the


Hotel
Crecy
nor
the
chateau
of
La
Terrasse
lie
in
that
direction
.


well
,
I
have
no
time
for
conjecture
;
I
must
hurry
home
.




gain
the
Rue
Fossette
,
reach
the
pensionnat
,
all
there
be
still
;


no
fiacre
have
yet
arrive
with
Madame
and
Desiree
.
I
have
leave
the
great


door
ajar
;
should
I
find
it
thus
?
perhaps
the
wind
or
some
other


accident
may
have
throw
it
to
with
sufficient
force
to
start
the


spring
-
bolt
?
in
that
case
,
hopeless
become
admission
;
my
adventure
must


issue
in
catastrophe
.
I
lightly
push
the
heavy
leaf
;
would
it
yield
?




yes
.
as
soundless
,
as
unresisting
,
as
if
some
propitious
genius
have


wait
on
a
sesame
-
charm
,
in
the
vestibule
within
.
enter
with
bated


breath
,
quietly
make
all
fast
,
shoelessly
mount
the
staircase
,
I


seek
the
dormitory
,
and
reach
my
couch

ay
!
I
reach
it
,
and
once
more
draw
a
free
inspiration
.
the
next


moment
,
I
almost
shriek
--
almost
,
but
not
quite
,
thank
Heaven
!




throughout
the
dormitory
,
throughout
the
house

there
reign
at
this


hour
the
stillness
of
death

all
sleep

in
such
hush
,
it
seem


that
none

stretch
on
the
nineteen
bed

nineteen
form

at
full

motionless
.
on
mine

the

couch

nothing


_
ought
_
to
have
lain

I
have
leave
it
void

void

have
find


it
.
what
,
then
;
do
I
see
between
the
half

draw
curtain

what
dark
,


usurp
shape
,
supine
,
long
,
and
strange
?
be
it
a
robber
who
have
make


his
way
through
the
open
street

door
,
and
lie
there
in
wait
?
it
look


very
black
,
I
think
it
look
--
not
human
.
can
it
be
a
wandering
dog
that


have
come
in
from
the
street
and
creep
and
nestle
hither
?
will
it


spring
,
will
it
leap
out
if
I
approach
?
approach
I
must
.
courage
!
one


step!--




my
head
reel
,
for
by
the
faint
night
-
lamp
,
I
see
stretch
on
my
bed


the
old
phantom
--
the
NUN
.




a
cry
at
this
moment
might
have
ruin
I
.
be
the
spectacle
what
it


might
,
I
could
afford
neither
consternation
,
scream
,
nor
swoon
.


besides
,
I
be
not
overcome
.
temper
by
late
incident
,
my
nerve


disdained
hysteria
.
warm
from
illumination
,
and
music
,
and
throng


thousand
,
thoroughly
lash
up
by
a
new
scourge
,
I
defy
spectra
.
in


a
moment
,
without
exclamation
,
I
have
rush
on
the
haunted
couch
;


nothing
leap
out
,
or
sprung
,
or
stir
;
all
the
movement
be
mine
,


so
be
all
the
life
,
the
reality
,
the
substance
,
the
force
;
as
my


instinct
feel
.
I
tear
she
up
--
the
incubus
!
I
hold
she
on
high
--
the


goblin
!
I
shake
she
loose
--
the
mystery
!
and
down
she
fall
--
down
all


around
I
--
down
in
shred
and
fragment
--
and
I
trode
upon
she
.




here
again
--
behold
the
branchless
tree
,
the
unstabled
Rosinante
;
the


film
of
cloud
,
the
flicker

invest
with
a

veil

the
garment

very
truth

strange
as
it
may
seem
,
be


genuine
nun

garment
,
and
by
some
hand
they
have
be
dispose
with
a


view
to
illusion
.
whence
come
these

from

;

this
remarkable
Midsummer

no

I
do
not
mean
that
it
bring
sign
in
heaven
above
,

portent


on
the

to
meteorological
phenomenon

,
flood
,
or
whirlwind

on
the
contrary
:

a
July
face
.
morning
deck
her
beauty
with
ruby
,
and
so
fill
she


lap
with
rose
,
that
they
fall
from
she
in
shower
,
make
her
path


blush
:
the
hour
wake

as

out

shadowless

the

a
burning

in
short
,
it
be
as
fine
a
day
as
the
fine
summer
could
boast
;
but
I


doubt
whether
I
be
not
the
sole
inhabitant
of
the
Rue
Fossette

who


care

a
thought
,
indeed
,
which
have
its

in
my


meditation

this
master
consideration
,
not
possess
for
I
so


entire
a

so
dense

to
the

of
my

I
somewhat
more
open
than
the
rest
to
any
collateral
observation

still
,
while
walk
in
the
garden
,
feel
the
sunshine
,
and
mark


the
blooming
and

I
ponder
the

subject

what
subject
?




merely
this
.
when

,
there
be
a
place
vacant

Deep
be
the

deep
the
horror
of
the

directress

I

so
pale

so


appal
.
here
be
a
blow
strike
at
her
tender
part
,
her
weak
side
;


here
be
damage
do
to
her
interest
.
how
,
too
,
have
the
untoward
event


happen
?
by
what
outlet
have
the
fugitive
take
wing
?
not
a

,
not
a
pane
of
glass

;
all
the

bolt
secure
.
never
to
this
day
have
Madame

obtain
satisfaction


on
this
point
,
nor
indeed
have
anybody
else
concern
,

and


except
one
,
Lucy
Snowe

who
could
not
forget
how
,
to
facilitate
a


certain
enterprise
,
a
certain
great
door
have
be
draw
softly
to
its


lintel
,
closed
,
indeed
,
but
neither
bolt
nor
secure
.
the
thunder


carriage

and
-

be
now

,
as
well
as


that
puzzle

,
the
waved
handkerchief
.




from
these
premise
,
and
one
or
two
other
,
inaccessible
to
any
but


myself
,
I
could
draw
but
one
inference
.
it
be
a
case
of
elopement
.


morally
certain
on
this
head
,
and
see
Madame
Beck
's
profound


embarrassment
,
I
at
last
communicate
my
conviction
.
having
allude
to


M.
de
Hamal
's
suit
,
I
find
,
as
I
expect
,
that
Madame
Beck
be


perfectly
au
fait
to
that
affair
.
she
have
long
since
discuss
it
with


Mrs.
Cholmondeley
,
and
lay
her
own
responsibility
in
the
business
on


that
lady
's
shoulder
.
to
Mrs.
Cholmondeley
and
M.

Bassompierre
she


now
have
recourse
.




we
find
that
the
Hotel
Crecy
be
already
alive
to
what
have
happen
.


Ginevra
have
write
to
her
cousin
Paulina

vaguely
signifying
hymeneal


intention
;
communication
have
be

from
the
family
of

M.

on
the
track
of
the

overtook

too
late

in
the
course
of
the
week
,
the

bring
I
a
note
.
I
may
as
well


transcribe
it

more
than
one
point:--

you

the
nun
of
the
attic

I


will
tell
you
how
he
manage
it
.
you
know
he
have
the
entree
of
the


Athenee

two
or
three
of
his
nephew
,
the
son
of
his
eld


sister
,
Madame
de
Melcy

be
student

you
know
the
court
of
the


athenee
be
on
the
other
side
of
the
high
wall
bound
your
walk
,
the


allee
defendue
.
Alfred
can
climb
as
well
as
he
can
dance
or
fence
:
his


amusement
be
to
make
the
escalade
of
our
pensionnat
by
mount
,
first


the
wall
;
then
--
by
the
aid
of
that
high
tree
overspread
the
grand


berceau
,
and
rest
some
of
its
bough
on
the
roof
of
the
low


building
of
our
premise
--
he
manage
to
scale
the
first
classe
and
the


grand
salle
.
one
night
,
by
the
way
,
he
fall
out
of
this
tree
,
tear
down


some
of
the
branch
,
nearly
break
his
own
neck
,
and
after
all
,
in


run
away
,
get
a
terrible
fright
,
and
be
nearly
catch
by
two


people
,
Madame
Beck
and
M.
Emanuel
,
he
think
,
walk
in
the
alley
.


from
the
grande

the
ascent

not
difficult

the
high
block


of

in
the
great
garret
.

day

leave
half
open
for
air
;
by
the
skylight
he
enter
.


nearly
a
year
ago
I
chance
to
tell
he
our
legend
of
the
nun
;
that


suggest
his
romantic
idea
of
the
spectral
disguise
,
which
I
think
you


must
allow
he
have
very
cleverly
carry
out
.




"
but
for
the
nun
's
black
gown
and
white
veil
,
he
would
have
be
catch


again
and
again
both
by
you
and
that
tiger
-
Jesuit
,
M.
Paul
.
he
think


you
both
capital
ghost
-
seer
,
and
very
brave
.
what
I
wonder
at
be
,


rather
your
secretiveness
than
your
courage
.
how
could
you
endure
the


visitation
of
that
long
spectre
,
time
after
time
,
without
cry
out
,


tell
everybody
,
and
rouse
the
whole
house
and
neighbourhood
?




"
oh
,
and
how
do
you
like
the
nun
as
a
bed

fellow
?
_
I
_
dress
she
up
:


do
n't
I
do
it
well
?
do
you
shriek
when
you
see
she
:
I
should
have


go
mad
;
but
then
you
have
such
nerves!--real
iron
and
bend
-
leather
!
I


believe
you
feel
nothing
.
you
have
n't
the
same
sensitiveness
that
a


person
of
my
constitution
have
.
you
seem
to
I
insensible
both
to
pain


and
fear
and
grief
.
you
be
a
real
old
Diogenes
.




"
well
,
dear
grandmother
!
and
be
you
not
mightily
angry
at
my
moonlight


flit
and
run
away
match
?
I
assure
you
it
be
excellent
fun
,
and
I


do
it
partly
to
spite
that
minx
,
Paulina
,
and
that
bear
,
Dr.
John
:
to


show
they
that
,
with
all
their
air
,
I
could
get
married
as
well
as


they
.
M.
de
Bassompierre
be
at
first
in
a
strange
fume
with
Alfred
;
he


threaten
a
prosecution
for
'
detournement
de
mineur
,
'
and
I
know
not


what
;
he
be
so
abominably
in
earnest
,
that
I
find
myself
force
to
do


a
little
bit
of
the
melodramatic
--
go
down
on
my
knee
,
sob
,
cry
,
drench


three
pocket
-
handkerchief
.
of
course
,
'
mon
oncle
'
soon
give
in
;


indeed
,
where
be
the
use
of
make
a
fuss
?
I
be
married
,
and
that
be


all
about
it
.
he
still
say
our
marriage
be
not
legal
,
because
I
be
not


of
age
,
forsooth
!
as
if
that
make
any
difference
!
I
be
just
as
much


married
as
if
I
be
a
hundred
.
however
,
we
be
to
be
marry
again

there
be
some
hope
that

give
I
a
decent
portion

will
be
very
convenient

dear
Alfred


have
nothing
but
his
nobility
,
native

hereditary

his

I


only
wish
uncle
would
do
thing
unconditionally
,
in
a
generous
,


gentleman

he
be
so
disagreeable

he
will
never
touch


card

be

down

they
accuse
my
angel
of
a


tendency
to
play
:
I
do
n't
know
anything

I
can
not
sufficiently
extol
the

clever
in

infallibly
be

wear
shoe

not

conclude

it

be
the
master

to


inspect

send

a
figure

my

print
upon
my

the
picture
of
M.
Paul
.




hundred
of
the
prayer
with
which
we
weary
Heaven
bring
to
the


suppliant
no
fulfilment

once
haply

one
golden
gift
fall


prone

the
lap

one
boon
full
and
bright
,
perfect
from

M.

wear
the
dress

he
probably
purpose
to
travel

guard
with
velvet

I

he
prepare
for
instant


departure

I
have
understand
that
two
day
be

he
look
well

cheerful
.
he
look
kind

benign

he
come
in
with
eagerness
;
he
be
close
to
I
in
one
second

he


be
all
amity

it
might
be
his
bridegroom
mood

thus
brighten


he

whatever
the
cause
,
I
could
not
meet
his
sunshine
with
cloud
.
if


this
be
my
last
moment
with
he
,
I
would
not
waste
it
in
force
,


unnatural
distance

I
love
he
well
--
too
well
not
to
smite
out
of
my


path
even
Jealousy
herself
,
when
she
would
have
obstruct
a
kind


farewell

a
cordial
word
from
his
lip
,

a
gentle
look
from
his

do
I
good
,
for
all
the
span
of
life
that
remain
to
I

it


would
be
comfort
in
the
last
strait
of
loneliness
;
I
would
take
it
--
I


would
taste
the
elixir
,
and
pride
should
not
spill
the
cup
.




the
interview
would
be
short
,

course
:
he
would
say
to
I
just
what


he
have
say
to
each
of
the
assemble
pupil
;
he
would
take
and
hold
my


hand
two
minute

he
would
touch
my
cheek
with
his
lip
for
the
first
,


last
,
only
time

and
then

the
final
parting

the
wide

the
great
gulf

to
lay
so
much
stress
on
an


opinion
about
appearance

I
fear
it
might
be
;
I
fear
it
be

but
in


that
case
I
must
avow

great
fear

strong
wish
moderately

M.
Paul
.




Whither
we

M.

of
his

of
stay
away
three
year
.
on
his
return
from


Guadaloupe
,
he
look
forward
to
release
from
liability
and
a
clear


course
;
and
what
do
I
purpose
do
in
the
interval
of
his
absence
?
he


ask
.
I
have
talk
once
,
he
remind
I
,
of
try
to
be
independent


and
keep
a
little
school
of
my
own
:
have
I
drop
the
idea
?




"
indeed
,
I
have
not

"
he

not

miss
he
there
too
much

I
should
feel
desolate

I

grow
sad--

another
objection
to

I
should
wish
to
write

you
sometimes

it

not

any
uncertainty
about
the
safe
transmission
of

in

Rue

in
short

our
catholic
discipline
in


certain

justifiable

expedient

might
possibly
,


under
peculiar

misapplication

perhaps


abuse

certain

freely
leave
I
my
pure

he
do
not
tease


nor
tempt
.
he
said:--




"
remain

my
little
English
Puritan
,
I
love
Protestantism


in
you

I
own
its
severe
charm
.
there
be
something
in
its
ritual
i


can
not
receive
myself
,

it
be
the
sole
creed
for
'

all
Rome

not
put
into

bigotry

Jesuit

he
be

honest
,

not
false
--
artless
,
and
not


cunning

a
freeman

his
tenderness
have
render

I
have
cultivate
out
of


love
for
he
(
I

naturally
no

the

he
prefer
,

some
of
they
be
yet
in
bloom

I
think
I
love
he
when
he
go
away

another

themselves

shriek
out

I


may
through
the
house
this
night

I
can
not
lull
the
