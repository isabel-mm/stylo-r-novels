a

out
on
the
quay
,
and
the
whole
bay

before
they
and
Mrs.

could
not

exclaim
,

plateful
of

;


the
hoary
lighthouse
,
distant
,
austere
,
in
the
midst
;
and
on
the
right
,


as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
,
fade
and
fall
,
in
soft
low
pleat
,


the
green
sand
dune
with
the
wild
flow
grass
on
they
,
which
always


seem
to
be
run
away
into
some
moon
country
,
uninhabited
of
man
.




that
be
the
view
,
she
say
,
stop
,
grow
greyer
-
eye
,
that
she


husband
love
.




she
pause
a
moment
.
but
now
,
she
say
,
artist
have
come
here
.
there


indeed
,
only
a
few
pace
off
,
stand
one
of
they
,
in
Panama
hat
and
yellow


boot
,
seriously
,
softly
,
absorbedly
,
for
all
that
he
be
watch
by
ten


little
boy
,
with
an
air
of
profound
contentment
on
his
round
red
face


gaze
,
and
then
,
when
he
have
gaze
,
dip
;
imbue
the
tip
of
his


brush
in
some
soft
mound
of
green
or
pink
.
since
Mr.
Paunceforte
have
be


there
,
three
year
before
,
all
the
picture
be
like
that
,
she
say
,


green
and
grey
,
with
lemon
-
colour
sailing
-
boat
,
and
pink
woman
on
the


beach
.




but
her
grandmother
's
friend
,
she
say
,
glance
discreetly
as
they


pass
,
take
the
great
pain
;
first
they
mix
their
own
colour
,
and


then
they
grind
they
,
and
then
they
put
damp
cloth
to
keep
they
moist
.




so
Mr.

suppose
she

see
that
that
man
's
picture

n't
 
solid
?
be
that
what

under
the
influence
of

for
a
moment

for
the

part
beat

the

under
the

thunder
hollow
in
her
ear

make
she
look
up


with
an
impulse
of
terror

they
have
cease
to

the
explanation

fall
in
one
second


from
the
tension

have
grip
she
to
the
other
extreme

to

her
unnecessary
expense

faintly
malicious

poor
Charles

be
shed
.
that
be
of
little
account

she
cheerfully

up
to
he

one

more

she
listen

as
if
she
wait
for


some
habitual
sound
,
some
regular
mechanical
sound
;
and
then
,
hear


something
rhythmical
,
half
say
,
half
chant
,
begin
in
the
garden
,
as


her
husband
beat
up
and
down
the
terrace

something
between
a
croak

a


song

be
soothe
once
more

assure
again
that
all
be
well
,
and


look
down
at
the
book
on
her
knee
find
the
picture
of
a
pocket
knife


with
six
blade
which
could
only
be
cut
out
if
James
be
very
careful
.




suddenly
a
loud
cry
,
as
of
a
sleep
-
walker
,
half
rouse

something
about

out
with
the

only
Lily

be


glad

that

the
sight
of
the
girl

on
the
edge
of
the
lawn

remind
she
;
she
be

her

.
with
her
little
chinese


eye

her
pucker

up
face
,
she
would
never
marry
;
one
could
not
take


her
painting
very
seriously
;
she
be
an
independent
little
creature

Mrs.

like
she
for
it

so
,
remember
her
promise
,
she
bend
she


head

indeed
,
he
almost
knock
she
easel
over
,
come
down
upon
she
with
his


hand
wave
shout
out
,
"
boldly
we
ride
and
well
,
"
but
,
mercifully
,
he


turn
sharp
,
and
ride
off
,
to
die
gloriously
she
suppose
upon
the


height
of
Balaclava
.
never
be
anybody
at
once
so
ridiculous
and
so


alarming
.
but
so
long
as
he
keep
like
that
,
wave
,
shout
,
she
be


safe
;
he
would
not
stand
still
and
look
at
her
picture
.
and
that
be
what


Lily
Briscoe
could
not
have
endure
.
even
while
she
look
at
the
mass
,


at
the
line
,
at
the
colour
,
at
Mrs.

sit
in
the
window
with


James

she
keep
a
feeler
on
her
surrounding
lest
some
one
should
creep


up
,
and
suddenly
she
should
find
her
picture
look
at
.
but
now
,
with
all


her
sense
quicken
as
they
be
,
look
,
strain
,
till
the
colour
of


the
wall
and
the
jacmanna
beyond
burn
into
her
eye
,
she
be
aware
of


someone
come
out
of
the
house
,
come
towards
she
;
but
somehow
divine
,


from
the
footfall
,
William
Bankes
,
so
that
though
her
brush
quiver
,
she


do
not
,
as
she
would
have
do
have
it
be
Mr.
Tansley
,
Paul
Rayley
,


Minta
Doyle
,
or
practically
anybody
else
,
turn
her
canvas
upon
the
grass
,


but
let
it
stand
.
William
Bankes
stand
beside
she
.




they
have
room
in
the
village
,
and
so
,
walk
in
,
walk
out
,
part


late
on
door
-
mat
,
have
say
little
thing
about
the
soup
,
about
the


child
,
about
one
thing
and
another
which
make
they
ally
;
so
that
when


he
stand
beside
she
now
in
his
judicial
way
 
he
be
old
enough
to
be
she


father
too
,
a
botanist
,
a
widower
,
smell
of
soap
,
very
scrupulous
and


clean
 
she
just
stand
there
.
he
just
stand
there
.
her
shoe
be


excellent
,
he
observe
.
they
allow
the
toe
their
natural
expansion
.


lodge
in
the
same
house
with
she
,
he
have
notice
too
,
how
orderly
she


be
,
up
before
breakfast
and
off
to
paint
,
he
believe
,
alone
:
poor
,


presumably
,
and
without
the
complexion
or
the
allurement
of
Miss
Doyle


certainly
,
but
with
a
good
sense
which
make
she
in
his
eye
superior
to


that
young
lady
.
now
,
for
instance
,
when
Ramsay
bear
down
on
they
,


shout
,
gesticulate
,
Miss
Briscoe
,
he
feel
certain
,
understand
.






some
one
have
blunder
.






Mr.
Ramsay
glare
at
they
.
he
glare
at
they
without
seem
to
see
they
.


that
do
make
they
both
vaguely
uncomfortable
.
together
they
have
see
a


thing
they
have
not
be
mean
to
see
.
they
have
encroach
upon
a
privacy
.


so
,
Lily
think
,
it
be
probably
an
excuse
of
his
for
move
,
for
get


out
of
earshot
,
that
make
Mr.
Bankes
almost
immediately
say
something


about
its
be
chilly
and
suggest
take
a
stroll
.
she
would
come
,


yes
.
but
it
be
with
difficulty
that
she
take
her
eye
off
her
picture
.




the
jacmanna
be
bright
violet
;
the
wall
stare
white
.
she
would
not


have
consider
it
honest
to
tamper
with
the
bright
violet
and
the
stare


white
,
since
she
see
they
like
that
,
fashionable
though
it
be
,
since


Mr.
Paunceforte
's
visit
,
to
see
everything
pale
,
elegant
,
semitransparent
.


then
beneath
the
colour
there
be
the
shape
.
she
could
see
it
all
so


clearly
,
so
commandingly
,
when
she
look
:
it
be
when
she
take
her
brush


in
hand
that
the
whole
thing
change
.
it
be
in
that
moment
's
flight


between
the
picture
and
her
canvas
that
the
demon
set
on
she
who
often


bring
she
to
the
verge
of
tear
and
make
this
passage
from
conception
to


work
as
dreadful
as
any
down
a
dark
passage
for
a
child
.
such
she
often


feel
herself
-
struggle
against
terrific
odd
to
maintain
her
courage
;
to


say
:
"
but
this
be
what
I
see
;
this
be
what
I
see
,
"
and
so
to
clasp
some


miserable
remnant
of
her
vision
to
her
breast
,
which
a
thousand
force
do


their
good
to
pluck
from
she
.
and
it
be
then
too
,
in
that
chill
and


windy
way
,
as
she
begin
to
paint
,
that
there
force
themselves
upon
she


other
thing
,
her
own
inadequacy
,
her
insignificance
,
keep
house
for


her
father
off
the
Brompton
Road
,
and
have
much
ado
to
control
her
impulse


to
fling
herself
 
thank
Heaven
she
have
always
resist
so
far
 
at


Mrs.
Ramsay
's
knee
and
say
to
she
-
but
what
could
one
say
to
she
?
"
I
be
in


love
with
you
?
"
no
,
that
be
not
true
.
"
I
be
in
love
with
this
all
,
"


wave
her
hand
at
the
hedge
,
at
the
house
,
at
the
child
.
it
be


absurd
,
it
be
impossible
.
so
now
she
lay
her
brush
neatly
in
the
box
,


side
by
side
,
and
say
to
William
Bankes
:




"
it
suddenly
get
cold
.
the
sun
seem
to
give
less
heat
,
"
she
say
,


look
about
she
,
for
it
be
bright
enough
,
the
grass
still
a
soft
deep


green
,
the
house
star
in
its
greenery
with
purple
passion
flower
,
and


rook
drop
cool
cry
from
the
high
blue
.
but
something
move
,


flash
,
turn
a
silver
wing
in
the
air
.
it
be
September
after
all
,


the
middle
of
September
,
and
past
six
in
the
evening
.
so
off
they


stroll
down
the
garden
in
the
usual
direction
,
past
the
tennis
lawn
,


past
the
pampas
grass
,
to
that
break
in
the
thick
hedge
,
guard
by
red


hot
poker
like
brasier
of
clear
burn
coal
,
between
which
the
blue


water
of
the
bay
look
bluer
than
ever
.




they
come
there
regularly
every
evening
draw
by
some
need
.
it
be
as
if


the
water
float
off
and
set
sailing
thought
which
have
grow
stagnant
on


dry
land
,
and
give
to
their
body
even
some
sort
of
physical
relief
.


first
,
the
pulse
of
colour
flood
the
bay
with
blue
,
and
the
heart


expand
with
it
and
the
body
swam
,
only
the
next
instant
to
be
check


and
chill
by
the
prickly
blackness
on
the
ruffled
wave
.
then
,
up


behind
the
great
black
rock
,
almost
every
evening
spurt
irregularly
,
so


that
one
have
to
watch
for
it
and
it
be
a
delight
when
it
come
,
a
fountain


of
white
water
;
and
then
,
while
one
wait
for
that
,
one
watch
,
on
the


pale
semicircular
beach
,
wave
after
wave
shed
again
and
again


smoothly
,
a
film
of
mother
of
pearl
.




they
both
smile
,
stand
there
.
they
both
feel
a
common
hilarity
,


excited
by
the
move
wave
;
and
then
by
the
swift
cut
race
of
a


sailing
boat
,
which
,
having
slice
a
curve
in
the
bay
,
stop
;
shiver
;


let
its
sail
drop
down
;
and
then
,
with
a
natural
instinct
to
complete
the


picture
,
after
this
swift
movement
,
both
of
they
look
at
the
dune


far
away
,
and
instead
of
merriment
felt
come
over
they
some


sadness
-
because
the
thing
be
complete
partly
,
and
partly
because


distant
view
seem
to
outlast
by
a
million
year
 
Lily
think
 
the
gazer


and
to
be
commune
already
with
a
sky
which
behold
an
earth
entirely


at
rest
.




look
at
the
far
sand
hill
,
William
Bankes
think
of
Ramsay
:
think


of
a
road
in
Westmorland
,
thought
of
Ramsay
stride
along
a
road
by


himself
hang
round
with
that
solitude
which
seem
to
be
his
natural
air
.


but
this
be
suddenly
interrupted
,
William
Bankes
remember
 
and
this


must
refer
to
some
actual
incident
,
by
a
hen
,
straddle
her
wing
out
in


protection
of
a
covey
of
little
chick
,
upon
which
Ramsay
,
stop
,


point
his
stick
and
say
"
pretty
-
pretty
,
"
an
odd
illumination
in
to


his
heart
,
Bankes
have
think
it
,
which
show
his
simplicity
,
his


sympathy
with
humble
thing
;
but
it
seem
to
he
as
if
their
friendship


have
cease
,
there
,
on
that
stretch
of
road
.
after
that
,
Ramsay
have


married
.
after
that
,
what
with
one
thing
and
another
,
the
pulp
have
go


out
of
their
friendship
.
whose
fault
it
be
he
could
not
say
,
only
,
after


a
time
,
repetition
have
take
the
place
of
newness
.
it
be
to
repeat
that


they
meet
.
but
in
this
dumb
colloquy
with
the
sand
dune
he
maintain


that
his
affection
for
Ramsay
have
in
no
way
diminish
;
but
there
,
like


the
body
of
a
young
man
lay
up
in
peat
for
a
century
,
with
the
red
fresh


on
his
lip
,
be
his
friendship
,
in
its
acuteness
and
reality
,
lay
up


across
the
bay
among
the
sandhill
.




he
be
anxious
for
the
sake
of
this
friendship
and
perhaps
too
in
order
to


clear
himself
in
his
own
mind
from
the
imputation
of
having
dry
and


shrink
-
for
Ramsay
live
in
a
welter
of
child
,
whereas
Bankes
be


childless
and
a
widower
-
he
be
anxious
that
Lily
Briscoe
should
not


disparage
Ramsay
 
a
great
man
in
his
own
way
 
yet
should
understand
how


thing
stand
between
they
.
begin
long
year
ago
,
their
friendship
have


petere
out
on
a
Westmorland
road
,
where
the
hen
spread
her
wing
before


her
chick
;
after
which
Ramsay
have
marry
,
and
their
path
lie


different
way
,
there
have
be
,
certainly
for
no
one
's
fault
,
some


tendency
,
when
they
meet
,
to
repeat
.




yes
.
that
be
it
.
he
finish
.
he
turn
from
the
view
.
and
,
turn


to
walk
back
the
other
way
,
up
the
drive
,
Mr.
Bankes
be
alive
to
thing


which
would
not
have
strike
he
have
not
those
sandhill
reveal
to
he


the
body
of
his
friendship
lie
with
the
red
on
its
lip
lay
up
in


peat
-
for
instance
,
Cam
,
the
little
girl
,
Ramsay
's
young
daughter
.
she


be
pick
Sweet
Alice
on
the
bank
.
she
be
wild
and
fierce
.
she
would


not
"
give
a
flower
to
the
gentleman
"
as
the
nursemaid
tell
she
.


no
!
no
!
no
!
she
would
not
!
she
clench
her
fist
.
she
stamp
.
and


Mr.
Bankes
feel
aged
and
sadden
and
somehow
put
into
the
wrong
by
she


about
his
friendship
.
he
must
have
dry
and
shrink
.




the
Ramsays
be
not
rich
,
and
it
be
a
wonder
how
they
manage
to


contrive
it
all
.
eight
child
!
to
feed
eight
child
on
philosophy
!


here
be
another
of
they
,
Jasper
this
time
,
stroll
past
,
to
have
a
shot


at
a
bird
,
he
say
,
nonchalantly
,
swinge
Lily
's
hand
like
a
pump
-
handle


as
he
pass
,
which
cause
Mr.
Bankes
to
say
,
bitterly
,
how
SHE
be
a


favourite
.
there
be
education
now
to
be
consider
 
true
,
Mrs.
Ramsay


have
something
of
her
own
perhaps
 
let
alone
the
daily
wear
and
tear
of


shoe
and
stocking
which
those
"
great
fellow
,
"
all
well
grown
,
angular
,


ruthless
youngster
,
must
require

as
for
be
sure
which
be
which
,
or


in
what
order
they
come

that
be
beyond
he
.
he
call
they
privately


after
the
king
and
Queens
of
England
;
Cam
the
Wicked

Andrew

Andrew
brain
.
while
he
walk
up
the
drive


and
Lily
Briscoe
say
yes
and
no
and
cap
his
comment
 
for
she
be
in


love
with
they
all
,
in
love
with
this
world
 
he
weigh
Ramsay
's
case
,


commiserate
he
,
envy
he
,
as
if
he
have
see
he
div
himself
of
all


those
glory
of
isolation
and
austerity
which
crown
he
in
youth
to


cumber
himself
definitely
with
flutter
wing
and
cluck


domesticity
.
they
give
he
something
-
William
Bankes
acknowledge
that
;


it
would
have
be
pleasant
if
Cam
have
stick
a
flower
in
his
coat
or


clamber
over
his
shoulder
,
as
over
her
father
's
,
to
look
at
a
picture


of
Vesuvius
in
eruption
;
but
they
have
also
,
his
old
friend
could
not
but


feel
,
destroy
something
.
what
would
a
stranger
think
now
?
what
do


this
Lily
Briscoe
think
?
could
one
help
notice
that
habit
grow
on
he
?


eccentricity
,
weakness
perhaps
?
it
be
astonishing
that
a
man
of
his


intellect
could
stoop
so
low
as
he
do
-
but
that
be
too
harsh
a


phrase
-
could
depend
so
much
as
he
do
upon
people
's
praise
.




"
oh
,
but
,
"
say
Lily
,
"
think
of
his
work
!
"




whenever
she
"
think
of
his
work
"
she
always
see
clearly
before
she
a


large
kitchen
table
.
it
be
Andrew
be
do
.
she
ask
he
what
his


father
's
book
be
about
.
"
subject
and
object
and
the
nature
of


reality
,
"
Andrew
have
say
.
and
when
she
say
Heavens
,
she
have
no
notion


what
that
mean
.
"
think
of
a
kitchen
table
then
,
"
he
tell
she
,
"
when


you
be
not
there
.
"




so
now
she
always
see
,
when
she
think
of
Mr.
Ramsay
's
work
,
a
scrubbed


kitchen
table
.
it
lodge
now
in
the
fork
of
a
pear
tree
,
for
they
have


reach
the
orchard
.
and
with
a
painful
effort
of
concentration
,
she


focus
her
mind
,
not
upon
the
silver
-
boss
bark
of
the
tree
,
or
upon
its


fish
-
shape
leave
,
but
upon
a
phantom
kitchen
table
,
one
of
those


scrub
board
table
,
grain
and
knotted
,
whose
virtue
seem
to
have


be
lay
bare
by
year
of
muscular
integrity
,
which
stick
there
,
its
four


leg
in
air
.
naturally
,
if
one
's
day
be
pass
in
this
seeing
of


angular
essence
,
this
reducing
of
lovely
evening
,
with
all
their


flamingo
cloud
and
blue
and
silver
to
a
white
deal
four
-
legged
table


 
and
it
be
a
mark
of
the
fine
mind
to
do
so
,
naturally
one
could
not


be
judge
like
an
ordinary
person
.




Mr.
Bankes
like
she
for
bid
he
"
think
of
his
work
.
"
he
have
think


of
it
,
often
and
often
.
time
without
number
,
he
have
say
,
"
ramsay
be
one


of
those
man
who
do
their
good
work
before
they
be
forty
.
"
he
have
make
a


definite
contribution
to
philosophy
in
one
little
book
when
he
be
only


five
and
twenty
;
what
come
after
be
more
or
less
amplification
,


repetition
.
but
the
number
of
man
who
make
a
definite
contribution
to


anything
whatsoever
be
very
small
,
he
say
,
pause
by
the
pear
tree
,
well


brush
,
scrupulously
exact
,
exquisitely
judicial
.
suddenly
,
as
if
the


movement
of
his
hand
have
release
it
,
the
load
of
her
accumulate


impression
of
he
tilt
up
,
and
down
pour
in
a
ponderous
avalanche
all


she
feel
about
he
.
that
be
one
sensation
.
then
up
rise
in
a
fume
the


essence
of
his
being
.
that
be
another
.
she
feel
herself
transfix


by
the
intensity
of
her
perception
;
it
be
his
severity
;
his
goodness
.
I


respect
you
 
she
address
silently
he
in
person
 
in
every
atom
;
you
be


not
vain
;
you
be
entirely
impersonal
;
you
be
fine
than
Mr.
Ramsay
;
you


be
the
fine
human
being
that
I
know
;
you
have
neither
wife
nor
child


 
without
any
sexual
feeling
,
she
long
to
cherish
that
loneliness
,
you


live
for
science
 
involuntarily
,
section
of
potato
rise
before
she


eye

praise
would
be
an
insult
to
you
;
generous
,
pure

hearted
,
heroic


man
!
but
simultaneously
,
she
remember
how
he
have
bring
a
valet
all


the
way
up
here
;
object
to
dog
on
chair
;
would
prose
for
hour
 
until


Mr.
Ramsay
slam
out
of
the
room
 
about
salt
in
vegetable
and
the


iniquity
of
english
cook
.




how
then
do
it
work
out
,
all
this
?
how
do
one
judge
people
,
think
of


they
?
how
do
one
add
up
this
and
that
and
conclude
that
it
be
like


one
feel
or
dislike

and
to
those
word
,
what
meaning
attach
,
after


all
?
stand
now
,
apparently
transfix
,
by
the
pear
tree
,
impression


pour
in
upon
she
of
those
two
man
,
and
to
follow
her
thought
be
like


follow
a
voice
which
speak
too
quickly
to
be
take
down
by
one
's


pencil

the
voice
be
her
own
voice
say
without
prompt


undeniable
,
everlasting
,
contradictory
thing
,
so
that
even
the


fissure
and
hump
on
the
bark
of
the
pear
tree
be
irrevocably


fix
there
for
eternity
.
you
have
greatness
,

Mr.

none
of
it

petty
,
selfish
,
vain
,
egotistical
;
he
be


spoilt
;
he
be
a
tyrant
;
he
wear
Mrs.

he
have
what

address
Mr.
Bankes

not
;
a
fiery
unworldliness
;

down
in

the
other
night


and
let
Mrs.
Ramsay
trim
his
hair
into
a
pudding
basin
?
all
of
this


dance
up
and
down
,
like
a
company
of
gnat
,
each
separate
but
all


marvellously
control
in
an
invisible
elastic
net

dance
up
and
down
in


Lily
's
mind
,
in

about
the
branch
of
the
pear
tree
,
where
still
hang


in
effigy
the
scrub
kitchen
table
,
symbol
of
her
profound
respect
for


Mr.

mind
,
until
she
think
which
have
spin
quick
and
quicker


explode
of
its
own
intensity
;
she
feel
release
;
a
shot
go
off
close
at


hand
,
and
there
come
,
fly
from
its
fragment
,
frightened
,
effusive
,


tumultuous
,
a
flock
of
starling
.




"
Jasper

"
say
Mr.
Bankes
.
they
turn
the
way
the
starling
fly
,
over


the
terrace
.
follow
the
scatter
of
swift

fly
bird
in
the
sky
they


step
through
the
gap
in
the
high
hedge
straight
into
Mr.
Ramsay
,
who


boom
tragically
at
they
,
"
some
one

"




his
eye
,
glaze
with
emotion
,
defiant
with
tragic
intensity
,
meet
theirs


for
a
second
,
and
tremble
on
the
verge
of
recognition
;
but
then
,
raise


his
hand
,
half
-
way
to
his
face
as
if
to
avert
,
to
brush
off
,
in
an
agony


of
peevish
shame
,
their
normal
gaze
,
as
if
he
beg
they
to
withhold
for


a
moment
what
he
know
to
be
inevitable
,
as
if
he
impress
upon
they
his


own
child
-
like
resentment
of
interruption
,
yet
even
in
the
moment
of


discovery
be
not
to
be
route
utterly
,
but
be
determined
to
hold
fast
to


something
of
this
delicious
emotion
,
this
impure
rhapsody
of
which
he
be


ashamed
,
but
in
which
he
revel
-
he
turn
abruptly
,
slam
his
private


door
on

,
Lily
Briscoe

Mr.

look
uneasily
up
into


the
sky
,
observe

she


chinese
eye

aslant
in
her
white

up

it
against
James

"

she

in
his
jealousy

bend
her
head
as
if
to
let
the
pelt
of


jagged
hail
,
the
drench
of
dirty
water
,
bespatter
she
unrebuked
.
there


be
nothing
to
be
say
.




he
stand
by
she
in
silence
.
very
humbly
,
at
length
,
he
say
that
he
would


step
over
and
ask
the
Coastguards
if
she
like
.




there
be
nobody
whom
she
reverence
as
she
reverence
he
.




she
be
quite
ready
to
take
his
word
for
it
,
she
say
.
only
then
they


need
not
cut
sandwich
-
that
be
all
.
they
come
to
she
,
naturally
,
since


she
be
a
woman
,
all
day
long
with
this
and
that
;
one
want
this
,


another
that
;
the
child
be
grow
up
;
she
often
feel
she
be
nothing


but
a
sponge
sop
full
of
human
emotion
.
then
he
say
,
Damn
you
.
he


say
,
it
must
rain
.
he
say
,
it
wo
n't
 
rain
;
and
instantly
a
Heaven
of


security
open
before
she
.
there
be
nobody
she
reverence
more
.
she


be
not
good
enough
to
tie
his
shoe
string
,
she
feel
.




already
ashamed
of
that
petulance
,
of
that
gesticulation
of
the
hand
when


charge
at
the
head
of
his
troop
,
Mr.
Ramsay
rather
sheepishly
prod


his
son
's
bare
leg
once
more
,
and
then
,
as
if
he
have
her
leave
for
it
,


with
a
movement
which
oddly
remind
his
wife
of
the
great
sea
lion
at
the


zoo
tumble
backwards
after
swallow
his
fish
and
wallop
off
so
that


the
water
in
the
tank
wash
from
side
to
side
,
he
dive
into
the
evening


air
which
,
already
thin
,
be
take
the
substance
from
leave
and


hedge
but
,
as
if
in
return
,
restore
to
rose
and
pink
a
lustre
which


they
have
not
have
by
day
.




"
some
one
have
blunder
,
"
he
say
again
,
stride
off
,
up
and
down
the


terrace
.




but
how
extraordinarily
his
note
have
change
!
it
be
like
the
cuckoo
;


"
in
June
he
get
out
of
tune
"
;
as
if
he
be
try
over
,
tentatively


seek
,
some
phrase
for
a
new
mood
,
and
have
only
this
at
hand
,
use


it
,
crack
though
it
be
.
but
it
sound
ridiculous
-
"
some
one
have


blunder
"
-
say
like
that
,
almost
as
a
question
,
without
any
conviction
,


melodiously
.
Mrs.
Ramsay
could
not
help
smile
,
and
soon
,
sure
enough
,


walk
up
and
down
,
he
hum
it
,
drop
it
,
fall
silent
.




he
be
safe
,
he
be
restore
to
his
privacy
.
he
stop
to
light
his


pipe
,
look
once
at
his
wife
and
son
in
the
window
,
and
as
one
raise


one
's
eye
from
a
page
in
an
express
train
and
see
a
farm
,
a
tree
,
a


cluster
of
cottage
as
an
illustration
,
a
confirmation
of
something
on
the


print
page
to
which
one
return
,
fortify
,

satisfied
,
so
without


his

either
his
son
or
his
wife
,
the
sight
of
they
fortify


he
and
satisfy
he
and
consecrate
his
effort
to
arrive
at
a
perfectly


clear
understanding
of
the
problem
which
now
engage
the
energy
of
his


splendid
mind
.




it
be
a
splendid
mind
.
for
if
thought
be
like
the
keyboard
of
a

for
one

up

divinely
innocent

occupy
with


little
trifle
at
their
foot

somehow
entirely
defenceless
against
a


doom

he
perceive

down

the

surely
the
leader
of
a
forlorn
hope
may
ask
himself
that
,
and
answer
,


without
treachery
to
the
expedition

"
one

he

toil
honestly

of
his

till
he
have
no


more
left
to
give

and
his
fame
last
how
long
?
it
be
permissible
even


for
a
die
hero
to
think
before

how
man
will
speak

his

perhaps
two
thousand

ask
Mr.
Ramsay
ironically
,
stare
at
the
hedge
.


what
,
indeed
,
if
you
look
from
a
mountain
top
down
the
long
waste
of
the


age

the
very
stone
one
kick
with
one
's
boot
will
outlast
Shakespeare
.


his
own
little
light
would
shine
,
not
very
brightly
,
for
a
year

two
,


and
would
then
be
merge
in
some
big
light
,

that
in
a
big
still
.


 
he
look
into
the
hedge
,
into
the
intricacy
of
the
twig
.
 
who
then


could
blame
the
leader
of
that
forlorn
party
which
after
all
have
climb


high
enough
to
see
the
waste
of
the
year
and
the
perishing
of
the
star

if
before
death
stiffen
his
limb
beyond
the
power
of
movement
he
do
a


little
consciously
raise
his
numb
finger
to
his
brow
,
and
square
his


shoulder
,
so
that
when
the
search
party
come
they
will
find
he
dead
at


his
post
,
the
fine
figure
of
a
soldier
?
Mr.
Ramsay
square
his
shoulder

stand
very
upright
by
the
urn

who
shall
blame
he
,
if
,
so
stand
for
a
moment
he
dwell
upon
fame
,


upon
search
party
,
upon
cairn
raise
by
grateful
follower
over
his


bone

finally
,
who
shall
blame
the
leader
of
the
doom
expedition
,
if
,


having
adventure
to
the
uttermost
,
and
use
his
strength
wholly
to
the


last
ounce
and
fall
asleep
not
much
care
if
he
wake
or
not
,
he
now


perceive
by
some
pricking
in
his
toe
that
he
live
,
and
do
not
on
the


whole
object
to
live
,
but
require
sympathy
,
and
whisky
,
and
some
one
to


tell
the
story
of
his
suffering
to
at
once
?
who
shall
blame
he
?
who


will
not
secretly
rejoice
when
the
hero
put
his
armour
off
,
and
halt
by


the
window
and
gaze
at
his
wife
and
son
,
who
,
very
distant
at
first
,


gradually
come
close
and
close
,
till
lip
and
book
and
head
be
clearly


before
he
,
though
still
lovely
and
unfamiliar
from
the
intensity
of
his


isolation
and
the
waste
of
age
and
the
perishing
of
the
star
,
and


finally
put
his
pipe
in
his
pocket
and
bend
his
magnificent
head


before
she
-
who
will
blame
he
if
he
do
homage
to
the
beauty
of
the


world
?

for
the
magnificence
of


his
head

there
he
stand

they
to
attend
to

most

by

,
not
for
a

he

so
boasting
of
her
capacity

protect
,

scarcely
a
shell
of
herself

she
to
know


herself
by
;
all
be
so
lavish
and

and
James
,
as
he
stand
stiff


between
her
knee
,
feel
her
rise
in
a
rosy
-
flower

lay
with


leave

which
the
beak

a
child
who
drop
off
satisfied
,

,
at


last
,
look
at
she
with
humble
gratitude
,
restore
,
renew
,
that
he


would

a
turn

cricket
.
he
go
.




immediately
,
Mrs.
Ramsey
seem
to
fold
herself
together
,
one
petal
close


in
another
,
and
the
whole
fabric
fall
in
exhaustion
upon
itself
,
so
that


she
have
only
strength
enough
to
move
her
finger
,
in
exquisite
abandonment


to
exhaustion
,
across
the
page
of
Grimm
's
fairy
story
,
while
there


throb
through
she
,
like
a
pulse
in
a
spring
which
have
expand
to
its


full
width
and
now
gently
cease
to
beat
,
the
rapture
of
successful


creation
.




every
throb
of
this
pulse
seem
,
as
he
walk
away
,
to
enclose
she
and


her
husband
,
and
to
give
to
each
that
solace
which
two
different
note
,


one
high
,
one
low
,
strike
together
,
seem
to
give
each
other
as
they


combine
.
yet
as
the
resonance
die
,
and
she
turn
to
the
Fairy
Tale


again
,
Mrs.
Ramsey
feel
not
only
exhaust
in
body
 
afterwards
,
not
at
the


time
,
she
always
feel
this
 
but
also
there
tinge
her
physical
fatigue


some
faintly
disagreeable
sensation
with
another
origin
.
not
that
,
as


she
read
aloud
the
story
of
the
Fisherman
's
Wife
,
she
know
precisely
what


it
come
from
;
nor
do
she
let
herself
put
into
word
her
dissatisfaction


when
she
realize
,
at
the
turn
of
the
page
when
she
stop
and
hear


dully
,
ominously
,
a
wave
fall
,
how
it
come
from
this
:
she
do
not
like
,


even
for
a
second
,
to
feel
fine
than
her
husband
;
and
far
,
could
not


bear
not
be
entirely
sure
,
when
she
speak
to
he
,
of
the
truth
of
what


she
say
.
university
and
people
want
he
,
lecture
and
book
and


their
being
of
the
high
importance
-
all
that
she
do
not
doubt
for
a


moment
;
but
it
be
their
relation
,
and
his
come
to
she
like
that
,


openly
,
so
that
any
one
could
see
,
that
discompose
she
;
for
then
people


say
he
depend
on
she
,
when
they
must
know
that
of
the
two
he
be


infinitely
the
more
important
,
and
what
she
give
the
world
,
in
comparison


with
what
he
give
,
negligable
.
but
then
again
,
it
be
the
other
thing


too
-
not
be
able
to
tell
he
the
truth
,
be
afraid
,
for
instance
,


about
the
greenhouse
roof
and
the
expense
it
would
be
,
fifty
pound


perhaps
to
mend
it
;
and
then
about
his
book
,
to
be
afraid
that
he
might


guess
,
what
she
a
little
suspect
,
that
his
last
book
be
not
quite
his


good
book
 
she
gather
that
from
William
Bankes
;
and
then
to
hide
small


daily
thing
,
and
the
child
see
it
,
and
the
burden
it
lay
on


they
-
all
this
diminish
the
entire
joy
,
the
pure
joy
,
of
the
two
note


sound
together
,
and
let
the
sound
die
on
her
ear
now
with
a
dismal


flatness
.




a
shadow
be
on
the
page
;
she
look
up
.
it
be
Augustus
Carmichael


shuffle
past
,
precisely
now
,
at
the
very
moment
when
it
be
painful
to


be
remind
of
the
inadequacy
of
human
relationship
,
that
the
most


perfect
be
flawed
,
and
could
not
bear
the
examination
which
,
love
she


husband
,
with
her
instinct
for
truth
,
she
turn
upon
it
;
when
it
be


painful
to
feel
herself
convict
of
unworthiness
,
and
impede
in
she


proper
function
by
these
lie
,
these
exaggeration
,
-
it
be
at
this


moment
when
she
be

thus
ignobly
in
the
wake
of
her
exaltation
,


that
Mr.
Carmichael

in
his
yellow
slipper

some
demon

to
call
out

all
this

smoothly
into


speculation
suggest
by
an
article
in
the
TIMES
about
the
number
of


Americans
who
visit
Shakespeare
's
house
every
year
.
if
Shakespeare


have
never
exist
,
he
ask
,
would
the
world
have
differ
much
from
what


it
be
today
?
do
the
progress
of
civilization
depend
upon
great
man
?
be


the
lot
of
the
average
human
be
well
now
than
in
the
time
of
the


pharaohs
?
be
the
lot
of
the
average
human
being
,
however
,
he
ask


himself
,
the
criterion
by
which
we
judge
the
measure
of
civilization
?


possibly
not
.
possibly
the
great
good
require
the
existence
of
a


slave
class
.
the
liftman
in
the
Tube
be
an
eternal
necessity
.
the


think
be
distasteful
to
he
.
he
toss
his
head
.
to
avoid
it
,
he


would
find
some
way
of
snub
the
predominance
of
the
art
.
he
would


argue
that
the
world
exist
for
the
average
human
being
;
that
the
art
be


merely
a
decoration
impose
on
the
top
of
human
life
;
they
do
not
express


it
.
nor
be
Shakespeare
necessary
to
it
.
not
know
precisely
why
it
be


that
he
want
to
disparage
Shakespeare
and
come
to
the
rescue
of
the
man


who
stand
eternally
in
the
door
of
the
lift
,
he
pick
a
leaf
sharply


from
the
hedge
.
all
this
would
have
to
be
dish
up
for
the
young
man
at


cardiff
next
month
,
he
think
;
here
,
on
his
terrace
,
he
be
merely


forage
and
picnic
 
he
throw
away
the
leaf
that
he
have
pick
so


peevishly
 
like
a
man
who
reach
from
his
horse
to
pick
a
bunch
of
rose
,


or
stuff
his
pocket
with
nut
as
he
amble
at
his
ease
through
the
lane


and
field
of
a
country
know
to
he
from
boyhood
.
it
be
all
familiar
;


this
turning
,
that
stile
,
that
cut
across
the
field
.
hour
he
would


spend
thus
,
with
his
pipe
,
of
an
evening
,
think
up
and
down
and
in
and


out
of
the
old
familiar
lane
and
common
,
which
be
all
stuck
about
with


the
history
of
that
campaign
there
,
the
life
of
this
statesman
here
,
with


poem
and
with
anecdote
,
with
figure
too
,
this
thinker
,
that
soldier
;


all
very
brisk
and
clear
;
but
at
length
the
lane
,
the
field
,
the
common
,


the
fruitful
nut
-
tree
and
the
flower
hedge
lead
he
on
to
that
further


turn
of
the
road
where
he
dismount
always
,
tie
his
horse
to
a
tree
,


and
proceed
on
foot
alone
.
he
reach
the
edge
of
the
lawn
and
look


out
on
the
bay
beneath
.




it
be
his
fate
,
his
peculiarity
,
whether
he
wish
it
or
not
,
to
come
out


thus
on
a
spit
of
land
which
the
sea
be
slowly
eat
away
,
and
there
to


stand
,
like
a
desolate
sea
-
bird
,
alone
.
it
be
his
power
,
his
gift
,


suddenly
to
shed
all
superfluity
,
to
shrink
and
diminish
so
that
he


look
barer
and
feel
sparer
,
even
physically
,
yet
lose
none
of
his


intensity
of
mind
,
and
so
to
stand
on
his
little
ledge
face
the
dark
of


human
ignorance
,
how
we
know
nothing
and
the
sea
eat
away
the
ground
we


stand
on
-
that
be
his
fate
,
his
gift
.
but
having
throw
away
,
when
he


dismount
,
all
gesture
and
frippery
,
all
trophy
of
nut
and
rose
,


and
shrink
so
that
not
only
fame
but
even
his
own
name
be
forget


by
he
,
keep
even
in
that
desolation
a
vigilance
which
spare
no


phantom
and
luxuriate
in
no
vision
,
and
it
be
in
this
guise
that


he
inspire
in
William
Bankes
 
intermittently
 
and
in
Charles
Tansley


 
obsequiously
and
in
his
wife
now
,
when
she
look
up
and
see
he


stand
at
the
edge
of
the
lawn
,
profoundly
,
reverence
,
and
pity
,
and


gratitude
too
,
as
a
stake
drive
into
the
bed
of
a
channel
upon
which
the


gull
perch
and
the
wave
beat
inspire
in
merry
boat

a
feeling

gratitude
for
the
duty

upon
itself

eight
child

half
aloud

so
he
break
off
,
turn
,

,
raise
his
eye
,
seek
the
figure
of
his


wife

to
his
little
boy
,
fill
his
pipe

from

ignorance

human
fate

find
consolation
in
trifle
so
slight

with


the
august
theme

now
before
he

that


comfort
over

deprecate
it

be
catch

a
world
of


misery
be
for
an
honest
man
the
most
despicable
of

Berkeley
,
and
the
cause
of
the
french


revolution

this

his
pleasure

it

glory

make

conceal
under
the
phrase

talk
nonsense

because
,
in
effect
,
he
have
not
do
the

it

a

it
be
the

a

afraid
to
own


his

who
could
not

this
be
what
I
like

this
be
what
I


be
;
and
rather
pitiable
and
distasteful
to
William
Bankes
and
Lily
Briscoe
,


who
wonder
why
such
concealment
should
be
necessary
;
why
he
need


always
praise
;
why
so
brave
a
man
in
thought
should
be
so
timid
in
life
;


how
strangely
he
be
venerable
and
laughable
at
one
and
the
same
time
.




teaching
and
preach
be
beyond
human
power
,
Lily
suspect
.
 
she
be


put
away
her
thing
.
 
if
you
be
exalted
you
must
somehow
come
a


cropper
.
Mrs.
Ramsay
give
he
what
he
ask
too
easily
.
then
the
change


must
be
so
upsetting
,
Lily
say
.
he
come
in
from
his
book
and
find
we


all
play
game
and
talk
nonsense
.
imagine
what
a
change
from
the


thing
he
think
about
,
she
say
.




he
be
bear
down
upon
they
.
now
he
stop
dead
and
stand
look
in


silence
at
the
sea
.
now
he
have
turn
away
again
.






9






yes
,
Mr.
Bankes
say
,
watch
he
go
.
it
be
a
thousand
pity
.
 
Lily


have
say
something
about
his
frightening
she
-
he
change
from
one
mood
to


another
so
suddenly
.
 
yes
,
say
Mr.
Bankes
,
it
be
a
thousand
pity
that


Ramsay
could
not
behave
a
little
more
like
other
people
.
 
for
he
like


Lily
Briscoe
;
he
could
discuss
Ramsay
with
she
quite
openly
.
 
it
be
for


that
reason
,
he
say
,
that
the
young
do
n't
 
read
Carlyle
.
a
crusty
old


grumbler
who
lose
his
temper
if
the
porridge
be
cold
,
why
should
he


preach
to
we
?
be
what
Mr.
Bankes
understand
that
young
people
say


nowadays
.
it
be
a
thousand
pity
if
you
think
,
as
he
do
,
that


Carlyle
be
one
of
the
great
teacher
of
mankind
.
Lily
be
ashamed
to
say


that
she
have
not
read
Carlyle
since
she
be
at
school
.
but
in
her
opinion


one
like
Mr.
Ramsay
all
the
well
for
think
that
if
his
little
finger


ache
the
whole
world
must
come
to
an
end
.
it
be
not
that
she
mind
.


for
who
could
be
deceive
by
he
?
he
ask
you
quite
openly
to
flatter


he
,

up
and

they
,


what
she
call
"

in
love
"
flood
they
.
they
become
part
of
that


unreal
but
penetrate
and
exciting
universe
which
be
the
world

through
the
eye
of

the
sky

and
,
what
be
even
more
exciting
,
she

,
too
,
as
she
see
Mr.


ramsay
bear
down
and
retreat
,
and
Mrs.
Ramsay
sit
with
James
in


the
window
and
the
cloud
move
and
the
tree
bending
,
how
life
,
from
be


make
up
of
little
separate
incident
which
one
live
one
by
one
,
become


curl
and
whole
like
a
wave
which
bear
one
up
and
throw
one
down
with


it
,
there
,
with
a
dash
on
the
beach
.




Mr.
Bankes
expect
she
to
answer
.
and
she
be
about
to
say
something


criticize
Mrs.
Ramsay
,
how
she
be
alarming
,
too
,
in
her
way
,


high
-
handed
,
or
word
to
that
effect
,
when
Mr.
Bankes
make
it
entirely


unnecessary
for
she
to
speak
by
his
rapture
.
for
such
it
be
consider


his
age
,
turn
sixty
,
and
his
cleanliness
and
his
impersonality
,
and
the


white
scientific
coat
which
seem
to
clothe
he
.
for
he
to
gaze
as
Lily


see
he
gaze
at
Mrs.
Ramsay
be
a
rapture
,
equivalent
,
Lily
feel
,
to
the


love
of
dozen
of
young
man
 
and
perhaps
Mrs.
Ramsay
have
never
excite
the


love
of
dozen
of
young
man
.
it
be
love
,
she
think
,
pretend
to


move
her
canvas
,
distil
and
filter
;
love
that
never
attempt
to


clutch
its
object
;
but
,
like
the
love
which
mathematician
bear
their


symbol
,
or
poet
their
phrase
,
be
mean
to
be
spread
over
the
world
and


become
part
of
the
human
gain
.
so
it
be
indeed
.
the
world
by
all
mean


should
have
share
it
,
could
Mr.
Bankes
have
say
why
that
woman
please


he
so
;
why
the
sight
of
she
read
a
fairy
tale
to
her
boy
have
upon
he


precisely
the
same
effect
as
the
solution
of
a
scientific
problem
,
so
that


he
rest
in
contemplation
of
it
,
and
feel
,
as
he
feel
when
he
have
prove


something
absolute
about
the
digestive
system
of
plant
,
that
barbarity


be
tame
,
the
reign
of
chaos
subdue
.




such
a
rapture
-
for
by
what
other
name
could
one
call
it
?
-
make
Lily


Briscoe
forget
entirely
what
she
have
be
about
to
say
.
it
be
nothing
of


importance
;
something
about
Mrs.
Ramsay
.
it
pale
beside
this
"
rapture
,
"


this
silent
stare
,
for
which
she
feel
intense
gratitude
;
for
nothing
so


solace
she
,
ease
she
of
the
perplexity
of
life
,
and
miraculously
raise


its
burden
,
as
this
sublime
power
,
this
heavenly
gift
,
and
one
would
no


more
disturb
it
,
while
it
last
,
than
break
up
the
shaft
of
sunlight
,


lie
level
across
the
floor
.




that
people
should
love
like
this
,
that
Mr.
Bankes
should
feel
this
for


Mrs.
Ramsey
 
she
glance
at
he
muse
 
be
helpful
,
be
exalt
.
she


wipe
one
brush
after
another
upon
a
piece
of
old
rag
,
menially
,
on


purpose
.
she
take
shelter
from
the
reverence
which
cover
all
woman
;
she


feel
herself
praise
.
let
he
gaze
;
she
would
steal
a
look
at
she


picture
.




she
could
have
weep
.
it
be
bad
,
it
be
bad
,
it
be
infinitely
bad
!
she


could
have
do
it
differently
of
course
;
the
colour
could
have
be


thin
and
fade
;
the
shape
etherealise
;
that
be
how
Paunceforte
would


have
see
it
.
but
then
she
do
not
see
it
like
that
.
she
see
the
colour


burn
on
a
framework
of
steel
;
the
light
of
a
butterfly
's
wing
lying


upon
the
arch
of
a
cathedral
.
of
all
that
only
a
few
random
mark


scrawl
upon
the
canvas
remain
.
and
it
would
never
be
see
;
never
be


hang
even
,
and
there
be
Mr.
Tansley
whisper
in
her
ear
,
"
woman
ca
n't


paint
,
woman
ca
n't
 
write
...
"




she
now
remember
what
she
have
be
go
to
say
about
Mrs.
Ramsay
.
she


do
not
know
how
she
would
have
put
it
;
but
it
would
have
be
something


critical
.
she
have
be
annoy
the
other
night
by
some
highhandedness
.


look
along
the
level
of
Mr.
Bankes
's
glance
at
she
,
she
think
that
no


woman
could
worship
another
woman
in
the
way
he
worship
;
they
could


only
seek
shelter
under
the
shade
which
Mr.
Bankes
extend
over
they
both
.


look
along
his
beam
she
add
to
it
her
different
ray
,
think
that


she
be
unquestionably
the
lovely
of
people
 
bow
over
her
book
;
the


well
perhaps
;
but
also
,
different
too
from
the
perfect
shape
which
one
see


there
.
but
why
different
,
and
how
different
?
she
ask
herself
,
scrape


her
palette
of
all
those
mound
of
blue
and
green
which
seem
to
she
like


clod
with
no
life
in
they
now
,
yet
she
vow
,
she
would
inspire
they
,


force
they
to
move
,
flow
,
do
her
bidding
tomorrow
.
how
do
she
differ
?


what
be
the
spirit
in
she
,
the
essential
thing
,
by
which
,
have
you
find
a


crumple
glove
in
the
corner
of
a
sofa
,
you
would
have
know
it
,
from
its


twisted
finger
,
hers
indisputably
?
she
be
like
a
bird
for
speed
,
an


arrow
for
directness
.
she
be
willful
;
she
be
command
 
of
course
,


Lily
remind
herself
,
I
be
think
of
her
relation
with
woman
,
and
I
be


much
young
,
an
insignificant
person
,
live
off
the
Brompton
Road
.
she


open
bedroom
window
.
she
shut
door
.
 
so
she
try
to
start
the
tune


of
Mrs.
Ramsay
in
her
head
.
 
arrive
late
at
night
,
with
a
light
tap
on


one
's
bedroom
door
,
wrap
in
an
old
fur
coat
 
for
the
setting
of
she


beauty
be
always
that
-
hasty
,
but
apt
,
she
would
enact
again
whatever
it


might
be
-
Charles
Tansley
lose
his
umbrella
;
Mr.
Carmichael
snuffle
and


sniff
;
Mr.
Bankes
say
,
"
the
vegetable
salt
be
lose
.
"
all
this
she


would
adroitly
shape
;
even
maliciously
twist
;
and
,
move
over
to
the


window
,
in
pretence
that
she
must
go
,
-
it
be
dawn
,
she
could
see
the
sun


rise
,
-
half
turn
back
,
more
intimately
,
but
still
always
laugh
,


insist
that
she
must
,
Minta
must
,
they
all
must
marry
,
since
in
the
whole


world
whatever
laurel
might
be
toss
to
her
 
but
Mrs.
Ramsay
care
not
a


fig
for
her
painting
,
or
triumph
win
by
her
 
probably
Mrs.
Ramsay
have


have
her
share
of
those
,
and
here
she
sadden
,
darken
,
and
come
back
to


her
chair
,
there
could
be
no
disputing
this
:
an
unmarried
woman
 
she


lightly
take
her
hand
for
a
moment
,
an
unmarried
woman
have
miss
the


good
of
life
.
the
house
seem
full
of
child
sleep
and
Mrs.
Ramsay


listen
;
shaded
light
and
regular
breathing
.




oh
,
but
,
Lily
would
say
,
there
be
her
father
;
her
home
;
even
,
have
she


dare
to
say
it
,
her
painting
.
but
all
this
seem
so
little
,
so


virginal
,
against
the
other
.
yet
,
as
the
night
wear
on
,
and
white
light


part
the
curtain
,
and
even
now
and
then
some
bird
chirp
in
the


garden
,
gather
a
desperate
courage
she
would
urge
her
own
exemption


from
the
universal
law
;
plead
for
it
;
she
like
to
be
alone
;
she
like
to


be
herself
;
she
be
not
make
for
that
;
and
so
have
to
meet
a
serious
stare


from
eye
of
unparalleled
depth
,
and
confront
Mrs.
Ramsay
's
simple


certainty
 
and
she
be
childlike
now
 
that
her
dear
Lily
,
her
little


Brisk
,
be
a
fool
.
then
,
she
remember
,
she
have
lay
her
head
on
Mrs.


Ramsay
's
lap
and
laugh
and
laugh
and
laugh
,
laugh
almost


hysterically
at
the
thought
of
Mrs.
Ramsay
preside
with
immutable
calm


over
destiny
which
she
completely
fail
to
understand
.
there
she
sit
,


simple
,
serious
.
she
have
recover
her
sense
of
her
now
-
this
be
the


glove
's
twisted
finger
.
but
into
what
sanctuary
have
one
penetrate
?


Lily
Briscoe
have
look
up
at
last
,
and
there
be
Mrs.
Ramsay
,
unwitte


entirely
what
have
cause
her
laughter
,
still
preside
,
but
now
with
every


trace
of
wilfulness
abolish
,
and
in
its
stead
,
something
clear
as
the


space
which
the
cloud
at
last
uncover
-
the
little
space
of
sky
which


sleep
beside
the
moon
.




be
it
wisdom
?
be
it
knowledge
?
be
it
,
once
more
,
the
deceptiveness
of


beauty
,
so
that
all
one
's
perception
,
half
way
to
truth
,
be
tangle
in


a
golden
mesh
?
or
do
she
lock
up
within
she
some
secret
which
certainly


Lily
Briscoe
believe
people
must
have
for
the
world
to
go
on
at
all
?


every
one
could
not
be
as
helter
skelter
,
hand
to
mouth
as
she
be
.
but


if
they
know
,
could
they
tell
one
what
they
know
?
sit
on
the
floor


with
her
arm
round
Mrs.
Ramsay
's
knee
,
close
as
she
could
get
,
smile


to
think
that
Mrs.
Ramsay
would
never
know
the
reason
of
that
pressure
,
she


imagine
how
in
the
chamber
of
the
mind
and
heart
of
the
woman
who
be
,


physically
,
touch
she
,
be
stand

there
hang
about

,

after
a

some
subtle
change
be
feel
in
the
person

have


dream
of
,

than
anything
she

the

,

an
august

;
the
shape
of
a
dome
.




this
ray
pass
level
with
Mr.
Bankes
's
ray
straight
to
Mrs.
Ramsay
sit


read
there
with
James
at
her
knee
.
but
now
while
she
still
look
,


Mr.
Bankes
have
do
.
he
have
put
on
his
spectacle
.
he
have
step
back
.


he
have
raise
his
hand
.
he
have
slightly
narrow
his
clear
blue
eye
,


when
lily
,
rouse
herself
,
see
what
he
be
at
,
and
wince
like
a
dog
who


see
a
hand
raise
to
strike
it
.
she
would
have
snatch
her
picture
off


the
easel
,
but
she
say
to
herself
,
one
must
.
she
brace
herself
to
stand


the
awful
trial
of
some
one
look
at
her
picture
.
one
must
,
she
say
,


one
must
.
and
if
it
must
be
see
,
Mr.
Bankes
be
less
alarming
than


another
.
but
that
any
other
eye
should
see
the
residue
of
she


thirty
-
three
year
,
the
deposit
of
each
day
's
living
mix
with
something


more
secret
than
she
have
ever
speak
or
show
in
the
course
of
all
those


day
be
an
agony
.
at
the
same
time
it
be
immensely
exciting
.




nothing
could
be
cool
and
quieter
.
take
out
a
pen
-
knife
,
Mr.
Bankes


tap
the
canvas
with
the
bone
handle
.
what
do
she
wish
to
indicate
by


the
triangular
purple
shape
,
"
just
there
"
?
he
ask
.




it
be
Mrs.
Ramsay
read
to
James
,
she
say
.
she
know
his
objection
-


that
no
one
could
tell
it
for
a
human
shape
.
but
she
have
make
no
attempt


at
likeness
,
she
say
.
for
what
reason
have
she
introduce
they
then
?
he


ask
.
why
indeed
?
-
except
that
if
there
,
in
that
corner
,
it
be
bright
,


here
,
in
this
,
she
feel
the
need
of
darkness
.
simple
,
obvious
,


commonplace
,
as
it
be
,
Mr.
Bankes
be
interested
.
mother
and
child


then
-
object
of
universal
veneration
,
and
in
this
case
the
mother
be


famous
for
her
beauty
-
might
be
reduce
,
he
ponder
,
to
a
purple
shadow


without
irreverence
.




but
the
picture
be
not
of
they
,
she
say
.
or
,
not
in
his
sense
.
there


be
other
sense
too
in
which
one
might
reverence
they
.
by
a
shadow
here


and
a
light
there
,
for
instance
.
her
tribute
take
that
form
if
,
as
she


vaguely
suppose
,
a
picture
must
be
a
tribute
.
a
mother
and
child
might


be
reduce
to
a
shadow
without
irreverence
.
a
light
here
require
a


shadow
there
.
he
consider
.
he
be
interested
.
he
take
it


scientifically
in
complete
good
faith
.
the
truth
be
that
all
his


prejudice
be
on
the
other
side
,
he
explain
.
the
large
picture
in


his
drawing
-
room
,
which
painter
have
praise
,
and
value
at
a
high
price


than
he
have
give
for
it
,
be
of
the
cherry
tree
in
blossom
on
the
bank


of
the
Kennet
.
he
have
spend
his
honeymoon
on
the
bank
of
the
Kennet
,
he


say
.
lily
must
come
and
see
that
picture
,
he
say
.
but
now
-
he
turn
,


with
his
glass
raise
to
the
scientific
examination
of
her
canvas
.
the


question
be
one
of
the
relation
of
masse
,
of
light
and
shadow
,


which
,
to
be
honest
,
he
have
never
consider
before
,
he
would
like
to
have


it
explain
-
what
then
do
she
wish
to
make
of
it
?
and
he
indicate
the


scene
before
they
.
she
look
.
she
could
not
show
he
what
she
wish
to


make
of
it
,
could
not
see
it
even
herself
,
without
a
brush
in
her
hand
.


she
take
up
once
more
her
old
painting
position
with
the
dim
eye
and
the


absent
-
minded
manner
,
subdue
all
her
impression
as
a
woman
to
something


much
more
general
;
become
once
more
under
the
power
of
that
vision
which


she
have
see
clearly
once
and
must
now
grope
for
among
hedge
and
house


and
mother
and
child
-
her
picture
.
it
be
a
question
,
she
remember
,


how
to
connect
this
mass
on
the
right
hand
with
that
on
the
left
.
she


might
do
it
by
bring
the
line
of
the
branch
across
so
;
or
break
the


vacancy
in
the
foreground
by
an
object
 
James
perhaps
 
so
.
but
the
danger


be
that
by
do
that
the
unity
of
the
whole
might
be
break
.
she


stop
;
she
do
not
want
to
bore
he
;
she
take
the
canvas
lightly
off
the


easel
.




but
it
have
be
see
;
it
have
be
take
from
she
.
this
man
have
share


with
she
something
profoundly
intimate
.
and
,
thank
Mr.
Ramsay
for
it


and
Mrs.
Ramsay
for
it
and
the
hour
and
the
place
,
credit
the
world
with


a
power
which
she
have
not
suspect
-
that
one
could
walk
away
down
that


long
gallery
not
alone
any
more
but
arm
in
arm
with
somebody
-
the


strange
feeling
in
the
world
,
and
the
most
exhilarating
-
she
nick


the
catch
of
her
paint
-
box
to
,
more
firmly
than
be
necessary
,
and
the


nick
seem
to
surround
in
a
circle
forever
the
paint
-
box
,
the
lawn
,


Mr.
Bankes
,
and
that
wild
villain
,
Cam
,
dash
past
.






10






for
Cam
graze
the
easel
by
an
inch
;
she
would
not
stop
for
Mr.
Bankes


and
Lily
Briscoe
;
though
Mr.
Bankes
,
who
would
have
like
a
daughter
of


his
own
,
hold
out
his
hand
;
she
would
not
stop
for
her
father
,
whom
she


graze
also
by
an
inch
;
nor
for
her
mother
,
who
call
"
Cam
!
I
want


you
a
moment
!
"
as
she
dash
past
.
she
be
off
like
a
bird
,
bullet
,
or


arrow
,
impel
by
what
desire
,
shoot
by
whom
,
at
what
direct
,
who


could
say
?
what
,
what
?
Mrs.
Ramsay
ponder
,
watch
she
.
it
might


be
a
vision
-
of
a
shell
,
of
a
wheelbarrow
,
of
a
fairy
kingdom
on
the


far
side
of
the
hedge
;
or
it
might
be
the
glory
of
speed
;
no
one
know
.


but
when
Mrs.
Ramsay
call
"
Cam
!
"
a
second
time
,
the
projectile
drop


in
mid
career
,
and
Cam
come
lag
back
,
pull
a
leaf
by
the
way
,
to


her
mother
.




what
be
she
dream
about
,
Mrs.
Ramsay
wonder
,
see
she
engross
,


as
she
stand
there
,
with
some
thought
of
her
own
,
so
that
she
have
to


repeat
the
message
twice
-
ask
Mildred
if
Andrew
,
Miss
Doyle
,
and
Mr.


Rayley
have
come
back
?
-
the
word
seem
to
be
drop
into
a
well
,


where
,
if
the
water
be
clear
,
they
be
also
so
extraordinarily


distort
that
,
even
as
they
descend
,
one
see
they
twist
about
to


make
Heaven
know
what
pattern
on
the
floor
of
the
child
's
mind
.
what


message
would
Cam
give
the
cook
?
Mrs.
Ramsay
wonder
.
and
indeed
it


be
only
by
wait
patiently
,
and
hear
that
there
be
an
old
woman
in


the
kitchen
with
very
red
cheek
,
drink
soup
out
of
a
basin
,
that


Mrs.
Ramsay
at
last
prompt
that
parrot
-
like
instinct
which
have
pick
up


Mildred
's
word
quite
accurately
and
could
now
produce
they
,
if
one


wait
,
in
a
colourless
singsong
.
shift
from
foot
to
foot
,
Cam


repeat
the
word
,
"
no
,
they
have
n't
,
and
I
've
 
tell
Ellen
to
clear
away


tea
.
"




Minta
Doyle
and
Paul
Rayley
have
not
come
back
then
.
that
could
only


mean
,
Mrs.
Ramsay
think
,
one
thing
.
she
must
accept
he
,
or
she
must


refuse
he
.
this
go
off
after
luncheon
for
a
walk
,
even
though


Andrew
be
with
they
-
what
could
it
mean
?
except
that
she
have
decide
,


rightly
,
Mrs.
Ramsay
think
 
and
she
be
very
,
very
fond
of
Minta
,
to


accept
that
good
fellow
,
who
might
not
be
brilliant
,
but
then
,
think


Mrs.
Ramsay
,
realise
that
James
be
tug
at
she
,
to
make
she
go
on


read
aloud
the
Fisherman
and
his
Wife
,
she
do
in
her
own
heart


infinitely
prefer
booby
to
clever
man
who
write
dissertation
;


Charles
Tansley
,
for
instance
.
anyhow
it
must
have
happen
,
one
way


or
the
other
,
by
now
.




but
she
read
,
"
next
morning
the
wife
awake
first
,
and
it
be
just


daybreak
,
and
from
her
bed
she
see
the
beautiful
country
lie
before


she
.
her
husband
be
still
stretch
himself
...
"




but
how
could
Minta
say
now
that
she
would
not
have
he
?
not
if
she


agree
to
spend
whole
afternoon
trapese
about
the
country
alone
-
for


Andrew
would
be
off
after
his
crab
-
but
possibly
Nancy
be
with
they
.


she
try
to
recall
the
sight
of
they
stand
at
the
hall
door
after


lunch
.
there
they
stand
,
look
at
the
sky
,
wonder
about
the


weather
,
and
she
have
say
,
think
partly
to
cover
their
shyness
,


partly
to
encourage
they
to
be
off
 
for
her
sympathy
be
with
Paul
,




"
there
be
n't
 
a
cloud
anywhere
within
mile
,
"
at
which
she
could
feel


little
Charles
Tansley
,
who
have
follow
they
out
,
snigger
.
but
she


do
it
on
purpose
.
whether
Nancy
be
there
or
not
,
she
could
not
be


certain
,
look
from
one
to
the
other
in
her
mind
's
eye
.




she
read
on
:
"
ah
,
wife
,
"
say
the
man
,
"
why
should
we
be
King
?
I
do


not
want
to
be
King
.
"
"
well
,
"
say
the
wife
,
"
if
you
wo
n't
 
be
King
,
I


will
;
go
to
the
Flounder
,
for
I
will
be
King
.
"




"
come
in
or
go
out
,
Cam
,
"
she
say
,
know
that
Cam
be
attract
only


by
the
word
"
Flounder
"
and
that
in
a
moment
she
would
fidget
and
fight


with
James
as
usual
.
Cam
shoot
off
.
Mrs.
Ramsay
go
on
reading
,


relieve
,
for
she
and
James
share
the
same
taste
and
be
comfortable


together
.




"
and
when
he
come
to
the
sea
,
it
be
quite
dark
grey
,
and
the
water
heave


up
from
below
,
and
smell
putrid
.
then
he
go
and
stand
by
it
and
say
,






'
flounder

the
Flounder

"
and
where
be


they
now
?
Mrs.
Ramsay
wonder
,
reading
and
thinking
,
quite
easily
,


both
at
the
same
time
;
for
the
story
of
the
Fisherman
and
his
Wife
be


like
the
bass
gently
accompany
a
tune
,
which
now
and
then
run
up


unexpectedly
into
the
melody
.
and
when
should
she
be
tell
?
if
nothing


happen
,
she
would
have
to
speak
seriously
to
Minta
.
for
she
could


not
go
trapese
about
all
over
the
country
,
even
if
Nancy
be
with


they
 
she
try
again
,
unsuccessfully
,
to
visualize
their
back
go


down
the
path
,
and
to
count
they
.
she
be
responsible
to
Minta
's


parent
-
the
Owl
and
the
Poker
.
her
nickname
for
they
shoot
into
she


mind
as
she
read
.
the
Owl
and
the
Poker
-
yes
,
they
would
be
annoy
if


they
hear
-
and
they
be
certain
to
hear
-
that
Minta
,
stay
with
the


Ramsays
,
have
be

etcetera
,

"
he
wear
a
wig
in


the
House
of
Commons
and
she
ably
assist
he
at
the
head
of
the


stair
,
"
she
repeat
,
fish
they
up
out
of
her
mind
by
a
phrase


which
,
come
back
from
some
party
,
she
have
make
to
amuse
her
husband
.


dear
,
dear
,
Mrs.
Ramsay
say
to
herself
,
how
do
they
produce
this


incongruous
daughter
?
this
tomboy
Minta
,
with
a
hole
in
her
stocking
?


how
do
she
exist
in
that
portentous
atmosphere
where
the
maid
be


always
remove
in
a
dust
-
pan
the
sand
that
the
parrot
have
scatter
,


and
conversation
be
almost
entirely
reduce
to
the
exploit
-
interesting


perhaps
,
but
limit
after
all
-
of
that
bird
?
naturally
,
one
have
ask


she
to
lunch
,
tea
,
dinner
,
finally
to
stay
with
they
up
at
Finlay
,
which


have
result
in
some
friction
with
the
Owl
,
her
mother
,
and
more
calling
,


and
more
conversation
,
and
more
sand
,
and
really
at
the
end
of
it
,
she
have


tell
enough
lie
about
parrot
to
last
she
a
lifetime
 
so
she
have
say


to
her
husband
that
night
,
come
back
from
the
party
.
however
,


Minta
come
...
yes
,
she
come
,
Mrs.
Ramsay
think
,
suspect
some
thorn


in
the
tangle
of
this
thought
;
and
disengage
it
find
it
to
be
this
:
a


woman
have
once
accuse
she
of
"
rob
she
of
her
daughter
's
affection
"
;


something
Mrs.
Doyle
have
say
make
she
remember
that
charge
again
.
wish


to
dominate
,
wish
to
interfere
,
make
people
do
what
she
wish
-
that


be
the
charge
against
she
,
and
she
think
it
most
unjust
.
how
could


she
help
be
"
like
that
"
to
look
at
?
no
one
could
accuse
she
of


take
pain
to
impress
.
she
be
often
ashamed
of
her
own
shabbiness
.


nor
be
she
domineering
,
nor
be
she
tyrannical
.
it
be
more
true


about
hospital
and
drain
and
the
dairy
.
about
thing
like
that
she


do
feel
passionately
,
and
would
,
if
she
have
the
chance
,
have
like
to


take
people
by
the
scruff
of
their
neck
and
make
they
see
.
no


hospital
on
the
whole
island
.
it
be
a
disgrace
.
milk
deliver
at


your
door
in
London
positively
brown
with
dirt
.
it
should
be
make


illegal
.
a
model
dairy
and
a
hospital
up
here
-
those
two
thing
she


would
have
like
to
do
,
herself
.
but
how
?
with
all
these
child
?


when
they
be
old
,
then
perhaps
she
would
have
time
;
when
they
be


all
at
school
.




oh
,
but
she
never
want
James
to
grow
a
day
old
!
or
Cam
either
.


these
two
she
would
have
like
to
keep
for
ever
just
as
they
be
,


demon
of
wickedness
,
angel
of
delight
,
never
to
see
they
grow
up
into


long
-
legged
monster
.
nothing
make
up
up
for
the
loss
.
when
she
read


just
now
to
James
,
"
and
there
be
number
of
soldier
with
kettledrum


and
trumpet
,
"
and
his
eye
darken
,
she
think
,
why
should
they
grow


up
and
lose
all
that
?
he
be
the
most
gifted
,
the
most
sensitive
of


her
child
.
but
all
,
she
think
,
be
full
of
promise
.
prue
,
a


perfect
angel
with
the
other
,
and
sometimes
now
,
at
night
especially
,


she
take
one
's
breath
away
with
her
beauty
.
Andrew
-
even
her
husband


admit
that
his
gift
for
mathematic
be
extraordinary
.
and
Nancy


and
Roger
,
they
be
both
wild
creature
now
,
scamper
about
over
the


country
all
day
long
.
as
for
Rose
,
her
mouth
be
too
big
,
but
she
have


a
wonderful
gift
with
her
hand
.
if
they
have
charade
,
Rose
make
the


dress
;
make
everything
;
like
good
arrange
table
,
flower
,


anything
.
she
do
not
like
it
that
Jasper
should
shoot
bird
;
but
it


be
only
a
stage
;
they
all
go
through
stage
.
why
,
she
ask
,


press
her
chin
on
James
's
head
,
should
they
grow
up
so
fast
?
why


should
they
go
to
school
?
she
would
have
like
always
to
have
have
a


baby
.
she
be
happiest
carry
one
in
her
arm
.
then
people
might


say
she
be
tyrannical
,
domineering
,
masterful
,
if
they
choose
;
she
do


not
mind
.
and
,
touch
his
hair
with
her
lip
,
she
think
,
he
will


never
be
so
happy
again
,
but
stop
herself
,
remember
how
it


anger
her
husband
that
she
should
say
that
.
still
,
it
be
true
.
they


be
happy
now
than
they
would
ever
be
again
.
a
tenpenny
tea
set


make
Cam
happy
for
day
.
she
hear
they
stamp
and
crow
on
the


floor
above
her
head
the
moment
they
awake
.
they
come
bustle
along


the
passage
.
then
the
door
spring
open
and
in
they
come
,
fresh
as


rose
,
stare
,
wide
awake
,
as
if
this
come
into
the
dining
-
room


after
breakfast
,
which
they
do
every
day
of
their
life
,
be
a


positive
event
to
they
,
and
so
on
,
with
one
thing
after
another
,
all


day
long
,
until
she
go
up
to
say
good
-
night
to
they
,
and
find
they


net
in
their
cot
like
bird
among
cherry
and
raspberry
,
still


make
up
story
about
some
little
bit
of
rubbish
-
something
they
have


hear
,
something
they
have
pick
up
in
the
garden
.
they
all
have
their


little
treasure
...
and
so
she
go
down
and
say
to
her
husband
,
why


must
they
grow
up
and
lose
it
all
?
never
will
they
be
so
happy
again
.


and
he
be
angry
.
why
take
such
a
gloomy
view
of
life
?
he
say
.
it


be
not
sensible
.
for
it
be
odd
;
and
she
believe
it
to
be
true
;
that


with
all
his
gloom
and
desperation
he
be
happy
,
more
hopeful
on
the


whole
,
than
she
be
.
less
expose
to
human
worry
-
perhaps
that
be


it
.
he
have
always
his
work
to
fall
back
on
.
not
that
she
herself
be


"
pessimistic
,
"
as
he
accuse
she
of
be
.
only
she
think
life
-
and


a
little
strip
of
time
present
itself
to
her
eye
-
her
fifty


year
.
there
it
be
before
she
-
life
.
life
,
she
think
-
but
she
do


not
finish
her
thought
.
she
take
a
look
at
life
,
for
she
have
a
clear


sense
of
it
there
,
something
real
,
something
private
,
which
she
share


neither
with
her
child
nor
with
her
husband
.
a
sort
of
transaction


go
on
between
they
,
in
which
she
be
on
one
side
,
and
life
be
on


another
,
and
she
be
always
try
to
get
the
well
of
it
,
as
it
be


of
she
;
and
sometimes
they
parley
 
when
she
sit
alone
;
there
be
,


she
remember
,
great
reconciliation
scene
;
but
for
the
most
part
,


oddly
enough
,
she
must
admit
that
she
feel
this
thing
that
she
call


life
terrible
,
hostile
,
and
quick
to
pounce
on
you
if
you
give
it
a


chance
.
there
be
eternal
problem
:
suffering
;
death
;
the
poor
.
there


be
always
a
woman
die
of
cancer
even
here
.
and
yet
she
have
say
to


all
these
child
,
you
shall
go
through
it
all
.
to
eight
people
she


have
say
relentlessly
that
 
and
the
bill
for
the
greenhouse
would
be


fifty
pound
.
for
that
reason
,
know
what
be
before
they
-
love
and


ambition
and
be
wretche
alone
in
dreary
place
-
she
have
often
the


feeling
,
why
must
they
grow
up
and
lose
it
all
?
and
then
she
say
to


herself
,
brandish
her
sword
at
life
,
Nonsense
.
they
will
be


perfectly
happy
.
and
here
she
be
,
she
reflect
,
feel
life
rather


sinister
again
,
make
Minta
marry
Paul
Rayley
;
because
whatever
she


might
feel
about
her
own
transaction
,
she
have
have
experience

the
whitening
of
the

the
leave

together

rouse


in
she
a
feeling
of
anxiety

what
it

that

he

go
to

that

he
would
climb
out
on
to
a
rock
;
he
would
be
cut
off

come
back
single
file
on
one
of
those
little
path
above
the
cliff


one
of
they
might
slip
.
he
would
roll
and
then
crash
.
it
be
grow


quite
dark
.




but
she
do
not

voice
change
in
the

as
she
finish
the


story

add
,
shut
the
book
,
and
speak
the
last
word
as
if


she
have
make
they
up
herself
,
look
into
James
's
eye
:
"
and
there


they
be
live
still
at
this
very
time
.
"




"
and
that
be
the
end
,

she
say
,
and
she
see
in
his
eye
,
as
the


interest
of
the
story
die
away
in
they
,
something
else
take
its
place
;


something
wonder
,
pale
,
like
the
reflection
of
a
light
,
which
at


once
make
he
gaze
and
marvel
.
turn
,
she
look
across
the
bay
,
and


there
,
sure
enough
,
come
regularly
across
the
wave
first
two
quick


stroke
and
then
one
long
steady
stroke
,
be
the
light
of
the


lighthouse
.
it
have
be
light
.




in
a
moment
he
would
ask
she
,
"
be
we
go
to
the
lighthouse
?
"
and


she
would
have
to
say
,
"
no
:
not
tomorrow
;
your
father
say
not
.
"


happily
,
Mildred
come
in
to
fetch
they
,
and
the
bustle
distract
they
.


but
he
keep
look
back
over
his
shoulder
as
Mildred
carry
he
out
,


and
she
be
certain
that
he
be
think
,
we
be
not
go
to
the


lighthouse
tomorrow
;
and
she
think
,
he
will
remember
that
all
his


life
.




11




no
,
she
think
,
put
together
some
of
the
picture
he
have
cut
out
-


a
refrigerator
,
a
mow
machine
,
a
gentleman
in
evening
dress
-


child
never
forget
.
for
this
reason
,
it
be
so
important
what
one


say
,
and
what
one
do
,
and
it
be
a
relief
when
they
go
to
bed
.
for


now
she
need
not
think
about
anybody
.
she
could
be
herself
,
by


herself
.
and
that
be
what
now
she
often
feel
the
need
of
-
to
think
;


well
,
not
even
to
think
.
to
be
silent
;
to
be
alone
.
all
the
being
and


the
do
,
expansive
,
glitter
,
vocal
,
evaporate
;
and
one
shrink
,


with
a
sense
of
solemnity
,
to
be
oneself
,
a
wedge
-
shape
core
of


darkness
,
something
invisible
to
other
.
although
she
continue
to


knit
,
and
sit
upright
,
it
be
thus
that
she
feel
herself
;
and
this
self


having
shed
its
attachment
be
free
for
the
strange
adventure
.
when


life
sink
down
for
a
moment
,
the
range
of
experience
seem
limitless
.


and
to
everybody
there
be
always
this
sense
of
unlimited
resource
,


she
suppose
;
one
after
another
,
she
,
Lily
,
Augustus
Carmichael
,
must


feel
,
our
apparition
,
the
thing
you
know
we
by
,
be
simply
childish
.


beneath
it
be
all
dark
,
it
be
all
spread
,
it
be
unfathomably
deep
;


but
now
and
again
we
rise
to
the
surface
and
that
be
what
you
see
we


by
.
her
horizon
seem
to
her
limitless
.
there
be
all
the
place


she
have
not
see
;
the
indian
plain
;
she
feel
herself
push
aside
the


thick
leather
curtain
of
a
church
in
Rome
.
this
core
of
darkness
could


go
anywhere
,
for
no
one
see
it
.
they
could
not
stop
it
,
she
think
,


exult
.
there
be
freedom
,
there
be
peace
,
there
be
,
most


welcome
of
all
,
a
summon
together
,
a
resting
on
a
platform


of
stability
.
not
as
oneself
do
one
find
rest
ever
,
in
her
experience


 
she
accomplish
here
something
dexterous
with
her
needle
 
but
as
a


wedge
of
darkness
.
lose
personality
,
one
lose
the
fret
,
the
hurry
,


the
stir
;
and
there
rise
to
her
lip
always
some
exclamation
of
triumph


over
life
when
thing
come
together
in
this
peace
,
this
rest
,
this


eternity
;
and
pause
there
she
look
out
to
meet
that
stroke
of
the


lighthouse
,
the
long
steady
stroke
,
the
last
of
the
three
,
which
be


her
stroke
,
for
watch
they
in
this
mood
always
at
this
hour
one


could
not
help
attach
oneself
to
one
thing
especially
of
the
thing


one
see
;
and
this
thing
,
the
long
steady
stroke
,
be
her
stroke
.
often


she
find
herself
sit
and
look
,
sit
and
look
,
with
she


work
in
her
hand
until
she
become
the
thing
she
look
at
-
that
light
,


for
example
.
and
it
would
lift
up
on
it
some
little
phrase
or
other


which
have
be
lie
in
her
mind
like
that
-
"
child
do
n't
 
forget
,


child
do
n't
 
forget
"
-
which
she
would
repeat
and
begin
add
to
it
,


it
will
end
,
it
will
end
,
she
say
.
it
will
come
,
it
will
come
,
when


suddenly
she
add
,
we
be
in
the
hand
of
the
Lord
.




but
instantly
she
be
annoy
with
herself
for
say
that
.
who
have


say
it
?
not
she
;
she
have
be
trap
into
say
something
she
do


not
mean
.
she
look
up
over
her
knitting
and
meet
the
third
stroke
and


it
seem
to
she
like
her
own
eye
meet
her
own
eye
,
search
as


she
alone
could
search
into
her
mind
and
her
heart
,
purify
out
of


existence
that
lie
,
any
lie
.
she
praise
herself
in
praise
the


light
,
without
vanity
,
for
she
be
stern
,
she
be
search
,
she
be


beautiful
like
that
light
.
it
be
odd
,
she
think
,
how
if
one
be


alone
,
one
leant
to
inanimate
thing
;
tree
,
stream
,
flower
;
feel


they
express
one
;
feel
they
become
one
;
feel
they
know
one
,
in
a


sense
be
one
;
feel
an
irrational
tenderness
thus
 
she
look
at
that


long
steady
light
 
as
for
oneself
.
there
rise
,
and
she
look
and


look
with
her
needle
suspend
,
there
curl
up
off
the
floor
of
the


mind
,
rise
from
the
lake
of
one
be
being
,
a
mist
,
a
bride
to
meet
she


lover
.




what
bring
she
to
say
that
:
"
we
be
in
the
hand
of
the
Lord
?
"
she


wonder
.
the
insincerity
slip
in
among
the
truth
rouse
she
,


annoy
she
.
she
return
to
she
knitting
again
.
how
could
any
Lord


have
make
this
world
?
she
ask
.
with
her
mind
she
have
always
seize


the
fact
that
there
be
no
reason
,
order
,
justice
:
but
suffering
,
death
,


the
poor
.
there
be
no
treachery
too
base
for
the
world
to
commit
;
she


know
that
.
no
happiness
last
;
she
know
that
.
she
knit
with
firm


composure
,
slightly
purse
her
lip
and
,
without
be
aware
of
it
,
so


stiffen
and
compose
the
line
of
her
face
in
a
habit
of
sternness


that
when
her
husband
pass
,
though
he
be
chuckle
at
the
thought


that
Hume
,
the
philosopher
,
grow
enormously
fat
,
have
stick
in
a
bog
,


he
could
not
help
note
,
as
he
pass
,
the
sternness
at
the
heart
of


her
beauty
.
it
sadden
he
,
and
her
remoteness
pain
he
,
and
he


feel
,
as
he
pass
,
that
he
could
not
protect
she
,
and
,
when
he
reach


the
hedge
,
he
be
sad
.
he
could
do
nothing
to
help
she
.
he
must
stand


by
and
watch
she
.
indeed
,
the
infernal
truth
be
,
he
make
thing
bad


for
she
.
he
be
irritable
-
he
be
touchy
.
he
have
lose
his
temper
over


the
lighthouse
.
he
look
into
the
hedge
,
into
its
intricacy
,
its


darkness
.




always
,
Mrs.
Ramsay
feel
,
one
help
oneself
out
of
solitude
reluctantly


by
lay
hold
of
some
little
odd
or
end
,
some
sound
,
some
sight
.
she


listen
,
but
it
be
all
very
still
;
cricket
be
over
;
the
child


be
in
their
bath
;
there
be
only
the
sound
of
the
sea
.
she
stop


knitting
;
she
hold
the
long
reddish
-
brown
stocking
dangle
in
she


hand
a
moment
.
she
see
the
light
again
.
with
some
irony
in
she


interrogation
,
for
when
one
wake
at
all
,
one
's
relation
change
,
she


look
at
the
steady
light
,
the
pitiless
,
the
remorseless
,
which
be
so


much
she
,
yet
so
little
she
,
which
have
she
at
its
beck
and
call
 
she


wake
in
the
night
and
see
it
bend
across
their
bed
,
stroke
the


floor
,
but
for
all
that
she
think
,
watch
it
with
fascination
,


hypnotise
,
as
if
it
be
stroke
with
its

,
and


the

go
out
of
the

it
roll
in
wave
of
pure
lemon
which


curve
and
swell
and
break
upon
the
beach
and
the
ecstasy

in


her
eye
and
wave
of
pure
delight
race
over
the
floor
of

he
would
let
she

and
he
pass

though
it
hurt

look
so
distant
,
and
he
could
not
reach
she
,
he
could
do
nothing

Mr.

.
"

Mrs.

"

Mrs.

it
be
about
the
influence
of
somebody
upon
something
.


"

it
be
all
he
have
to
count
on

Mr.

.
"

Heaven

he
'd
disinherit

Mr.

.
he
do
not
look
at
the
flower
,


which
his
wife
be
consider
,
but
at
a
spot
about
a
foot
or


so
above
they
.
there
be
no
harm
in
he
,
he
add
,
and
be
just


about
to
say
that
anyhow
he
be
the
only
young
man
in
England
who


admire
his
-
when
he

but


then
these
she
have
put
in
with
her
own
hand
,
say
Mrs.
Ramsay
.
the


question
be
,
what
happen
if
she
send
bulb
down
;
do
Kennedy
plant


they
?
it
be
his
incurable
laziness
;
she
add
,
move
on
.
if
she


stand
over
he
all
day
long
with
a
spade
in
her
hand
,
he
do
sometimes


do
a
stroke
of
work
.
so
they
stroll
along
,
towards
the
red

hot


poker

.
"

look


tonight
,
"

Mrs.

.
they
pause
.
he
wish
Andrew
could
be


induce
to
work
hard
.
he
would
lose
every
chance
of
a
scholarship
if


he
do
n't
.
"
oh
,
scholarship
!
"
she
say
.
Mr.
Ramsay
think
her
foolish


for
say
that
,
about
a
serious
thing
,
like
a
scholarship
.
he
should


be
very
proud
of
Andrew
if
he
get
a
scholarship
,
he
say
.
she
would
be


just
as
proud
of
he
if
he
do
n't
,
she
answer
.
they
disagree
always


about
this
,
but
it
do
not
matter
.
she
like
he
to
believe
in


scholarship
,
and
he
like
she
to
be
proud
of
Andrew
whatever
he
do
.


suddenly
she
remember
those
little
path
on
the
edge
of
the
cliff
.




be
n't
 
it
late
?
she
ask
.
they
have
n't
 
come
home
yet
.
he
flick
his


watch
carelessly
open
.
but
it
be
only
just
past
seven
.
he
hold
his


watch
open
for
a
moment
,
decide
that
he
would
tell
she
what
he
have


feel
on
the
terrace
.
to
begin
with
,
it
be
not
reasonable
to
be
so


nervous
.
Andrew
could
look
after
himself
.
then
,
he
want
to
tell
she


that
when
he
be
walk
on
the
terrace
just
now
-
here
he
become


uncomfortable
,
as
if
he
be
break
into
that
solitude
,
that


aloofness
,
that
remoteness
of
hers
.
but
she
press
he
.
what
have


he
want
to
tell
she
,
she
ask
,
think
it
be
about
go
to
the


lighthouse
;
that
he
be
sorry
he
have
say
"
damn
you
.
"
but
no
.
he
do


not
like
to
see
her
look
so
sad
,
he
say
.
only
wool
gathering
,
she


protest
,
flush
a
little
.
they
both
feel
uncomfortable
,
as
if
they


do
not
know
whether
to
go
on
or
go
back
.
she
have
be
read
fairy


tale
to
James
,
she
say
.
no
,
they
could
not
share
that
;
they
could


not
say
that
.




they
have
reach
the
gap
between
the
two
clump
of
red
-
hot
poker
,
and


there
be
the
lighthouse
again
,
but
she
would
not
let
herself
look
at


it
.
have
she
know
that
he
be
look
at
she
,
she
think
,
she
would


not
have
let
herself
sit
there
,
think
.
she
dislike
anything
that


remind
she
that
she
have
be
see
sit
think
.
so
she
look


over
her
shoulder
,
at
the
town
.
the
light
be
ripple
and
run


as
if
they
be
drop
of
silver
water
hold
firm
in
a
wind
.
and
all
the


poverty
,
all
the
suffering
have
turn
to
that
,
Mrs.
Ramsay
think
.
the


light
of
the
town
and
of
the
harbour
and
of
the
boat
seem
like
a


phantom
net
float
there
to
mark
something
which
have
sink
.
well
,
if


he
could
not
share
her
thought
,
Mr.
Ramsay
say
to
himself
,
he
would
be


off
,
then
,
on
his
own
.
he
want
to
go
on
thinking
,
tell
himself
the


story
how
Hume
be
stick
in
a
bog
;
he
want
to
laugh
.
but
first
it


be
nonsense
to
be
anxious
about
Andrew
.
when
he
be
Andrew
's
age
he


use
to
walk
about
the
country
all
day
long
,
with
nothing
but
a
biscuit


in
his
pocket
and
nobody
bother
about
he
,
or
think
that
he
have


fall
over
a
cliff
.
he
say
aloud
he
think
he
would
be
off
for
a


day
's
walk
if
the
weather
hold
.
he
have
have
about
enough
of
Bankes
and


of
Carmichael
.
he
would
like
a
little
solitude
.
yes
,
she
say
.
it


annoy
he
that
she
do
not
protest
.
she
know
that
he
would
never
do


it
.
he
be
too
old
now
to
walk
all
day
long
with
a
biscuit
in
his


pocket
.
she
worry
about
the
boy
,
but
not
about
he
.
year
ago
,


before
he
have
marry
,
he
think
,
look
across
the
bay
,
as
they


stand
between
the
clump
of
red
-
hot
poker
,
he
have
walk
all
day
.
he


have
make
a
meal
off
bread
and
cheese
in
a
public
house
.
he
have
work


ten
hour
at
a
stretch
;
an
old
woman
just
pop
her
head
in
now
and


again
and
see
to
the
fire
.
that
be
the
country
he
like
good
,
over


there
;
those
sandhill
dwindle
away
into
darkness
.
one
could
walk


all
day
without
meet
a
soul
.
there
be
not
a
house
scarcely
,
not
a


single
village
for
mile
on
end
.
one
could
worry
thing
out
alone
.


there
be
little
sandy
beach
where
no
one
have
be
since
the


beginning
of
time
.
the
seal
sit
up
and
look
at
you
.
it
sometimes


seem
to
he
that
in
a
little
house
out
there
,
alone
-
he
break
off
,


sigh
.
he
have
no
right
.
the
father
of
eight
child
-
he
remind


himself
.
and
he
would
have
be
a
beast
and
a
cur
to
wish
a
single


thing
alter
.
Andrew
would
be
a
well
man
than
he
have
be
.
prue


would
be
a
beauty
,
her
mother
say
.
they
would
stem
the
flood
a
bit
.


that
be
a
good
bit
of
work
on
the
whole
-
his
eight
child
.
they


show
he
do
not
damn
the
poor
little
universe
entirely
,
for
on
an


evening
like
this
,
he
think
,
look
at
the
land
dwindle
away
,
the


little
island
seem
pathetically
small
,
half
swallow
up
in
the
sea
.




"
poor
little
place
,
"
he
murmur
with
a
sigh
.




she
hear
he
.
he
say
the
most
melancholy
thing
,
but
she
notice


that
directly
he
have
say
they
he
always
seem
more
cheerful
than


usual
.
all
this
phrase
-
making
be
a
game
,
she
think
,
for
if
she
have


say
half
what
he
say
,
she
would
have
blow
her
brain
out
by
now
.




it
annoy
she
,
this
phrase
-
making
,
and
she
say
to
he
,
in
a
matter-


of
-
fact
way
,
that
it
be
a
perfectly
lovely
evening
.
and
what
be
he


groan
about
,
she
ask
,
half
laugh
,
half
complain
,
for
she


guess
what
he
be
think
-
he
would
have
write
well
book
if
he


have
not
marry
.




he
be
not
complain
,
he
say
.
she
know
that
he
do
not
complain
.


she
know
that
he
have
nothing
whatever
to
complain
of
.
and
he
seize


her
hand
and
raise
it
to
his
lip
and
kiss
it
with
an
intensity
that


bring
the
tear
to
her
eye
,
and
quickly
he
drop
it
.




they
turn
away
from
the
view
and
begin
to
walk
up
the
path
where
the


silver
-
green
spear
-
like
plant
grow
,
arm
in
arm
.
his
arm
be
almost


like
a
young
man
's
arm
,
Mrs.
Ramsay
think
,
thin
and
hard
,
and
she


think
with
delight
how
strong
he
still
be
,
though
he
be
over
sixty
,


and
how
untamed
and
optimistic
,
and
how
strange
it
be
that
be


convince
,
as
he
be
,
of
all
sort
of
horror
,
seem
not
to
depress


he
,
but
to
cheer
he
.
be
it
not
odd
,
she
reflect
?
indeed
he


seem
to
she
sometimes
make
differently
from
other
people
,
bear
blind
,


deaf
,
and
dumb
,
to
the
ordinary
thing
,
but
to
the
extraordinary


thing
,
with
an
eye
like
an
eagle
's
.
his
understanding
often


astonish
she
.
but
do
he
notice
the
flower
?
no
.
do
he
notice
the


view
?
no
.
do
he
even
notice
his
own
daughter
's
beauty
,
or
whether


there
be
pudding
on
his
plate
or
roast
beef
?
he
would
sit
at
table


with
they
like
a
person
in
a
dream
.
and
his
habit
of
talk
aloud
,
or


say
poetry
aloud
,
be
grow
on
he
,
she
be
afraid
;
for
sometimes


it
be
awkward
-






good
and
bright
come
away
!






poor
Miss
Giddings
,
when
he
shout
that
at
she
,
almost
jump
out
of


her
skin
.
but
then
,
Mrs.
Ramsay
,
though
instantly
take
his
side


against
all
the
silly
Giddingses
in
the
world
,
then
,
she
think
,


intimate
by
a
little
pressure
on
his
arm
that
he
walk
up
hill
too


fast
for
she
,
and
she
must
stop
for
a
moment
to
see
whether
those
be


fresh
molehill
on
the
bank
,
then
,
she
think
,
stoop
down
to
look
,


a
great
mind
like
his
must
be
different
in
every
way
from
ours
.
all


the
great
man
she
have
ever
know
,
she
think
,
decide
that
a
rabbit


must
have
get
in
,
be
like
that
,
and
it
be
good
for
young
man
 
though


the
atmosphere
of
lecture
-
room
be
stuffy
and
depress
to
she
beyond


endurance
almost
 
simply
to
hear
he
,
simply
to
look
at
he
.
but


without
shoot
rabbit
,
how
be
one
to
keep
they
down
?
she
wonder
.


it
might
be
a
rabbit
;
it
might
be
a
mole
.
some
creature
anyhow
be


ruin
her
Evening
Primroses
.
and
look
up
,
she
see
above
the
thin


tree
the
first
pulse
of
the
full
-
throbbing
star
,
and
want
to
make


her
husband
look
at
it
;
for
the
sight
give
she
such
keen
pleasure
.
but


she
stop
herself
.
he
never
look
at
thing
.
if
he
do
,
all
he


would
say
would
be
,
poor
little
world
,
with
one
of
his
sigh
.




at
that
moment
,
he
say
,
"
very
fine
,
"
to
please
she
,
and
pretend
to


admire
the
flower
.
but
she
know
quite
well
that
he
do
not
admire


they
,
or
even
realise
that
they
be
there
.
it
be
only
to
please


she
.
ah
,
but
be
that
not
Lily
Briscoe
stroll
along
with
William


Bankes
?
she
focusse
her
short
-
sighted
eye
upon
the
back
of
a


retreat
couple
.
yes
,
indeed
it
be
.
do
that
not
mean
that
they


would
marry
?
yes
,
it
must
!
what
an
admirable
idea
!
they
must
marry
!




13




he
have
be
to
Amsterdam
,
Mr.
Bankes
be
say
as
he
stroll
across


the
lawn
with
Lily
Briscoe
.
he
have
see
the
Rembrandts
.
he
have
be
to


Madrid
.
unfortunately
,
it
be
good
Friday
and
the
Prado
be
shut
.
he


have
be
to
Rome
.
have
Miss
Briscoe
never
be
to
Rome
?
oh
,
she


should
-
it
would
be
a
wonderful
experience
for
she
-
the
Sistine


chapel
;
Michael
Angelo
;
and
Padua
,
with
its
Giottos
.
his
wife
have
be


in
bad
health
for
many
year
,
so
that
their
sight
-
seeing
have
be
on
a


modest
scale
.




she
have
be
to
Brussels
;
she
have
be
to
Paris
but
only
for
a
flying


visit
to
see
an
aunt
who
be
ill
.
she
have
be
to
Dresden
;
there
be


masse
of
picture
she
have
not
see
;
however
,
Lily
Briscoe
reflect
,


perhaps
it
be
well
not
to
see
picture
:
they
only
make
one


hopelessly
discontent
with
one
's
own
work
.
Mr.
Bankes
think
one


could
carry
that
point
of
view
too
far
.
we
ca
n't
 
all
be
Titians
and
we


ca
n't
 
all
be
darwin
,
he
say
;
at
the
same
time
he
doubt
whether
you


could
have
your
Darwin
and
your
Titian
if
it
be
n't
 
for
humble
people


like
ourselves
.
Lily
would
have
like
to
pay
he
a
compliment
;
you
be


not
humble
,
Mr.
Bankes
,
she
would
have
like
to
have
say
.
but
he
do


not
want
compliment
 
most
man
do
,
she
think
,
and
she
be
a
little


ashamed
of
her
impulse
and
say
nothing
while
he
remark
that
perhaps


what
he
be
say
do
not
apply
to
picture
.
anyhow
,
say
Lily
,


toss
off
her
little
insincerity
,
she
would
always
go
on
painting
,


because
it
interest
she
.
yes
,
say
Mr.
Bankes
,
he
be
sure
she
would
,


and
,
as
they
reach
the
end
of
the
lawn
he
be
ask
she
whether
she


have
difficulty
in
find
subject
in
London
when
they
turn
and
see


the
Ramsays
.
so
that
be
marriage
,
Lily
think
,
a
man
and
a
woman


look
at
a
girl
throw
a
ball
.
that
be
what
Mrs.
Ramsay
try
to


tell
I
the
other
night
,
she
think
.
for
she
be
wear
a
green


shawl
,
and
they
be
stand
close
together
watch
Prue
and


jasper
throw
catch
.
and
suddenly
the
meaning
which
,
for
no


reason
at
all
,
as
perhaps
they
be
step
out
of
the
Tube
or


ring
a
doorbell
,
descend
on
people
,
make
they
symbolical
,


make
they
representative
,
come
upon
they
,
and
make
they
in
the
dusk


stand
,
look
,
the
symbol
of
marriage
,
husband
and
wife
.
then
,


after
an
instant
,
the
symbolical
outline
which
transcend
the
real


figure
sink
down
again
,
and
they
become
,
as
they
meet
they
,
Mr.
and
Mrs.


ramsay
watch
the
child
throw
catch
.
but
still
for
a
moment
,


though
Mrs.
Ramsay
greet
they
with
her
usual
smile
 
oh
,
she
be
think


we
be
go
to
get
marry
,
Lily
think
 
and
say
,
"
I
have
triumph


tonight
,
"
mean
that
for
once
Mr.
Bankes
have
agree
to
dine
with
they


and
not
run
off
to
his
own
lodge
where
his
man
cook
vegetable


properly
;
still
,
for
one
moment
,
there
be
a
sense
of
thing
have


be
blow
apart
,
of
space
,
of
irresponsibility
as
the
ball
soar


high
,
and
they
follow
it
and
lose
it
and
see
the
one
star
and
the


drape
branch
.
in
the
fail
light
they
all
look
sharp
-
edge
and


ethereal
and
divide
by
great
distance
.
then
,
dart
backwards
over


the
vast
space
 
for
it
seem
as
if
solidity
have
vanish
altogether
,


Prue
run
full
tilt
into
they
and
catch
the
ball
brilliantly
high
up
in


her
left
hand
,
and
her
mother
say
,
"
have
n't
 
they
come
back
yet
?
"


whereupon
the
spell
be
break
.
Mr.
Ramsay
feel
free
now
to
laugh
out


loud
at
the
thought
that
Hume
have
stick
in
a
bog
and
an
old
woman


rescue
he
on
condition
he
say
the
Lord
's
Prayer
,
and
chuckle
to


himself
he
stroll
off
to
his
study
.
Mrs.
Ramsay
,
bring
Prue
back


into
throw
catch
again
,
from
which
she
have
escape
,
ask
,




"
do
Nancy
go
with
they
?
"




14




 
certainly
,
Nancy
have
go
with
they
,
since
Minta
Doyle
have
ask
it


with
her
dumb
look
,
hold
out
her
hand
,
as
Nancy
make
off
,
after


lunch
,
to
her
attic
,
to
escape
the
horror
of
family
life
.
she


suppose
she
must
go
then
.
she
do
not
want
to
go
.
she
do
not
want
to


be
draw
into
it
all
.
for
as
they
walk
along
the
road
to
the
cliff


Minta
keep
on
take
her
hand
.
then
she
would
let
it
go
.
then
she


would
take
it
again
.
what
be
it
she
want
?
Nancy
ask
herself
.


there
be
something
,
of
course
,
that
people
want
;
for
when
Minta
take


her
hand
and
hold
it
,
Nancy
,
reluctantly
,
see
the
whole
world
spread


out
beneath
she
,
as
if
it
be
Constantinople
see
through
a
mist
,
and


then
,
however
heavy
-
eyed
one
might
be
,
one
must
need
ask
,
"
be
that


Santa
Sofia
?
"
"
be
that
the
Golden
Horn
?
"
so
Nancy
ask
,
when
Minta


take
her
hand
.
"
what
be
it
that
she
want
?
be
it
that
?
"
and
what
be


that
?
here
and
there
emerge
from
the
mist
 
as
Nancy
look
down
upon


life
spread
beneath
her
 
a
pinnacle
,
a
dome
;
prominent
thing
,
without


name
.
but
when
Minta
drop
her
hand
,
as
she
do
when
they
run
down


the
hillside
,
all
that
,
the
dome
,
the
pinnacle
,
whatever
it
be
that


have
protrude
through
the
mist
,
sink
down
into
it
and
disappear
.


Minta
,
Andrew
observe
,
be
rather
a
good
walker
.
she
wear
more


sensible
clothe
that
most
woman
.
she
wear
very
short
skirt
and
black


knickerbocker
.
she
would
jump
straight
into
a
stream
and
flounder


across
.
he
like
her
rashness
,
but
he
see
that
it
would
not
do
-
she


would
kill
herself
in
some
idiotic
way
one
of
these
day
.
she
seem


to
be
afraid
of
nothing
-
except
bull
.
at
the
mere
sight
of
a
bull
in


a
field
she
would
throw
up
her
arm
and
fly
scream
,
which
be
the


very
thing
to
enrage
a
bull
of
course
.
but
she
do
not
mind
own
up


to
it
in
the
least
;
one
must
admit
that
.
she
know
she
be
an
awful


coward
about
bull
,
she
say
.
she
think
she
must
have
be
toss
in


her
perambulator
when
she
be
a
baby
.
she
do
n't
 
seem
to
mind
what
she


say
or
do
.
suddenly
now
she
pitch
down
on
the
edge
of
the
cliff


and
begin
to
sing
some
song
about






damn
your
eye
,
damn
your
eye
.






they
all
have
to
join
in
and
sing
the
chorus
,
and
shout
out
together
:






damn
your
eye
,
damn
your
eye
,






but
it
would
be
fatal
to
let
the
tide
come
in
and
cover
up
all
the
good


hunting
-
ground
before
they
get
on
to
the
beach
.




"
fatal
,
"
Paul
agree
,
spring
up
,
and
as
they
went
slither
down
,


he
keep
quote
the
guide
-
book
about
"
these
island
be
justly


celebrate
for
their
park
-
like
prospect
and
the
extent

variety
of


their
marine
curiosity
.
"
but
it
would
not
do
altogether
,
this


shout
and
damn
your
eye
,
Andrew
feel
,
pick
his
way
down
the


cliff
,
this
clap
he
on
the
back
,
and
call
he
"
old
fellow
"
and


all
that
;
it
would
not
altogether
do
.
it
be
the
bad
of
take
woman


on
walk
.
once
on
the
beach
they
separate
,
he
go
out
on
to
the


Pope
's
Nose
,
take
his
shoe
off
,
and
roll
his
sock
in
they
and


let
that
couple
look
after
themselves
;
Nancy
wade
out
to
her
own


rock
and
search
her
own
pool
and
let
that
couple
look
after


themselves
.
she
crouch
low
down
and
touch
the
smooth
rubber
-
like


sea
anemone
,
who
be
stick
like
lump
of
jelly
to
the
side
of
the


rock
.
brood
,
she
change
the
pool
into
the
sea
,
and
make
the
minnow


into
shark
and
whale
,
and
cast
vast
cloud
over
this
tiny
world
by


hold
her
hand
against
the
sun
,
and
so
bring
darkness
and


desolation
,
like
God
himself
,
to
million
of
ignorant
and
innocent


creature
,
and
then
take
her
hand
away
suddenly
and
let
the
sun
stream


down
.
out
on
the
pale
criss
-
crossed
sand
,
high
-
stepping
,
fringe
,


gauntlete
,
stalk
some
fantastic
leviathan
 
she
be
still
enlarge


the
pool
,
and
slip
into
the
vast
fissure
of
the
mountain
side
.


and
then
,
let
her
eye
slide
imperceptibly
above
the
pool
and
rest


on
that
wavering
line
of
sea
and
sky
,
on
the
tree
trunk
which
the


smoke
of
steamer
make
waver
on
the
horizon
,
she
become
with
all
that


power
sweep
savagely
in
and
inevitably
withdraw
,
hypnotise
,
and


the
two
sense
of
that
vastness
and
this
tininess
 
the
pool
have


diminish
again
 
flower
within
it
make
she
feel
that
she
be
bind


hand
and
foot
and
unable
to
move
by
the
intensity
of
feeling
which


reduce
her
own
body
,
her
own
life
,
and
the
life
of
all
the
people
in


the
world
,
for
ever
,
to
nothingness
.
so
listen
to
the
wave
,


crouch
over
the
pool
,
she
brood
.




and
Andrew
shout
that
the
sea
be
come
in
,
so
she
leapt
splash


through
the
shallow
wave
on
to
the
shore
and
run
up
the
beach
and
be


carry
by
her
own
impetuosity
and
her
desire
for
rapid
movement
right


behind
a
rock
and
there
-
oh
,
heavens
!
in
each
other
's
arm
,
be
Paul


and
Minta
kissing
probably
.
she
be
outraged
,
indignant
.
she
and


Andrew
put
on
their
shoe
and
stocking
in
dead
silence
without
say


a
thing
about
it
.
indeed
they
be
rather
sharp
with
each
other
.
she


might
have
call
he
when
she
see
the
crayfish
or
whatever
it
be
,


Andrew
grumble
.
however
,
they
both
feel
,
it
be
not
our
fault
.
they


have
not
want
this
horrid
nuisance
to
happen
.
all
the
same
it


irritated
Andrew
that
Nancy
should
be
a
woman
,
and
Nancy
that
Andrew


should
be
a
man
,
and
they
tie
their
shoe
very
neatly
and
draw
the


bow
rather
tight
.




it
be
not
until
they
have
climb
right
up
on
to
the
top
of
the
cliff


again
that
Minta
cry
out
that
she
have
lose
her
grandmother
's
brooch
-


her
grandmother
's
brooch
,
the
sole
ornament
she
possess
-
a
weeping


willow
,
it
be
 
they
must
remember
it
 
set
in
pearl
.
they
must
have


see
it
,
she
say
,
with
the
tear
run
down
her
cheek
,
the


brooch
which
her
grandmother
have
fasten
her
cap
with
till
the


last
day
of
her
life
.
now
she
have
lose
it
.
she
would
rather
have


lose
anything
than
that
!
she
would
go
back
and
look
for
it
.
they
all


go
back
.
they
poke
and
peer
and
look
.
they
keep
their
head


very
low
,
and
say
thing
shortly
and
gruffly
.
Paul
Rayley
search


like
a
madman
all
about
the
rock
where
they
have
be
sit
.
all
this


pother
about
a
brooch
really
do
n't
 
do
at
all
,
Andrew
think
,
as
Paul


tell
he
to
make
a
"
thorough
search
between
this
point
and
that
.
"
the


tide
be
come
in
fast
.
the
sea
would
cover
the
place
where
they
have


sit
in
a
minute
.
there
be
not
a
ghost
of
a
chance
of
their
find
it


now
.
"
we
shall
be
cut
off
!
"
Minta
shriek
,
suddenly
terrify
.
as
if


there
be
any
danger
of
that
!
it
be
the
same
as
the
bull
all
over


again
-
she
have
no
control
over
her
emotion
,
Andrew
think
.
woman


have
n't
.
the
wretched
Paul
have
to
pacify
she
.
the
man
 
Andrew
and
Paul


at
once
become
manly
,
and
different
from
usual
 
take
counsel
briefly


and
decide
that
they
would
plant
Rayley
's
stick
where
they
have
sit
and


come
back
at
low
tide
again
.
there
be
nothing
more
that
could
be
do


now
.
if
the
brooch
be
there
,
it
would
still
be
there
in
the
morning
,


they
assure
she
,
but
Minta
still
sob
,
all
the
way
up
to
the
top
of


the
cliff
.
it
be
her
grandmother
's
brooch
;
she
would
rather
have
lose


anything
but
that
,
and
yet
Nancy
feel
,
it
might
be
true
that
she
mind


lose
her
brooch
,
but
she
be
n't
 
cry
only
for
that
.
she
be
cry


for
something
else
.
we
might
all
sit
down
and
cry
,
she
feel
.
but
she


do
not
know
what
for
.




they
draw
ahead
together
,
Paul
and
Minta
,
and
he
comfort
she
,
and


say
how
famous
he
be
for
find
thing
.
once
when
he
be
a
little


boy
he
have
find
a
gold
watch
.
he
would
get
up
at
daybreak
and
he
be


positive
he
would
find
it
.
it
seem
to
he
that
it
would
be


almost
dark
,
and
he
would
be
alone
on
the
beach
,
and
somehow
it
would


be
rather
dangerous
.
he
begin
tell
she
,
however
,
that
he
would


certainly
find
it
,
and
she
say
that
she
would
not
hear
of
his
get


up
at
dawn
:
it
be
lose
:
she
know
that
:
she
have
have
a
presentiment
when


she
put
it
on
that
afternoon
.
and
secretly
he
resolve
that
he
would


not
tell
she
,
but
he
would
slip
out
of
the
house
at
dawn
when
they
be


all
asleep
and
if
he
could
not
find
it
he
would
go
to
Edinburgh
and
buy


she
another
,
just
like
it
but
more
beautiful
.
he
would
prove
what
he


could
do
.
and
as
they
come
out
on
the
hill
and
see
the
light
of
the


town
beneath
they
,
the
light
come
out
suddenly
one
by
one
seem


like
thing
that
be
go
to
happen
to
he
-
his
marriage
,
his


child
,
his
house
;
and
again
he
think
,
as
they
come
out
on
to
the


high
road
,
which
be
shade
with
high
bush
,
how
they
would
retreat


into
solitude
together
,
and
walk
on
and
on
,
he
always
lead
she
,
and


she
press
close
to
his
side
 
as
she
do
now
.
as
they
turn
by
the


cross
road
he
think
what
an
appalling
experience
he
have
be


through
,
and
he
must
tell
some
one
-
Mrs.
Ramsay
of
course
,
for
it
take


his
breath
away
to
think
what
he
have
be
and
do
.
it
have
be
far


and
away
the
bad
moment
of
his
life
when
he
ask
Minta
to
marry
he
.


he
would
go
straight
to
Mrs.
Ramsay
,
because
he
feel
somehow
that
she


be
the
person
who
have
make
he
do
it
.
she
have
make
he
think
he
could


do
anything
.
nobody
else
take
he
seriously
.
but
she
make
he
believe


that
he
could
do
whatever
he
want
.
he
have
feel
her
eye
on
he
all


day
today
,
follow
he
about
 
though
she
never
say
a
word
 
as
if
she


be
say
,
"
yes
,
you
can
do
it
.
I
believe
in
you
.
I
expect
it
of


you
.
"
she
have
make
he
feel
all
that
,
and
directly
they
get
back
 
he


look
for
the
light
of
the
house
above
the
bay
 
he
would
go
to
she


and
say
,
"
I
've
 
do
it
,
Mrs.
Ramsay
;
thank
to
you
.
"
and
so
turn
into


the
lane
that
lead
to
the
house
he
could
see
light
move
about
in
the


upper
window
.
they
must
be
awfully
late
then
.
People
be
get


ready
for
dinner
.
the
house
be
all
light
up
,
and
the
light
after
the


darkness
make
his
eye
feel
full
,
and
he
say
to
himself
,
childishly
,


as
he
walk
up
the
drive
,
Lights
,
light
,
light
,
and
repeat
in
a


daze
way
,
light
,
light
,
light
,
as
they
come
into
the
house
stare


about
he
with
his
face
quite
stiff
.
but
,
good
heaven
,
he
say
to


himself
,
put
his
hand
to
his
tie
,
I
must
not
make
a
fool
of


myself

well
then
,
Nancy

comb
,
and

.




Jasper
offer
she
an
opal
necklace
;
Rose
a
gold
necklace
.
which


look
well
against
her
black
dress
?
which
do
indeed
,
say
Mrs.
Ramsay


absent
-
mindedly
,
look
at
her
neck
and
shoulder
 
but
avoid
she


face
 
in
the
glass
.
and
then
,
while
the
child
rummage
among
she


thing
,
she
look
out
of
the
window
at
a
sight
which
always
amuse


she
-
the
rook
try
to
decide
which
tree
to
settle
on
.
every
time
,


they
seem
to
change
their
mind
and
rise
up
into
the
air
again
,


because
,
she
think
,
the
old
rook
,
the
father
rook
,
old
Joseph
be
she


name
for
he
,
be
a
bird
of
a
very
trying
and
difficult
disposition
.


he
be
a
disreputable
old
bird
,
with
half
his
wing
feather
miss
.


he
be
like
some
seedy
old
gentleman
in
a
top
hat
she
have
see
play


the
horn
in
front
of
a
public
house
.




"
look
!
"
she
say
,
laugh
.
they
be
actually
fight
.
Joseph
and


Mary
be
fight
.
anyhow
they
all
go
up
again
,
and
the
air
be


shove
aside
by
their
black
wing
and
cut
into
exquisite
scimitar
shape
.


the
movement
of
the
wing
beat
out
,
out
,
out
-
she
could
never


describe
it
accurately
enough
to
please
herself
-
be
one
of
the


lovely
of
all
to
she
.
look
at
that
,
she
say
to
Rose
,
hope


that
Rose
would
see
it
more
clearly
than
she
could
.
for
one
's
child


so
often
give
one
's
own
perception
a
little
thrust
forwards
.




but
which
be
it
to
be
?
they
have
all
the
tray
of
her
jewel
-
case


open
.
the
gold
necklace
,
which
be
italian
,
or
the
opal
necklace
,


which
Uncle
James
have
bring
she
from
India
;
or
should
she
wear
she


amethyst
?




"
Choose
,
dearest
,
choose
,
"
she
say
,
hope
that
they
would
make


haste
.




but
she
let
they
take
their
time
to
choose
:
she
let
Rose
,
particularly
,


take
up
this
and
then
that
,
and
hold
her
jewel
against
the
black


dress
,
for
this
little
ceremony
of
choose
jewel
,
which
be
go


through
every
night
,
be
what
Rose
like
well
,
she
know
.
she
have
some


hide
reason
of
her
own
for
attach
great
importance
to
this


choose
what
her
mother
be
to
wear
.
what
be
the
reason
,
Mrs.
Ramsay


wonder
,
stand
still
to
let
she
clasp
the
necklace
she
have
choose
,


divine
,
through
her
own
past
,
some
deep
,
some
bury
,
some
quite


speechless
feeling
that
one
have
for
one
's
mother
at
Rose
's
age
.
like


all
feeling
feel
for
oneself
,
Mrs.
Ramsay
think
,
it
make
one
sad
.
it


be
so
inadequate
,
what
one
could
give
in
return
;
and
what
Rose
feel


be
quite
out
of
proportion
to
anything
she
actually
be
.
and
Rose


would
grow
up
;
and
Rose
would
suffer
,
she
suppose
,
with
these
deep


feeling
,
and
she
say
she
be
ready
now
,
and
they
would
go
down
,
and


Jasper
,
because
he
be
the
gentleman
,
should
give
she
his
arm
,
and


Rose
,
as
she
be
the
lady
,
should
carry
her
handkerchief
 
she
give
she


the
handkerchief
,
and
what
else
?
oh
,
yes
,
it
might
be
cold
:
a
shawl
.


choose
I
a
shawl
,
she
say
,
for
that
would
please
Rose
,
who
be
bind


to
suffer
so
.
"
there
,
"
she
say
,
stop
by
the
window
on
the


landing
,
"
there
they
be
again
.
"
Joseph
have
settle
on
another
tree-


top
.
"

n't
 
you
think
they
mind
,
"
she
say
to
Jasper
,
"
have
their


wing
break
?
"
why
do
he
want
to
shoot
poor
old
Joseph
and
Mary
?
he


shuffle
a
little
on
the
stair
,
and
feel
rebuke
,
but
not
seriously
,


for
she
do
not
understand
the
fun
of
shoot
bird
;
and
they
do
not


feel
;
and
be
his
mother
she
live
away
in
another
division
of
the


world
,
but
he
rather
like
her
story
about
Mary
and
Joseph
.
she
make


he
laugh
.
but
how
do
she
know
that
those
be
Mary
and
Joseph
?
do


she
think
the
same
bird
come
to
the
same
tree
every
night
?
he
ask
.


but
here
,
suddenly
,
like
all
grow
-
up
people
,
she
cease
to
pay
he
the


least
attention
.
she
be
listen
to
a
clatter
in
the
hall
.




"
they
've
 
come
back
!
"
she
exclaim
,
and
at
once
she
feel
much
more


annoy
with
they
than
relieved
.
then
she
wonder
,
have
it
happen
?


she
would
go
down
and
they
would
tell
she
-
but
no
.
they
could
not
tell


her
anything
,
with
all
these
people
about
.
so
she
must
go
down
and


begin
dinner
and
wait
.
and
,
like
some
queen
who
,
find
her
people


gather
in
the
hall
,
look
down
upon
they
,
and
descend
among
they
,


and
acknowledge
their
tribute
silently
,
and
accept
their
devotion


and
their
prostration
before
she
 
Paul
do
not
move
a
muscle
but
look


straight
before
he
as
she
pass
 
she
go
down
,
and
cross
the
hall


and
bow
her
head
very
slightly
,
as
if
she
accept
what
they
could


not
say
:
their
tribute
to
her
beauty
.




but
she
stop
.
there
be
a
smell
of
burning
.
could
they
have
let
the

she
wonder
,
pray
heaven
not

when
the


great
clangour
of
the

announce
solemnly

think
Mrs.

,
take
she


place
at

,
and
look

she
be
out

it
.
it
be
all

to
an

sit
down
.
and
meanwhile
she
wait
,
passively
,
for


some
one
to
answer
she
,
for
something
to
happen
.
but
this
be

she
feel

look
round
it


be
very
shabby
.
there
be
no

anywhere
.
she
forebore
to
look
at


Mr.

.
nothing
seem
to
have
merge
.
they
all
sit
separate
.


and
the
whole
of
the
effort
of
merge
and
flow
and
create
rest


on

.
again
she
feel
,
as
a
fact
without
hostility
,
the
sterility
of


man
,
for
if
she
do
not
do
it
nobody
would
do
it
,

so
,
give


herself
a
little
shake

one
give
a
watch
that
have
stop
,

and
so
on
and
so
on
,
she
repeat
,
listen


to
it
,
shelter
and
foster
the
still
feeble
pulse
as
one
might


guard
a
weak
flame
with
a

and
so
then
,
she
conclude
,

herself
by

silently
in
his

the

sink
,
he
would
have


whirl
round
and
round
and
find
rest
on
the
floor
of
the
sea
.




"
do
you
find
your
letter
?
I
tell

to
put

,
"
she
say
to
William
Bankes
.




Lily
Briscoe
watch
she
drift
into
that
strange
no
-
man
's
land
where


to
follow
people
be
impossible
and
yet
their
go
inflict
such
a


chill
on
those
who
watch
they
that
they
always
try
at
least
to
follow


they
with
their
eye
as
one
follow
a
fade
ship
until
the
sail
have


sink
beneath
the
horizon
.




how
old
she
look
,
how
worn
she
look
,
Lily
think
,
and
how
remote
.


then
when
she
turn
to
William
Bankes
,
smile
,
it
be
as
if
the
ship


have
turn
and
the
sun
have
strike
its
sail
again
,
and
Lily
think


with
some
amusement
because
she
be
relieve
,
why
do
she
pity
he
?


for
that
be
the
impression
she
give
,
when
she
tell
he
that
his


letter
be
in
the
hall
.
Poor
William
Bankes
,
she
seem
to
be


say
,
as
if
her
own
weariness
have
be
partly
pity
people
,
and
the


life
in
she
,
her
resolve
to
live
again
,
have
be
stir
by
pity
.
and


it
be
not
true
,
Lily
think
;
it
be
one
of
those
misjudgment
of
hers


that
seem
to
be
instinctive
and
to
arise
from
some
need
of
her
own


rather
than
of
other
people
's
.
he
be
not
in
the
least
pitiable
.
he
have


his
work
,
Lily
say
to
herself
.
she
remember
,
all
of
a
sudden
as
if


she
have
find
a
treasure
,
that
she
have
her
work
.
in
a
flash
she
see


her
picture
,
and
think
,
yes
,
I
shall
put
the
tree
far
in
the


middle
;
then
I
shall
avoid
that
awkward
space
.
that
be
what
I
shall
do
.


that
be
what
have
be
puzzle
I
.
she
take
up
the
salt
cellar
and
put


it
down
again
on
a
flower
pattern
in
the
table
-
cloth
,
so
as
to
remind


herself
to
move
the
tree
.




"
it
be
odd
that
one
scarcely
get
anything
worth
have
by
post
,

one


always
want
one

say
Mr.
Bankes
.




what
damn
rot
they
talk
,
think
Charles
Tansley
,
lay
down
his


spoon
precisely
in
the
middle
of
his
plate
,
which
he
have
sweep
clean
,


as
if
,
Lily
think
 
he
sit
opposite
to
she
with
his
back
to
the
window


precisely
in
the
middle
of
view
,
he
be
determined
to
make
sure
of


his
meal
.
everything
about
he
have
that
meagre
fixity
,
that
bare


unloveliness
.
but
nevertheless
,
the
fact
remain
,
it
be
impossible


to
dislike
any
one
if
one
look
at
they
.
she
like
his
eye
;
they


be
blue
,
deep
set
,
frightening
.




"

"
ask
Mrs.

Mr.

now

nothing

"
no

to
the
Lighthouse
tomorrow
,
Mrs.

he
say
,
assert


himself
.
he
like
she
;
he
admire
she
;
he
still
think
of
the
man
in


the
drain
-
pipe
look
up
at
she
;
but
he
feel
it
necessary
to
assert


himself
.




he
be
really
,
Lily
Briscoe
think
,
in
spite
of
his
eye
,
but
then


look
at
his
nose
,
look
at
his
hand
,
the
most
uncharming
human
being


she
have
ever
meet
.
then
why
do
she
mind
what
he
say
?
woman

write
,
woman
ca
n't

what
do
that
matter
come
from
he
,
since


clearly
it
be
not
true
to
he
but
for
some
reason
helpful
to
he
,
and


that
be
why
he
say
it
?
why
do
her
whole
being
bow
,
like
corn
under


a
wind
,
and
erect
itself
again
from
this
abasement
only
with
a
great


and
rather
painful
effort
?
she
must
make
it
once
more
.
there
be
the


sprig
on
the
table

cloth
;
there

my
painting
;
I
must
move
the
tree
to


the
middle
;
that
matter
-
nothing
else
.
could
she
not
hold
fast
to


that
,
she
ask
herself
,
and
not
lose
her
temper
,
and
not
argue
;
and
if


she
want
revenge
take
it
by
laugh
at
he
?




"
oh
,
Mr.
Tansley
,
"
she
say
,
"

"




she
be
tell
lie
he
could
see
.
she
be
say
what
she
do
not

to
annoy
he
,
for
some
reason
.
she
be

.
he
be
in


his
old
flannel
trouser
.
he
have
no
other
.
he
feel
very
rough
and


isolated
and
lonely
.
he
know
that
she
be
try
to
tease
he
for
some


reason
;
she
do
n't
 
want
to

.
but
he
be
not
go
to
be


make
a
fool
of
by
woman
,
so
he
turn
deliberately
in
his
chair
and


look
out
of
the
window
and
say
,
all
in
a
jerk
,
very
rudely
,
it
would


be
too
rough
for
she
tomorrow
.
she
would
be
sick
.




it
annoy
he
that
she
should
have
make
he
speak
like
that
,
with
Mrs.


ramsay

.
if
only
he
could
be
alone
in
his
room
work
,
he


think
,
among
his
book
.
that
be
where
he
feel
at
his
ease
.
and
he


have
never
run
a
penny
into
debt
;
he
have
never
cost
his
father

penny


since
he
be
fifteen
;
he
have
help

home
out
of

still
,
he
wish
he
have
know
how
to
answer


Miss
Briscoe
properly
;
he
wish
it
have
not

out
all
in
a
jerk
like


that
.
"
you
'd
be
sick
.
"
he
wish
he
could
think
of
something
to
say
to


Mrs.
Ramsay
,
something
which
would
show
she
that
he
be
not
just
a
dry


prig
.
that
be
what
they
all
think
he
.
he
turn
to
she
.
but
Mrs.


Ramsay
be
talk
about
people
he
have
never
hear
of

William


Bankes

"

,

it
away

,
interrupt
what
she
be

to
William

to
speak
to
the
maid
.
"
it
must
have

"
she
be

,
turn


back
to
he
again
as
if
she
could
not
lose
a
moment
of
their
talk
,
for


she
be
absorb
by
what
they
be
say
.
so
he
have
actually
hear


from
she
this
evening
!
and
be
Carrie
still
live
at
Marlow
,
and
be


everything
still
the
same
?
oh
,
she
could
remember
it
as
if
it
be


yesterday
-
on
the
river
,
feel
it
as
if
it
be
yesterday
-
go
on


the
river
,
feel
very
cold
.
but
if
the
Mannings
make
a
plan
they


stuck
to
it
.
never
should
she
forget
Herbert
kill
a
wasp
with
a


teaspoon
on
the
bank
!
and
it
be
still
go
on
,
Mrs.
Ramsay
muse
,


glide
like
a
ghost
among
the
chair
and
table
of
that
drawing
-
room


on
the
bank
of
the
Thames
where
she
have
be
so
very
,
very
cold
twenty


year
ago
;
but
now
she
go
among
they
like
a
ghost
;
and
it
fascinate


she
,
as
if
,
while
she
have
change
,
that
particular
day
,
now
become
very


still
and
beautiful
,
have
remain
there
,
all
these
year
.
have
Carrie


write
to
he
herself
?
she
ask
.




"
yes
.
she
say
they
be
build
a
new
billiard
room
,
"
he
say
.
no
!


no
!
that
be
out
of
the
question
!
build
a
new
billiard
room
!


it
seem
to
she
impossible
.




Mr.
Bankes
could
not
see
that
there
be
anything
very
odd
about
it
.


they
be
very
well
off
now
.
should
he
give
her
love
to
Carrie
?




"
oh
,
"
say
Mrs.
Ramsay
with
a
little
start
,
"
no
,
"
she
add
,
reflect


that
she
do
not
know
this
Carrie
who
build
a
new
billiard
room
.
but


how
strange
,
she
repeat
,
to
Mr.
Bankes
's
amusement
,
that
they
should


be
go
on
there
still
.
for
it
be
extraordinary
to
think
that
they


have
be
capable
of
go
on
live
all
these
year
when
she
have
not


think
of
they
more
than
once
all
that
time
.
how
eventful
her
own


life
have
be
,
during
those
same
year
.
yet
perhaps
Carrie
Manning


have
not
think
about
she
,
either
.
the
thought
be
strange
and


distasteful
.




"
People
soon
drift
apart
,
"
say
Mr.
Bankes
,
feel
,
however
,
some


satisfaction
when
he
think
that
after
all
he
know
both
the
Mannings


and
the
Ramsays
.
he
have
not
drift
apart
he
think
,
lay
down
his


spoon
and
wipe
his
clean
-
shaven
lip
punctiliously
.
but
perhaps
he


be
rather
unusual
,
he
think
,
in
this
;
he
never
let
himself
get
into


a
groove
.
he
have
friend
in
all
circle
...
Mrs.
Ramsay
have
to
break


off
here
to
tell
the
maid
something
about
keep
food
hot
.
that
be


why
he
prefer
dining
alone
.
all
those
interruption
annoy
he
.


well
,
think
William
Bankes
,
preserve
a
demeanour
of
exquisite


courtesy
and
merely
spread
the
finger
of
his
left
hand
on
the


table
-
cloth
as
a
mechanic
examine
a
tool
beautifully
polished
and


ready
for
use
in
an
interval
of
leisure
,
such
be
the
sacrifice
one
's


friend
ask
of
one
.
it
would
have
hurt
she
if
he
have
refuse
to
come
.


but
it
be
not
worth
it
for
he
.
look
at
his
hand
he
think
that


if
he
have
be
alone
dinner
would
have
be
almost
over
now
;
he
would


have
be
free
to
work
.
yes
,
he
think
,
it
be
a
terrible
waste
of


time
.
the
child
be
drop
in
still
.
"
I
wish
one
of
you
would


run
up
to
Roger
's
room
,
"
Mrs.
Ramsay
be
say
.
how
trifle
it
all


be
,
how
boring
it
all
be
,
he
think
,
compare
with
the
other
thing
-


work
.
here
he
sit
drum
his
finger
on
the
table
-
cloth
when
he


might
have
be
-
he
take
a
flash
bird's
-
eye
view
of
his
work
.
what


a
waste
of
time
it
all
be
to
be
sure
!
yet
,
he
think
,
she
be
one
of


my
old
friend
.
I
be
by
way
of
be
devote
to
she
.
yet
now
,
at


this
moment
her
presence
mean
absolutely
nothing
to
he
:
her
beauty


mean
nothing
to
he
;
she
sit
with
her
little
boy
at
the
window
-


nothing
,
nothing
.
he
wish
only
to
be
alone
and
to
take
up
that
book
.


he
feel
uncomfortable
;
he
feel
treacherous
,
that
he
could
sit
by
she


side
and
feel
nothing
for
she
.
the
truth
be
that
he
do
not
enjoy


family
life
.
it
be
in
this
sort
of
state
that
one
ask
oneself
,
what


do
one
live
for
?
why
,
one
ask
oneself
,
do
one
take
all
these


pain
for
the
human
race
to
go
on
?
be
it
so
very
desirable
?
be
we


attractive
as
a
specie
?
not
so
very
,
he
think
,
look
at
those


rather
untidy
boy
.
his
favourite
,
Cam
,
be
in
bed
,
he
suppose
.


foolish
question
,
vain
question
,
question
one
never
ask


if
one
be
occupy
.
be
human
life
this
?
be
human
life
that
?
one


never
have
time
to
think
about
it
.
but
here
he
be
ask
himself
that


sort
of
question
,
because
Mrs.
Ramsay
be
give
order
to
servant
,
and


also
because
it
have
strike
he
,
think
how
surprised
Mrs.
Ramsay
be


that
Carrie
Manning
should
still
exist
,
that
friendship
,
even
the
good


of
they
,
be
frail
thing
.
one
drift
apart
.
he
reproach
himself


again
.
he
be
sit
beside
Mrs.
Ramsay
and
he
have
nothing
in
the


world
to
say
to
she
.




"
I
be
so
sorry
,
"
say
Mrs.
Ramsy
,
turn
to
he
at
last
.
he
feel
rigid


and
barren
,
like
a
pair
of
boot
that
have
be
soak
and
go
dry
so


that
you
can
hardly
force
your
foot
into
they
.
yet
he
must
force
his


foot
into
they
.
he
must
make
himself
talk
.
unless
he
be
very


careful
,
she
would
find
out
this
treachery
of
his
;
that
he
do
not
care


a
straw
for
she
,
and
that
would
not
be
at
all
pleasant
,
he
think
.
so


he
bend
his
head
courteously
in
her
direction
.




"
how
you
must
detest
dining
in
this
bear
garden
,
"
she
say
,
make
use
,


as
she
do
when
she
be
distract
,
of
her
social
manner
.
so
,
when


there
be
a
strife
of
tongue
,
at
some
meeting
,
the
chairman
,
to
obtain


unity
,
suggest
that
every
one
shall
speak
in
French
.
perhaps
it
be


bad
French
;
French
may
not
contain
the
word
that
express
the
speaker
's


thought
;
nevertheless
speak
french
impose
some
order
,
some


uniformity
.
reply
to
she
in
the
same
language
,
Mr.
Bankes
say
,
"
no
,


not
at
all
,
"
and
Mr.
Tansley
,
who
have
no
knowledge
of
this
language
,


even
speak
thus
in
word
of
one
syllable
,
at
once
suspect
its


insincerity
.
they
do
talk
nonsense
,
he
think
,
the
Ramsays
;
and
he


pounce
on
this
fresh
instance
with
joy
,
make
a
note
which
,
one
of


these
day
,
he
would
read
aloud
,
to
one
or
two
friend
.
there
,
in
a


society
where
one
could
say
what
one
like
he
would
sarcastically


describe
'
stay
with
the
Ramsays
"
and
what
nonsense
they
talk
.
it


be
worth
while
do
it
once
,
he
would
say
;
but
not
again
.
the
woman


bored
one
so
,
he
would
say
.
of
course
Ramsay
have
dish
himself
by


marry
a
beautiful
woman
and
have
eight
child
.
it
would
shape


itself
something
like
that
,
but
now
,
at
this
moment
,
sit
stick


there
with
an
empty
seat
beside
he
,
nothing
have
shape
itself
at
all
.


it
be
all
in
scrap
and
fragment
.
he
feel
extremely
,
even


physically
,
uncomfortable
.
he
want
somebody
to
give
he
a
chance
of


assert
himself
.
he
want
it
so
urgently
that
he
fidget
in
his


chair
,
look
at
this
person
,
then
at
that
person
,
try
to
break
into


their
talk
,
open
his
mouth
and
shut
it
again
.
they
be
talk


about
the
fishing
industry
.
why
do
no
one
ask
he
his
opinion
?
what


do
they
know
about
the
fishing
industry
?




Lily
Briscoe
know
all
that
.
sit
opposite
he
,
could
she
not
see
,


as
in
an
x
-
ray
photograph
,
the
rib
and
thigh
bone
of
the
young
man
's


desire
to
impress
himself
,
lie
dark
in
the
mist
of
his
flesh
-
that


thin
mist
which
convention
have
lay
over
his
burn
desire
to
break


into
the
conversation
?
but
,
she
think
,
screw
up
her
chinese


eye
,
and
remember
how
he
sneer
at
woman
,
"
ca
n't
 
paint
,
ca
n't


write
,
"
why
should
I
help
he
to
relieve
himself
?




there
be
a
code
of
behaviour
,
she
know
,
whose
seventh
article
 
it
may


be
 
say
that
on
occasion
of
this
sort
it
behove
the
woman
,
whatever


her
own
occupation
might
be
,
to
go
to
the
help
of
the
young
man


opposite
so
that
he
may
expose
and
relieve
the
thigh
bone
,
the
rib
,


of
his
vanity
,
of
his
urgent
desire
to
assert
himself
;
as
indeed
it
be


their
duty
,
she
reflect
,
in
her
old
maidenly
fairness
,
to
help
we
,


suppose
the
Tube
be
to
burst
into
flame
.
then
,
she
think
,
I
should


certainly
expect
Mr.
Tansley
to
get
I
out
.
but
how
would
it
be
,
she


think
,
if
neither
of
we
do
either
of
these
thing
?
so
she
sit
there


smile
.




"
you
be
not
plan
to
go
to
the
lighthouse
,
be
you
,
Lily
,
"
say
Mrs.


Ramsay
.
"
remember
poor
Mr.
Langley
;
he
have
be
round
the
world
dozen


of
time
,
but
he
tell
I
he
never
suffer
as
he
do
when
my
husband


take
he
there
.
be
you
a
good
sailor
,
Mr.
Tansley
?
"
she
ask
.




Mr.
Tansley
raise
a
hammer
:
swing
it
high
in
air
;
but
realise
,
as
it


descend
,
that
he
could
not
smite
that
butterfly
with
such
an


instrument
as
this
,
say
only
that
he
have
never
be
sick
in
his
life
.


but
in
that
one
sentence
lie
compact
,
like
gunpowder
,
that
his


grandfather
be
a
fisherman
;
his
father
a
chemist
;
that
he
have
work


his
way
up
entirely
himself
;
that
he
be
proud
of
it
;
that
he
be


Charles
Tansley
-
a
fact
that
nobody
there
seem
to
realise
;
but
one
of


these
day
every
single
person
would
know
it
.
he
scowl
ahead
of
he
.


he
could
almost
pity
these
mild
cultivate
people
,
who
would
be
blow


sky
high
,
like
bale
of
wool
and
barrel
of
apple
,
one
of
these
day


by
the
gunpowder
that
be
in
he
.




"
will
you
take
I
,
Mr.
Tansley
?
"
say
Lily
,
quickly
,
kindly
,
for
,
of


course
,
if
Mrs.
Ramsay
say
to
she
,
as
in
effect
she
do
,
"
I
be


drown
,
my
dear
,
in
sea
of
fire
.
unless
you
apply
some
balm
to
the


anguish
of
this
hour
and
say
something
nice
to
that
young
man
there
,


life
will
run
upon
the
rock
-
indeed
I
hear
the
grating
and
the


growl
at
this
minute
.
my
nerve
be
taut
as
fiddle
string
.


another
touch
and
they
will
snap
"
-
when
Mrs.
Ramsay
say
all
this
,
as


the
glance
in
her
eye
say
it
,
of
course
for
the
hundred
and
fiftieth


time
Lily
Briscoe
have
to
renounce
the
experiment
-
what
happen
if
one


be
not
nice
to
that
young
man
there
-
and
be
nice
.




judge
the
turn
in
her
mood
correctly
-
that
she
be
friendly
to
he


now
-
he
be
relieve
of
his
egotism
,
and
tell
she
how
he
have
be


throw
out
of
a
boat
when
he
be
a
baby
;
how
his
father
use
to
fish


he
out
with
a
boat
-
hook
;
that
be
how
he
have
learn
to
swim
.
one
of


his
uncle
keep
the
light
on
some
rock
or
other
off
the
scottish
coast
,


he
say
.
he
have
be
there
with
he
in
a
storm
.
this
be
say
loudly


in
a
pause
.
they
have
to
listen
to
he
when
he
say
that
he
have
be


with
his
uncle
in
a
lighthouse
in
a
storm
.
ah
,
think
Lily
Briscoe
,


as
the
conversation
take
this
auspicious
turn
,
and
she
feel
Mrs.


ramsay
's
gratitude
 
for
Mrs.
Ramsay
be
free
now
to
talk
for
a
moment


herself
,
ah
,
she
think
,
but
what
have
n't
 
I
pay
to
get
it
for
you
?


she
have
not
be
sincere
.




she
have
do
the
usual
trick
-
be
nice
.
she
would
never
know
he
.
he


would
never
know
she
.
human
relation
be
all
like
that
,
she
think
,


and
the
bad
 
if
it
have
not
be
for
Mr.
Bankes
 
be
between
man
and


woman
.
inevitably
these
be
extremely
insincere
she
think
.
then


her
eye
catch
the
salt
cellar
,
which
she
have
place
there
to
remind


she
,
and
she
remember
that
next
morning
she
would
move
the
tree


far
towards
the
middle
,
and
her
spirit
rise
so
high
at
the
thought


of
painting
tomorrow
that
she
laugh
out
loud
at
what
Mr.
Tansley
be


say
.
let
he
talk
all
night
if
he
like
it
.




"
but
how
long
do
they
leave
man
on
a
lighthouse
?
"
she
ask
.
he
tell


she
.
he
be
amazingly
well
informed
.
and
as
he
be
grateful
,
and
as


he
like
she
,
and
as
he
be
begin
to
enjoy
himself
,
so
now
,
Mrs.


Ramsay
think
,
she
could
return
to
that
dream
land
,
that
unreal
but


fascinating
place
,
the
Mannings
'
drawing
-
room
at
Marlow
twenty
year


ago
;
where
one
move
about
without
haste
or
anxiety
,
for
there
be
no


future

worry
about
.
she
know
what
have
happen
to
they
,
what
to


she
.
it
be
like
read
a
good
book
again
,
for
she
know
the
end
of


that
story
,
since
it
have
happen
twenty
year
ago
,
and
life
,
which


shoot
down
even
from
this
dining
-
room
table
in
cascade
,
heaven
know


where
,
be
seal
up
there
,
and
lie
,
like
a
lake
,
placidly
between
its


bank
.
he
say
they
have
build
a
billiard
room
-
be
it
possible
?


would
William
go
on
talk
about
the
manning
?
she
want
he
to
.


but
,
no
-
for
some
reason
he
be
no
long
in
the
mood
.
she
try
.


he
do
not
respond
.
she
could
not
force
he
.
she
be
disappointed
.




"
the
child
be
disgraceful
,
"
she
say
,
sigh
.
he
say
something


about
punctuality
be
one
of
the
minor
virtue
which
we
do
not


acquire
until
later
in
life
.




"
if
at
all
,
"
say
Mrs.
Ramsay
merely
to
fill
up
space
,
think
what
an


old
maid
William
be
become
.
conscious
of
his
treachery
,
conscious


of
her
wish
to
talk
about
something
more
intimate
,
yet
out
of
mood
for


it
at
present
,
he
feel
come
over
he
the
disagreeableness
of
life
,


sit
there
,
wait
.
perhaps
the
other
be
say
something


interesting
?
what
be
they
say
?




that
the
fishing
season
be
bad
;
that
the
man
be
emigrate
.
they


be
talk
about
wage
and
unemployment
.
the
young
man
be
abuse


the
government
.
William
Bankes
,
think
what
a
relief
it
be
to
catch


on
to
something
of
this
sort
when
private
life
be
disagreeable
,
hear


he
say
something
about
"
one
of
the
most
scandalous
act
of
the
present


government
.
"
Lily
be
listen
;
Mrs.
Ramsay
be
listen
;
they
be


all
listen
.
but
already
bored
,
Lily
feel
that
something
be
lack
;


Mr.
Bankes
feel
that
something
be
lack
.
pull
her
shawl
round
she


Mrs.
Ramsay
feel
that
something
be
lack
.
all
of
they
bend


themselves
to
listen
think
,
"
pray
heaven
that
the
inside
of
my
mind


may
not
be
expose
,
"
for
each
thought
,
"
the
other
be
feel
this
.


they
be
outraged
and
indignant
with
the
government
about
the


fisherman
.
whereas
,
I
feel
nothing
at
all
.
"
but
perhaps
,
think
Mr.


Bankes
,
as
he
look
at
Mr.
Tansley
,
here
be
the
man
.
one
be
always


wait
for
the
man
.
there
be
always
a
chance
.
at
any
moment
the


leader
might
arise
;
the
man
of
genius
,
in
politic
as
in
anything
else
.


probably
he
will
be
extremely
disagreeable
to
we
old
fogy
,
think
Mr.


banke
,
do
his
good
to
make
allowance
,
for
he
know
by
some
curious


physical
sensation
,
as
of
nerve
erect
in
his
spine
,
that
he
be


jealous
,
for
himself
partly
,
partly
more
probably
for
his
work
,
for
his


point
of
view
,
for
his
science
;
and
therefore
he
be
not
entirely
open-


minded
or
altogether
fair
,
for
Mr.
Tansley
seem
to
be
say
,
you
have


waste
your
life
.
you
be
all
of
you
wrong
.
poor
old
fogy
,
you
be


hopelessly
behind
the
time
.
he
seem
to
be
rather
cocksure
,
this


young
man
;
and
his
manner
be
bad
.
but
Mr.
Bankes
bid
himself


observe
,
he
have
courage
;
he
have
ability
;
he
be
extremely
well
up
in


the
fact
.
probably
,
Mr.
Bankes
think
,
as
Tansley
abuse
the


government
,
there
be
a
good
deal
in
what
he
say
.




"
tell
I
now
...
"
he
say
.
so
they
argue
about
politic
,
and
Lily


look
at
the
leaf
on
the
table
-
cloth
;
and
Mrs.
Ramsay
,
leave
the


argument
entirely
in
the
hand
of
the
two
man
,
wonder
why
she
be
so


bore
by
this
talk
,
and
wish
,
look
at
her
husband
at
the
other
end


of
the
table
,
that
he
would
say
something
.
one
word
,
she
say
to


herself
.
for
if
he
say
a
thing
,
it
would
make
all
the
difference
.
he


go
to
the
heart
of
thing
.
he
care
about
fisherman
and
their
wage
.


he
could
not
sleep
for
thinking
of
they
.
it
be
altogether
different


when
he
speak
;
one
do
not
feel
then
,
pray
heaven
you
do
n't
 
see
how


little
I
care
,
because
one
do
care
.
then
,
realise
that
it
be
because


she
admire
he
so
much
that
she
be
wait
for
he
to
speak
,
she


feel
as
if
somebody
have
be
praise
her
husband
to
she
and
their


marriage
,
and
she
glow
all
over
withiut
realise
that
it
be


she
herself
who
have
praise
he
.
she
look
at
he
think
to
find


this
in
his
face
;
he
would
be
look
magnificent
...
but
not
in
the


least
!
he
be
screw
his
face
up
,
he
be
scowl
and
frown
,
and


flush
with
anger
.
what
on
earth
be
it
about
?
she
wonder
.
what


could
be
the
matter
?
only
that
poor
old
Augustus
have
ask
for


another
plate
of
soup
-
that
be
all
.
it
be
unthinkable
,
it
be


detestable
 
so
he
signal
to
she
across
the
table
 
that
Augustus


should
be
begin
his
soup
over
again
.
he
loathe
people
eat
when


he
have
finish
.
she
see
his
anger
fly
like
a
pack
of
hound
into
his


eye
,
his
brow
,
and
she
know
that
in
a
moment
something
violent
would


explode
,
and
then
-
thank
goodness
!
she
see
he
clutch
himself
and
clap


a
brake
on
the
wheel
,
and
the
whole
of
his
body
seem
to
emit
spark


but
not
word
.
he
sit
there
scowl
.
he
have
say
nothing
,
he
would


have
her
observe
.
let
she
give
he
the
credit
for
that
!
but
why


after
all
should
poor
Augustus
not
ask
for
another
plate
of
soup
?
he


have
merely
touch
Ellen
's
arm
and
say
:




"
Ellen
,
please
,
another
plate
of
soup
,
"
and
then
Mr.
Ramsay
scowl
like


that
.




and
why
not
?
Mrs.
Ramsay
demand
.
surely
they
could
let
Augustus
have


his
soup
if
he
want
it
.
he
hate
people
wallow
in
food
,
Mr.
Ramsay


frown
at
she
.
he
hate
everything
drag
on
for
hour
like
this
.


but
he
have
control
himself
,
Mr.
Ramsay
would
have
her
observe
,


disgusting
though
the
sight
be
.
but
why
show
it
so
plainly
,
Mrs.


Ramsay
demand
 
they
look
at
each
other
down
the
long
table
send


these
question
and
answer
across
,
each
know
exactly
what
the
other


feel
.
everybody
could
see
,
Mrs.
Ramsay
think
.
there
be
Rose
gaze


at
her
father
,
there
be
Roger
gaze
at
his
father
;
both
would
be
off


in
spasm
of
laughter
in
another
second
,
she
know
,
and
so
she
say


promptly
 
indeed
it
be
time
:




"
light
the
candle
,
"
and
they
jump
up
instantly
and
go
and
fumble


at
the
sideboard
.




why
could
he
never
conceal
his
feeling
?
Mrs.
Ramsay
wonder
,
and
she


wonder
if
Augustus
Carmichael
have
notice
.
perhaps
he
have
;
perhaps


he
have
not
.
she
could
not
help
respect
the
composure
with
which
he


sit
there
,
drink
his
soup
.
if
he
want
soup
,
he
ask
for
soup
.


whether
people
laugh
at
he
or
be
angry
with
he
he
be
the
same
.


he
do
not
like
she
,
she
know
that
;
but
partly
for
that
very
reason
she


respect
he
,
and
look
at
he
,
drink
soup
,
very
large
and
calm


in
the
fail
light
,
and
monumental
,
and
contemplative
,
she
wonder


what
he
do
feel
then
,
and
why
he
be
always
content
and
dignified
;
and


she
think
how
devoted
he
be
to
Andrew
,
and
would
call
he
into
his


room
,
and
Andrew
say
,
'
show
he
thing
.
"
and
there
he
would
lie
all


day
long
on
the
lawn
brood
presumably
over
his
poetry
,
till
he


remind
one
of
a
cat
watch
bird
,
and
then
he
clap
his
paw


together
when
he
have
find
the
word
,
and
her
husband
say
,
"
poor
old


Augustus
-
he
be
a
true
poet
,
"
which
be
high
praise
from
her
husband
.




now
eight
candle
be
stand
down
the
table
,
and
after
the
first
stoop


the
flame
stand
upright
and
draw
with
they
into
visibility
the
long


table
entire
,
and
in
the
middle
a
yellow
and
purple
dish
of
fruit
.
what


have
she
do
with
it
,
Mrs.
Ramsay
wonder
,
for
Rose
's
arrangement
of


the
grape
and
pear
,
of
the
horny
pink
-
line
shell
,
of
the
banana
,


make
she
think
of
a
trophy
fetch
from
the
bottom
of
the
sea
,
of


Neptune
's
banquet
,
of
the
bunch
that
hang
with
vine
leave
over
the


shoulder
of
Bacchus
 
in
some
picture
,
among
the
leopard
skin
and
the


torch
lollop
red
and
gold
...
thus
bring
up
suddenly
into
the


light
it
seem
possess
of
great
size
and
depth
,
be
like
a
world
in


which
one
could
take
one
's
staff
and
climb
hill
,
she
think
,
and
go


down
into
valley
,
and
to
her
pleasure
 
for
it
bring
they
into


sympathy
momentarily
 
she
see
that
Augustus
too
feast
his
eye
on
the


same
plate
of
fruit
,
plunge
in
,
break
off
a
bloom
there
,
a
tassel


here
,
and
return
,
after
feast
,
to
his
hive
.
that
be
his
way
of


look
,
different
from
hers
.
but
look
together
unite
they
.




now
all
the
candle
be
light
up
,
and
the
face
on
both
side
of
the


table
be
bring
near
by
the
candle
light
,
and
compose
,
as
they


have
not
be
in
the
twilight
,
into
a
party
round
a
table
,
for
the
night


be
now
shut
off
by
pane
of
glass
,
which
,
far
from
give
any
accurate


view
of
the
outside
world
,
ripple
it
so
strangely
that
here
,
inside


the
room
,
seem
to
be
order
and
dry
land
;
there
,
outside
,
a
reflection


in
which
thing
wave
and
vanish
,
waterily
.




some
change
at
once
go
through
they
all
,
as
if
this
have
really


happen
,
and
they
be
all
conscious
of
make
a
party
together
in
a


hollow
,
on
an
island
;
have
their
common
cause
against
that
fluidity
out


there
.
Mrs.
Ramsay
,
who
have
be
uneasy
,
wait
for
Paul
and
Minta
to


come
in
,
and
unable
,
she
feel
,
to
settle
to
thing
,
now
feel
she


uneasiness
change
to
expectation
.
for
now
they
must
come
,
and
Lily


Briscoe
,
try
to
analyse
the
cause
of
the
sudden
exhilaration
,


compare
it
with
that
moment
on
the
tennis
lawn
,
when
solidity
suddenly


vanish
,
and
such
vast
space
lie
between
they
;
and
now
the
same


effect
be
get
by
the
many
candle
in
the

a
sound
of


lamentation

in
her
large
brown

;
but
afterwards
she
get
on
perfectly
,
and
make
herself
out
even


more
ignorant
than

sometimes
she

;


sometimes

she
never

;
they
be
engaged
.
and


for
a
moment
she
feel
what
she
have
never
expect
to
feel
again
-


jealousy
.
for
he
,
her
husband
,
feel
it
too
-
Minta
's
glow
;

these
girl
,
these
golden
-
reddish
girl
,
with
something

,


something
a
little
wild
and
harum
-
scarum
about
they
,
who
do
n't


'
scrape
their
hair
off
,
"
be

,
as
he
say
about
poor
Lily
Briscoe
,


'
skimpy
"
.
there
be
some
quality
which
she
herself
have
not
,
some


lustre
,
some
richness
,
which
attract
he
,
amuse
he
,
lead
he
to
make


favourite
of
girl
like
Minta
.
they
might
cut
his
hair
from
he
,


plait
he
watch
-
chain
,
or
interrupt
he
at
his
work
,
hail
he
 
she


hear
they

and
out
he
come
to
play
tennis
.




but
indeed
she
be
not
jealous
,
only
,
now
and
then
,
when
she
make


herself
look
in
her
glass
,
a
little
resentful
that
she
have
grow
old
,


perhaps
,
by
her
own
fault
.
 
the
bill
for
the
greenhouse
and
all
the


rest
of
it
.
 
she
be
grateful
to
they
for

at
he
.
 
"
how

"
and
so
on
,
till
he
seem
a


young
man
;
a
man
very
attractive
to
woman
,
not
burden
,
not
weigh


down
with
the
greatness
of
his
labour
and
the
sorrow
of
the
world
and


his
fame
or
his
failure
,
but
again
as
she

exquisite
scent
of

from

great
brown

three

into
the
soft
mass
,
to


choose
a
specially
tender
piece
for
William

she
peer
into


the
dish
,
with
its
shiny
wall
and
its
confusion
of
savoury
brown
and


yellow
meat
and
its
bay
leave
and
its
wine
,
and

one
profound
-
for
what
could
be
more
serious
than
the
love


of

what
more

on
by
her
sense
that


William

affection
have
come
back
to
she
,
and
that
everything
be
all


right
again
,
and
that
her
suspense
be
over

that
now

free


both
to
triumph
and
to
mock
,
she
laugh
,
she
gesticulate
,
till
Lily

,
how
childlike
,
how
absurd

up
there
with

her
beauty

again
in

something
frightening
about

be
irresistible
.


always

get
her

a
spell
on
they
all
,
by
wish
,
so


simply
,
so
directly
,
and
Lily
contrast
that
abundance
with
her
own


poverty
of
spirit
,
and
suppose
that
it
be
partly
that
belief
 
for
she


face
be
all
light
up
-
without
look
young
,
she
look
radiant
 
in
this


strange
,
this
terrifying
thing
,

how
in
the
dawn
on
the
beach

the
one
to


pounce
on

the
odd
chuckle


he
gave

cruelty
,
its

,
catch
sight
of
the
salt
cellar
on
the


pattern
,
she
need
not
marry
,
thank
Heaven
:
she
need
not
undergo
that


degradation
.
she
be
save
from
that
dilution
.
she
would
move
the
tree


rather
more
to
the
middle
.




such
be
the
complexity
of
thing
.
for
what
happen
to
she
,


especially
stay
with
the
Ramsays
,
be
to
be
make
to
feel
violently


two
opposite
thing
at
the
same
time
;
that
be
what
you
feel
,
be
one
;


that
be
what
I
feel
,
be
the
other
,
and
then
they
fight
together
in
she


mind
,
as
now
.
it
be
so
beautiful
,
so
exciting
,
this
love
,
that
I


tremble
on
the
verge
of
it
,
and
offer
,
quite
out
of
my
own
habit
,
to


look
for
a
brooch
on
a
beach
;
also
it
be
the
stupid
,
the
most


barbaric
of
human
passion
,
and
turn
a
nice
young
man
with
a
profile


like
a
gem
's
 
Paul
's
be
exquisite
 
into
a
bully
with
a
crowbar
 
he


be
swagger
,
he
be
insolent
 
in
the
Mile
End
Road
.
yet
,
she
say
to


herself
,
from
the
dawn
of
time
ode
have
be
sing
to
love
;
wreath


heaped
and
rose
;
and
if
you
ask
nine
people
out
of
ten
they
would


say
they
want
nothing
but
this
-
love
;
while
the
woman
,
judge
from


her
own
experience
,
would
all
the
time
be
feel
,
this
be
not
what
we


want
;
there
be
nothing
more
tedious
,
puerile
,
and
inhumane
than
this
;


yet
it
be
also
beautiful
and
necessary
.
well
then
,
well
then
?
she


ask
,
somehow
expect
the
other
to
go
on
with
the
argument
,
as
if


in
an
argument
like
this
one
throw
one
's
own
little
bolt
which
fall


short
obviously
and
leave
the
other
to
carry
it
on
.
so
she
listen


again
to
what
they
be
say
in
case
they
should
throw
any
light
upon


the
question
of
love
.




"
then
,
"
say
Mr.
Bankes
,
"
there
be
that
liquid
the
english
call
coffee
.
"




"
oh
,
coffee
!
"
say
Mrs.
Ramsay
.
but
it
be
much
rather
a
question
 
she


be
thoroughly
rouse
,
Lily
could
see
,
and
talk
very
emphatically
 
of


real
butter
and
clean
milk
.
speak
with
warmth
and
eloquence
,
she


describe
the
iniquity
of
the
english
dairy
system
,
and
in
what
state


milk
be
deliver
at
the
door
,
and
be
about
to
prove
her
charge
,
for


she
have
go
into
the
matter
,
when
all
round
the
table
,
begin
with


Andrew
in
the
middle
,
like
a
fire
leap
from
tuft
to
tuft
of
furze
,


her
child
laugh
;
her
husband
laugh
;
she
be
laugh
at
,
fire-


encircled
,
and
force
to
veil
her
crest
,
dismount
her
battery
,
and


only
retaliate
by
display
the
raillery
and
ridicule
of
the
table


to
Mr.
Bankes
as
an
example
of
what
one
suffer
if
one
attack
the


prejudice
of
the
British
Public
.




purposely
,
however
,
for
she
have
it
on
her
mind
that
Lily
,
who
have


help
she
with
Mr.
Tansley
,
be
out
of
thing
,
she
exempt
she
from


the
rest
;
say
"
lily
anyhow
agree
with
I
,
"
and
so
draw
she
in
,
a


little
fluttered
,
a
little
startled
.
 
for
she
be
think
about


love
.
 
they
be
both
out
of
thing
,
Mrs.
Ramsay
have
be
think
,


both
Lily
and
Charles
Tansley
.
both
suffer
from
the
glow
of
the


other
two
.
he
,
it
be
clear
,
feel
himself
utterly
in
the
cold
;
no


woman
would
look
at
he
with
Paul
Rayley
in
the
room
.
poor
fellow
!


still
,
he
have
his
dissertation
,
the
influence
of
somebody
upon


something
:
he
could
take
care
of
himself
.
with
Lily
it
be
different
.


she
fade
,
under
Minta
's
glow
;
become
more
inconspicuous
than
ever
,
in


her
little
grey
dress
with
her
little
puckered
face
and
her
little


chinese
eye
.
everything
about
she
be
so
small
.
yet
,
think
Mrs.


ramsay
,
compare
she
with
Minta
,
as
she
claim
her
help
 
for
Lily


should
bear
she
out
she
talk
no
more
about
her
dairy
than
she


husband
do
about
his
boot
-
he
would
talk
by
the
hour
about
his
boot


of
the
two
,
Lily
at
forty
will
be
the
well
.
there
be
in
Lily
a


thread
of
something
;
a
flare
of
something
;
something
of
her
own
which


Mrs.
Ramsay
like
very
much
indeed
,
but
no
man
would
,
she
fear
.


obviously
,
not
,
unless
it
be
a
much
old
man
,
like
William
Bankes
.


but
then
he
care
,
well
,
Mrs.
Ramsay
sometimes
think
that
he
care
,


since
his
wife
's
death
,
perhaps
for
she
.
he
be
not
"
in
love
"
of


course
;
it
be
one
of
those
unclassified
affection
of
which
there
be


so
many
.
oh
,
but
nonsense
,
she
think
;
William
must
marry
Lily
.
they


have
so
many
thing
in
common
.
Lily
be
so
fond
of
flower
.
they
be


both
cold
and
aloof
and
rather
self
-
sufficing
.
she
must
arrange
for


they
to
take
a
long
walk
together
.




foolishly
,
she
have
set
they
opposite
each
other
.
that
could
be
remedied


tomorrow
.
if
it
be
fine
,
they
should
go
for
a
picnic
.
everything


seem
possible
.
everything
seem
right
.
just
now
 
but
this
can
not


last
,
she
think
,
dissociate
herself
from
the
moment
while
they
be


all
talk
about
boot
 
just
now
she
have
reach
security
;
she
hover


like
a
hawk
suspend
;
like
a
flag
float
in
an
element
of
joy
which


fill
every
nerve
of
her
body
fully
and
sweetly
,
not
noisily
,
solemnly


rather
,
for
it
arise
,
she
think
,
look
at
they
all
eat
there
,


from
husband
and
child
and
friend
;
all
of
which
rise
in
this


profound
stillness
 
she
be
help
William
Bankes
to
one
very
small


piece
more
,
and
peer
into
the
depth
of
the
earthenware
pot
 
seem


now
for
no
special
reason
to
stay
there
like
a
smoke
,
like
a
fume


rise
upwards
,
hold
they
safe
together
.
nothing
need
be
say
;


nothing
could
be
say
.
there
it
be
,
all
round
they
.
it
partook
,
she


feel
,
carefully
help
Mr.
Bankes
to
a
specially
tender
piece
,
of


eternity
;
as
she
have
already
feel
about
something
different
once
before


that
afternoon
;
there
be
a
coherence
in
thing
,
a
stability
;
something
,


she
mean
,
be
immune
from
change
,
and
shine
out
 
she
glance
at
the


window
with
its
ripple
of
reflect
light
 
in
the
face
of
the
flowing
,


the
fleeting
,
the
spectral
,
like
a
ruby
;
so
that
again
tonight
she
have


the
feeling
she
have
have
once
today
,
already
,
of
peace
,
of
rest
.
of


such
moment
,
she
think
,
the
thing
be
make
that
endure
.




"
yes
,
"
she
assure
William
Bankes
,
"
there
be
plenty
for
everybody
.
"




"
Andrew
,
"
she
say
,
"
hold
your
plate
low
,
or
I
shall
spill
it
.
"
 
the


BOEUF
EN
DAUBE
be
a
perfect
triumph
.
 
here
,
she
feel
,
put
the


spoon
down
,
where
one
could
move
or
rest
;
could
wait
now
 
they
be
all


help
 
listen
;
could
then
,
like
a
hawk
which
lapse
suddenly
from


its
high
station
,
flaunt
and
sink
on
laughter
easily
,
rest
her
whole


weight
upon
what
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
her
husband

about
the
square
root
of
one
thousand
two
hundred
and
fifty

three
.


that

the
number

,
on
his
watch
.




what
do
it
all
mean
?
to
this
day
she
have
no
notion

what
be
that
?
her
son

.
she
leant
on
they
;
on
cube
and
square


root
;
that

what
they

;
on

's
Memoirs
:
she
let
it
uphold


she
and
sustain
she
,
this
admirable
fabric
of
the
masculine


intelligence
,
which
run
up
and
down
,
cross
this
way
and
that
,
like


iron
girder
span
the
swaying
fabric
,
uphold
the
world
,
so
that


she
could
trust
herself
to
it
utterly
,
even
shut
her
eye
,
or
flicker


they
for
a
moment
,
as
a
child
stare
up
from
its
pillow
wink
at
the


myriad
layer
of
the
leave
of
a
tree
.
then
she
wake
up
.
it
be
still


be
fabricate
.
William
Bankes
be
praise
the
waverly
novel
.




he
read
one
of
they
every
six
month
,
he
say
.
and
why
should
that
make


Charles
Tansley
angry
?
he
rush
in
 
all
,
think
Mrs.
Ramsay
,
because


Prue
will
not
be
nice
to
he
 
and
denounce
the
waverly
novel
when
he


know
nothing
about
it
,
nothing
about
it
whatsoever
,
Mrs.
Ramsay
think
,


observe
he
rather
than
listen
to
what
he
say
.
she
could
see
how


it
be
from
his
manner
-
he
want
to
assert
himself
,
and
so
it
would


always
be
with
he
till
he
get
his
Professorship
or
marry
his
wife
,


and
so
need
not
be
always
say
,
"
i
-
I
-
I.
"
for
that
be
what
his


criticism
of
poor
Sir
Walter
,
or
perhaps
it
be
Jane
Austen
,
amount


to
.
"
I
-
-I
-
-I.
"
he
be
think
of
himself
and
the
impression
he


be
make
,
as
she
could
tell
by
the
sound
of
his
voice
,
and
his


emphasis
and
his
uneasiness
.
success
would
be
good
for
he
.
at
any


rate
they
be
off
again
.
now
she
need
not
listen
.
it
could
not
last
,


she
know
,
but
at
the
moment
her
eye
be
so
clear
that
they
seem
to


go
round
the
table
unveil
each
of
these
people
,
and
their
thought


and
their
feeling
,
without
effort
like
a
light
steal
under
water
so


that
its
ripple
and
the
reed
in
it
and
the
minnow
balance


themselves
,
and
the
sudden
silent
trout
be
all
light
up
hang
,


tremble
.
so
she
see
they
;
she
hear
they
;
but
whatever
they
say
have


also
this
quality
,
as
if
what
they
say
be
like
the
movement
of
a


trout
when
,
at
the
same
time
,
one
can
see
the
ripple
and
the
gravel
,


something
to
the
right
,
something
to
the
left
;
and
the
whole
be
hold


together
;
for
whereas
in
active
life
she
would
be
net
and


separate
one
thing
from
another
;
she
would
be
say
she
like
the


waverly
novel
or
have
not
read
they
;
she
would
be
urge
herself


forward
;
now
she
say
nothing
.
for
the
moment
,
she
hang
suspend
.




"
ah
,
but
how
long
do
you
think
it
'll
last
?
"
say
somebody
.
it
be
as


if
she
have
antennae
tremble
out
from
she
,
which
,
intercept
certain


sentence
,
force
they
upon
her
attention
.
this
be
one
of
they
.
she


scented
danger
for
her
husband
.
a
question
like
that
would
lead
,


almost
certainly
,
to
something
be
say
which
remind
he
of
his
own


failure
.
how
long
would
he
be
read
-
he
would
think
at
once
.
William


Bankes
 
who
be
entirely
free
from
all
such
vanity
 
laugh
,
and
say


he
attach
no
importance
to
change
in
fashion
.
who
could
tell
what


be
go
to
last
-
in
literature
or
indeed
in
anything
else
?




"
let
we
enjoy
what
we
do
enjoy
,
"
he
say
.
his
integrity
seem
to
Mrs.


ramsay
quite
admirable
.
he
never
seem
for
a
moment
to
think
,
but
how


do
this
affect
I
?
but
then
if
you
have
the
other
temperament
,
which


must
have
praise
,
which
must
have
encouragement
,
naturally
you
begin


 
and
she
know
that
Mr.
Ramsay
be
begin
 
to
be
uneasy
;
to
want


somebody
to
say
,
oh
,
but
your
work
will
last
,
Mr.
Ramsay
,
or
something


like
that
.
he
show
his
uneasiness
quite
clearly
now
by
say
,
with


some
irritation
,
that
,
anyhow
,
Scott
 
or
be
it
shakespeare
?
 
would


last
he
his
lifetime
.
he
say
it
irritably
.
everybody
,
she
think
,


feel
a
little
uncomfortable
,
without
know
why
.
then
Minta
Doyle
,


whose
instinct
be
fine
,
say
bluffly
,
absurdly
,
that
she
do
not


believe
that
any
one
really
enjoy
read
Shakespeare
.
Mr.
Ramsay


say
grimly
 
but
his
mind
be
turn
away
again
 
that
very
few
people


like
it
as
much
as
they
say
they
do
.
but
,
he
add
,
there
be


considerable
merit
in
some
of
the
play
nevertheless
,
and
Mrs.
Ramsay


see
that
it
would
be
all
right
for
the
moment
anyhow
;
he
would
laugh
at


Minta
,
and
she
,
Mrs.
Ramsay
see
,
realise
his
extreme
anxiety
about


himself
,
would
,
in
her
own
way
,
see
that
he
be
take
care
of
,
and


praise
he
,
somehow
or
other
.
but
she
wish
it
be
not
necessary
:


perhaps
it
be
her
fault
that
it
be
necessary
.
anyhow
,
she
be
free


now
to
listen
to
what
Paul
Rayley
be
try
to
say
about
book
one
have


read
as
a
boy
.
they
last
,
he
say
.
he
have
read
some
of
Tolstoi
at


school
.
there
be
one
he
always
remember
,
but
he
have
forget
the


name
.
russian
name
be
impossible
,
say
Mrs.
Ramsay
.
"
Vronsky
,
"
say


Paul
.
he
remember
that
because
he
always
think
it
such
a
good
name


for
a
villain
.
"
Vronsky
,
"
say
Mrs.
Ramsay
;
"
oh
,
ANNA
KARENINA
,
"
but


that
do
not
take
they
very
far
;
book
be
not
in
their
line
.
no
,


Charles
Tansley
would
put
they
both
right
in
a
second
about
book
,
but


it
be
all
so
mixed
up
with
,
be
I
say
the
right
thing
?
be
I
make


a
good
impression
?
that
,
after
all
,
one
know
more
about
he
than


about
Tolstoi
,
whereas
,
what
Paul
say
be
about
the
thing
,
simply
,
not


himself
,
nothing
else
.
like
all
stupid
people
,
he
have
a
kind
of


modesty
too
,
a
consideration
for
what
you
be
feel
,
which
,
once
in


a
way
at
least
,
she
find
attractive
.
now
he
be
think
,
not
about


himself
,
or
about
Tolstoi
,
but
whether
she
be
cold
,
whether
she
feel
a


draught
,
whether
she
would
like
a
pear
.




no
,
she
say
,
she
do
not
want
a
pear
.
indeed
she
have
be
keep


guard
over
the
dish
of
fruit
 
without
realise
it
 
jealously
,
hope


that
nobody
would
touch
it
.
her
eye
have
be
go
in
and
out
among


the
curve
and
shadow
of
the
fruit
,
among
the
rich
purple
of
the


lowland
grape
,
then
over
the
horny
ridge
of
the
shell
,
put
a


yellow
against
a
purple
,
a
curved
shape
against
a
round
shape
,
without


know
why
she
do
it
,
or
why
,
every
time
she
do
it
,
she
feel
more


and
more
serene
;
until
,
oh
,
what
a
pity
that
they
should
do
it
-
a
hand


reach
out
,
take
a
pear
,
and
spoilt
the
whole
thing
.
in
sympathy
she


look
at
Rose
.
she
look
at
Rose
sit
between
Jasper
and
Prue
.


how
odd
that
one
's
child
should
do
that
!




how
odd
to
see
they
sit
there
,
in
a
row
,
her
child
,
Jasper
,


Rose
,
Prue
,
Andrew
,
almost
silent
,
but
with
some
joke
of
their
own


go
on
,
she
guess
,
from
the
twitching
at
their
lip
.
it
be


something
quite
apart
from
everything
else
,
something
they
be


hoard
up
to
laugh
over
in
their
own
room
.
it
be
not
about
their


father
,
she
hope
.
no
,
she
think
not
.
what
be
it
,
she
wonder
,


sadly
rather
,
for
it
seem
to
she
that
they
would
laugh
when
she
be


not
there
.
there
be
all
that
hoard
behind
those
rather
set
,
still
,


mask
-
like
face
,
for
they
do
not
join
in
easily
;
they
be
like


watcher
,
surveyor
,
a
little
raise
or
set
apart
from
the
grow
-
up


people
.
but
when
she
look
at
Prue
tonight
,
she
see
that
this
be


not
now
quite
true
of
she
.
she
be
just
begin
,
just
move
,


just
descend
.
the
faint
light
be
on
her
face
,
as
if
the


glow
of
Minta
opposite
,
some
excitement
,
some
anticipation
of
happiness


be
reflect
in
she
,
as
if
the
sun
of
the
love
of
man
and
woman
rise


over
the
rim
of
the
table
-
cloth
,
and
without
know
what
it
be
she


bent
towards
it
and
greet
it
.
she
keep
look
at
Minta
,
shyly
,
yet


curiously
,
so
that
Mrs.
Ramsay
look
from
one
to
the
other
and
say
,


speak
to
Prue
in
her
own
mind
,
you
will
be
as
happy
as
she
be
one
of


these
day
.
you
will
be
much
happy
,
she
add
,
because
you
be
my


daughter
,
she
mean
;
her
own
daughter
must
be
happy
than
other


people
's
daughter
.
but
dinner
be
over
.
it
be
time
to
go
.
they


be
only
play
with
thing
on
their
plate
.
she
would
wait
until


they
have
do
laugh
at
some
story
her
husband
be
tell
.
he
be


have
a
joke
with
Minta
about
a
bet
.
then
she
would
get
up
.




she
like
Charles
Tansley
,
she
think
,
suddenly
;
she
like
his
laugh
.


she
like
he
for
be
so
angry
with
Paul
and
Minta
.
she
like
his


awkwardness
.
there
be
a
lot
in
that
young
man
after
all
.
and
Lily
,


she
think
,
put
her
napkin
beside
her
plate
,
she
always
have
some


joke
of
her
own
.
one
need
never
bother
about
Lily
.
she
wait
.
she


tuck
her
napkin
under
the
edge
of
her
plate
.
well
,
be
they
do


now
?
no
.
that
story
have
lead
to
another
story
.
her
husband
be
in


great
spirit
tonight
,
and
wish
,
she
suppose
,
to
make
it
all
right


with
old
Augustus
after
that
scene
about
the
soup
,
have
draw
he
in
-


they
be
tell
story
about
some
one
they
have
both
know
at


college
.
she
look
at
the
window
in
which
the
candle
flame
burn


bright
now
that
the
pane
be
black
,
and
look
at
that
outside


the
voice
come
to
she
very
strangely
,
as
if
they
be
voice
at
a


service
in
a
cathedral
,
for
she
do
not
listen
to
the
word
.
the


sudden
burst
of
laughter
and
then
one
voice
 
Minta
's
 
speak


alone
,
remind
she
of
man
and
boy
cry
out
the
latin
word


of
a
service
in
some
roman
catholic
cathedral
.
she
wait
.
she


husband
speak
.
he
be
repeat
something
,
and
she
know
it
be
poetry


from
the
rhythm
and
the
ring
of
exultation
,
and
melancholy
in
his


voice
:




come
out
and
climb
the
garden
path
,
Luriana
Lurilee
.


the
China
rise
be
all
abloom
and
buzz
with
the
yellow
bee
.




the
word
 
she
be
look
at
the
window
 
sound
as
if
they
be


float
like
flower
on
water
out
there
,
cut
off
from
they
all
,
as
if


no
one
have
say
they
,
but
they
have
come
into
existence
of
themselves
.






and
all
the
life
we
ever
live
and
all
the
life
to
be


be
full
of
tree
and
change
leave
.






she
do
not
know
what
they
mean
,
but
,
like
music
,
the
word
seem
to


be
speak
by
her
own
voice
,
outside
her
self
,
say
quite
easily
and


naturally
what
have
be
in
her
mind
the
whole
evening
while
she
say


different
thing
.
she
know
,
without
look
round
,
that
every
one
at


the
table
be
listen
to
the
voice
say
:




I
wonder
if
it
seem
to
you
,
Luriana
,
Lurilee




with
the
same
sort
of
relief
and
pleasure
that
she
have
,
as
if
this


be
,
at
last
,
the
natural
thing
to
say
,
this
be
their
own
voice


speak
.




but
the
voice
have
stop
.
she
look
round
.
she
make
herself
get
up
.


Augustus
Carmichael
have
rise
and
,
hold
his
table
napkin
so
that
it


look
like
a
long
white
robe
he
stand
chant
:




to
see
the
king
go
ride
by


over
lawn
and
daisy
lea


with
their
palm
leave
and
cedar


Luriana
,
Lurilee
,




and
as
she
pass
he
,
he
turn
slightly
towards
she
repeat
the


last
word
:




Luriana
,
Lurilee




and
bow
to
she
as
if
he
do
her
homage
.
without
know
why
,
she


feel
that
he
like
she
well
than
he
ever
have
do
before
;
and
with
a


feeling
of
relief
and
gratitude
she
return
his
bow
and
pass
through


the
door
which
he
hold
open
for
she
.




it
be
necessary
now
to
carry
everything
a
step
far
.
with
her
foot


on
the
threshold
she
wait
a
moment
long
in
a
scene
which
be


vanish
even
as
she
look
,
and
then
,
as
she
move
and
take
Minta
's


arm
and
leave
the
room
,
it
change
,
it
shape
itself
differently
;
it
have


become
,
she
know
,
give
one
last
look
at
it
over
her
shoulder
,
already


the
past
.






18






as
usual
,
Lily
think
.
there
be
always
something
that
have
to
be
do


at
that
precise
moment
,
something
that
Mrs.
Ramsay
have
decide
for


reason
of
her
own
to
do
instantly
,
it
might
be
with
every
one
stand


about
make
joke
,
as
now
,
not
be
able
to
decide
whether
they
be


go
into
the
smoking
-
room
,
into
the
drawing
-
room
,
up
to
the
attic
.


then
one
see
Mrs.
Ramsay
in
the
midst
of
this
hubbub
stand
there
with


Minta
's
arm
in
hers
,
bethink
she
,
"
yes
,
it
be
time
for
that
now
,
"
and


so
make
off
at
once
with
an
air
of
secrecy
to
do
something
alone
.
and


directly
she
go
a
sort
of
disintegration
set
in
;
they
waver
about
,


go
different
way
,
Mr.
Bankes
take
Charles
Tansley
by
the
arm
and
go


off
to
finish
on
the
terrace
the
discussion
they
have
begin
at
dinner


about
politic
,
thus
give
a
turn
to
the
whole
poise
of
the
evening
,


make
the
weight
fall
in
a
different
direction
,
as
if
,
Lily
think
,


see
they
go
,
and
hear
a
word
or
two
about
the
policy
of
the


Labour
Party
,
they
have
go
up
on
to
the
bridge
of
the
ship
and
be


take
their
bearing
;
the
change
from
poetry
to
politic
strike
she


like
that
;
so
Mr.
Bankes
and
Charles
Mrs.
Ramsay
go
upstairs
in
the


lamplight
alone
.
where
,
Lily
wonder
,
be
she
go
so
quickly
?




not
that
she
do
in
fact
run
or
hurry
;
she
go
indeed
rather
slowly
.


she
feel
rather
inclined
just
for
a
moment
to
stand
still
after
all


that
chatter
,
and
pick
out
one
particular
thing
;
the
thing
that


matter
;
to
detach
it
;
separate
it
off
;
clean
it
of
all
the
emotion


and
odd
and
end
of
thing
,
and
so
hold
it
before
she
,
and
bring
it
to


the
tribunal
where
,
range
about
in
conclave
,
sit
the
judge
she
have


set
up
to
decide
these
thing
.
be
it
good
,
be
it
bad
,
be
it
right
or


wrong
?
where
be
we
all
go
to
?
and
so
on
.
so
she
right


herself
after
the
shock
of
the
event
,
and
quite
unconsciously
and


incongruously
,
use
the
branch
of
the
elm
tree
outside
to
help
she


to
stabilise
her
position
.
her
world
be
change
:
they
be
still
.


the
event
have
give
she
a
sense
of
movement
.
all
must
be
in
order
.


she
must
get
that
right
and
that
right
,
she
think
,
insensibly


approve
of
the
dignity
of
the
tree
'
stillness
,
and
now
again
of
the


superb
upward
rise
 
like
the
beak
of
a
ship
up
a
wave
 
of
the
elm


branch
as
the
wind
raise
they
.
for
it
be
windy
 
she
stand
a
moment


to
look
out
.
it
be
windy
,
so
that
the
leave
now
and
then
brush


open
a
star
,
and
the
star
themselves
seem
to
be
shake
and
dart


light
and
try
to
flash
out
between
the
edge
of
the
leave
.
yes
,


that
be
do
then
,
accomplish
;
and
as
with
all
thing
do
,
become


solemn
.
now
one
thought
of
it
,
clear
of
chatter
and
emotion
,
it


seem
always
to
have
be
,
only
be
show
now
and
so
be
show
,


strike
everything
into
stability
.
they
would
,
she
think
,
go
on


again
,
however
long
they
live
,
come
back
to
this
night
;
this
moon
;


this
wind
;
this
house
:
and
to
she
too
.
it
flatter
she
,
where
she
be


most
susceptible
of
flattery
,
to
think
how
,
wound
about
in
their


heart
,
however
long
they
live
she
would
be
weave
;
and
this
,
and
this
,


and
this
,
she
think
,
go
upstairs
,
laugh
,
but
affectionately
,
at


the
sofa
on
the
landing
 
her
mother
's
;
at
the
rocking
-
chair
 
she


father
's
;
at
the
map
of
the
Hebrides
.
all
that
would
be
revive
again


in
the
life
of
Paul
and
Minta
;
"
the
rayley
"
-
she
try
the
new
name


over
;
and
she
feel
,
with
her
hand
on
the
nursery
door
,
that
community


of
feeling
with
other
people
which
emotion
give
as
if
the
wall
of


partition
have
become
so
thin
that
practically
 
the
feeling
be
one
of


relief
and
happiness
 
it
be
all
one
stream
,
and
chair
,
table
,
map
,


be
hers
,
be
theirs
,
it
do
not
matter
whose
,
and
Paul
and
Minta


would
carry
it
on
when
she
be
dead
.




she
turn
the
handle
,
firmly
,
lest
it
should
squeak
,
and
go
in
,


purse
her
lip
slightly
,
as
if
to
remind
herself
that
she
must
not


speak
aloud
.
but
directly
she
come
in
she
see
,
with
annoyance
,
that
the


precaution
be
not

.
the
child
be
not
asleep
.
it
be
most


annoying
.
Mildred
should
be
more
careful
.
there
be
James
wide
awake


and
Cam
sitting
bolt
upright
,
and
Mildred

but
Mildred

.
what
have
possess
Edward
to
send
they
this
horrid


skull

she
have
be
so
foolish
as
to
let
they

it
up
there
.
it


be
nail
fast
,
Mildred

,
and
Cam

n't
 
go
to

with
it
in


the
room
,
and
James
scream
if

horn
,
Cam

,
all
over


the
room
.
it
be
true
.
wherever
they

light
 
and
James
could


not
sleep
without
a
light
 
there
be
always
a
shadow
somewhere
.




"
but
think
,
Cam
,

be
only
an
old
pig
,
"
say
Mrs.
Ramsay
,
"

nice
black


pig
like
the
pig

be
a
horrid
thing
,


branch
at
she
all
over
the
room
.




"
well
then
,
"
say
Mrs.
Ramsay
,
"
we
will
cover
it
up
,
"
and
they
all


watch
she
go
to
the
chest
of
drawer
,
and
open
the
little
drawer


quickly
one
after
another
,
and
not
see
anything
that
would
do
,
she


quickly
take
her
own
shawl
off
and
wound
it
round
the
skull
,
round
and


round
and
round
,
and
then
she
come
back
to
Cam
and
lay
her
head
almost


flat
on
the
pillow
beside
Cam
's
and
say
how
lovely
it
look
now
;
how


the
fairy
would
love
it
;
it
be
like
a
bird
's
nest
;
it
be
like
a


beautiful
mountain
such
as
she
have
see
abroad
,
with
valley
and


flower
and
bell
ring
and
bird
singing
and
little
goat
and


antelope
and
...
she
could
see
the
word
echo
as
she
speak
they


rhythmically
in
Cam
's
mind
,
and
Cam
be
repeat
after
she
how
it
be


like
a
mountain
,
a
bird
's
nest
,
a
garden
,
and
there
be
little


antelope
,
and
her
eye
be
open
and
shutting
,
and
Mrs.
Ramsay
go


on
speak
still
more
monotonously
,
and
more
rhythmically
and
more


nonsensically
,
how
she
must
shut
her
eye
and
go
to
sleep
and
dream
of


mountain
and
valley
and
star
fall
and
parrot
and
antelope
and


garden
,
and
everything
lovely
,
she
say
,
raise
her
head
very
slowly


and
speak
more
and
more
mechanically
,
until
she
sit
upright
and
see


that
Cam
be
asleep
.




now
,
she
whisper
,
cross
over
to
his
bed
,
James
must
go
to
sleep


too
,
for
see
,
she
say
,
the
boar
's
skull
be
still
there
;
they
have
not


touch
it
;
they
have
do
just
what
he
want
;
it
be
there
quite


unhurt
.
he
make
sure
that
the
skull
be
still
there
under
the
shawl
.


but
he
want
to
ask
she
something
more
.
would
they
go
to
the
lighthouse


tomorrow
?




no
,
not
tomorrow
,
she
say
,
but
soon
,
she
promise
he
;
the
next
fine


day
.
he
be
very
good
.
he
lie
down
.
she
cover
he
up
.
but
he


would
never
forget
,
she
know
,
and
she
feel
angry
with
Charles
Tansley
,


with
her
husband
,
and
with
herself
,
for
she
have
raise
his
hope
.
then


feel
for
her
shawl
and
remember
that
she
have
wrap
it
round
the


boar
's
skull
,
she
get
up
,
and
pull
the
window
down
another
inch
or


two
,
and
hear
the
wind
,
and
get
a
breath
of
the
perfectly
indifferent


chill
night
air
and
murmur
good
night
to
Mildred
and
leave
the
room


and
let
the
tongue
of
the
door
slowly
lengthen
in
the
lock
and
go


out
.




she
hope
he
would
not
bang
his
book
on
the
floor
above
their
head
,


she
think
,
still
think
how
annoying
Charles
Tansley
be
.
for


neither
of
they
sleep
well
;
they
be
excitable
child
,
and
since
he


say
thing
like
that
about
the
lighthouse
,
it
seem
to
her
likely


that
he
would
knock
a
pile
of
book
over
,
just
as
they
be
go
to


sleep
,
clumsily
sweep
they
off
the
table
with
his
elbow
.
for
she


suppose
that
he
have
go
upstairs
to
work
.
yet
he
look
so
desolate
;


yet
she
would
feel
relieved
when
he
go
;
yet
she
would
see
that
he
be


well
treat
tomorrow
;
yet
he
be
admirable
with
her
husband
;
yet
his


manner
certainly
want
improve
;
yet
she
like
his
laugh
-
think


this
,
as
she
come
downstairs
,
she
notice
that
she
could
now
see
the


moon
itself
through
the
staircase
window
-
the
yellow
harvest
moon
-


and
turn
,
and
they
see
she
,
stand
above
they
on
the
stair
.




"
that
be
my
mother
,
"
think
prue
.
yes
;
Minta
should
look
at
she
;
Paul


Rayley
should
look
at
she
.
that
be
the
thing
itself
,
she
feel
,
as
if


there
be
only
one
person
like
that
in
the
world
;
her
mother
.
and
,


from
having
be
quite
grow
up
,
a
moment
before
,
talk
with
the


other
,
she
become
a
child
again
,
and
what
they
have
be
do
be
a


game
,
and
would
her
mother
sanction
their
game
,
or
condemn
it
,
she


wonder
.
and
think
what
a
chance
it
be
for
Minta
and
Paul
and


lily
to
see
she
,
and
feel
what
an
extraordinary
stroke
of
fortune
it


be
for
she
,
to
have
she
,
and
how
she
would
never
grow
up
and
never


leave
home
,
she
say
,
like
a
child
,
"
we
think
of
go
down
to
the


beach
to
watch
the
wave

instantly

for
no
reason

not
like
to
think
of
he
so
,


and
wonder
if
they
have
guess
at
dinner
why
he
suddenly
become


irritable
when
they
talk
about
fame
and
book
last
,
wonder
if


the
child
be
laugh
at
that
,
she
twitch
the
stocking
out
,
and


all
the
fine
graving
came
draw
with
steel
instrument
about
her
lip


and
forehead
,
and
she
grow
still
like
a
tree
which
have
be
toss
and


quiver
and
now
,
when
the
breeze
fall
,
settle
,
leaf
by
leaf
,
into


quiet
.




it
do
n't
 
matter
,
any
of
it
,
she
think
.
a
great
man
,
a
great
book
,


fame
-
who
could
tell
?
she
know
nothing
about
it
.
but
it
be
his
way


with
he
,
his
truthfulness
-
for
instance
at
dinner
she
have
be


think
quite
instinctively
,
if
only
he
would
speak
!
she
have
complete


trust
in
he
.
and
dismiss
all
this
,
as
one
pass
in
diving
now
a


weed
,
now
a
straw
,
now
a
bubble
,
she
feel
again
,
sink
deeply
,
as
she


have
feel
in
the
hall
when
the
other
be
talk
,
there
be
something
I


want
-
something
I
have
come
to
get
,
and
she
fall
deeply
and
deep


without
know
quite
what
it
be
,
with
her
eye
close
.
and
she


wait
a
little
,
knitting
,
wonder
,
and
slowly
rise
those
word
they


have
say
at
dinner
,
"
the
China
rise
be
all
abloom
and
buzz
with
the


honey
bee
,
"
begin
wash
from
side
to
side
of
her
mind
rhythmically
,


and
as
they
wash
,
word
,
like
little
shaded
light
,
one
red
,
one


blue
,
one
yellow
,
light
up
in
the
dark
of
her
mind
,
and
seem
leave


their
perch
up
there
to
fly
across
and
across
,
or
to
cry
out
and
to


be
echo
;
so
she
turn
and
feel
on
the
table
beside
she
for
a
book
.






and
all
the
life
we
ever
live


and
all
the
life
to
be
,


be
full
of
tree
and
change
leave
,






she
murmur
,
stick
her
needle
into
the
stocking
.
and
she
open


the
book
and
begin
read
here
and
there
at
random
,
and
as
she
do
so
,


she
feel
that
she
be
climb
backwards
,
upwards
,
shove
her
way
up


under
petal
that
curve
over
she
,
so
that
she
only
know
this
be
white
,


or
this
be
red
.
she
do
not
know
at
first
what
the
word
mean
at
all
.






Steer
,
hither
steer
your
wing
pine
,
all
beat
Mariners






she
read
and
turn
the
page
,
swinge
herself
,
zigzag
this
way
and


that
,
from
one
line
to
another
as
from
one
branch
to
another
,
from
one


red
and
white
flower
to
another
,
until
a
little
sound
rouse
she
-
she


husband
slap
his
thigh
.
their
eye
meet
for
a
second
;
but
they
do


not
want
to
speak
to
each
other
.
they
have
nothing
to
say
,
but


something
seem
,
nevertheless
,
to
go
from
he
to
she
.
it
be
the


life
,
it
be
the
power
of
it
,
it
be
the
tremendous
humour
,
she
know
,


that
make
he
slap
his
thigh
.
do
n't
 
interrupt
I
,
he
seem
to
be


say
,
do
n't
 
say
anything
;
just
sit
there
.
and
he
go
on
reading
.


his
lip
twitch
.
it
fill
he
.
it
fortify
he
.
he
clean
forgot


all
the
little
rub
and
dig
of
the
evening
,
and
how
it
bore
he


unutterably
to
sit
still
while
people
eat
and
drink
interminably
,
and


his
be
so
irritable
with
his
wife
and
so
touchy
and
mind
when


they
pass
his
book
over
as
if
they
do
n't
 
exist
at
all
.
but
now
,
he


feel
,
it
do
n't
 
matter
a
damn
who
reach
z
 
if
think
run
like
an


alphabet
from
a
to
z
.
somebody
would
reach
it
-
if
not
he
,
then


another
.
this
man
's
strength
and
sanity
,
his
feeling
for
straight


forward
simple
thing
,
these
fisherman
,
the
poor
old
craze
creature
in


Mucklebackit
's
cottage
make
he
feel
so
vigorous
,
so
relieved
of


something
that
he
feel
roused
and
triumphant
and
could
not
choke
back


his
tear
.
raise
the
book
a
little
to
hide
his
face
,
he
let
they


fall
and
shake
his
head
from
side
to
side
and
forget
himself
completely


 
but
not
one
or
two
reflection
about
morality
and
french
novel
and


english
novel
and
Scott
's
hand
be
tie
but
his
view
perhaps
be


as
true
as
the
other
view
,
forget
his
own
bother
and
failure


completely
in
poor
Steenie
's
drowning
and
Mucklebackit
's
sorrow
 
that


be
Scott
at
his
good
 
and
the
astonishing
delight
and
feeling
of


vigour
that
it
give
he
.




well
,
let
they
improve
upon
that
,
he
think
as
he
finish
the


chapter
.
he
feel
that
he
have
be
argue
with
somebody
,
and
have
get


the
well
of
he
.
they
could
not
improve
upon
that
,
whatever
they


might
say
;
and
his
own
position
become
more
secure
.
the
lover
be


fiddlestick
,
he
think
,
collect
it
all
in
his
mind
again
.
that
be


fiddlestick
,
that
be
first
-
rate
,
he
think
,
put
one
thing
beside


another
.
but
he
must
read
it
again
.
he
could
not
remember
the
whole


shape
of
the
thing
.
he
have
to
keep
his
judgement
in
suspense
.
so
he


return
to
the
other
thought
-
if
young
man
do
not
care
for
this
,


naturally
they
do
not
care
for
he
either
.
one
ought
not
to
complain
,


think
Mr.
Ramsay
,
try
to
stifle
his
desire
to
complain
to
his
wife


that
young
man
do
not
admire
he
.
but
he
be
determined
;
he
would
not


bother
she
again
.
here
he
look
at
her
reading
.
she
look
very


peaceful
,
reading
.
he
like
to
think
that
every
one
have
take


themselves
off
and
that
he
and
she
be
alone
.
the
whole
of
life
do


not
consist
in
go
to
bed
with
a
woman
,
he
think
,
return
to


Scott
and
Balzac
,
to
the
english
novel
and
the
french
novel
.




Mrs.
Ramsay
raise
her
head
and
like
a
person
in
a
light
sleep
seem
to


say
that
if
he
want
she
to
wake
she
would
,
she
really
would
,
but


otherwise
,
might
she
go
on
sleep
,
just
a
little
long
,
just
a


little
long
?
she
be
climb
up
those
branch
,
this
way
and
that
,


lay
hand
on
one
flower
and
then
another
.






nor
praise
the
deep
vermilion
in
the
rose
,






she
read
,
and
so
read
she
be
ascend
,
she
feel
,
on
to
the
top
,


on
to
the
summit
.
how
satisfying
!
how
restful
!
all
the
odd
and
end


of
the
day
stick
to
this
magnet
;
her
mind
feel
sweep
,
feel
clean
.
and


then
there
it
be
,
suddenly
entire
;
she
hold
it
in
her
hand
,
beautiful


and
reasonable
,
clear
and
complete
,
here
-
the
sonnet
.




but
she
be
become
conscious
of
her
husband
look
at
she
.
he
be


smile
at
she
,
quizzically
,
as
if
he
be
ridicule

very
forthright
,
after
read


about
Steenie

"
how
nice
it
would
be
to
marry
a
man
with
a
wash
-
leather
bag
for
his


watch
,
"
she
say
,
for
that
be
the
sort
of
joke
they
have
together
.




he
snort
.
he
feel
about
this
engagement
as
he
always
feel
about
any


engagement
;
the
girl
be
much
too
good
for
that
young
man
.
slowly
it


come
into
her
head
,
why
be
it
then
that
one
want
people
to
marry
?


what
be
the
value
,
the
meaning
of
thing
?
 
every
word
they
say
now


would
be
true
.
 
do
say
something
,
she
think
,
wish
only
to
hear
his


voice
.
for
the
shadow
,
the
thing
fold
they
in
be
begin
,
she


feel
,
to
close
round
she
again
.
say
anything
,
she
beg
,
look
at


he
,
as
if
for
help
.




he
be
silent
,
swinge
the
compass
on
his
watch
-
chain
to
and
fro
,
and


thinking
of
Scott
's
novel
and
Balzac
's
novel
.
but
through
the


crepuscular
wall
of
their
intimacy
,
for
they
be
draw
together
,


involuntarily
,
come
side
by
side
,
quite
close
,
she
could
feel
his


mind
like
a
raise
hand
shadow
her
mind
;
and
he
be
begin
,
now


that
her
thought
take
a
turn
he
dislike
-
towards
this
"
pessimism
"
as


he
call
it
-
to
fidget
,
though
he
say
nothing
,
raise
his
hand
to


his
forehead
,
twist
a
lock
of
hair
,
let
it
fall
again
.




"
you
wo
n't
 
finish
that
stocking
tonight
,
"
he
say
,
point
to
she


stocking
.
that
be
what
she
want
-
the
asperity
in
his
voice


reprove
she
.
if
he
say
it
be
wrong
to
be
pessimistic
probably
it
be


wrong
,
she
think
;
the
marriage
will
turn
out
all
right
.




"
no
,
"
she
say
,
flatten
the
stocking
out
upon
her
knee
,
"
I
sha
n't


finish
it
.
"




and
what
then
?
for
she
feel
that
he
be
still
look
at
she
,
but
that


his
look
have
change
.
he
want
something
-
want
the
thing
she
always


find
it
so
difficult
to
give
he
;
want
she
to
tell
he
that
she


love
he
.
and
that
,
no
,
she
could
not
do
.
he
find
talk
so
much


easy
than
she
do
.
he
could
say
thing
-
she
never
could
.
so


naturally
it
be
always
he
that
say
the
thing
,
and
then
for
some


reason
he
would
mind
this
suddenly
,
and
would
reproach
she
.
a


heartless
woman
he
call
she
;
she
never
tell
he
that
she
love
he
.


but
it
be
not
so
-
it
be
not
so
.
it
be
only
that
she
never
could
say


what
she
feel
.
be
there
no
crumb
on
his
coat
?
nothing
she
could
do


for
he
?
get
up
,
she
stand
at
the
window
with
the
reddish
-
brown


stock
in
her
hand
,
partly
to
turn
away
from
he
,
partly
because
she


remember
how
beautiful
it
often
be
-
the
sea
at
night
.
but
she
know


that
he
have
turn
his
head
as
she
turn
;
he
be
watch
she
.
she


know
that
he
be
think
,
you
be
more
beautiful
than
ever
.
and
she


feel
herself
very
beautiful
.
will
you
not
tell
I
just
for
once
that


you
love
I
?
he
be
think
that
,
for
he
be
rouse
,
what
with
Minta


and
his
book
,
and
its
be
the
end
of
the
day
and
their
have


quarrel
about

to
the
lighthouse
.
but
she
could
not
do
it
;
she


could
not
say
it
.
then
,
know
that
he
be
watch
she
,
instead
of


say
anything
she
turn
,
hold
her
stocking
,
and
look
at
he
.


and
as
she
look
at
he
she
begin
to
smile
,
for
though
she
have
not

a
word
,
he
know
,
of
course
he
know
,
that
she
love
he
.
he
could


not
deny
it
.
and
smile
she
look
out
of
the
window
and
say


 
think
to
herself
,
nothing
on

can
equal
this
happiness
 
-




"

you
can


neither

they


have
feather

light
finger
and
the
light
persistency
of
feather
,
they


would
look

once

on
the
shut
eye

the
loosely
clasp
finger

so
soon
a
bird
sing
,
a
cock
crow
,
or
a


faint
green
quicken
,
like
a
turn
leaf
,
in
the
hollow
of
the
wave
.


night
,
however
,
succeed
to
night
.
the
winter
hold
a
pack
of
they
in


store
and
deal
they
equally
,
evenly
,
with
indefatigable
finger
.


they
lengthen
;
they
darken
.
some
of
they
hold
aloft
clear
planet
,


plate
of
brightness
.
the
autumn
tree
,
ravage
as
they
be
,
take


on
the
flash
of
tattered
flag
kindle
in
the
gloom
of
cool


cathedral
cave
where
gold
letter

describe
death
in


battle
and
how
bone
bleach
and
burn
far
away
in
indian
sand
.
the


autumn
tree
gleam
in
the
yellow
moonlight
,
in
the
light
of
harvest


moon
,
the
light
which
mellow
the
energy
of
labour
,

smooth
the


stubble
,
and
bring
the
wave
lapping
blue
to
the
shore
.




it
seem
now
as
if
,
touch
by
human
penitence
and
all
its
toil
,


divine
goodness
have
part
the
curtain
and
display
behind
it
,
single
,


distinct
,
the
hare
erect
;
the
wave
fall
;
the
boat
rocking
;
which
,


do
we
deserve
they
,
should
be
ours
always
.
but
alas
,
divine
goodness
,


twitch
the
cord
,
draw
the
curtain
;
it
do
not
please
he
;
he


cover
his
treasure
in
a
drench
of
hail
,
and
so
break
they
,
so


confuse
they
that
it
seem
impossible
that
their
calm
should
ever


return
or
that
we
should
ever
compose
from
their
fragment
a
perfect


whole
or
read
in
the
litter
piece
the
clear
word
of
truth
.
for
our


penitence
deserve
a
glimpse
only
;
our
toil
respite
only
.




the
night
now
be
full
of
wind
and
destruction
;
the
tree
plunge
and


bend
and
their
leave
fly
helter
skelter
until
the
lawn
be
plaster


with
they
and
they
lie
pack
in
gutter
and
choke
rain
pipe
and


scatter
damp
path
.
also
the
sea
toss
itself
and
break
itself
,
and


should
any
sleeper
fancying
that
he
might
find
on
the
beach
an
answer


to
his
doubt
,
a
sharer
of
his
solitude
,
throw
off
his
bedclothe
and


go
down
by
himself
to
walk
on
the
sand
,
no
image
with
semblance
of


serve
and
divine
promptitude
come
readily
to
hand
bring
the
night


to
order
and
make
the
world
reflect
the
compass
of
the
soul
.
the


hand
dwindle
in
his
hand
;
the
voice
bellow
in
his
ear
.
almost
it


would
appear
that
it
be
useless
in
such
confusion
to
ask
the
night


those
question
as
to
what
,
and
why
,
and
wherefore
,
which
tempt
the


sleeper
from
his
bed
to
seek
an
answer
.




 
Mr.
Ramsay
,
stumble
along
a
passage
one
dark
morning
,
stretch
his


arm
out
,
but
Mrs.
Ramsay
having
die
rather
suddenly
the
night
before
,


his
arm
,
though
stretch
out
,
remain
empty
.
 





4






so
with
the
house
empty
and
the
door
lock
and
the
mattress
roll


round
,
those
stray
air
,
advance
guard
of
great
army
,
bluster
in
,


brush
bare
board
,
nibble
and
fan
,
meet
nothing
in
bedroom
or


drawing
-
room
that
wholly
resist
they
but
only
hanging
that
flap
,


wood
that
creak
,
the
bare
leg
of
table
,
saucepan
and
china
already


fur
,
tarnished
,
crack
.
what
people
have
shed
and
leave
-
a
pair
of


shoe
,
a
shoot
cap
,
some
fade
skirt
and
coat
in
wardrobe
-
those


alone
keep
the
human
shape
and
in
the
emptiness
indicate
how
once
they


be
fill
and
animate
;
how
once
hand
be
busy
with
hook
and


button
;
how
once
the
look
-
glass
have
hold
a
face
;
have
hold
a
world


hollow
out
in
which
a
figure
turn
,
a
hand
flash
,
the
door
open
,


in
come
child
rush
and
tumbling
;
and
go
out
again
.
now
,
day


after
day
,
light
turn
,
like
a
flower
reflect
in
water
,
its
sharp


image
on
the
wall
opposite
.
only
the
shadow
of
the
tree
,
flourish


in
the
wind
,
make
obeisance
on
the
wall
,
and
for
a
moment
darken
the


pool
in
which
light
reflect
itself
;
or
bird
,
fly
,
make
a
soft


spot
flutter
slowly
across
the
bedroom
floor
.




so
loveliness
reign
and
stillness
,
and
together
make
the
shape
of


loveliness
itself
,
a
form
from
which
life
have
part
;
solitary
like
a


pool
at
evening
,
far
distant
,
see
from
a
train
window
,
vanish
so


quickly
that
the
pool
,
pale
in
the
evening
,
be
scarcely
rob
of
its


solitude
,
though
once
see
.
loveliness
and
stillness
clasped
hand
in


the
bedroom
,
and
among
the
shrouded
jug
and
sheet
chair
even
the


prying
of
the
wind
,
and
the
soft
nose
of
the
clammy
sea
air
,
rub
,


snuffle
,
iterate
,
and
reiterate
their
question
-
"
will
you
fade
?


will
you
perish
?
"
-
scarcely
disturb
the
peace
,
the
indifference
,
the


air
of
pure
integrity
,
as
if
the
question
they
ask
scarcely
need


that
they
should
answer
:
we
remain
.




nothing
it
seem
could
break
that
image
,
corrupt
that
innocence
,
or


disturb
the
sway
mantle
of
silence
which
,
week
after
week
,
in
the


empty
room
,
wove
into
itself
the
fall
cry
of
bird
,
ship
hoot
,


the
drone
and
hum
of
the
field
,
a
dog
's
bark
,
a
man
's
shout
,
and


fold
they
round
the
house
in
silence
.
once
only
a
board
spring
on


the
landing
;
once
in
the
middle
of
the
night
with
a
roar
,
with
a


rupture
,
as
after
century
of
quiescence
,
a
rock
rend
itself
from
the


mountain
and
hurtles
crash
into
the
valley
,
one
fold
of
the
shawl


loosen
and
swing
to
and
fro
.
then
again
peace
descend
;
and
the


shadow
waver
;
light
bent
to
its
own
image
in
adoration
on
the
bedroom


wall
;
and
Mrs.
McNab
,
tear
the
veil
of
silence
with
hand
that
have


stand
in
the
wash
-
tub
,
grind
it
with
boot
that
have
crunch
the


shingle
,
come
as
direct
to
open
all
window
,
and
dust
the
bedroom
.






5






as
she
lurch
 
for
she
roll
like
a
ship
at
sea
 
and
leer
 
for
she


eye
fall
on
nothing
directly
,
but
with
a
sidelong
glance
that


deprecate
the
scorn
and
anger
of
the
world
-
she
be
witless
,
she
know


it
,
as
she
clutch
the
banister
and
haul
herself
upstairs
and


roll
from
room
to
room
,
she
sing
.
rub
the
glass
of
the
long


look
-
glass
and
leer
sideways
at
her
swinge
figure
a
sound


issue
from
her
lip
-
something
that
have
be
gay
twenty
year
before


on
the
stage
perhaps
,
have
be
hum
and
dance
to
,
but
now
,


come
from
the
toothless
,
bonnet
,
care
-
take
woman
,
be
rob


of
meaning
,
be
like
the
voice
of
witlessness
,
humour
,
persistency


itself
,
trodden
down
but
spring
up
again
,
so
that
as
she


lurch
,
dusting
,
wipe
,
she
seem
to
say
how
it
be
one
long
sorrow


and
trouble
,
how
it
be
get
up
and
go
to
bed
again
,
and
bring


thing
out
and
put
they
away
again
.
it
be
not
easy
or
snug
this


world
she
have
know
for
close
on
seventy
year
.
bow
down
she
be


with
weariness
.
how
long
,
she
ask
,
creak
and
groan
on
she


knee
under
the
bed
,
dust
the
board
,
how
long
shall
it
endure
?
but


hobble
to
her
foot
again
,
pull
herself
up
,
and
again
with
she


sidelong
leer
which
slip
and
turn
aside
even
from
her
own
face
,


and
her
own
sorrow
,
stand
and
gape
in
the
glass
,
aimlessly
smile
,


and
begin
again
the
old
amble
and
hobble
,
take
up
mat
,
put
down


china
,
look
sideways
in
the
glass
,
as
if
,
after
all
,
she
have
she


consolation
,
as
if
indeed
there
twine
about
her
dirge
some


incorrigible
hope
.
vision
of
joy
there
must
have
be
at
the
wash-


tub
,
say
with
her
child
 
yet
two
have
be
base
-
bear
and
one
have


desert
she
,
at
the
public
-
house
,
drink
;
turn
over
scrap
in


her
drawer
.
some
cleavage
of
the
dark
there
must
have
be
,
some


channel
in
the
depth
of
obscurity
through
which
light
enough
issue
to


twist
her
face
grin
in
the
glass
and
make
she
,
turn
to
her
job


again
,
mumble
out
the
old
music
hall
song
.
the
mystic
,
the
visionary
,


walk
the
beach
on
a
fine
night
,
stir
a
puddle
,
look
at
a


stone
,
ask
themselves
"
what
be
I
,
"
"
what
be
this
?
"
have
suddenly
an


answer
vouchsafe
they
:
 
they
could
not
say
what
it
be
 
so
that
they


be
warm
in
the
frost
and
have
comfort
in
the
desert
.

Mrs.

the
spring
without
a

to
toss
,
bare
and

a
virgin
fierce


in
her
chastity
,
scornful
in
her
purity
,

lay
out
on
field
wide-


eyed
and
watchful
and
entirely
careless

Prue

what

people
say
,
could
have
be
more
fitting
?
and
,
they


add
,
how
beautiful
she
look
!




as
summer
near
,
as
the
evening
lengthen
,
there
come
to
the


wakeful
,
the
hopeful
,
walk
the
beach
,
stir
the
pool
,


imagination
of
the
strange
kind
-
of
flesh
turn
to
atom
which


drive
before
the
wind
,
of

their
heart
,
of

,


sea
,

purposely
together
to
assemble
outwardly


the
scatter
part
of
the
vision
within
.
in
those
mirror
,
the
mind


of
man
,
in
those
pool
of
uneasy
water
,
in
which
cloud
for
ever
turn


and
shadow
form
,
dream
persist
,
and
it
be
impossible
to
resist
the


strange
intimation
which
every
gull
,
flower
,
tree
,
man
and
woman
,
and


the
white
earth
itself
seem
to
declare
 
but
if
question
at
once
to


withdraw
 
that
good
triumph
,
happiness
prevail
,
order
rule
;
or
to


resist
the
extraordinary
stimulus
to
range
hither
and
thither
in
search


of
some
absolute
good
,
some
crystal
of
intensity
,
remote
from
the
know


pleasure
and
familiar
virtue
,
something
alien
to
the
process
of


domestic
life
,
single
,
hard
,
bright
,
like
a
diamond
in
the
sand
,
which


would
render
the
possessor
secure
.
moreover
,
softened
and
acquiescent

spring
with
her
bee
hum
and
gnat
dancing
throw
her
cloak


about
she
,
veil
her
eye
,
avert
her
head
,
and
among
pass
shadow


and
flight
of
small
rain
seem
to
have
take
upon
she
a
knowledge
of


the
sorrow
of
mankind
.




 
Prue
Ramsay
die
that
summer
in
some
illness
connect
with


childbirth
,
which
be
indeed
a
tragedy
,
people
say
,
everything
,
they


say
,
have
promise
so
well
.




and
now
in
the
heat
of
summer
the
wind
send
its
spy
about
the
house


again
.
fly
wove
a
web
in
the
sunny
room
;
weed
that
have
grow
close


to
the
glass
in
the
night
tap
methodically
at
the
window
pane
.
when


darkness
fall
,
the
stroke
of
the
lighthouse
,
which
have
lay
itself
with


such
authority
upon
the
carpet
in
the
darkness
,
trace
its
pattern
,


come
now
in
the
soft
light
of
spring
mix
with
moonlight
gliding


gently
as
if
it
lay
its
caress
and
linger
steathily
and
look
and


come
lovingly
again
.
but
in
the
very
lull
of
this
love
caress
,
as


the
long
stroke
leant
upon
the
bed
,
the
rock
be
rent
asunder
;
another


fold
of
the
shawl
loosen
;
there
it
hang
,
and
sway
.
through
the


short
summer
night
and
the
long
summer
day
,
when
the
empty
room


seem
to
murmur
with
the
echo
of
the
field
and
the
hum
of
fly
,


the
long
streamer
wave
gently
,
sway
aimlessly
;
while
the
sun
so


stripe
and
bar
the
room
and
fill
they
with
yellow
haze
that
Mrs.


McNab
,
when
she
break
in
and
lurch
about
,
dust
,
sweeping
,
look


like
a
tropical
fish
oare
its
way
through
sun
-
lance
water
.




but
slumber
and
sleep
though
it
might
there
come
later
in
the
summer


ominous
sound
like
the
measured
blow
of
hammer
dull
on
feel
,


which
,
with
their
repeat
shock
still
far
loosen
the
shawl
and


crack
the
tea
-
cup
.
now
and
again
some
glass
tinkle
in
the
cupboard


as
if
a
giant
voice
have
shriek
so
loud
in
its
agony
that
tumbler


stand
inside
a
cupboard
vibrate
too
.
then
again
silence
fall
;
and


then
,
night
after
night
,
and
sometimes
in
plain
mid
-
day
when
the
rose


be
bright
and
light
turn
on
the
wall
its
shape
clearly
there
seem


to
drop
into
this
silence
,
this
indifference
,
this
integrity
,
the
thud


of
something
fall
.




 
a
shell
explode
.
twenty
or
thirty
young
man
be
blow
up
in
France
,


among
they
Andrew
Ramsay
,
whose
death
,
mercifully
,
be
instantaneous
.




at
that
season
those
who
have
go
down
to
pace
the
beach
and
ask
of
the


sea
and
sky
what
message
they
report
or
what
vision
they
affirm
have


to
consider
among
the
usual
token
of
divine
bounty
-
the
sunset
on


the
sea
,
the
pallor
of
dawn
,
the
moon
rise
,
fishing
-
boat
against
the


moon
,
and
child
make
mud
pie
or
pelt
each
other
with
handful


of
grass
,
something
out
of
harmony
with
this
jocundity
and
this


serenity
.
there
be
the
silent
apparition
of
an
ashen
-
colour
ship


for
instance
,
come
,
go
;
there
be
a
purplish
stain
upon
the
bland


surface
of
the
sea
as
if
something
have
boil
and
bleed
,
invisibly
,


beneath
.
this
intrusion
into
a
scene
calculate
to
stir
the
most


sublime
reflection
and
lead
to
the
most
comfortable
conclusion
stay


their
pacing
.
it
be
difficult
blandly
to
overlook
they
;
to
abolish


their
significance
in
the
landscape
;
to
continue
,
as
one
walk
by
the


sea
,
to
marvel
how
beauty
outside
mirror
beauty
within
.




do
nature
supplement
what
man
advanced
?
do
she
complete
what
he


begin
?
with
equal
complacence
she
see
his
misery
,
his
meanness
,
and


his
torture
.
that
dream
,
of
sharing
,
complete
,
of
find
in


solitude
on
the
beach
an
answer
,
be
then
but
a
reflection
in
a
mirror
,


and
the
mirror
itself
be
but
the
surface
glassiness
which
form
in


quiescence
when
the
nobler
power
sleep
beneath
?
impatient
,
despair


yet
loth
to
go
 
for
beauty
offer
her
lur
,
have
her
consolation
,
to


pace
the
beach
be
impossible
;
contemplation
be
unendurable
;
the


mirror

from
the


upper
room

gigantic
chaos
streak
with


lightning
could
have

hear
tumbling
and
tossing
,
as
the
wind

disport
themselves
like
the
amorphous
bulk
of
leviathan
whose


brow

in
the
darkness

battle
and
tumbling

the
stillness
and
the


brightness
of
the
day
be
as
strange
as
the
chaos
and
tumult
of
night

,
a

Mrs.
McNab
's
dream
of
a
lady
,
of
a
child
,
of
a
plate
of
milk


soup
?
it
have
waver
over
the
wall
like
a
spot
of
sunlight
and


vanish
.
she
have
lock
the
door
;
she
have
go
.
it
be
beyond
the


strength
of
one
woman
,
she
say
.
they
never
send
.
they
never
write
.


there
be
thing
up
there
rot
in
the
drawer
-
it
be
a
shame
to


leave
they
so
,
she
say
.
the
place
be
go
to
rack
and
ruin
.
only


the
Lighthouse
beam
enter
the
room
for
a
moment
,
send
its
sudden


stare
over
bed
and
wall
in
the
darkness
of
winter
,
look
with


equanimity
at
the
thistle
and
the
swallow
,
the
rat
and
the
straw
.


nothing
now
withstand
they
;
nothing
say
no
to
they
.
let
the
wind


blow
;
let
the
poppy
seed
itself
and
the
carnation
mate
with
the


cabbage
.
let
the
swallow
build
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
the
thistle


thrust
aside
the
tile
,
and
the
butterfly
sun
itself
on
the
faded


chintz
of
the
arm
-
chair
.
let
the
broken
glass
and
the
china
lie
out


on
the
lawn
and
be
tangle
over
with
grass
and
wild
berry
.




for
now
have
come
that
moment
,
that
hesitation
when
dawn
tremble
and


night
pause
,
when
if
a
feather
alight
in
the
scale
it
will
be
weigh


down
.
one
feather
,
and
the
house
,
sink
,
fall
,
would
have
turn


and
pitch
downward
to
the
depth
of
darkness
.
in
the
ruin
room
,


picnicker
would
have
light
their
kettle
;
lover
seek
shelter
there
,


lie
on
the
bare
board
;
and
the
shepherd
store
his
dinner
on
the


brick
,
and
the
tramp
sleep
with
his
coat
round
he
to
ward
off
the


cold
.
then
the
roof
would
have
fall
;
briar
and
hemlock
would
have


blot
out
path
,
step
and
window
;
would
have
grow
,
unequally
but


lustily
over
the
mound
,
until
some
trespasser
,
lose
his
way
,
could


have
tell
only
by
a
red
-
hot
poker
among
the
nettle
,
or
a
scrap
of


china
in
the
hemlock
,
that
here
once
some
one
have
live
;
there
have
be


a
house
.




if
the
feather
have
fall
,
if
it
have
tip
the
scale
downwards
,
the


whole
house
would
have
plunge
to
the
depth
to
lie
upon
the
sand
of


oblivion
.
but
there
be
a
force
work
;
something
not
highly


conscious
;
something
that
leer
,
something
that
lurch
;
something
not


inspire
to
go
about
its
work
with
dignified
ritual
or
solemn
chant
.


Mrs.
McNab
groan
;
Mrs.
Bast
creak
.
they
be
old
;
they
be
stiff
;


their
leg
ache
.
they
come
with
their
broom
and
pail
at
last
;
they


get
to
work
.
all
of
a
sudden
,
would
Mrs.
McNab
see
that
the
house
be


ready
,
one
of
the
young
lady
write
:

she
get
this
do
;
would


she
get
that
do
;
all
in
a
hurry
.
they
might
be
come
for
the


summer
;
have
leave
everything
to
the
last
;
expect
to
find
thing
as


they
have
leave
they
.
slowly
and
painfully
,
with
broom
and
pail
,


mop
,
scour
,
Mrs.
McNab
,
Mrs.
Bast
,
stay
the
corruption
and
the


rot
;
rescue
from
the
pool
of
Time
that
be
fast
close
over
they
now


a
basin
,
now
a
cupboard
;
fetch
up
from
oblivion
all
the
Waverley


novel
and
a
tea
-
set
one
morning
;
in
the
afternoon
restore
to
sun
and


air
a
brass
fender
and
a
set
of
steel
fire

.
George
,
Mrs.
Bast
's


son
,
catch
the
rat
,
and
cut
the
grass
.
they
have
the
builder
.


attend
with
the
creaking
of
hinge
and
the
screeching
of
bolt
,
the


slamming
and
banging
of
damp
-
swollen
woodwork
,
some
rusty
laborious


birth
seem
to
be
take
place
,
as
the
woman
,
stoop
,
rise
,


groan
,
singing
,
slap
and
slam
,
upstairs
now
,
now
down
in
the


cellar
.
oh
,
they
say
,
the
work
!




they
drink
their
tea
in
the
bedroom
sometimes
,
or
in
the
study
;


break
off
work
at
mid
-
day
with
the
smudge
on
their
face
,
and
their


old
hand
clasp
and
cramp
with
the
broom
handle
.
flop
on


chair
,
they
contemplate
now
the
magnificent
conquest
over
tap
and


bath
;
now
the
more
arduous
,
more
partial
triumph
over
long
row
of


book
,
black
as
raven
once
,
now
white

in
a
ring
of


light

the
old
gentleman
,

as
a
rake
,

up
with
the

young
gentleman

dead
.
that
she
be
sure
.
she
have
read
his
name
in


the
paper
.




there
be
the
cook
now
,
Mildred
,
Marian
,
some
such
name
as
that
-
a
red-


head
woman
,
quick
-
temper
like
all
her
sort
,
but
kind
,
too
,
if

a


plate
of
soup
for
Maggie
;
a
bite
of
ham
,
sometimes
;
whatever

over
.


they
live
well
in
those
day
.
they
have
everything
they
want


 
glibly
,
jovially
,
with
the
tea
hot
in
she
,
she
unwound
her
ball
of


memory
,

Mrs.

she
have
never
know
they
;
have
live
in
Glasgow
at
that
time

,

her
cup
down
,

they
hang
that
beast
's
skull


there
for
?
shoot
in
foreign
part
no
doubt
.




it
might
well
be
,
say
Mrs.
McNab
,
wanton
on
with
her
memory
;
they


have
friend
in
eastern
country
;
gentleman
stay
there
,
lady
in


evening
dress
;
she
have
see
they
once
through
the
dining
-
room
door
all


sit
at
dinner
.
twenty
she
dare
say
all
in
their
jewellery
,
and


she
ask
to
stay
help
wash
up
,
might
be
till
after
midnight
.




ah
,
say
Mrs.
Bast
,
they
'd
find
it
change
.
she
leant
out
of
the


window
.
she
watch
her
son
George
scythe
the
grass
.
they
might


well
ask
,
what
have
be
do
to
it
?
see
how
old
Kennedy
be


suppose
to
have
charge
of
it
,
and
then
his
leg
get
so
bad
after
he


fall
from
the
cart
;
and
perhaps
then
no
one
for
a
year
,
or
the
well


part
of
one
;
and
then
Davie
Macdonald
,
and
seed
might
be
send
,
but
who


should
say
if
they
be
ever
plant
?
they
'd
find
it
change
.




she
watch
her
son
scythe
.
he
be
a
great
one
for
work
-
one
of


those
quiet
one
.
well
they
must
be
get
along
with
the
cupboard
,


she
suppose
.
they
haul
themselves
up
.




at
last
,
after
day
of
labour
within
,
of
cut
and
dig
without
,


duster
be
flick
from
the
window
,
the
window
be
shut
to
,
key


be
turn
all
over
the
house
;
the
front
door
be
bang
;
it
be


finish
.




and
now
as
if
the
cleaning
and
the
scrubbing
and
the
scything
and
the


mow
have
drown
it
there
rise
that
half
-
hear
melody
,
that


intermittent
music
which
the
ear
half
catch
but
lets
fall
;
a
bark
,
a


bleat
;
irregular
,
intermittent
,
yet
somehow
related
;
the
hum
of
an


insect
,
the
tremor
of
cut
grass
,
disevere
yet
somehow
belong
;
the


jar
of
a
dorbeetle
,
the
squeak
of
a
wheel
,
loud
,
low
,
but
mysteriously


related
;
which
the
ear
strain
to
bring
together
and
be
always
on
the


verge
of
harmonise
,
but
they
be
never
quite
hear
,
never
fully


harmonise
,
and
at
last
,
in
the
evening
,
one
after
another
the
sound


die
out
,
and
the
harmony
falter
,
and
silence
fall
.
with
the
sunset


sharpness
be
lose
,
and
like
mist
rise
,
quiet
rise
,
quiet
spread
,


the
wind
settle
;
loosely
the
world
shake
itself
down
to
sleep
,
darkly


here
without
a
light
to
it
,
save
what
come
green
suffuse
through


leave
,
or
pale
on
the
white
flower
in
the
bed
by
the
window
.




 
Lily
Briscoe

her

evening

indeed
peace
have
come
.
message
of
peace
breathe
from
the
sea
to


the
shore
.
never
to
break
its
sleep
any
more
,
to
lull
it
rather
more


deeply
to
rest
,
and
whatever
the
dreamer
dream
holily
,
dream
wisely
,


to
confirm
-
what
else
be
it
murmur
-
as
Lily
Briscoe
lay
her
head


on
the
pillow
in
the
clean
still
room
and
hear
the
sea
.
through
the


open
window
the
voice
of
the
beauty
of
the
world
come
murmur
,
too


softly
to
hear
exactly
what
it
say
-
but
what
matter
if
the
meaning


be
plain
?
entreat
the
sleeper
 
the
house
be
full
again
;
Mrs.


Beckwith
be
stay
there
,
also
Mr.
Carmichael
,
if
they
would
not


actually
come
down
to
the
beach
itself
at
least
to
lift
the
blind
and


look
out
.
they
would
see
then
night
flow
down
in
purple
;
his
head


crown
;
his
sceptre
jewel
;
and
how
in
his
eye
a
child
might
look
.


and
if
they
still
falter
 
Lily
be
tired
out
with
travelling
and


sleep
almost
at
once
;
but
Mr.
Carmichael
read
a
book
by
candlelight
,
if


they
still
say
no
,
that
it
be
vapour
,
this
splendour
of
his
,
and
the


dew
have
more
power
than
he
,
and
they
prefer
sleep
;
gently
then


without
complaint
,
or
argument
,
the
voice
would
sing
its
song
.
gently


the
wave
would
break
 
Lily
hear
they
in
her
sleep
;
tenderly
the


light
fall
 
it
seem
to
come
through
her
eyelid
.
and
it
all
look
,


Mr.
Carmichael
think
,
shut
his
book
,
fall
asleep
,
much
as
it


use
to
look
.




indeed
the
voice
might
resume
,
as
the
curtain
of
dark
wrap


themselves
over
the
house
,
over
Mrs.
Beckwith
,
Mr.
Carmichael
,
and
Lily


Briscoe
so
that
they
lie
with
several
fold
of
blackness
on
their
eye
,


why
not
accept
this
,
be
content
with
this
,
acquiesce
and
resign
?
the


sigh
of
all
the
sea
break
in
measure
round
the
isle
soothe
they
;


the
night
wrap
they
;
nothing
break
their
sleep
,
until
,
the
bird


beginning
and
the
dawn
weave
their
thin
voice
in
to
its
whiteness
,
a


cart
grinding
,
a
dog
somewhere
bark
,
the
sun
lift
the
curtain
,


break
the
veil
on
their
eye
,
and
Lily
Briscoe
stir
in
her
sleep
.


she
clutch
at
her
blanket
as
a
faller
clutch
at
the
turf
on
the


edge
of
a
cliff
.
her
eye
open
wide
.
here
she
be
again
,
she


think
,
sit
bold
upright
in
bed
.
awake
.










the
lighthouse






1




what
do
it
mean
then
,
what
can
it
all
mean
?
Lily
Briscoe
ask


herself
,
wonder
whether
,
since
she
have
be
leave
alone
,
it
behove


she
to
go
to
the
kitchen
to
fetch
another
cup
of
coffee
or
wait
here
.


what
do
it
mean
?
-
a
catchword
that
be
,
catch
up
from
some
book
,


fit
her
think
loosely
,
for
she
could
not
,
this
first
morning
with


the
Ramsays
,
contract
her
feeling
,
could
only
make
a
phrase
resound
to


cover
the
blankness
of
her
mind
until
these
vapour
have
shrink
.
for


really
,
what
do
she
feel
,
come
back
after
all
these
year
and
Mrs.


ramsay
dead
?
nothing
,
nothing
-
nothing
that
she
could
express
at
all
.




she
have
come
late
last
night
when
it
be
all
mysterious
,
dark
.
now
she


be
awake
,
at
her
old
place
at
the
breakfast
table
,
but
alone
.
it
be


very
early
too
,
not
yet
eight
.
there
be
this
expedition
-
they
be


go
to
the
lighthouse
,
Mr.
Ramsay
,
Cam
,
and
James
.
they
should
have


go
already
-
they
have
to
catch
the
tide
or
something
.
and
Cam
be


not
ready
and
James
be
not
ready
and
Nancy
have
forget
to
order
the


sandwich
and
Mr.
Ramsay
have
lose
his
temper
and
bang
out
of
the


room
.




"
what
be
the
use
of
go
now
?
"
he
have
storm
.




Nancy
have
vanish
.
there
he
be
,
march
up
and
down
the
terrace
in


a
rage
.
one
seem
to
hear
door
slamming
and
voice
call
all
over


the
house
.
now
Nancy
burst
in
,
and
ask
,
look
round
the
room
,
in
a


queer
half
daze
,
half
desperate
way
,
"
what
do
one
send
to
the


lighthouse
?
"
as
if
she
be
force
herself
to
do
what
she
despair
of


ever
be
able
to
do
.




what
do
one
send
to
the
lighthouse
indeed
!
at
any
other
time
Lily


could
have
suggest
reasonably
tea
,
tobacco
,
newspaper
.
but
this


morning
everything
seem
so
extraordinarily
queer
that
a
question
like


Nancy
's
-
what
do
one
send
to
the
lighthouse
?
-
open
door
in
one
's


mind
that
go
bang
and
swinge
to
and
fro
and
make
one
keep


ask
,
in
a
stupefied
gape
,
what
do
one
send
?
what
do
one
do
?


why
be
one
sit
here
,
after
all
?




sit
alone
 
for
Nancy
go
out
again
 
among
the
clean
cup
at
the


long
table
,
she
feel
cut
off
from
other
people
,
and
able
only
to
go
on


watch
,
ask
,
wonder
.
the
house
,
the
place
,
the
morning
,
all


seem
stranger
to
she
.
she
have
no
attachment
here
,
she
feel
,
no


relation
with
it
,
anything
might
happen
,
and
whatever
do
happen
,
a


step
outside
,
a
voice
call
 
"
it
be
not
in
the
cupboard
;
it
be
on
the


landing
,
"
some
one
cry
,
be
a
question
,
as
if
the
link
that
usually


bind
thing
together
have
be
cut
,
and
they
float
up
here
,
down


there
,
off
,
anyhow
.
how
aimless
it
be
,
,
how
chaotic
,
how
unreal
it


be
,
she
think
,
look
at
her
empty
coffee
cup
.
Mrs.
Ramsay
dead
;


Andrew
kill
;
prue
dead
too
-
repeat
it
as
she
might
,
it
rouse
no


feel
in
she
.
and
we
all
get
together
in
a
house
like
this
on
a


morning
like
this
,
she
say
,
look
out
of
the
window
.
it
be
a


beautiful
still
day
.






2






suddenly
Mr.
Ramsay
raise
his
head
as
he
pass
and
look
straight
at


she
,
with
his
distraught
wild
gaze
which
be
yet
so
penetrate
,
as
if


he
see
you
,
for
one
second
,
for
the
first
time
,
for
ever
;
and
she


pretend
to
drink
out
of
her
empty
coffee
cup
so
as
to
escape
he
-
to


escape
his
demand
on
she
,
to
put
aside
a
moment
long
that
imperious


need
.
and
he
shake
his
head
at
she
,
and
stride
on
 
"
Alone
"
she
hear


he
say
,
"
perish
"
she
hear
he
say
 
and
like
everything
else
this


strange
morning
the
word
become
symbol
,
write
themselves
all
over
the


grey
-
green
wall
.
if
only
she
could
put
they
together
,
she
feel
,
write


they
out
in
some
sentence
,
then
she
would
have
get
at
the
truth
of


thing
.
old
Mr.
Carmichael
came
pad
softly
in
,
fetch
his
coffee
,


take
his
cup
and
make
off
to
sit
in
the
sun
.
the
extraordinary


unreality
be
frightening
;
but
it
be
also
exciting
.
go
to
the


lighthouse
.
but
what
do
one
send
to
the
lighthouse
?
perish
.
alone
.


the
grey
-
green
light
on
the
wall
opposite
.
the
empty
place
.
such
be


some
of
the
part
,
but
how
bring
they
together
?
she
ask
.
as
if
any


interruption
would
break
the
frail
shape
she
be
build
on
the
table


she
turn
she
back
to
the
window
lest
Mr.
Ramsay
should
see
she
.
she


must
escape
somewhere
,
be
alone
somewhere
.
suddenly
she
remember
.


when
she
have
sit
there
last
ten
year
ago
there
have
be
a
little
sprig


or
leaf
pattern
on
the
table
-
cloth
,
which
she
have
look
at
in
a
moment


of
revelation
.
there
have
be
a
problem
about
a
foreground
of
a


picture
.
move
the
tree
to
the
middle
,
she
have
say
.
she
have
never


finish
that
picture
.
she
would
paint
that
picture
now
.
it
have
be


knock
about
in
her
mind
all
these
year
.
where
be
her
paint
,
she


wonder
?
her
paint
,
yes
.
she
have
leave
they
in
the
hall
last
night
.


she
would
start
at
once
.
she
get
up
quickly
,
before
Mr.
Ramsay
turn
.




she
fetch
herself
a
chair
.
she
pitch
her
easel
with
her
precise


old
-
maidish
movement
on
the
edge
of
the
lawn
,
not
too
close
to
Mr.


Carmichael
,
but
close
enough
for
his
protection
.
yes
,
it
must
have


be
precisely
here
that
she
have
stand
ten
year
ago
.
there
be
the


wall
;
the
hedge
;
the
tree
.
the
question
be
of
some
relation
between


those
masse
.
she
have
bear
it
in
her
mind
all
these
year
.
it
seem


as
if
the
solution
have
come
to
she
:
she
know
now
what
she
want
to
do
.




but
with
Mr.
Ramsay
bear
down
on
she
,
she
could
do
nothing
.
every


time
he
approach
-
he
be
walk
up
and
down
the
terrace
-
ruin


approach
,
chaos
approach
.
she
could
not
paint
.
she
stoop
,
she


turn
;
she
take
up
this
rag
;
she
squeeze
that
tube
.
but
all
she
do


be
to
ward
he
off
a
moment
.
he
make
it
impossible
for
she
to
do


anything
.
for
if
she
give
he
the
least
chance
,
if
he
see
she


disengage
a
moment
,
look
his
way
a
moment
,
he
would
be
on
she
,


say
,
as
he
have
say
last
night
,
"
you
find
we
much
changed
.
"
last


night
he
have
get
up
and
stop
before
she
,
and
say
that
.
dumb
and


stare
though
they
have
all
sit
,
the
six
child
whom
they
use
to


call
after
the
king
and
Queens
of
England
-
the
Red
,
the
Fair
,
the


Wicked
,
the
Ruthless
-
she
feel
how
they
rage
under
it
.
kind
old
Mrs.


Beckwith
say
something
sensible
.
but
it
be
a
house
full
of
unrelated


passion
-
she
have
feel
that
all
the
evening
.
and
on
top
of
this
chaos


Mr.
Ramsay
get
up
,
press
her
hand
,
and
say
:
"
you
will
find
we
much


change
"
and
none
of
they
have
move
or
have
speak
;
but
have
sit
there
as


if
they
be
force
to
let
he
say
it
.
only
James
 
certainly
the


Sullen
 
scowl
at
the
lamp
;
and
Cam
screw
her
handkerchief
round
she


finger
.
then
he
remind
they
that
they
be
go
to
the
lighthouse


tomorrow
.
they
must
be
ready
,
in
the
hall
,
on
the
stroke
of
half
-
past


seven
.
then
,
with
his
hand
on
the
door
,
he
stop
;
he
turn
upon


they
.
do
they
not
want
to
go
?
he
demand
.
have
they
dare
say


no
 
he
have
some
reason
for
want
it
 
he
would
have
fling
himself


tragically
backwards
into
the
bitter
water
of
depair
.
such
a


gift
he
have
for
gesture
.
he
look
like
a
king
in
exile
.
doggedly


James
say
yes
.
Cam
stumble
more
wretchedly
.
yes
,
oh
,
yes
,
they
'd


both
be
ready
,
they
say
.
and
it
strike
she
,
this
be
tragedy
-
not


pall
,
dust
,
and
the
shroud
;
but
child
coerce
,
their
spirit


subdue
.
James
be
sixteen
,
Cam
,
seventeen
,
perhaps
.
she
have
look


round
for
some
one
who
be
not
there
,
for
Mrs.
Ramsay
,
presumably
.
but


there
be
only
kind
Mrs.
Beckwith
turn
over
her
sketch
under
the


lamp
.
then
,
be
tired
,
her
mind
still
rise
and
fall
with
the


sea
,
the
taste
and
smell

after
long
absence
possess


she
,
the
candle
waver
in
her
eye
,
she
have
lose
herself
and
go


under
.
it
be
a
wonderful
night
,
starlit
;
the
wave
sound
as
they


go
upstairs
;
the
moon
surprise
they
,
enormous
,
pale
,
as
they
pass


the
staircase
window
.
she
have
sleep
at
once
.




she
set
her
clean
canvas
firmly
upon
the
easel
,
as
a
barrier
,
frail
,


but
she
hope
sufficiently
substantial
to
ward
off
Mr.
Ramsay
and
his


exactingness
.
she
do
she
good
to
look
,
when
his
back
be
turn
,
at


her
picture
;
that
line
there
,
that
mass
there
.
but
it
be
out
of
the


question
.
let
he
be
fifty
foot
away
,
let
he
not
even
speak
to
you
,


let
he
not
even
see
you
,
he
permeate
,
he
prevail
,
he
impose


himself
.
he
change
everything
.
she
could
not
see
the
colour
;
she


could
not
see
the
line
;
even
with
his
back
turn
to
she
,
she
could


only
think
,
but
he
'll
be
down
on
I
in
a
moment
,
demand
-
something


she
feel
she
could
not
give
he
.
she
reject
one
brush
;
she
choose


another
.
when
would
those
child
come
?
when
would
they
all
be
off
?


she
fidget
.
that
man
,
she
think
,
her
anger
rise
in
she
,
never


give
;
that
man
take
.
she
,
on
the
other
hand
,
would
be
force
to
give
.


Mrs.
Ramsay
have
give
.
give
,
give
,
give
,
she
have
die
-
and
have


leave
all
this
.
really
,
she
be
angry
with
Mrs.
Ramsay
.
with
the
brush


slightly
tremble
in
her
finger
she
look
at
the
hedge
,
the
step
,


the
wall
.
it
be
all
Mrs.
Ramsay
's
do
.
she
be
dead
.
here
be
Lily
,


at
forty
-
four
,
waste
her
time
,
unable
to
do
a
thing
,
stand
there
,


play
at
painting
,
play
at
the
one
thing
one
do
not
play
at
,
and


it
be
all
Mrs.
Ramsay
's
fault
.
she
be
dead
.
the
step
where
she
use


to
sit
be
empty
.
she
be
dead
.




but
why
repeat
this
over
and
over
again
?
why
be
always
try
to
bring


up
some
feeling
she
have
not
get
?
there
be
a
kind
of
blasphemy
in
it
.


it
be
all
dry
:
all
wither
:
all
spend
.
they
ought
not
to
have
ask


she
;
she
ought
not
to
have
come
.
one
ca
n't
 
waste
one
's
time
at
forty-


four
,
she
think
.
she
hate
play
at
painting
.
a
brush
,
the
one


dependable
thing
in
a
world
of
strife
,
ruin
,
chaos
-
that
one
should
not


play
with
,
knowingly
even
:
she
detest
it
.
but
he
make
she
.
you


sha
n't
 
touch
your
canvas
,
he
seem
to
say
,
bear
down
on
she
,
till


you
've
 
give
I
what
I
want
of
you
.
here
he
be
,
close
upon
she
again
,


greedy
,
distraught
.
well
,
think
Lily
in
despair
,
let
she
right


hand
fall
at
her
side
,
it
would
be
simple
then
to
have
it
over
.


surely
,
she
could
imitate
from
recollection
the
glow
,
the
rhapsody
,
the


self
-
surrender
,
she
have
see
on
so
many
woman
's
face
 
on
Mrs.
Ramsay
's
,


for
instance
 
when
on
some
occasion
like
this
they
blaze
up
-
she
could


remember
the
look
on
Mrs.
Ramsay
's
face
-
into
a
rapture
of
sympathy
,
of


delight
in
the
reward
they
have
,
which
,
though
the
reason
of
it
escape


she
,
evidently
confer
on
they
the
most
supreme
bliss
of
which
human


nature
be
capable
.
here
he
be
,
stop
by
her
side
.
she
would
give


he
what
she
could
.






3






she
seem
to
have
shrivel
slightly
,
he
think
.
she
look
a
little


skimpy
,
wispy
;
but
not
unattractive
.
he
like
she
.
there
have
be
some


talk
of
her
marry
William
Bankes
once
,
but
nothing
have
come
of
it
.


his
wife
have
be
fond
of
she
.
he
have
be
a
little
out
of
temper
too


at
breakfast
.
and
then
,
and
then
-
this
be
one
of
those
moment
when


an
enormous
need
urge
he
,
without
be
conscious
what
it
be
,
to


approach
any
woman
,
to
force
they
,
he
do
not
care
how
,
his
need
be
so


great
,
to
give
he
what
he
want
:
sympathy
.




be
anybody
look
after
she
?
he
say
.
have
she
everything
she


want
?




"
oh
,
thank
,
everything
,
"
say
Lily
Briscoe
nervously
.
no
;
she
could


not
do
it
.
she
ought
to
have
float
off
instantly
upon
some
wave
of


sympathetic
expansion
:
the
pressure
on
she
be
tremendous
.
but
she


remain
stuck
.
there
be
an
awful
pause
.
they
both
look
at
the


sea
.
why
,
think
Mr.
Ramsay
,
should
she
look
at
the
sea
when
I
be


here
?
she
hope
it
would
be
calm
enough
for
they
to
land
at
the


lighthouse
,
she
say
.
the
Lighthouse
!
the
Lighthouse
!
what
be
that


get
to
do
with
it
?
he
think
impatiently
.
instantly
,
with
the
force


of
some
primeval
gust
 
for
really
he
could
not
restrain
himself
any


long
,
there
issue
from
he
such
a
groan
that
any
other
woman
in
the


whole
world
would
have
do
something
,
say
something
-
all
except


myself
,
think
Lily
,
gird
at
herself
bitterly
,
who
be
not
a
woman
,


but
a
peevish
,
ill
-
temper
,
dry
-
up
old
maid
,
presumably
.




 
Mr.
Ramsay
sigh
to
the
full
.
he
wait
.
be
she
not
go
to
say


anything
?
do
she
not
see
what
he
want
from
she
?
then
he
say
he


have
a
particular
reason
for
want
to
go
to
the
lighthouse
.
his


wife
use
to
send
the
man
thing
.
there
be
a
poor
boy
with
a


tuberculous
hip
,
the
lightkeeper
's
son
.
he
sigh
profoundly
.


he
sigh
significantly
.
all
Lily
wish
be
that
this
enormous
flood


of
grief
,
this
insatiable
hunger
for
sympathy
,
this
demand
that
she


should
surrender
herself
up
to
he
entirely
,
and
even
so
he
have
sorrow


enough
to
keep
she
supply
for
ever
,
should
leave
she
,
should
be


divert
 
she
keep
look
at
the
house
,
hope
for
an
interruption


before
it
sweep
she
down
in
its
flow
.




"
such
expedition
,
"
say
Mr.
Ramsay
,
scrape
the
ground
with
his
toe
,


"
be
very
painful
.
"
still
Lily
say
nothing
.
 
she
be
a
stock
,
she
be
a


stone
,
he
say
to
himself
.
 
"
they
be
very
exhausting
,
"
he
say
,


look
,
with
a
sickly
look
that
nauseate
her
 
he
be
act
,
she


feel
,
this
great
man
be
dramatise
himself
,
at
his
beautiful
hand
.


it
be
horrible
,
it
be
indecent
.
would
they
never
come
,
she
ask
,


for
she
could
not
sustain
this
enormous
weight
of
sorrow
,
support
these


heavy
drapery
of
grief
 
he
have
assume
a
pose
of
extreme


decreptitude
;
he
even
totter
a
little
as
he
stand
there
 
a
moment


long
.




still
she
could
say
nothing
;
the
whole
horizon
seem
sweep
bare
of


object
to
talk
about
;
could
only
feel
,
amazedly
,
as
Mr.
Ramsay
stand


there
,
how
his
gaze
seem
to
fall
dolefully
over
the
sunny
grass
and


discolour
it
,
and
cast
over
the
rubicund
,
drowsy
,
entirely
content


figure
of
Mr.
Carmichael
,
read
a
french
novel
on
a
deck
-
chair
,
a
veil


of
crape
,
as
if
such
an
existence
,
flaunt
its
prosperity
in
a
world


of
woe
,
be
enough
to
provoke
the
most
dismal
thought
of
all
.
look


at
he
,
he
seem
to
be
say
,
look
at
I
;
and
indeed
,
all
the
time
he


be
feel
,
think
of
I
,
think
of
I
.
ah
,
could
that
bulk
only
be


waft
alongside
of
they
,
Lily
wish
;
have
she
only
pitch
her
easel
a


yard
or
two
close
to
he
;
a
man
,
any
man
,
would
staunch
this
effusion
,


would
stop
these
lamentation
.
a
woman
,
she
have
provoke
this
horror
;


a
woman
,
she
should
have
know
how
to
deal
with
it
.
it
be
immensely


to
her
discredit
,
sexually
,
to
stand
there
dumb
.
one
say
-
what
do


one
say
?
-
oh
,
Mr.
Ramsay
!
dear
Mr.
Ramsay
!
that
be
what
that
kind
old


lady
who
sketch
,
Mrs.
Beckwith
,
would
have
say
instantly
,
and


rightly
.
but
,
no
.
they
stand
there
,
isolate
from
the
rest
of
the


world
.
his
immense
self
-
pity
,
his
demand
for
sympathy
pour
and


spread
itself
in
pool
at
ther
foot
,
and
all
she
do
,
miserable
sinner


that
she
be
,
be
to
draw
her
skirt
a
little
close
round
her
ankle
,


lest
she
should
get
wet
.
in
complete
silence
she
stand
there
,
grasp


her
paint
brush
.




Heaven
could
never
be
sufficiently
praise
!
she
hear
sound
in
the


house
.
James
and
Cam
must
be
come
.
but
Mr.
Ramsay
,
as
if
he
know


that
his
time
run
short
,
exert
upon
her
solitary
figure
the
immense


pressure
of
his
concentrated
woe
;
his
age
;
his
frailty
:
his
desolation
;


when
suddenly
,
toss
his
head
impatiently
,
in
his
annoyance
-
for


after
all
,
what
woman
could
resist
he
?
-
he
notice
that
his
boot
-
lace


be
untie
.
remarkable
boot
they
be
too
,
Lily
think
,
look


down
at
they
:
sculpture
;
colossal
;
like
everything
that
Mr.
ramsay

,
from
his
fray
tie
to
his
half
-
buttoned
waistcoat
,
his
own


indisputably
.
she
could
see
they
walk
to
his
room
of
their
own


accord
,
expressive
in
his
absence
of
pathos
,
surliness
,
ill
-
temper
,


charm
.




"
what
beautiful
boot
!
"
she
exclaim
.
she
be
ashamed
of
herself
.
to


praise
his
boot
when
he
ask
she
to
solace
his
soul
;
when
he
have


show
she
his
bleed
hand
,
his
lacerated
heart
,
and
ask
she
to


pity
they
,
then
to
say
,
cheerfully
,
"
ah

but
what
beautiful
boot

wear
!
"

,
she
know
,
and
she
look
up

in
one


of
his
sudden
roar
of
ill

temper
complete
annihilation
.




instead
,
Mr.
Ramsay
smile
.
his
pall
,
his
drapery
,
his
infirmity


fall
from
he
.
ah

he
say
,
hold
his
foot
up
for
she
to
look


at

only
one
man
in
England

among
the
chief
curse
of


mankind

cripple
and
torture
the
human
foot
.
"
they
be
also
the
most


obstinate
and
perverse
of
mankind
.
it
have
take
he
the
good
part
of


his
youth
to
get
boot
make
as
they
should
be
make
.
he
would
have
she


observe
 
he
lift
his
right
foot
and
then
his
left
 
that
she
have
never


see
boot
make
quite
that
shape
before
.
they
be
make
of
the
fine


leather
in
the
world
,
also
.
Most
leather
be
mere
brown
paper
and


cardboard
.
he
look
complacently
at
his
foot
,
still
hold
in
the
air
.


they
have
reach
,
she
feel
,
a
sunny
island
where
peace
dwelt
,
sanity


reign
and
the
sun
for
ever
shine
,
the
bless
island
of
good
boot
.


her
heart
warm
to
he
.
"
now
let
I
see
if
you
can
tie
a
knot
,
"
he


say
.
he
poohpoohe
her
feeble
system
.
he
show
she
his
own


invention
.
once
you
tie
it
,
it
never
come
undone
.
three
time
he


knot
her
shoe
;
three
time
he
unknotte
it
.




why
,
at
this
completely
inappropriate
moment
,
when
he
be
stoop
over


her
shoe
,
should
she
be
so
torment
with
sympathy
for
he
that
,
as
she


stoop
too
,
the
blood
rush
to
her
face
,
and
,
thinking
of
she


callousness
 
she
have
call
he
a
play
-
actor
 
she
feel
her
eye
swell


and
tingle
with
tear
?
thus
occupy
he
seem
to
she
a
figure
of


infinite
pathos
.
he
tie
knot
.
he
buy
boot
.
there
be
no
helping


Mr.
Ramsay
on
the
journey
he
be
go
.
but
now
just
as
she
wish
to


say
something
,
could
have
say
something
,
perhaps
,
here
they
be
-
Cam


and
James
.
they
appear
on
the
terrace
.
they
come
,
lagging
,
side
by


side
,
a
serious
,
melancholy
couple
.




but
why
be
it
like
that
that
they
come
?
she
could
not
help
feel


annoy
with
they
;
they
might
have
come
more
cheerfully
;
they
might


have
give
he
what
,
now
that
they
be
off
,
she
would
not
have
the


chance
of
give
he
.
for
she
feel
a
sudden
emptiness
;
a
frustration
.


her
feeling
have
come
too
late
;
there
it
be
ready
;
but
he
no
long


need
it
.
he
have
become
a
very
distinguished
,
elderly
man
,
who
have
no


need
of
her
whatsoever
.
she
feel
snub
.
he
sling
a
knapsack
round


his
shoulder
.
he
share
out
the
parcel
-
there
be
a
number
of
they
,


ill
tie
in
brown
paper
.
he
send
Cam
for
a
cloak
.
he
have
all
the


appearance
of
a
leader
make
ready
for
an
expedition
.
then
,
wheel


about
,
he
lead
the
way
with
his
firm
military
tread
,
in
those
wonderful


boot
,
carry
brown
paper
parcel
,
down
the
path
,
his
child


follow
he
.
they
look
,
she
think
,
as
if
fate
have
devote
they


to
some
stern
enterprise
,
and
they
go
to
it
,
still
young
enough
to
be


draw
acquiescent
in
their
father
's
wake
,
obediently
,
but
with
a
pallor


in
their
eye
which
make
she
feel
that
they
suffer
something
beyond


their
year
in
silence
.
so
they
pass
the
edge
of
the
lawn
,
and
it


seem
to
Lily
that
she
watch
a
procession
go
,
draw
on
by
some


stress
of
common
feeling
which
make
it
,
falter
and
flagging
as
it


be
,
a
little
company
bind
together
and
strangely
impressive
to
she
.


politely
,
but
very
distantly
,
Mr.
Ramsay
raise
his
hand
and
salute
she


as
they
pass
.




but
what
a
face
,
she
think
,
immediately
find
the
sympathy
which


she
have
not
be
ask
to
give
trouble
she
for
expression
.
what
have


make
it
like
that
?
thinking
,
night
after
night
,
she
suppose
-
about


the
reality
of
kitchen
table
,
she
add
,
remember
the
symbol
which


in
her
vagueness
as
to
what
Mr.
Ramsay
do
think
about
Andrew
have
give


she
.
 
he
have
be
kill
by
the
splinter
of
a
shell
instantly
,
she


bethought
she
.
 
the
kitchen
table
be
something
visionary
,
austere
;


something
bare
,
hard
,
not
ornamental
.
there
be
no
colour
to
it
;
it


be
all
edge
and
angle
;
it
be
uncompromisingly
plain
.
but
Mr.
Ramsay


keep
always
his
eye
fix
upon
it
,
never
allow
himself
to
be


distracted
or
delude
,
until
his
face
became
worn
too
and
ascetic
and


partook
of
this
unornamented
beauty
which
so
deeply
impress
she
.


then
,
she
recall
 
stand
where
he
have
leave
she
,
hold
her
brush
,


worry
have
fret
it
-
not
so
nobly
.
he
must
have
have
his
doubt


about
that
table
,
she
suppose
;
whether
the
table
be
a
real
table
;


whether
it
be
worth
the
time
he
give
to
it
;
whether
he
be
able
after


all
to
find
it
.
he
have
have
doubt
,
she
feel
,
or
he
would
have
ask


less
of
people
.
that
be
what
they
talk
about
late
at
night


sometimes
,
she
suspect
;
and
then
next
day
Mrs.
Ramsay
look
tired
,


and
Lily
fly
into
a
rage
with
he
over
some
absurd
little
thing
.
but


now
he
have
nobody
to
talk
to
about
that
table
,
or
his
boot
,
or
his


knot
;
and
he
be
like
a
lion
seek
whom
he
could
devour
,
and
his


face
have
that
touch
of
desperation
,
of
exaggeration
in
it
which
alarm


she
,
and
make
she
pull
her
skirt
about
she
.
and
then
,
she
recall
,


there
be
that
sudden
revivification
,
that
sudden
flare
 
when
she


praise
his
boot
,
that
sudden
recovery
of
vitality
and
interest
in


ordinary
human
thing
,
which
too
pass
and
change
 
for
he
be
always


change
,
and
hide
nothing
 
into
that
other
final
phase
which
be
new
to


she
and
have
,
she
own
,
make
herself
ashamed
of
her
own
irritability
,


when
it
seem
as
if
he
have
shed
worry
and
ambition
,
and
the
hope
of


sympathy
and
the
desire
for
praise
,
have
enter
some
other
region
,
be


draw
on
,
as
if
by
curiosity
,
in
dumb
colloquy
,
whether
with
himself
or


another
,
at
the
head
of
that
little
procession
out
of
one
's
range
.
an


extraordinary
face
!
the
gate
bang
.






4






so
they
be
go
,
she
think
,
sigh
with
relief
and
disappointment
.


her
sympathy
seem
to
be
cast
back
on
she
,
like
a
bramble
sprung


across
her
face
.
she
feel
curiously
divide
,
as
if
one
part
of
she


be
draw
out
there
-
it
be
a
still
day
,
hazy
;
the
Lighthouse
look


this
morning
at
an
immense
distance
;
the
other
have
fix
itself


doggedly
,
solidly
,
here
on
the
lawn
.
she
see
her
canvas
as
if
it
have


float
up
and
place
itself
white
and
uncompromise
directly
before


she
.
it
seem
to
rebuke
she
with
its
cold
stare
for
all
this
hurry


and
agitation
;
this
folly
and
waste
of
emotion
;
it
drastically
recall


she
and
spread
through
her
mind
first
a
peace
,
as
her
disorderly


sensation
 
he
have
go
and
she
have
be
so
sorry
for
he
and
she
have


say
nothing
 
troop
off
the
field
;
and
then
,
emptiness
.
she
look


blankly
at
the
canvas
,
with
its
uncompromising
white
stare
;
from
the


canvas
to
the
garden
.
there
be
something
 
she
stand
screw
up
she


little
chinese
eye
in
her
small
pucker
face
,
something
she


remember
in
the
relation
of
those
line
cut
across
,
slice


down
,
and
in
the
mass
of
the
hedge
with
its
green
cave
of
blue
and


brown
,
which
have
stay
in
her
mind
;
which
have
tie
a
knot
in
her
mind


so
that
at
odd
and
end
of
time
,
involuntarily
,
as
she
walk
along


the
Brompton
Road
,
as
she
brush
her
hair
,
she
find
herself
paint


that
picture
,
pass
her
eye
over
it
,
and
untie
the
knot
in


imagination
.
but
there
be
all
the
difference
in
the
world
between


this
planning
airily
away
from
the
canvas
and
actually
take
her
brush


and
make
the
first
mark
.




she
have
take
the
wrong
brush
in
her
agitation
at
Mr.
Ramsay
's
presence
,


and
her
easel
,
ram
into
the
earth
so
nervously
,
be
at
the
wrong


angle
.
and
now
that
she
have
ut
that
right
,
and
in
so
do
have
subdue


the
impertinence
and
irrelevance
that
pluck
her
attention
and
make


her
remember
how
she
be
such
and
such
a
person
,
have
such
and
such


relation
to
people
,
she
take
her
hand
and
raise
her
brush
.
for
a


moment
it
stayed
tremble
in
a
painful
but
exciting
ecstasy
in
the


air
.
where
to
begin
?
-
that
be
the
question
at
what
point
to
make


the
first
mark
?
one
line
place
on
the
canvas
commit
she
to


innumerable
risk
,
to
frequent
and
irrevocable
decision
.
all
that
in


idea
seem
simple
become
in
practice
immediately
complex
;
as
the
wave


shape
themselves
symmetrically
from
the
cliff
top
,
but
to
the
swimmer


among
they
be
divide
by
steep
gulfs
,
and
foam
crest
.
still
the


risk
must
be
run
;
the
mark
make
.




with
a
curious
physical
sensation
,
as
if
she
be
urge
forward
and
at


the
same
time
must
hold
herself
back
,
she
make
she
first
quick
decisive


stroke
.
the
brush
descend
.
it
flicker
brown
over
the
white
canvas
;


it
leave
a
running
mark
.
a
second
time
she
do
it
-
a
third
time
.
and


so
pause
and
so
flicker
,
she
attain
a
dancing
rhythmical


movement
,
as
if
the
pause
be
one
part
of
the
rhythm
and
the
stroke


another
,
and
all
be
relate
;
and
so
,
lightly
and
swiftly
pause
,


strike
,
she
score
her
canvas
with
brown
run
nervous
line
which


have
no
soon
settle
there
than
they
enclose
  
she
feel
it
loom


out
at
her
 
a
space
.
down
in
the
hollow
of
one
wave
she
see
the
next


wave
tower
high
and
high
above
she
.
for
what
could
be
more


formidable
than
that
space
?
here
she
be
again
,
she
think
,
step


back
to
look
at
it
,
draw
out
of
gossip
,
out
of
living
,
out
of


community
with
people
into
the
presence
of
this
formidable
ancient


enemy
of
hers
-
this
other
thing
,
this
truth
,
this
reality
,
which


suddenly
lay
hand
on
she
,
emerge
stark
at
the
back
of
appearance


and
command
her
attention
.
she
be
half
unwilling
,
half
reluctant
.


why
always
be
draw
out
and
hale
away
?
why
not
leave
in
peace
,
to


talk
to
Mr.
Carmichael
on
the
lawn
?
it
be
an
exact
form
of


intercourse
anyhow
.
other
worshipful
object
be
content
with


worship
;
man
,
woman
,
God
,
all
let
one
kneel
prostrate
;
but
this


form
,
be
it
only
the
shape
of
a
white
lamp
-
shade

in
which

the
fluidity


of
life
for
the
concentration
of

she
have
a
few
moment
of


nakedness
when
she
seem
like
an
unborn
soul
,
a
soul
reft
of

on
some
windy
pinnacle
and
expose
without
protection
to
all


the
blast
of
doubt
.
why
then
do
she
do
it
?
she
look
at

.
it
would
be
roll
up
and

under
a

.


what
be
the
good
of

then
,

she
hear
some
voice

she

at
the

be
strong
enough
to
bear

spurting
over
that
glaring
,


hideously
difficult
white
space
,
while
she
model

at

he
would
sit
right
in


the
middle
of
the
view
.
but
after
all
,
she
reflect
,
there
be
the


scene
on
the
beach
.
one
must
remember
that
.
it
be
a
windy
morning
.


they
have
all
go
down
to
the
beach
.
Mrs.
Ramsay
sit
down
and
write


letter
by
a
rock
.
she
write
and
write
.
"
oh
,
"
she
say
,
look
up
at


something
float
in
the
sea
,
"
be
it
a
lobster
pot
?
be
it
an
upturned


boat
?
"
she
be
so
short
-
sighted
that
she
could
not
see
,
and
then


Charles
Tansley
become
as
nice
as
he
could
possibly
be
.
he
begin


play
duck
and
drake
.
they
choose
little
flat
black
stone
and
send


they
skip
over
the
wave
.
every
now
and
then
Mrs.
Ramsay
look
up


over
her
spectacle
and
laugh
at
they
.
what
they
say
she
could
not


remember
,
but
only
she
and
Charles
throw
stone
and
get
on
very


well
all
of
a
sudden
and
Mrs.
Ramsay
watch
they
.
she
be
highly


conscious
of
that
.
Mrs.
Ramsay
,
she
think
,
step
back
and
screw


up
her
eye
.
 
it
must
have
alter
the
design
a
good
deal
when
she
be


sit
on
the
step
with
James
.
there
must
have
be
a
shadow
.
 
when


she
think
of
herself
and
Charles
throw
duck
and
drake
and
of
the


whole
scene
on
the
beach
,
it
seem
to
depend
somehow
upon
Mrs.
Ramsay


sit
under
the
rock
,
with
a
pad
on
her
knee
,
write
letter
.
 
she


write
innumerable
letter
,
and
sometimes
the
wind
take
they
and
she
and


Charles
just
save
a
page
from
the
sea
.
 
but
what
a
power
be
in
the


human
soul
!
she
think
.
that
woman
sit
there
write
under
the


rock
resolve
everything
into
simplicity
;
make
these
anger
,


irritation
fall
off
like
old
rag
;
she
bring
together
this
and
that


and
then
this
,
and
so
make
out
of
that
miserable
silliness
and
spite


 
she
and
Charles
squabbling
,
spar
,
have
be
silly
and
spiteful


something
-
this
scene
on
the
beach
for
example
,
this
moment
of


friendship
and
liking
-
which
survive
,
after
all
these
year
complete
,


so
that
she
dip
into
it
to
re
-
fashion
her
memory
of
he
,
and
there


it
stay
in
the
mind
affect
one
almost
like
a
work
of
art
.




"
like
a
work
of
art
,
"
she
repeat
,
look
from
her
canvas
to
the


drawing
-
room
step
and
back
again
.
she
must
rest
for
a
moment
.
and
,


rest
,
look
from
one
to
the
other
vaguely
,
the
old
question
which


traverse
the
sky
of
the
soul
perpetually
,
the
vast
,
the
general


question
which
be
apt
to
particularise
itself
at
such
moment
as


these
,
when
she
release
faculty
that
have
be
on
the
strain
,
stand


over
she
,
pause
over
she
,
darken
over
she
.
what
be
the
meaning
of


life
?
that
be
all
-
a
simple
question
;
one
that
tend
to
close
in
on


one
with
year
.
the
great
revelation
have
never
come
.
the
great


revelation
perhaps
never
do
come
.
instead
there
be
little
daily


miracle
,
illumination
,
match
strike
unexpectedly
in
the
dark
;


here
be
one
.
this
,
that
,
and
the
other
;
herself
and
Charles
Tansley


and
the
break
wave
;
Mrs.
Ramsay
bring
they
together
;
Mrs.
Ramsay


say
,
"
life
stand
still
here
"
;
Mrs.
Ramsay
making
of
the
moment


something
permanent
 
as
in
another
sphere
Lily
herself
try
to


make
of
the
moment
something
permanent
 
-
this
be
of
the
nature


of
a
revelation
.
in
the
midst
of
chaos
there
be
shape
;
this
eternal


pass
and
flow
 
she
look
at
the
cloud
go
and
the
leave


shake
 
be
strike
into
stability
.
life
stand
still
here
,
Mrs.
Ramsay


say
.
"
Mrs.
Ramsay
!
Mrs.
Ramsay
!
"
she
repeat
.
she
owe
it
all
to
she
.




all
be
silence
.
nobody
seem
yet
to
be
stir
in
the
house
.
she


look
at
it
there
sleep
in
the
early
sunlight
with
its
window


green
and
blue
with
the
reflect
leave
.
the
faint
think
she
be


thinking
of
Mrs.
Ramsay
seem
in
consonance
with
this
quiet
house
;
this


smoke
;
this
fine
early
morning
air
.
Faint
and
unreal
,
it
be
amazingly


pure
and
exciting
.
she
hope
nobody
would
open
the
window
or
come
out


of
the
house
,
but
that
she
might
be
leave
alone
to
go
on
thinking
,
to
go


on
painting
.
she
turn
to
her
canvas
.
but
impel
by
some
curiosity
,


drive
by
the
discomfort
of
the
sympathy
which
she
hold
undischarged
,


she
walk
a
pace
or
so
to
the
end
of
the
lawn
to
see
whether
,
down


there
on
the
beach
,
she
could
see
that
little
company
set
sail
.


down
there
among
the
little
boat
which
float
,
some
with
their
sail


furl
,
some
slowly
,
for
it
be
very
calm
move
away
,
there
be
one


rather
apart
from
the
other
.
the
sail
be
even
now
be
hoist
.


she
decide
that
there
in
that
very
distant
and
entirely
silent
little


boat
Mr.
Ramsay
be
sit
with
Cam
and
James
.
now
they
have
get
the


sail
up
;
now
after
a
little
flagging
and
silence
,
she
watch
the
boat


take
its
way
with
deliberation
past
the
other
boat
out
to
sea
.






5






the
sail
flap
over
their
head
.
the
water
chuckle
and
slap
the


side
of
the
boat
,
which
drowse
motionless
in
the
sun
.
now
and
then


the
sail
ripple
with
a
little
breeze
in
they
,
but
the
ripple
run
over


they
and
cease
.
the
boat
make
no
motion
at
all
.
Mr.
Ramsay
sit
in
the


middle
of
the
boat
.
he
would
be
impatient
in
a
moment
,
James
think
,


and
Cam
think
,
look
at
her
father
,
who
sit
in
the
middle
of
the


boat
between
they
 
James
steer
;
Cam
sit
alone
in
the
bow
 
with
his


leg
tightly
curl
.
he
hate
hang
about
.
sure
enough
,
after


fidget
a
second
or
two
,
he
say
something
sharp
to
Macalister
's
boy
,


who
get
out
his
oar
and
begin
to
row
.
but
their
father
,
they
know
,


would
never
be
content
until
they
be
fly
along
.
he
would
keep


look
for
a
breeze
,
fidget
,
say
thing
under
his
breath
,
which


Macalister
and
and
Macalister
's
boy
would
overhear
,
and
they
would
both


be
make
horribly
uncomfortable
.
he
have
make
they
come
.
he
have
force


they
to
come
.
in
their
anger
they
hope
that
the
breeze
would
never


rise
,
that
he
might
be
thwart
in
every
possible
way
,
since
he
have


force
they
to
come
against
their
will
.




all
the
way
down
to
the
beach
they
have
lag
behind
together
,
though


he
bid
they
"
walk
up
,
walk
up
,
"
without
speak
.
their
head
be


bent
down
,
their
head
be
press
down
by
some
remorseless
gale
.


speak
to
he
they
could
not
.
they
must
come
;
they
must
follow
.
they


must
walk
behind
he
carry
brown
paper
parcel
.
but
they
vow
,
in


silence
,
as
they
walk
,
to
stand
by
each
other
and
carry
out
the
great


compact
-
to
resist
tyranny
to
the
death
.
so
there
they
would
sit
,
one


at
one
end
of
the
boat
,
one
at
the
other
,
in
silence
.
they
would
say


nothing
,
only
look
at
he
now
and
then
where
he
sit
with
his
leg


twist
,
frown
and
fidgeting
,
and
pishe
and
pshawing
and
mutter


thing
to
himself
,
and
wait
impatiently
for
a
breeze
.
and
they


hope
it
would
be
calm
.
they
hope
he
would
be
thwart
.
they
hope


the
whole
expedition
would
fail
,
and
they
would
have
to
put
back
,
with


their
parcel
,
to
the
beach
.




but
now
,
when
Macalister
's
boy
have
row
a
little
way
out
,
the
sail


slowly
swing
round
,
the
boat
quicken
itself
,
flatten
itself
,
and


shoot
off
.
instantly
,
as
if
some
great
strain
have
be
relieve
,
Mr.


Ramsay
uncurl
his
leg
,
take
out
his
tobacco
pouch
,
hand
it
with
a


little
grunt
to
Macalister
,
and
feel
,
they
know
,
for
all
they
suffer
,


perfectly
content
.
now
they
would
sail
on
for
hour
like
this
,
and
Mr.


Ramsay
would
ask
old
Macalister
a
question
-
about
the
great
storm


last
winter
probably
-
and
old
Macalister
would
answer
it
,
and
they


would
puff
their
pipe
together
,
and
Macalister
would
take
a
tarry
rope


in
his
finger
,
tie
or
untie
some
knot
,
and
the
boy
would
fish
,
and


never
say
a
word
to
any
one
.
James
would
be
force
to
keep
his
eye
all


the
time
on
the
sail
.
for
if
he
forget
,
then
the
sail
pucker
and


shiver
,
and
the
boat
slacken
,
and
Mr.
Ramsay
would
say
sharply
,


"
look
out
!
look
out
!
"
and
old
Macalister
would
turn
slowly
on
his


seat
.
so
they
hear
Mr.
Ramsay
ask
some
question
about
the
great


storm
at
Christmas
.
"

round
the
point
,
"
old


Macalister

,

the
great
storm
last
Christmas
,
when
ten


ship
have
be
drive
into
the
bay
for
shelter
,
and
he
have
see
"
one


there
,
one

,
one
there
"
 
he
point
slowly
round
the
bay
.
Mr.


Ramsay
follow
he
,
turn
his
head
.
he
have
see
four
man
cling


to
the
mast
.
then
she
be
go
.
"
and
at
last
we
shove
she
off
,
"
he


go
on
 
but
in
their
anger
and
their
silence
they
only
catch
a
word


here
and
there
,
sit
at
opposite
end
of
the
boat
,
unite
by
their


compact
to
fight
tyranny
to
the
death
.
at
last
they
have
shove


she
off
,
they
have
launch
the
lifeboat
,
and
they
have
get
she
out


past
the
point
-
Macalister
tell
the
story
;
and
though
they
only


catch
a
word
here
and
there
,
they
be
conscious
all
the
time
of
their


father
-
how
he
leant
forward
,
how
he
bring
his
voice
into
tune
with


Macalister
's
voice
;
how
,
puff
at
his
pipe
,
and
look
there
and


there
where
Macalister
point
,
he
relish
the
thought
of
the
storm


and
the
dark
night
and
the
fisherman
strive
there
.
he
like
that
man


should
labour
and
sweat
on
the
windy
beach
at
night
;
pit
muscle
and


brain
against
the
wave
and
the
wind
;
he
like
man
to
work
like
that
,


and
woman
to
keep
house
,
and
sit
beside
sleep
child
indoor
,


while
man
be
drown
,
out
there
in
a
storm
.
so
James
could
tell
,
so


cam
could
tell
 
they
look
at
he
,
they
look
at
each
other
,
from


his
toss
and
his
vigilance
and
the
ring
in
his
voice
,
and
the
little


tinge
of
scottish
accent
which
come
into
his
voice
,
make
he
seem


like
a
peasant
himself
,
as
he
question
Macalister
about
the
eleven


ship
that
have
be
drive
into
the
bay
in
a
storm
.
three
have
sink
.




he
look
proudly
where
Macalister
point
;
and
Cam
think
,
feel


proud
of
he
without
know
quite
why
,
have
he
be
there
he
would
have


launch
the
lifeboat
,
he
would
have
reach
the
wreck
,
Cam
think
.


he
be
so
brave
,
he
be
so
adventurous
,
Cam
think
.
but
she


remember
.
there
be
the
compact
;
to
resist
tyranny
to
the
death
.


their
grievance
weigh
they
down
.
they
have
be
force
;
they
have
be


bid
.
he
have
bear
they
down
once
more
with
his
gloom
and
his


authority
,
make
they
do
his
bidding
,
on
this
fine
morning
,
come
,


because
he
wish
it
,
carry
these
parcel
,
to
the
lighthouse
;
take


part
in
these
rite
he
go
through
for
his
own
pleasure
in
memory
of


dead
people
,
which
they
hate
,
so
that
they
lag
after
he
,
all


the
pleasure
of
the
day
be
spoil
.




yes
,
the
breeze
be
freshen
.
the
boat
be
lean
,
the
water
be


slice
sharply
and
fall
away
in
green
cascade
,
in
bubble
,
in


cataract
.
Cam
look
down
into
the
foam
,
into
the
sea
with
all
its


treasure
in
it
,
and
its
speed
hypnotise
she
,
and
the
tie
between
she


and
James
sag
a
little
.
it
slacken
a
little
.
she
begin
to
think
,


how
fast
it
go
.
where
be
we
go
?
and
the
movement
hypnotise
she
,


while
James
,
with
his
eye
fix
on
the
sail
and
on
the
horizon
,
steer


grimly
.
but
he
begin
to
think
as
he
steer
that
he
might
escape
;
he


might
be
quit
of
it
all
.
they
might
land
somewhere
;
and
be
free
then
.


both
of
they
,
look
at
each
other
for
a
moment
,
have
a
sense
of
escape


and
exaltation
,
what
with
the
speed
and
the
change
.
but
the
breeze


breed
in
Mr.
Ramsay
too
the
same
excitement
,
and
,
as
old
Macalister


turn
to
fling
his
line
overboard
,
he
cry
out
aloud
,




"
we
perish
,
"
and
then
again
,
"
each
alone
.
"
and
then
with
his
usual


spasm
of
repentance
or
shyness
,
pull
himself
up
,
and
wave
his
hand


towards
the
shore
.




"
see
the
little
house
,
"
he
say
point
,
wish
Cam
to
look
.
she


raise
herself
reluctantly
and
look
.
but
which
be
it
?
she
could
no


long
make
out
,
there
on
the
hillside
,
which
be
their
house
.
all


look
distant
and
peaceful
and
strange
.
the
shore
seem
refined
,
far


away
,
unreal
.
already
the
little
distance
they
have
sail
have
put
they


far
from
it
and
give
it
the
changed
look
,
the
compose
look
,
of


something
recede
in
which
one
have
no
long
any
part
.
which
be


their
house
?
she
could
not
see
it
.




"
but
I
beneath
a
rougher
sea
,
"
Mr.
Ramsay
murmur
.
he
have
find
the


house
and
so
see
it
,
he
have
also
see
himself
there
;
he
have
see


himself
walk
on
the
terrace
,
alone
.
he
be
walk
up
and
down


between
the
urn
;
and
he
seem
to
himself
very
old
and
bow
.
sit


in
the
boat
,
he
bow
,
he
crouch
himself
,
act
instantly
his
part
-


the
part
of
a
desolate
man
,
widow
,
bereft
;
and
so
call
up
before


he
in
host
people
sympathise
with
he
;
stage
for
himself
as
he
sit


in
the
boat
,
a
little
drama
;
which
require
of
he
decrepitude
and


exhaustion
and
sorrow
 
he
raise
his
hand
and
look
at
the
thinness


of
they
,
to
confirm
his
dream
 
and
then
there
be
give
he
in


abundance
woman
's
sympathy
,
and
he
imagine
how
they
would
soothe
he


and
sympathise
with
he
,
and
so
get
in
his
dream
some
reflection
of


the
exquisite
pleasure
woman
's
sympathy
be
to
he
,
he
sigh
and
say


gently
and
mournfully
:






but
I
beneath
a
rougher
sea


be
whelm
in
deep
gulfs
than
he
,






so
that
the
mournful
word
be
hear
quite
clearly
by
they
all
.
Cam


half
start
on
her
seat
.

shock
she
-
it
outrage

.
the


movement
rouse
her
father
;
and
he
shudder
,
and
break
off
,


exclaim
:
"
look

look
!
"
so
urgently
that
James
also
turn
his
head


to
look
over
his
shoulder
at
the
island
.
they
all
look
.
they
look


at
the
island
.




but
Cam
could
see
nothing
.
she
be
think
how
all
those
path
and


the
lawn
,
thick
and
knot
with
the
life

have
live
there
,
be


gone
:
be
rub
out
;
be
past
;
be
unreal

the
boat
and
the
sail
with
its
patch
;
Macalister
with
his
earring
;
the


noise
of
the
wave
-
all
this
be
real
.
think
this
,
she
be


murmur
to
herself
,
"
we
perish

each
alone
,
"
for
her
father
's
word


break
and
break
again
in
her
mind
,
when
her
father
,
see
she
gaze


so
vaguely
,
begin
to
tease
she
.
do
n't
 
she
know
the
point
of
the


compass
?
he
ask
.
do
n't
 
she
know
the
North
from
the
South
?
do
she


really
think
they
live
right
out
there
?
and
he
point
again
,
and


show
she
where
their
house
be
,
there
,
by
those
tree
.
he
wish
she


would
try
to
be
more
accurate
,
he
say
:
"
tell
I
-
which
be
East
,
which


be
west
?
"
he
say
,
half
laugh
at
she
,
half
scold
she
,
for
he


could
not
understand
the
state
of
mind
of
any
one
,
not
absolutely


imbecile
,
who
do
not
know
the
point
of
the
compass
.
yet
she
do
not


know
.
and
see
she
gaze
,
with
her
vague
,
now
rather
frightened
,


eye
fix
where
no
house
be
Mr.
Ramsay
forget
his
dream
;
how
he
walk


up
and
down
between
the
urn
on
the
terrace
;
how
the
arm
be


stretch
out
to
he
.
he
think
,
woman
be
always
like
that
;
the


vagueness
of
their
mind
be
hopeless
;
it
be
a
thing
he
have
never
be


able
to
understand
;
but
so
it
be
.
it
have
be
so
with
she
-
his
wife
.


they
could
not
keep
anything
clearly
fix
in
their
mind
.
but
he
have


be
wrong
to
be
angry
with
she
;
moreover
,
do
he
not
rather
like
this


vagueness
in
woman
?
it
be
part
of
their
extraordinary
charm
.
I
will


make
her
smile
at
I
,
he
think
.
she
look
frightened
.
she
be
so


silent
.
he
clutch
his
finger
,
and
determine
that
his
voice
and
his


face
and
all
the
quick
expressive
gesture
which
have
be
at
his


command
make
people
pity
he
and
praise
he
all
these
year
should


subdue
themselves
.
he
would
make
her
smile
at
he
.
he
would
find
some


simple
easy
thing
to
say
to
she
.
but
what
?
for
,
wrap
up
in
his


work
as
he
be
,
he
forget
the
sort
of
thing
one
say
.
there
be
a


puppy
.
they
have
a
puppy
.
who
be
look
after
the
puppy
today
?
he


ask
.
yes
,
think
James
pitilessly
,
see
his
sister
's
head
against


the
sail
,
now
she
will
give
way
.
I
shall
be
leave
to
fight
the
tyrant


alone
.
the
compact
would
be
leave
to
he
to
carry
out
.
Cam
would
never


resist
tyranny
to
the
death
,
he
think
grimly
,
watch
her
face
,
sad
,


sulky
,
yield
.
and
as
sometimes
happen
when
a
cloud
fall
on
a


green
hillside
and
gravity
descend
and
there
among
all
the
surround


hill
be
gloom
and
sorrow
,
and
it
seem
as
if
the
hill
themselves


must
ponder
the
fate
of
the
clouded
,
the
darken
,
either
in
pity
,


or
maliciously
rejoice
in
her
dismay
:
so
Cam
now
feel
herself


overcast
,
as
she
sit
there
among
calm
,
resolute
people
and
wonder


how
to
answer
her
father
about
the
puppy
;
how
to
resist
his


entreaty
-
forgive
I
,
care
for
I
;
while
James
the
lawgiver
,
with
the


tablet
of
eternal
wisdom
lay
open
on
his
knee
 
his
hand
on
the
tiller


have
become
symbolical
to
she
,
say
,
resist
he
.
fight
he
.
he
say


so
rightly
;
justly
.
for
they
must
fight
tyranny
to
the
death
,
she


think
.
of
all
human
quality
she
reverence
justice
most
.
she


brother
be
most
god
-
like
,
her
father
most
suppliant
.
and
to
which
do


she
yield
,
she
think
,
sit
between
they
,
gaze
at
the
shore
whose


point
be
all
unknown
to
she
,
and
think
how
the
lawn
and
the


terrace
and
the
house
be
smooth
away
now
and
peace
dwell
there
.




"
jasper
,
"
she
say
sullenly
.
he
'd
look
after
the
puppy
.




and
what
be
she
go
to
call
he
?
her
father
persist
.
he
have
have


a
dog
when
he
be
a
little
boy
,
call
Frisk
.
she
'll
give
way
,
James


think
,
as
he
watch
a
look
come
upon
her
face
,
a
look
he
remember
.


they
look
down
he
think
,
at
their
knitting
or
something
.
then


suddenly
they
look
up
.
there
be
a
flash
of
blue
,
he
remember
,
and


then
somebody
sit
with
he
laugh
,
surrender
,
and
he
be
very


angry
.
it
must
have
be
his
mother
,
he
think
,
sit
on
a
low


chair
,
with
his
father
stand
over
she
.
he
begin
to
search
among
the


infinite
series
of
impression
which
time
have
lay
down
,
leaf
upon


leaf
,
fold
upon
fold
softly
,
incessantly
upon
his
brain
;
among
scent
,


sound
;
voice
,
harsh
,
hollow
,
sweet
;
and
light
pass
,
and
broom


tap
;
and
the
wash
and
hush
of
the
sea
,
how
a
man
have
march
up
and


down
and
stop
dead
,
upright
,
over
they
.
meanwhile
,
he
notice
,
Cam


dabble
her
finger
in
the
water
,
and
stare
at
the
shore
and
say


nothing
.
no
,
she
wo
n't
 
give
way
,
he
think
;
she
be
different
,
he


think
.
well
,
if
Cam
would
not
answer
he
,
he
would
not
bother
her
Mr.


Ramsay
decide
,
feel
in
his
pocket
for
a
book
.
but
she
would
answer


he
;
she
wish
,
passionately
,
to
move
some
obstacle
that
lie
upon
she


tongue
and
to
say
,
oh
,
yes
,
Frisk
.
I
'll
call
he
Frisk
.
she
want


even
to
say
,
be
that
the
dog
that
find
its
way
over
the
moor
alone
?


but
try
as
she
might
,
she
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
like
that
,


fierce
and
loyal
to
the
compact
,
yet
pass
on
to
her
father
,


unsuspected
by
James
,
a
private
token
of
the
love
she
feel
for
he
.


for
she
think
,
dabble
her
hand
 
and
now
Macalister
's
boy
have
catch


a
mackerel
,
and
it
lie
kicking
on
the
floor
,
with
blood
on
its
gill


for
she
think
,
look
at
James
who
keep
his
eye
dispassionately
on


the
sail
,
or
glance
now
and
then
for
a
second
at
the
horizon
,
you
be


not
expose
to
it
,
to
this
pressure
and
division
of
feeling
,
this


extraordinary
temptation
.
her
father
be
feel
in
his
pocket
;
in


another
second
,
he
would
have
find
his
book
.
for
no
one
attract
she


more
;
his
hand
be
beautiful
,
and
his
foot
,
and
his
voice
,
and
his


word
,
and
his
haste
,
and
his
temper
,
and
his
oddity
,
and
his
passion
,


and
his
say
straight
out
before
every
one
,
we
perish
,
each
alone
,


and
his
remoteness
.
 
he
have
open
his
book
.
 
but
what
remain


intolerable
,
she
think
,
sit
upright
,
and
watch
Macalister
's


boy
tug
the
hook
out
of
the
gill
of
another
fish
,
be
that
crass


blindness
and
tyranny
of
his
which
have
poison
her
childhood
and


raise
bitter
storm
,
so
that
even
now
she
wake
in
the
night
tremble


with
rage
and
remember
some
command
of
his
;
some
insolence
:
"
do


this
,
"
"
do
that
,
"
his
dominance
:
his
"
submit
to
I
.
"




so
she
say
nothing
,
but
look
doggedly
and
sadly
at
the
shore
,


wrap
in
its
mantle
of
peace
;
as
if
the
people
there
have
fall


asleep
,
she
think
;
be
free
like
smoke
,
be
free
to
come
and
go


like
ghost
.
they
have
no
suffering
there
,
she
think
.






6






yes
,
that
be
their
boat
,
Lily
Briscoe
decide
,
stand
on
the
edge
of


the
lawn
.
it
be
the
boat
with
greyish
-
brown
sail
,
which
she
see
now


flatten
itself
upon
the
water
and
shoot
off
across
the
bay
.
there
he


sit
,
she
think
,
and
the
child
be
quite
silent
still
.
and
she


could
not
reach
he
either
.
the
sympathy
she
have
not
give
he
weigh


she
down
.
it
make
it
difficult
for
she
to
paint
.




she
have
always
find
he
difficult
.
she
never
have
be
able
to
praise


he
to
his
face
,
she
remember
.
and
that
reduce
their
relationship
to


something
neutral
,
without
that
element
of
sex
in
it
which
make
his


manner
to
Minta
so
gallant
,
almost
gay
.
he
would
pick
a
flower
for


she
,
lend
she
his
book
.
but
could
he
believe
that
Minta
read
they
?


she
drag
they
about
the
garden
,
stick
in
leave
to
mark
the


place
.




"
D'you
remember
,
Mr.
Carmichael
?
"
she
be
inclined
to
ask
,
look
at


the
old
man
.
but
he
have
pull
his
hat
half
over
his
forehead
;
he
be


asleep
,
or
he
be
dream
,
or
he
be
lie
there
catch
word
,
she


suppose
.




"
D'you
remember
?
"
she
feel
inclined
to
ask
he
as
she
pass
he
,


think
again
of
Mrs.
Ramsay
on
the
beach
;
the
cask
bob
up
and


down
;
and
the
page
fly
.
why
,
after
all
these
year
have
that


survive
,
ring
round
,
light
up
,
visible
to
the
last
detail
,
with
all


before
it
blank
and
all
after
it
blank
,
for
mile
and
mile
?




"
be
it
a
boat
?
be
it
a
cork
?
"
she
would
say
,
Lily
repeat
,
turn


back
,
reluctantly
again
,
to
her
canvas
.
Heaven
be
praise
for
it
,
the


problem
of
space
remain
,
she
think
,
take
up
her
brush
again
.
it


glare
at
she
.
the
whole
mass
of
the
picture
be
poise
upon
that


weight
.
beautiful
and
bright
it
should
be
on
the
surface
,
feathery
and


evanescent
,
one
colour
melt
into
another
like
the
colour
on
a


butterfly
's
wing
;
but
beneath
the
fabric
must
be
clamp
together
with


bolt
of
iron
.
it
be
to
be
a
thing
you
could
ruffle
with
your
breath
;


and
a
thing
you
could
not
dislodge
with
a
team
of
horse
.
and
she
begin


to
lay
on
a
red
,
a
grey
,
and
she
begin
to
model
her
way
into
the
hollow


there
.
at
the
same
time
,
she
seem
to
be
sit
beside
Mrs.
Ramsay
on


the
beach
.




"
be
it
a
boat
?
be
it
a
cask
?
"
Mrs.
Ramsay
say
.
and
she
begin
hunt


round
for
her
spectacle
.
and
she
sit
,
having
find
they
,
silent
,


look
out
to
sea
.
and
lily
,
paint
steadily
,
feel
as
if
a
door
have


open
,
and
one
go
in
and
stand
gaze
silently
about
in
a
high


cathedral
-
like
place
,
very
dark
,
very
solemn
.
shout
come
from
a
world


far
away
.
steamer
vanish
in
stalk
of
smoke
on
the
horizon
.


Charles
throw
stone
and
send
they
skip
.




Mrs.
Ramsay
sit
silent
.
she
be
glad
,
Lily
think
,
to
rest
in
silence
,


uncommunicative
;
to
rest
in
the
extreme
obscurity
of
human


relationship
.
who
know
what
we
be
,
what
we
feel
?
who
know
even
at


the
moment
of
intimacy
,
this
be
knowledge
?
be
n't
 
thing
spoil
then
,


Mrs.
Ramsay
may
have
ask
 
it
seem
to
have
happen
so
often
,
this


silence
by
her
side
 
by
say
they
?
be
n't
 
we
more
expressive
thus
?


the
moment
at
least
seem
extraordinarily
fertile
.
she
ram
a


little
hole
in
the
sand
and
cover
it
up
,
by
way
of
bury
in
it
the


perfection
of
the
moment
.
it
be
like
a
drop
of
silver
in
which
one


dip
and
illumine
the
darkness
of
the
past
.




Lily
step
back
to
get
her
canvas
-
so
-
into
perspective
.
it
be
an


odd
road
to
be
walk
,
this
of
painting
.
out
and
out
one
go
,


far
,
until
at
last
one
seem
to
be
on
a
narrow
plank
,
perfectly


alone
,
over
the
sea
.
and
as
she
dip
into
the
blue
paint
,
she


dip
too
into
the
past
there
.
now
Mrs.
Ramsay
get
up
,
she


remember
.
it
be
time
to
go
back
to
the
house
-
time
for


luncheon
.
and
they
all
walk
up
from
the
beach
together
,
she
walk


behind
with
William
Bankes
,
and
there
be
Minta
in
front
of
they
with
a


hole
in
her
stocking
.
how
that
little
round
hole
of
pink
heel
seem


to
flaunt
itself
before
they
!
how
William
Bankes
deplore
it
,
without
,


so
far
as
she
could
remember
,
say
anything
about
it
!
it
mean
to


he
the
annihilation
of
womanhood
,
and
dirt
and
disorder
,
and
servant


leave
and
bed
not
make
at
mid
-
day
-
all
the
thing
he
most
abhor
.


he
have
a
way
of
shudder
and
spread
his
finger
out
as
if
to
cover


an
unsightly
object
which
he
do
now
-
hold
his
hand
in
front
of


he
.
and
Minta
walk
on
ahead
,
and
presumably
Paul
meet
she
and
she


go
off
with
Paul
in
the
garden
.




the
Rayleys
,
think
Lily
Briscoe
,
squeeze
her
tube
of
green
paint
.


she
collect
her
impression
of
the
Rayleys
.
their
life
appear
to


she
in
a
series
of
scene
;
one
,
on
the
staircase
at
dawn
.
Paul
have


come
in

o'clock

go
on
tunnel

,
into
the

and
he

.
she
see
he
sit
in
the
corner
of
some
lugubrious


place
where
the
smoke
attach
itself
to
the
red
plush
seat
,
and
the


waitress
get
to

and
he

with
a
little
man
who


be
in
the
tea
trade
and
live
at
Surbiton
,
but
that
be
all
Paul
know


about
he
.
and
then
Minta
be
out
when
he
come
home
and
then
there
be


that
scene
on
the
stair
,
when
he
get
the
poker
in
case
of
burglar
 
no


doubt
to

bitterly
,

at
any

horribly
strained
.
Paul
take
she
down

garden
to
look
at
the
belgian
hare
which
he
breed
,
and
Minta
follow


they
,
singing
,
and
put
her
bare
arm
on
his
shoulder
,
lest
he
should


tell
she
anything
.




Minta
be
bore
by
hare
,
Lily
think
.
but
Minta
never
give
herself


away
.
she
never
say
thing
like
that
about
play
chess
in
coffee-


house
.
she
be
far
too
conscious
,
far
too
wary
.
but
to
go
on
with


their
story
-
they
have
get
through
the
dangerous
stage
by
now
.
she
have


be
stay
with
they
last
summer
some
time
and
the
car
break
down
and


Minta
have
to
hand
he
his
tool
.
he
sit
on
the
road
mend
the
car
,


and
it
be
the
way
she
give
he
the
tool
-
business
-
like
,


straightforward
,
friendly
-
that
prove
it
be
all
right
now
.
they
be


"
in
love
"
no
long
;
no
,
he
have
take
up
with
another
woman
,
a
serious


woman
,
with
her
hair
in
a
plait
and
a
case
in
her
hand
 
Minta
have


describe
she
gratefully
,
almost
admiringly
,
who
go
to
meeting
and


share
Paul
's
view
 
they
have
get
more
and
more
pronounced
 
about
the


taxation
of
land
value
and
a
capital
levy
.
far
from
break
up
the


marriage
,
that
alliance
have
right
it
.
they
be
excellent
friend
,


obviously
,
as
he
sit
on
the
road
and
she
hand
he
his
tool
.




so
that
be
the
story
of
the
Rayleys
,
Lily
think
.
she
imagine


herself
tell
it
to
Mrs.
Ramsay
,
who
would
be
full
of
curiosity
to


know
what
have
become
of
the
rayley
.
she
would
feel
a
little


triumphant
,
tell
Mrs.
Ramsay
that
the
marriage
have
not
be
a


success
.




but
the
dead
,
think
Lily
,
encounter
some
obstacle
in
her
design


which
make
her
pause
and
ponder
,
step
back
a
foot
or
so
,
oh
,
the


dead
!
she
murmur
,
one
pity
they
,
one
brush
they
aside
,
one
have


even
a
little
contempt
for
they
.
they
be
at
our
mercy
.
Mrs.
Ramsay


have
fade
and
go
,
she
think
.
we
can
over
-
ride
her
wish
,
improve


away
her
limited
,
old
-
fashioned
idea
.
she
recede
far
and
far


from
we
.
mockingly
she
seem
to
see
she
there
at
the
end
of
the


corridor
of
year
say
,
of
all
incongruous
thing
,
"
Marry
,
marry
!
"


 
sit
very
upright
early
in
the
morning
with
the
bird
begin
to


cheep
in
the
garden
outside
.
and
one
would
have
to
say
to
she
,
it
have


all
go
against
your
wish
.
they
be
happy
like
that
;
I
be
happy
like


this
.
life
have
change
completely
.
at
that
all
her
being
,
even
she


beauty
,
become
for
a
moment
,
dusty
and
out
of
date
.
for
a
moment
Lily
,


stand
there
,
with
the
sun
hot
on
her
back
,
sum
up
the
Rayleys
,


triumph
over
Mrs.
Ramsay
,
who
would
never
know
how
Paul
go
to


coffee
-
house
and
have
a
mistress
;
how
he
sit
on
the
ground
and
Minta

tool
;
how
she
stand
here

,
have
never
marry
,


not
even
William
Bankes
.




Mrs.
Ramsay
have
plan
it
.
perhaps
,
have
she
live
,
she
would
have


compel
it
.
already
that
summer
he
be
"
the
kind
of

.
"
he

.
"
he

,
with
that
faint
touch
of
irony


that
make
Mrs.
Ramsay
slip
through
one
's
finger
,
that
she
have
a


scientific
mind
;
she
like
flower
;
she
be
so
exact
.
what
be
this


mania
of
her
for

?
lily
wonder
,
step
to
and
fro
from


her
easel
.




 
suddenly
,
as
suddenly
as
a
star
slide
in
the
sky
,
a
reddish
light


seem
to
burn
in
her
mind
,
cover
Paul
Rayley
,
issue
from
he
.
it


rise
like
a
fire
send
up
in
token
of
some
celebration
by
savage
on
a


distant
beach
.
she
hear
the
roar
and
the
crackle
.
the
whole
sea
for


mile
round
run
red
and
gold
.
some
winey
smell
mix
with
it
and


intoxicate
she
,
for
she
feel
again
her
own
headlong
desire
to
throw


herself
off
the
cliff
and
be
drown
look
for
a
pearl
brooch
on
a


beach
.
and
the
roar
and
the
crackle
repel
she
with
fear
and


disgust
,
as
if
while
she
see
its
splendour
and
power
she
see
too
how
it


feed
on
the
treasure
of
the
house
,
greedily
,
disgustingly
,
and
she


loathe
it
.
but
for
a
sight
,
for
a
glory
it
surpass
everything
in


her
experience
,
and
burn
year
after
year
like
a
signal
fire
on
a


desert
island
at
the
edge
of
the
sea
,
and
one
have
only
to
say
"
in
love
"


and
instantly
,
as
happen
now
,
up
rise
Paul
's
fire
again
.
and
it
sink


and
she
say
to
herself
,
laugh
,
"
the
rayley
"
;
how
Paul
go
to


coffee
-
house
and
play
chess
.




she
have
only
escape
by
the
skin
of
her
tooth
though
,
she
think
.
she


have
be
look
at
the
table
-
cloth
,
and
it
have
flash
upon
she
that


she
would
move
the
tree
to
the
middle
,
and
need
never
marry
anybody
,


and
she
have
feel
an
enormous
exultation
.
she
have
feel
,
now
she
could


stand
up
to
Mrs.
Ramsay
-
a
tribute
to
the
astonishing
power
that
Mrs.


Ramsay
have
over
one
.
do
this
,
she
say
,
and
one
do
it
.
even
she


shadow
at
the
window
with
James
be
full
of
authority
.
she
remember


how
William
Bankes
have
be
shock
by
her
neglect
of
the
significance


of
mother
and
son
.
do
she
not
admire
their
beauty
?
he
say
.
but


William
,
she
remember
,
have
listen
to
she
with
his
wise
child
's
eye


when
she
explain
how
it
be
not
irreverence
:
how
a
light
there
need


a
shadow
there
and
so
on
.
she
do
not
intend
to
disparage
a
subject


which
,
they
agree
,
Raphael
have
treat
divinely
.
she
be
not
cynical
.


quite
the
contrary
.
thank
to
his
scientific
mind
he
understand
-
a


proof
of
disintereste
intelligence
which
have
please
she
and
comfort


her
enormously
.
one
could
talk
of
painting
then
seriously
to
a
man
.


indeed
,
his
friendship
have
be
one
of
the
pleasure
of
her
life
.
she


love
William
Bankes
.




they
go
to
Hampton
Court
and
he
always
leave
she
,
like
the
perfect


gentleman
he
be
,
plenty
of
time
to
wash
her
hand
,
while
he
stroll


by
the
river
.
that
be
typical
of
their
relationship
.
many
thing
be


leave
unsaid
.
then
they
stroll
through
the
courtyard
,
and
admire
,


summer
after
summer
,
the
proportion
and
the
flower
,
and
he
would
tell


her
thing
,
about
perspective
,
about
architecture
,
as
they
walk
,
and


he
would
stop
to
look
at
a
tree
,
or
the
view
over
the
lake
,
and
admire


a
child
-
 
it
be
his
great
grief
-
he
have
no
daughter
 
in
the
vague
aloof


way
that
be
natural
to
a
man
who
spend
spend
so
much
time
in


laboratorie
that
the
world
when
he
come
out
seem
to
dazzle
he
,


so
that
he
walk
slowly
,
lift
his
hand
to
screen
his
eye
and


pause
,
with
his
head
throw
back
,
merely
to
breathe
the
air
.
then


he
would
tell
she
how
his
housekeeper
be
on
her
holiday
;
he
must


buy
a
new
carpet
for
the
staircase
.
perhaps
she
would
go
with
he
to


buy
a
new
carpet
for
the
staircase
.
and
once
something
lead
he
to
talk


about
the
Ramsays
and
he
have
say
how
when
he
first
see
she
she
have


be
wear
a
grey
hat
;
she
be
not
more
than
nineteen
or
twenty
.
she


be
astonishingly
beautiful
.
there
he
stand
look
down
the
avenue
at


Hampton
Court
as
if
he
could
see
she
there
among
the
fountain
.




she
look
now
at
the
drawing
-
room
step
.
she
see
,
through
William
's


eye
,
the
shape
of
a
woman
,
peaceful
and
silent
,
with
downcast
eye
.


she
sit
musing
,
ponder
 
she
be
in
grey
that
day
,
Lily
think
.


her
eye
be
bent
.
she
would
never
lift
they
.
yes
,
think
Lily
,


look
intently
,
I
must
have
see
she
look
like
that
,
but
not
in
grey
;


nor
so
still
,
nor
so
young
,
nor
so
peaceful
.
the
figure
come
readily


enough
.
she
be
astonishingly
beautiful
,
as
William
say
.
but
beauty


be
not
everything
.
Beauty
have
this
penalty
-
it
come
too
readily
,
come


too
completely
.
it
still
life
-
freeze
it
.
one
forget
the
little


agitation
;
the
flush
,
the
pallor
,
some
queer
distortion
,
some
light
or


shadow
,
which
make
the
face
unrecognisable
for
a
moment
and
yet
add
a


quality
one
see
for
ever
after
.
it
be
simple
to
smooth
that
all
out


under
the
cover
of
beauty
.
but
what
be
the
look
she
have
,
Lily


wonder
,
when
she
clap
her
deer
-
stalker
's
hat
on
her
head
,
or
run


across
the
grass
,
or
scold
Kennedy
,
the
gardener
?
who
could
tell


she
?
who
could
help
she
?




against
she
will
she
have
come
to
the
surface
,
and
find
herself
half


out
of
the
picture
,
look
,
little
dazedly
,
as
if
at
unreal
thing
,
at


Mr.
Carmichael
.
he
lie
on
his
chair
with
his
hand
clasp
above
his


paunch
not
read
,
or
sleep
,
but
bask
like
a
creature
gorge


with
existence
.
his
book
have
fall
on
to
the
grass
.




she
want
to
go
straight
up
to
he
and
say
,
"
Mr.
Carmichael
!
"
then
he


would
look
up
benevolently
as
always
,
from
his
smoky
vague
green
eye
.


but
one
only
wake
people
if
one
know
what
one
want
to
say
to
they
.


and
she
want
to
say
not
one
thing
,
but
everything
.
little
word
that


break
up
the
thought
and
dismember
it
say
nothing
.
"
about
life
,


about
death
;
about
Mrs.
Ramsay
"
-
no
,
she
think
,
one
could
say


nothing
to
nobody
.
the
urgency
of
the
moment
always
miss
its
mark
.


word
flutter
sideways
and
strike
the
object
inch
too
low
.
then


one
give
it
up
;
then
the
idea
sink
back
again
;
then
one
become
like


most
middle
-
aged
people
,
cautious
,
furtive
,
with
wrinkle
between
the


eye
and
a
look
of
perpetual
apprehension
.
for
how
could
one
express


in
word
these
emotion
of
the
body
?
express
that
emptiness
there
?


 
she
be
look
at
the
drawing
-
room
step
;
they
look
extraordinarily


empty
.
 
it
be
one
's
body
feeling
,
not
one
's
mind
.
the
physical


sensation
that
go
with
the
bare
look
of
the
step
have
become


suddenly
extremely
unpleasant
.
to
want
and
not
to
have
,
send
all
up


her
body
a
hardness
,
a
hollowness
,
a
strain
.
and
then
to
want
and
not


to
have
-
to
want
and
want
-
how
that
wring
the
heart
,
and
wring
it
again


and
again
!
oh
,
Mrs.
Ramsay
!
she
call
out
silently
,
to
that
essence


which
sit
by
the
boat
,
that
abstract
one
make
of
she
,
that
woman
in


grey
,
as
if
to
abuse
she
for
having
go
,
and
then
having
go
,
come


back
again
.
it
have
seem
so
safe
,
think
of
she
.
ghost
,
air
,


nothingness
,
a
thing
you
could
play
with
easily
and
safely
at
any
time


of
day
or
night

she
have
be
that
,

then
suddenly
she
put
her
hand


out
and
wring
the
heart
thus
.
suddenly
,
the
empty
drawing
-
room
step
,


the
frill
of
the
chair
inside
,
the
puppy
tumble
on
the
terrace
,
the


whole
wave
and
whisper
of
the
garden
become
like
curve
and
arabesque


flourish
round
a
centre
of
complete
emptiness
.




"
what
do
it
mean
?
how
do
you
explain
it
all
?
"
she
want
to
say
,


turn
to
Mr.
Carmichael
again
.
for
the
whole
world
seem
to
have


dissolve
in
this
early
morning
hour
into
a
pool
of
thought
,
a
deep


basin
of
reality
,
and
one
could
almost
fancy
that
have
Mr.
Carmichael


speak
,
for
instance
,
a
little
tear
would
have
rent
the
surface
pool
.


and
then
?
something
would
emerge
.
a
hand
would
be
shove
up
,
a
blade


would
be
flash
.
it
be
nonsense
of
course
.




a
curious
notion
come
to
she
that
he
do
after
all
hear
the
thing
she


could
not
say
.
he
be
an
inscrutable
old
man
,
with
the
yellow
stain
on


his
beard
,
and
his
poetry
,
and
his
puzzle
,
sail
serenely
through
a


world
which
satisfy
all
his
want
,
so
that
she
think
he
have
only
to


put
down
his
hand
where
he
lie
on
the
lawn
to
fish
up
anything
he


want
.
she
look
at
her
picture
.
that
would
have
be
his
answer
,


presumably
-
how
"
you
"
and
"
I
"
and
'
she
"
pass
and
vanish
;
nothing
stay
;


all
change
;
but
not
word
,
not
paint
.
yet
it
would
be
hang
in
the


attic
,
she
think
;
it
would
be
roll
up
and
fling
under
a
sofa
;
yet


even
so
,
even
of
a
picture
like
that
,
it
be
true
.
one
might
say
,
even


of
this
scrawl
,
not
of
that
actual
picture
,
perhaps
,
but
of
what
it


attempt
,
that
it
"
remain
for
ever
,
"
she
be
go
to
say
,
or
,
for


the
word
speak
sound
even
to
herself
,
too
boastful
,
to
hint
,


wordlessly
;
when
,
look
at
the
picture
,
she
be
surprised
to
find


that
she
could
not
see
it
.
her
eye
be
full
of
a
hot
liquid
 
she
do


not
think
of
tear
at
first
 
which
,
without
disturb
the
firmness
of


her
lip
,
make
the
air
thick
,
roll
down
her
cheek
.
she
have
perfect


control
of
herself
-
oh
,
yes
!
-
in
every
other
way
.
be
she
cry
then


for
Mrs.
Ramsay
,
without
be
aware
of
any
unhappiness
?
she
address


old
Mr.
Carmichael
again
.
what
be
it
then
?
what
do
it
mean
?
could


thing
thrust
their
hand
up
and
grip
one
;
could
the
blade
cut
;
the


fist
grasp
?
be
there
no
safety
?
no
learning
by
heart
of
the
way
of


the
world
?
no
guide
,
no
shelter
,
but
all
be
miracle
,
and
leap
from


the
pinnacle
of
a
tower
into
the
air
?
could
it
be
,
even
for
elderly


people
,
that
this
be
life
?
-
startling
,
unexpected
,
unknown
?
for
one


moment
she
feel
that
if
they
both
get
up
,
here
,
now
on
the
lawn
,
and


demand
an
explanation
,
why
be
it
so
short
,
why
be
it
so


inexplicable
,
say
it
with
violence
,
as
two
fully
equip
human
being


from
whom
nothing

roll


itself
up

the

would
fill
;
those
empty
flourish
would
form
into

they
shout
loud
enough

the

of
the
want

the
bitter
anger
 
to
be
call


back

more
mysteriously

it

some
trick

the
painter

for
day
after

thus
,

unquestioningly
with
her
companion

in
London

the


vision
would
come
to
she
,
and
her
eye
,
half
closing
,
seek
something


to
base
her
vision
on
.
she
look
down
the
railway
carriage
,
the


omnibus
;
take
a
line
from
shoulder
or
cheek
;
look
at
the
window


opposite
;
at
Piccadilly
,
lamp
-
string
in
the
evening
.
all
have
be
part


of
the
field
of
death
.
but
always
something
-
it
might
be
a
face
,
a


voice
,
a
paper
boy

thrust
through

,


wake
she
,
require
and
get
in
the
end
an
effort
of
attention
,
so
that


the
vision
must
be
perpetually
remade
.
now
again
,
move
as
she
be
by


some
instinctive
need
of
distance
and
blue
,
she
look
at
the
bay


beneath
she
,
make
hillock
of
the
blue
bar
of
the
wave
,
and


stony
field
of
the
purpler
space
,
again
she
be
rouse
as
usual
by


something
incongruous
.
there
be
a
brown
spot
in
the
middle
of
the


bay
.
it
be
a
boat
.
yes
,
she
realise
that
after
a
second
.
but
whose


boat
?
Mr.
Ramsay
's
boat
,
she
reply
.
Mr.
Ramsay
;
the
man
who
have


march
past
she
,
with
his
hand
raise
,
aloof
,
at
the
head
of
a


procession
,
in
his
beautiful
boot
,
ask
she
for
sympathy
,
which


she
have
refuse
.
the
boat
be
now
half
way
across
the
bay

so
fine

the
morning

for
a
streak
of
wind
here
and
there
that


the
sea

have
drop
down
into
the
sea
.
a
steamer
far


out
at
sea
have
draw
in
the
air
a
great
scroll
of
smoke
which
stay


there
curve
and
circle
decoratively
,
as
if
the
air
be
a
fine


gauze
which
hold
thing
and
keep
they
softly
in
its
mesh
,
only
gently


sway
they
this
way
and
that
.
and
as
happen
sometimes
when
the


weather
be
very
fine
,
the
cliff
look
as
if
they
be
conscious
of


the
ship
,
and
the
ship
look
as
if
they
be
conscious
of
the


cliff
,
as
if
they
signal
to
each
other
some
message
of
their
own
.


for
sometimes
quite
close
to
the
shore
,
the
Lighthouse
look
this


morning
in
the
haze
an
enormous
distance
away
.




"
where
be
they
now
?
"
lily
think
,
look
out
to
sea
.
where
be
he
,


that
very
old
man
who
have
go
past
her
silently
,
hold
a
brown
paper


parcel
under
his
arm
?
the
boat
be
in
the
middle
of
the
bay
.






9






they
do
n't
 
feel
a
thing
there
,
Cam
think
,
look
at
the
shore
,


which
,
rise
and
fall
,
become
steadily
more
distant
and
more


peaceful
.
her
hand
cut
a
trail
in
the
sea
,
as
her
mind
make
the
green


swirl
and
streak
into
pattern
and
,
numb
and
shroud
,
wander
in


imagination
in
that
underworld
of
water
where
the
pearl
stick
in


cluster
to
white
spray
,
where
in
the
green
light
a
change
come
over


one
's
entire
mind
and
one
's
body
shine
half
transparent
envelop
in
a


green
cloak
.




then
the
eddy
slacken
round
her
hand
.
the
rush
of
the
water
cease
;


the
world
become
full
of
little
creaking
and
squeaking
sound
.
one


hear
the
wave
break
and
flap
against
the
side
of
the
boat
as


if
they
be
anchor
in
harbour
.
everything
become
very
close
to
one
.


for
the
sail
,
upon
which
James
have
his
eye
fix
until
it
have
become


to
he
like
a
person
whom
he
know
,
sag
entirely
;
there
they
come
to


a
stop
,
flap
about
wait
for
a
breeze
,
in
the
hot
sun
,
mile
from


shore
,
mile
from
the
lighthouse
.
everything
in
the
whole
world
seem


to
stand
still
.
the
Lighthouse
become
immovable
,
and
the
line
of
the


distant
shore
become
fix
.
the
sun
grow
hot
and
everybody
seem


to
come
very
close
together
and
to
feel
each
other
's
presence
,
which


they
have
almost
forget
.
Macalister
's
fishing
line
go
plumb
down


into
the
sea
.
but
Mr.
Ramsay
go
on
read
with
his
leg
curl
under


he
.




he
be
read
a
little
shiny
book
with
cover
mottle
like
a
plover
's


egg
.
now
and
again
,
as
they
hang
about
in
that
horrid
calm
,
he
turn


a
page
.
and
James
feel
that
each
page
be
turn
with
a
peculiar


gesture
aim
at
he
;
now
assertively
,
now
commandingly
;
now
with
the


intention
of
make
people
pity
he
;
and
all
the
time
,
as
his
father


read
and
turn
one
after
another
of
those
little
page
,
James
keep


dread
the
moment
when
he
would
look
up
and
speak
sharply
to
he


about
something
or
other
.
why
be
they
lag
about
here
?
he
would


demand
,
or
something
quite
unreasonable
like
that
.
and
if
he
do
,


James
think
,
then
I
shall
take
a
knife
and
strike
he
to
the
heart
.




he
have
always
keep
this
old
symbol
of
take
a
knife
and
strike


his
father
to
the
heart
.
only
now
,
as
he
grow
old
,
and
sit


stare
at
his
father
in
an
impotent
rage
,
it
be
not
he
,
that
old


man
read
,
whom
he
want
to
kill
,
but
it
be
the
thing
that


descend
on
he
-
without
his
know
it
perhaps
:
that
fierce
sudden


black
-
wing
harpy
,
with
its
talon
and
its
beak
all
cold
and
hard
,


that
strike
and
strike
at
you
 
he
could
feel
the
beak
on
his
bare
leg
,


where
it
have
strike
when
he
be
a
child
 
and
then
make
off
,
and
there


he
be
again
,
an
old
man
,
very
sad
,
read
his
book
.
that
he
would


kill
,
that
he
would
strike
to
the
heart
.
whatever
he
do
-
 
and
he


might
do
anything
,
he
feel
,
look
at
the
lighthouse
and
the
distant


shore
 
whether
he
be
in
a
business
,
in
a
bank
,
a
barrister
,
a
man
at


the
head
of
some
enterprise
,
that
he
would
fight
,
that
he
would
track


down
and
stamp
out
-
tyranny
,
despotism
,
he
call
it
-
make
people


do
what
they
do
not
want
to
do
,
cut
off
their
right
to
speak
.
how


could
any
of
they
say
,
but
I
wo
n't
,
when
he
say
,
come
to
the


lighthouse
.
do
this
.
fetch
I
that
.
the
black
wing
spread
,
and
the


hard
beak
tore
.
and
then
next
moment
,
there
he
sit
read
his
book
;


and
he
might
look
up
-
one
never
know
-
quite
reasonably
.
he
might
talk


to
the
Macalisters
.
he
might
be
press
a
sovereign
into
some
frozen


old
woman
's
hand
in
the
street
,
James
think
,
and
he
might
be
shout


out
at
some
fisherman
's
sport
;
he
might
be
wave
his
arm
in
the
air


with
excitement
.
or
he
might
sit
at
the
head
of
the
table
dead
silent


from
one
end
of
dinner
to
the
other
.
yes
,
think
James
,
while
the


boat
slap
and
dawdle
there
in
the
hot
sun
;
there
be
a
waste
of


snow
and
rock
very
lonely
and
austere
;
and
there
he
have
come
to
feel
,


quite
often
lately
,
when
his
father
say
something
or
do
something


which
surprise
the
other
,
there
be
two
pair
of
footprint
only
;


his
own
and
his
father
's
.
they
alone
know
each
other
.
what
then
be


this
terror
,
this
hatred
?
turn
back
among
the
many
leave


which
the
past
have
fold
in
he
,
peer
into
the
heart
of
that


forest
where
light
and
shade
so
chequer
each
other
that
all
shape


be
distort
,
and
one
blunder
,
now
with
the
sun
in
one
's
eye
,


now
with
a
dark
shadow
,
he
seek
an
image
to
cool
and
detach
and
round


off
his
feeling
in
a
concrete
shape
.
suppose
then
that
as
a
child


sit
helpless
in
a
perambulator
,
or
on
some
one
's
knee
,
he
have
see


a
waggon
crush
ignorantly
and
innocently
,
some
one
's
foot
?
suppose
he


have
see
the
foot
first
,
in
the
grass
,
smooth
,
and
whole
;
then
the


wheel
;
and
the
same
foot
,
purple
,
crush
.
but
the
wheel
be
innocent
.


so
now
,
when
his
father
come
stride
down
the
passage
knock
they
up


early
in
the
morning
to
go
to
the
Lighthouse
down
it
come
over
his


foot
,
over
Cam
's
foot
,
over
anybody
's
foot
.
one
sit
and
watch
it
.




but
whose
foot
be
he
think
of
,
and
in
what
garden
do
all
this


happen
?
for
one
have
setting
for
these
scene
;
tree
that
grow
there
;


flower
;
a
certain
light
;
a
few
figure
.
everything
tend
to
set


itself
in
a
garden
where
there
be
none
of
this
gloom
.
none
of
this


throw
of
hand
about
;
people
speak
in
an
ordinary
tone
of
voice
.


they
go
in
and
out
all
day
long
.
there
be
an
old
woman
gossip
in


the
kitchen
;
and
the
blind
be
suck
in
and
out
by
the
breeze
;
all


be
blow
,
all
be
grow
;
and
over
all
those
plate
and
bowl
and


tall
brandish
red
and
yellow
flower
a
very
thin
yellow
veil
would


be
draw
,
like
a
vine
leaf
,
at
night
.
thing
become
still
and
dark


at
night
.
but
the
leaf
-
like
veil
be
so
fine
,
that
light
lift
it
,


voice
crinkle
it
;
he
could
see
through
it
a
figure
stooping
,
hear
,


come
close
,
go
away
,
some
dress
rustle
,
some
chain
tinkle
.




it
be
in
this
world
that
the
wheel
go
over
the
person
's
foot
.


something
,
he
remember
,
stayed
flourish
up
in
the
air
,
something


arid
and
sharp
descended
even
there
,
like
a
blade
,
a
scimitar
,
smite


through
the
leave
and
flower
even
of
that
happy
world
and
make
it


shrivel
and
fall
.




"
it
will
rain
,
"
he
remember
his
father
say
.
"
you
wo
n't
 
be
able
to


go
to
the
lighthouse
.
"




the
Lighthouse
be
then
a
silvery
,
misty
-
look
tower
with
a
yellow


eye
,
that
open
suddenly
,
and
softly
in
the
evening
.
now
-




James
look
at
the
lighthouse
.
he
could
see
the
white
-
wash
rock
;


the
tower
,
stark
and
straight
;
he
could
see
that
it
be
bar
with


black
and
white
;
he
could
see
window
in
it
;
he
could
even
see
washing


spread
on
the
rock
to
dry
.
so
that
be
the
lighthouse
,
be
it
?




no
,
the
other
be
also
the
lighthouse
.
for
nothing
be
simply
one


thing
.
the
other
lighthouse
be
true
too
.
it
be
sometimes
hardly
to


be
see
across
the
bay
.
in
the
evening
one
look
up
and
see
the
eye


open
and
shutting
and
the
light
seem
to
reach
they
in
that
airy


sunny
garden
where
they
sit
.




but
he
pull
himself
up
.
whenever
he
say
"
they
"
or
"
a
person
,
"
and


then
begin
hear
the
rustle
of
some
one
come
,
the
tinkle
of
some


one
go
,
he
become
extremely
sensitive
to
the
presence
of
whoever


might
be
in
the
room
.
it
be
his
father
now
.
the
strain
be
acute
.


for
in
one
moment
if
there
be
no
breeze
,
his
father
would
slap
the


cover
of
his
book
together
,
and
say
:
"
what
be
happen
now
?
what
be


we
dawdle
about
here
for
,
eh
?
"
as
,
once
before
he
have
bring
his


blade
down
among
they
on
the
terrace
and
she
have
go
stiff
all
over
,


and
if
there
have
be
an
axe
handy
,
a
knife
,
or
anything
with
a
sharp


point
he
would
have
seize
it
and
strike
his
father
through
the
heart
.


she
have
go
stiff
all
over
,
and
then
,
her
arm
slacken
,
so
that
he


feel
she
listen
to
he
no
long
,
she
have
rise
somehow
and
go
away


and
leave
he
there
,
impotent
,
ridiculous
,
sit
on
the
floor
grasp


a
pair
of
scissor
.




not
a
breath
of
wind
blow
.
the
water
chuckle
and
gurgle
in
the


bottom
of
the
boat
where
three
or
four
mackerel
beat
their
tail
up
and


down
in
a
pool
of
water
not
deep
enough
to
cover
they
.
at
any
moment


Mr.
Ramsay
 
he
scarcely
dare
look
at
he
 
might
rouse
himself
,
shut
his


book
,
and
say
something
sharp
;
but
for
the
moment
he
be
read
,
so


that
James
stealthily
,
as
if
he
be
steal
downstairs
on
bare
foot
,


afraid
of
wake
a
watchdog
by
a
creaking
board
,
go
on
think
what


be
she
like
,
where
do
she
go
that
day
?
he
begin
follow
she
from


room
to
room
and
at
last
they
come
to
a
room
where
in
a
blue
light
,
as


if
the
reflection
come
from
many
china
dish
,
she
talk
to
somebody
;


he
listen
to
her
talk
.
she
talk
to
a
servant
,
say
simply


whatever
come
into
her
head
.
she
alone
speak
the
truth
;
to
her
alone


could
he
speak
it
.
that
be
the
source
of
her
everlasting
attraction


for
he
,
perhaps
;
she
be
a
person
to
whom
one
could
say
what
come
into


one
's
head
.
but
all
the
time
he
think
of
she
,
he
be
conscious
of


his
father
follow
his
thought
,
survey
it
,
make
it
shiver
and


falter
.
at
last
he
cease
to
think
.




there
he
sit
with
his
hand
on
the
tiller
in
the
sun
,
stare
at
the


lighthouse
,
powerless
to
move
,
powerless
to
flick
off
these
grain
of


misery
which
settle
on
his
mind
one
after
another
.
a
rope
seem
to


bind
he
there
,
and
his
father
have
knot
it
and
he
could
only
escape


by
take
a
knife
and
plunge
it
...
but
at
that
moment
the
sail


swing
slowly
round
,
fill
slowly
out
,
the
boat
seem
to
shake


herself
,
and
then
to
move
off
half
conscious
in
her
sleep
,
and
then
she


wake
and
shoot
through
the
wave
.
the
relief
be
extraordinary
.
they


all
seem
to
fall
away
from
each
other
again
and
to
be
at
their


ease
,
and
the
fishing
-
line
slant
taut
across
the
side
of
the


boat
.
but
his
father
do
not
rouse
himself
.
he
only
raise
his
right


hand
mysteriously
high
in
the
air
,
and
let
it
fall
upon
his
knee
again


as
if
he
be
conduct
some
secret
symphony
.






10






 
the
sea
without
a
stain
on
it
,
think
Lily
Briscoe
,
still
stand


and
look
out
over
the
bay
.
the
sea
stretch
like
silk
across
the


bay
.
distance
have
an
extraordinary
power
;
they
have
be
swallow
up


in
it
,
she
feel
,
they
be
go
for
ever
,
they
have
become
part
of
the


nature
of
thing
.
it
be
so
calm
;
it
be
so
quiet
.
the
steamer
itself


have
vanish
,
but
the
great
scroll
of
smoke
still
hang
in
the
air
and


droop
like
a
flag
mournfully
in
valediction
.






11






it
be
like
that
then
,
the
island
,
think
Cam
,
once
more
draw
she


finger
through
the
wave
.
she
have
never
see
it
from
out
at
sea


before
.
it
lie
like
that
on
the
sea
,
do
it
,
with
a
dent
in
the
middle


and
two
sharp
crag
,
and
the
sea
sweep
in
there
,
and
spread
away
for


mile
and
mile
on
either
side
of
the
island
.
it
be
very
small
;


shape
something
like
a
leaf
stand
on
end
.
so
we
take
a
little
boat
,


she
think
,
begin
to
tell
herself
a
story
of
adventure
about


escape
from
a
sink
ship
.
but
with
the
sea
stream
through
she


finger
,
a
spray
of
seaweed
vanish
behind
they
,
she
do
not
want
to


tell
herself
seriously
a
story
;
it
be
the
sense
of
adventure
and


escape
that
she
want
,
for
she
be
think
,
as
the
boat
sail
on
,


how
her
father
's
anger
about
the
point
of
the
compass
,
James
's


obstinacy
about
the
compact
,
and
her
own
anguish
,
all
have
slip
,
all


have
pass
,
all
have
stream
away
.
what
then
come
next
?
where
be


they
go
?
from
her
hand
,
ice
cold
,
hold
deep
in
the
sea
,
there


spurt
up
a
fountain
of
joy
at
the
change
,
at
the
escape
,
at
the


adventure
 
that
she
should
be
alive
,
that
she
should
be
there
.
and


the
drop
fall
from
this
sudden
and
unthinking
fountain
of
joy
fall


here
and
there
on
the
dark
,
the
slumbrous
shape
in
her
mind
;
shape
of


a
world
not
realise
but
turn
in
their
darkness
,
catch
here
and


there
,
a
spark
of
light
;
Greece
,
Rome
,
Constantinople
.
small
as
it


be
,
and
shape
something
like
a
leaf
stand
on
its
end
with
the
gold-


sprinkle
water
flow
in
and
about
it
,
it
have
,
she
suppose
,
a
place


in
the
universe
-
even
that
little
island
?
the
old
gentleman
in
the


study
she
think
could
have
tell
she
.
sometimes
she
stray
in
from


the
garden
purposely
to
catch
they
at
it
.
there
they
be
 
it
might
be


Mr.
Carmichael
or
Mr.
Bankes
who
be
sit
with
her
father
 
sit


opposite
each
other
in
their
low
arm
-
chair
.
they
be
crackle
in


front
of
they
the
page
of
the
TIMES
,
when
she
come
in
from
the
garden
,


all
in
a
muddle
,
about
something
some
one
have
say
about
Christ
,
or


hear
that
a
mammoth
have
be
dig
up
in
a
London
street
,
or
wonder


what
Napoleon
be
like
.
then
they
take
all
this
with
their
clean
hand


 
they
wear
grey
-
colour
clothe
;
they
smell
of
heath
 
and
they


brush
the
scrap
together
,
turn
the
paper
,
cross
their
knee
,


and
say
something
now
and
then
very
brief
.
just
to
please
herself
she


would
take
a
book
from
the
shelf
and
stand
there
,
watch
her
father


write
,
so
equally
,
so
neatly
from
one
side
of
the
page
to
another
,
with


a
little
cough
now
and
then
,
or
something
say
briefly
to
the
other
old


gentleman
opposite
.
and
she
think
,
stand
there
with
her
book
open
,


one
could
let
whatever
one
think
expand
here
like
a
leaf
in
water
;


and
if
it
do
well
here
,
among
the
old
gentleman
smoke
and
the
TIMES


crackle
then
it
be
right
.
and
watch
her
father
as
he
write
in


his
study
,
she
think
 
now
sit
in
the
boat
 
he
be
not
vain
,
nor
a


tyrant
and
do
not
wish
to
make
you
pity
he
.
indeed
,
if
he
see
she


be
there
,
read
a
book
,
he
would
ask
she
,
as
gently
as
any
one


could
,
be
there
nothing
he
could
give
she
?




lest
this
should
be
wrong
,
she
look
at
he
read
the
little
book


with
the
shiny
cover
mottle
like
a
plover
's
egg
.
no
;
it
be
right
.


look
at
he
now
,
she
want
to
say
aloud
to
James
.
 
but
James
have
his


eye
on
the
sail
.
 
he
be
a
sarcastic
brute
,
James
would
say
.
he
bring


the
talk
round
to
himself
and
his
book
,
James
would
say
.
he
be


intolerably
egotistical
.
bad
of
all
,
he
be
a
tyrant
.
but
look
!
she


say
,
look
at
he
.
look
at
he
now
.
she
look
at
he
read
the


little
book
with
his
leg
curl
;
the
little
book
whose
yellowish
page


she
know
,
without
know
what
be
write
on
they
.
it
be
small
;
it


be
closely
print
;
on
the
fly
-
leaf
,
she
know
,
he
have
write
that
he


have
spend
fifteen
franc
on
dinner
;
the
wine
have
be
so
much
;
he
have


give
so
much
to
the
waiter
;
all
be
add
up
neatly
at
the
bottom
of


the
page
.
but
what
might
be
write
in
the
book
which
have
round
its


edge
off
in
his
pocket
,
she
do
not
know
.
what
he
think
they
none


of
they
know
.
but
he
be
absorb
in
it
,
so
that
when
he
look
up
,
as


he
do
now
for
an
instant
,
it
be
not
to
see
anything
;
it
be
to
pin


down
some
thought
more
exactly
.
that
do
,
his
mind
fly
back
again


and
he
plunge
into
his
reading
.
he
read
,
she
think
,
as
if
he
be


guide
something
,
or
wheedle
a
large
flock
of
sheep
,
or
push
his


way
up
and
up
a
single
narrow
path
;
and
sometimes
he
go
fast
and


straight
,
and
break
his
way
through
the
bramble
,
and
sometimes
it


seem
a
branch
strike
at
he
,
a
bramble
blind
he
,
but
he
be
not


go
to
let
himself
be
beat
by
that
;
on
he
go
,
toss
over
page


after
page
.
and
she
go
on
tell
herself
a
story
about
escape


from
a
sink
ship
,
for
she
be
safe
,
while
he
sit
there
;
safe
,
as
she


feel
herself
when
she
creep
in
from
the
garden
,
and
take
a
book


down
,
and
the
old
gentleman
,
lower
the
paper
suddenly
,
say


something
very
brief
over
the
top
of
it
about
the
character
of
Napoleon
.




she
gaze
back
over
the
sea
,
at
the
island
.
but
the
leaf
be
lose


its
sharpness
.
it
be
very
small
;
it
be
very
distant
.
the
sea
be


more
important
now
than
the
shore
.
wave
be
all
round
they
,
toss


and
sink
,
with
a
log
wallow
down
one
wave
;
a
gull
ride
on


another
.
about
here
,
she
think
,
dabble
her
finger
in
the
water
,
a


ship
have
sink
,
and
she
murmur
,
dreamily
half
asleep
,
how
we
perish
,


each
alone
.






12






so
much
depend
then
,
think
Lily
Briscoe
,
look
at
the
sea
which


have
scarcely
a
stain
on
it
,
which
be
so
soft
that
the
sail
and
the


cloud
seem
set
in
its
blue
,
so
much
depend
,
she
think
,
upon


distance
:
whether
people
be
near
we
or
far
from
we
;
for
her
feeling


for
Mr.
Ramsay
change
as
he
sail
far
and
far
across
the
bay
.


it
seem
to
be
elongate
,
stretch
out
;
he
seem
to
become
more
and


more
remote
.
he
and
his
child
seem
to
be
swallow
up
in
that


blue
,
that
distance
;
but
here
,
on
the
lawn
,
close
at
hand
,
Mr.


Carmichael
suddenly
grunt
.
she
laugh
.
he
claw
his
book
up
from


the
grass
.
he
settle
into
his
chair
again
puff
and
blow
like


some
sea
monster
.
that
be
different
altogether
,
because
he
be
so


near
.
and
now
again
all
be
quiet
.
they
must
be
out
of
bed
by
this


time
,
she
suppose
,
look
at
the
house
,
but
nothing
appear
there
.


but
then
,
she
remember
,
they
have
always
make
off
directly
a
meal
be


over
,
on
business
of
their
own
.
it
be
all
in
keep
with
this


silence
,
this
emptiness
,
and
the
unreality
of
the
early
morning
hour
.


it
be
a
way
thing
have
sometimes
,
she
think
,
linger
for
a
moment


and
look
at
the
long
glitter
window
and
the
plume
of
blue
smoke
:


they
become
illness
,
before
habit
have
spin
themselves
across
the


surface
,
one
feel
that
same
unreality
,
which
be
so
startling
;
feel


something
emerge
.
life
be
most
vivid
then
.
one
could
be
at
one
's


ease
.
mercifully
one
need
not
say
,
very
briskly
,
cross
the
lawn
to


greet
old
Mrs.
Beckwith
,
who
would
be
come
out
to
find
a
corner
to
sit


in
,
"
oh
,
good
-
morning
,
Mrs.
Beckwith
!
what
a
lovely
day
!
be
you
go


to
be
so
bold
as
to
sit
in
the
sun
?
Jasper
's
hide
the
chair
.
do


let
I
find
you
one
!
"
and
all
the
rest
of
the
usual
chatter
.
one
need


not
speak
at
all
.
one
glide
,
one
shake
one
's
sail
 
there
be
a
good


deal
of
movement
in
the
bay
,
boat
be
start
off
 
between
thing
,


beyond
thing
.
empty
it
be
not
,
but
full
to
the
brim
.
she
seem
to


be
stand
up
to
the
lip
in
some
substance
,
to
move
and
float
and


sink
in
it
,
yes
,
for
these
water
be
unfathomably
deep
.
into
they


have
spill
so
many
life
.
the
Ramsays
'
;
the
child
's
;
and
all
sort


of
waif
and
stray
of
thing
besides
.
a
washer
-
woman
with
her
basket
;


a
rook
,
a
red
-
hot
poker
;
the
purple
and
grey
-
green
of
flower
:
some


common
feeling
which
hold
the
whole
together
.




it
be
some
such
feeling
of
completeness
perhaps
which
,
ten
year
ago
,


stand
almost
where
she
stand
now
,
have
make
she
say
that
she
must
be


in
love
with
the
place
.
love
have
a
thousand
shape
.
there
might
be


lover
whose
gift
it
be
to
choose
out
the
element
of
thing
and
place


they
together
and
so
,
give
they
a
wholeness
not
theirs
in
life
,
make


of
some
scene
,
or
meeting
of
people
 
all
now
go
and
separate
,
one
of


those
globe
compact
thing
over
which
think
linger
,
and
love


play
.




her
eye
rest
on
the
brown
speck
of
Mr.
Ramsay
's
sailing
boat
.
they


would
be
at
the
lighthouse
by
lunch
time
she
suppose
.
but
the
wind


have
freshen
,
and
,
as
the
sky
change
slightly
and
the
sea
change


slightly
and
the
boat
alter
their
position
,
the
view
,
which
a


moment
before
have
seem
miraculously
fix
,
be
now
unsatisfactory
.


the
wind
have
blow
the
trail
of
smoke
about
;
there
be
something


displease
about
the
placing
of
the
ship
.




the
disproportion
there
seem
to
upset
some
harmony
in
her
own
mind
.


she
feel
an
obscure
distress
.
it
be
confirm
when
she
turn
to
she


picture
.
she
have
be
waste
her
morning
.
for
whatever
reason
she


could
not
achieve
that
razor
edge
of
balance
between
two
opposite


force
;
Mr.
Ramsay
and
the
picture
;
which
be
necessary
.
there
be


something
perhaps
wrong
with
the
design
?
be
it
,
she
wonder
,
that


the
line
of
the
wall
want
breaking
,
be
it
that
the
mass
of
the
tree


be
too
heavy
?
she
smile
ironically
;
for
have
she
not
think
,
when


she
begin
,
that
she
have
solve
her
problem
?




what
be
the
problem
then
?
she
must
try
to
get
hold
of
something
tht


evade
she
.
it
evade
she
when
she
think
of
Mrs.
Ramsay
;
it
evade


she
now
when
she
think
of
her
picture
.
phrase
come
.
vision
come
.


beautiful
picture
.
beautiful
phrase
.
but
what
she
wish
to
get
hold


of
be
that
very
jar
on
the
nerve
,
the
thing
itself
before
it
have
be


make
anything
.
get
that
and
start
afresh
;
get
that
and
start
afresh
;


she
say
desperately
,
pitch
herself
firmly
again
before
her
easel
.


it
be
a
miserable
machine
,
an
inefficient
machine
,
she
think
,
the


human
apparatus
for
painting
or
for
feeling
;
it
always
break
down
at


the
critical
moment
;
heroically
,
one
must
force
it
on
.
she
stare
,


frowning
.
there
be
the
hedge
,
sure
enough
.
but
one
get
nothing
by


solicit
urgently
.
one
get
only
a
glare
in
the
eye
from
look
at


the
line
of
the
wall
,
or
from
think
-
she
wear
a
grey
hat
.
she
be


astonishingly
beautiful
.
let
it
come
,
she
think
,
if
it
will
come
.


for
there
be
moment
when
one
can
neither
think
nor
feel
.
and
if


one
can
neither
think
nor
feel
,
she
think
,
where
be
one
?




here
on
the
grass
,
on
the
ground
,
she
think
,
sit
down
,
and


examine
with
her
brush
a
little
colony
of
plantain
.
for
the
lawn


be
very
rough
.
here
sit
on
the
world
,
she
think
,
for
she
could


not
shake
herself
free
from
the
sense
that
everything
this
morning
be


happen
for
the
first
time
,
perhaps
for
the
last
time
,
as
a


traveller
,
even
though
he
be
half
asleep
,
know
,
look
out
of
the


train
window
,
that
he
must
look
now
,
for
he
will
never
see
that
town
,


or
that
mule
-
cart
,
or
that
woman
at
work
in
the
field
,
again
.
the


lawn
be
the
world
;
they
be
up
here
together
,
on
this
exalt


station
,
she
think
,
look
at
old
Mr.
Carmichael
,
who
seem
 
though


they
have
not
say
a
word
all
this
time
 
to
share
her
thought
.
and
she


would
never
see
he
again
perhaps
.
he
be
grow
old
.
also
,
she


remember
,
smile
at
the
slipper
that
dangle
from
his
foot
,
he
be


grow
famous
.
People
say
that
his
poetry
be
'
so
beautiful
.
"
they


go
and
publish
thing
he
have
write
forty
year
ago
.
there
be
a


famous
man
now
call
Carmichael
,
she
smile
,
think
how
many
shape


one
person
might
wear
,
how
he
be
that
in
the
newspaper
,
but
here
the


same
as
he
have
always
be
.
he
look
the
same
-
greyer
,
rather
.


yes
,
he
look
the
same
,
but
somebody
have
say
,
she
recall
,
that
when


he
have
hear
of
Andrew
Ramsay
's
death
 
he
be
kill
in
a
second
by
a


shell
;
he
should
have
be
a
great
mathematician
 
Mr.
Carmichael
have


"
lose
all
interest
in
life
.
"
what
do
it
mean
-
that
?
she
wonder
.
have


he
march
through
Trafalgar
Square
grasp
a
big
stick
?
have
he


turn
page
over
and
over
,
without
read
they
,
sit
in
his
room


in
St.
John
's
Wood
alone
?
she
do
not
know
what
he
have
do
,
when
he


hear
that
Andrew
be
kill
,
but
she
feel
it
in
he
all
the
same
.


they
only
mumble
at
each
other
on
staircase
;
they
look
up
at
the


sky
and
say
it
will
be
fine
or
it
wo
n't
 
be
fine
.
but
this
be
one
way


of
know
people
,
she
think
:
to
know
the
outline
,
not
the
detail
,
to


sit
in
one
's
garden
and
look
at
the
slope
of
a
hill
run
purple


down
into
the
distant
heather
.
she
know
he
in
that
way
.
she
know


that
he
have
change
somehow
.
she
have
never
read
a
line
of
his
poetry
.


she
think
that
she
know
how
it
go
though
,
slowly
and
sonorously
.


it
be
season
and
mellow
.
it
be
about
the
desert
and
the
camel
.
it


be
about
the
palm
tree
and
the
sunset
.
it
be
extremely
impersonal
;


it
say
something
about
death
;
it
say
very
little
about
love
.
there


be
an
impersonality
about
he
.
he
want
very
little
of
other
people
.


have
he
not
always
lurch
rather
awkwardly
past
the
drawing
-
room
window


with
some
newspaper
under
his
arm
,
try
to
avoid
Mrs.
Ramsay
whom
for


some
reason
he
do
not
much
like
?
on
that
account
,
of
course
,
she


would
always
try
to
make
he
stop
.
he
would
bow
to
she
.
he
would
halt


unwillingly
and
bow
profoundly
.
annoy
that
he
do
not
want
anything


of
she
,
Mrs.
Ramsay
would
ask
he
 
Lily
could
hear
she
 
would
n't
 
he
like


a
coat
,
a
rug
,
a
newspaper
?
no
,
he
want
nothing
.
 
here
he
bow
.


there
be
some
quality
in
she
which
he
do
not
much
like
.
it
be


perhaps
her
masterfulness
,
her
positiveness
,
something
matter
-
of
-
fact


in
she
.
she
be
so
direct
.




 
a
noise
draw
her
attention
to
the
drawing
-
room
window
-
the
squeak
of
a


hinge
.
the
light
breeze
be
toy
with
the
window
.




there
must
have
be
people
who
dislike
she
very
much
,
Lily
think


 
yes
;
she
realise
that
the
drawing
-
room
step
be
empty
,
but
it
have
no


effect
on
she
whatever
.
she
do
not
want
Mrs.
Ramsay
now
.
 
-
People
who


think
she
too
sure
,
too
drastic
.




also
,
her
beauty
offend
people
probably
.
how
monotonous
,
they
would


say
,
and
the
same
always
!
they
prefer
another
type
-
the
dark
,
the


vivacious
.
then
she
be
weak
with
her
husband
.
she
let
he
make
those


scene
.
then
she
be
reserve
.
nobody
know
exactly
what
have
happen


to
she
.
and
 
to
go
back
to
Mr.
Carmichael
and
his
dislike
 
one
could
not


imagine
Mrs.
Ramsay
stand
painting
,
lie
reading
,
a
whole
morning
on


the
lawn
.
it
be
unthinkable
.
without
say
a
word
,
the
only
token
of


her
errand
a
basket
on
her
arm
,
she
go
off
to
the
town
,
to
the
poor
,


to
sit
in
some
stuffy
little
bedroom
.
often
and
often
Lily
have
see


her
go
silently
in
the
midst
of
some
game
,
some
discussion
,
with
she


basket
on
her
arm
,
very
upright
.
she
have
note
her
return
.
she
have


think
,
half
laugh
 
she
be
so
methodical
with
the
tea
cup
,
half


move
 
her
beauty
take
one
's
breath
away
,
eye
that
be
close
in


pain
have
look
on
you
.
you
have
be
with
they
there
.




and
then
Mrs.
Ramsay
would
be
annoy
because
somebody
be
late
,
or
the


butter
not
fresh
,
or
the
teapot
chip
.
and
all
the
time
she
be


say
that
the
butter
be
not
fresh
one
would
be
think
of
Greek


temple
,
and
how
beauty
have
be
with
they
there
in
that
stuffy
little


room
.
she
never
talk
of
it
-
she
go
,
punctually
,
directly
.
it
be


her
instinct
to
go
,
an
instinct
like
the
swallow
for
the
south
,
the


artichoke
for
the
sun
,
turn
she
infallibly
to
the
human
race
,


make
her
nest
in
its
heart
.
and
this
,
like
all
instinct
,
be
a


little
distressing
to
people
who
do
not
share
it

notion

in
both

about


the
ineffectiveness
of
action
,
the
supremacy
of

go
be


a
reproach
to
they
,
give
a
different
twist
to
the
world
,
so
that
they

lead
to
protest
,
see
their
own
prepossession
disappear
,
and


clutch
at
they

.
Charles
Tansley
do
that
too

the

,
shiny

,
rather
like
Charles

.


she
have
look
at
he
ironically
from
her
seat
in
the
half
-
empty
hall
,


pump
love
into
that
chilly
space
,
and
suddenly
,
there
be
the
old


cask
or
whatever
it
be
bob
up
and
down
among
the
wave
and
Mrs.


ramsay
look
for
her
spectacle
case
among
the
pebble
.
"
oh
,

!


what
a
nuisance
!
lose
again
.
do
n't
 
bother
,
Mr.

.
I
lose


thousand
every
summer
,
"
at
which
he
press
his
chin
back
against
his


collar
,
as
if
afraid
to
sanction
such
exaggeration
,
but
could
stand
it


in
she
whom
he
like
,
and
smile
very
charmingly
.
he
must
have


confide
in
she
on
one
of
those
long
expedition
when
people
get


separate
and

back
alone
.
he
be
educate
his
little
sister
,


Mrs.
Ramsay
have
tell
she
.
it
be
immensely
to
his
credit
.
her
own
idea


of
he
be
grotesque
,
Lily
know
well
,
stir
the
plantain
with
she


brush
.
half
one
's
notion
of
other
people
be
,
after
all
,
grotesque
.


they
serve
private
purpose
of
one
's
own
.
he
do
for
she
instead
of
a


whipping
-
boy
.
she
find
herself
flagellate
his
lean
flank
when
she


be
out
of
temper
.
if
she

to
be
serious
about
he
she

to


help
herself
to
Mrs.

's
saying
,
to
look
at

through
her
eye
.




she
raise
a
little
mountain
for
the
ant
to
climb
over
.
she
reduce


they
to
a
frenzy
of
indecision
by
this
interference
in
their
cosmogony
.


some
run
this
way
,
other
that
.




one
want
fifty
pair
of
eye
to
see
with
,
she
reflect
.
fifty
pair


of
eye
be
not
enough
to
get
round
that
one
woman
with
,
she
think
.


among
they
,
must
be
one
that
be
stone
blind
to
her
beauty
.
one
want


most
some
secret
sense
,
fine
as
air
,
with
which
to
steal
through


keyhole
and
surround
she
where
she
sit
knit
,
talk
,
sit


silent
in
the
window
alone
;
which
take
to
itself
and
treasure
up
like


the
air
which
hold
the
smoke
of
the
steamer
,
her
thought
,
she


imagination
,
her
desire
.
what
do
the
hedge
mean
to
she
,
what
do


the
garden
mean
to
she
,
what
do
it
mean
to
she
when
a
wave
break
?


 
Lily
look
up
,
as
she
have
see
Mrs.
Ramsay
look
up
;
she
too
hear
a


wave
fall
on
the
beach
.
 
and
then
what
stir
and
tremble
in
she


mind
when
the
child
cry
,
"
how
be
that
?
how
be
that
?
"
cricket
?


she
would
stop
knit
for
a
second
.
she
would
look
intent
.
then
she


would
lapse
again
,
and
suddenly
Mr.
Ramsay
stop
dead
in
his
pacing
in


front
of
she
and
some
curious
shock
pass
through
she
and
seem
to


rock
she
in
profound
agitation
on
its
breast
when
stop
there
he


stand
over
she
and
look
down
at
she
.
lily
could
see
he
.




he
stretch
out
his
hand
and
raise
she
from
her
chair
.
it
seem


somehow
as
if
he
have
do
it
before
;
as
if
he
have
once
bent
in
the
same


way
and
raise
she
from
a
boat
which
,
lie
a
few
inch
off
some


island
,
have
require
that
the
lady
should
thus
be
help
on
shore
by


the
gentleman
.
an
old
-
fashioned
scene
that
be
,
which
require
,


very
nearly
,
crinoline
and
peg
-
top
trouser
.
let
herself
be


help
by
he
,
Mrs.
Ramsay
have
think
 
Lily
suppose
 
the
time


have
come
now
.
yes
,
she
would
say
it
now
.
yes
,
she
would
marry
he
.


and
she
step
slowly
,
quietly
on
shore
.
probably
she
say
one


word
only
,
let
her
hand
rest
still
in
his
.
I
will
marry
you
,


she
might
have
say
,
with
her
hand
in
his
;
but
no
more
.
time


after
time
the
same
thrill
have
pass
between
they
-
obviously
it


have
,
Lily
think
,
smooth
a
way
for
her
ant
.
she
be
not


invent
;
she
be
only
try
to
smooth
out
something
she
have
be


give
year
ago
fold
up
;
something
she
have
see
.
for
in
the
rough


and
tumble
of
daily
life
,
with
all
those
child
about
,
all
those


visitor
,
one
have
constantly
a
sense
of
repetition
-
of
one
thing


fall
where
another
have
fall
,
and
so
set
up
an
echo
which


chime
in
the
air
and
make
it
full
of
vibration
.




but
it
would
be
a
mistake
,
she
think
,
think
how
they
walk
off


together
,
arm
in
arm
,
past
the
greenhouse
,
to
simplify
their


relationship
.
it
be
no
monotony
of
bliss
-
she
with
her
impulse
and


quickness
;
he
with
his
shudder
and
gloom
.
oh
,
no
.
the
bedroom
door


would
slam
violently
early
in
the
morning
.
he
would
start
from
the


table
in
a
temper
.
he
would
whizz
his
plate
through
the
window
.
then


all
through
the
house
there
would
be
a
sense
of
door
slamming
and


blind
flutter
,
as
if
a
gusty
wind
be
blow
and
people
scud


about
try
in
a
hasty
way
to
fasten
hatch
and
make
thing
ship-


shape
.
she
have
meet
Paul
Rayley
like
that
one
day
on
the
stair
.


they
have
laugh
and
laugh
,
like
a
couple
of
child
,
all
because


Mr.
Ramsay
,
find
an
earwig
in
his
milk
at
breakfast
have
send
the


whole
thing
fly
through
the
air
on
to
the
terrace
outside
.
'
an
earwig
,


prue
murmur
,
awestruck
,
'
in
his
milk
.
'
other
people
might
find


centipede
.
but
he
have
build
round
he
such
a
fence
of
sanctity
,
and


occupy
the
space
with
such
a
demeanour
of
majesty
that
an
earwig


in
his
milk
be
a
monster
.




but
it
tire
Mrs.
Ramsay
,
it
cow
she
a
little
-
the
plate
whiz


and
the
door
slamming
.
and
there
would
fall
between
they
sometimes


long
rigid
silence
,
when
,
in
a
state
of
mind
which
annoy
Lily


in
she
,
half
plaintive
,
half
resentful
,
she
seem
unable
to
surmount


the
temp
calmly
,
or
to
laugh
as
they
laugh
,
but
in
her
weariness


perhaps
conceal
something
.
she
brood
and
sit
silent
.
after
a


time
he
would
hang
stealthily
about
the
place
where
she
be
-
roam


under
the
window
where
she
sat
write
letter
or
talk
,
for
she


would
take
care
to
be
busy
when
he
pass
,
and
evade
he
,
and
pretend


not
to
see
he
.
then
he
would
turn
smooth
as
silk
,
affable
,
urbane
,


and
try
to
win
she
so
.
still
she
would
hold
off
,
and
now
she
would


assert
for
a
brief
season
some
of
those
pride
and
air
the
due


of
her
beauty
which
she
be
generally
utterly
without
;
would
turn


her
head
;
would
look
so
,
over
her
shoulder
,
always
with
some


Minta
,
Paul
,
or
William
Bankes
at
her
side
.
at
length
,
stand


outside
the
group
the
very
figure
of
a
famished
wolfhound
 
Lily
get
up


off
the
grass
and
stand
look
at
the
step
,
at
the
window
,
where
she


have
see
he
,
he
would
say
her
name
,
once
only
,
for
all
the
world
like


a
wolf
bark
in
the
snow
,
but
still
she
hold
back
;
and
he
would
say


it
once
more
,
and
this
time
something
in
the
tone
would
rouse
she
,
and


she
would
go
to
he
,
leave
they
all
of
a
sudden
,
and
they
would
walk


off
together
among
the
pear
tree
,
the
cabbage
,
and
the
raspberry


bed
.
they
would
have
it
out
together
.
but
with
what
attitude
and


with
what
word
?
such
a
dignity
be
theirs
in
this
relationship
that
,


turn
away
,
she
and
Paul
and
Minta
would
hide
their
curiosity
and


their
discomfort
,
and
begin
pick
flower
,
throw
ball
,


chatter
,
until
it
be
time
for
dinner
,
and
there
they
be
,
he
at


one
end
of
the
table
,
she
at
the
other
,
as
usual
.




"
why
do
n't
 
some
of
you
take
up
botany
?
..
with
all
those
leg
and
arm


why
do
n't
 
one
of
you
...
?
"
so
they
would
talk
as
usual
,
laugh
,


among
the
child
.
all
would
be
as
usual
,
save
only
for
some
quiver
,


as
of
a
blade
in
the
air
,
which
come
and
go
between
they
as
if


the
usual
sight
of
the
child
sit
round
their
soup
plate


have
freshen
itself
in
their
eye
after
that
hour
among
the
pear
and


the
cabbage
.
especially
,
Lily
think
,
Mrs.
Ramsay
would
glance
at


prue
.
she
sit
in
the
middle
between
brother
and
sister
,
always


occupy
,
it
seem
,
see
that
nothing
go
wrong
so
that
she


scarcely
speak
herself
.
how
Prue
must
have
blame
herself
for
that


earwig
in
the
milk
how
white
she
have
go
when
Mr.
Ramsay
throw
his


plate
through
the
window
!
how
she
droop
under
those
long
silence


between
they
!
anyhow
,
her
mother
now
would
seem
to
be
make
it
up
to


she
;
assure
she
that
everything
be
well
;
promise
she
that
one
of


these
day
that
same
happiness
would
be
her
.
she
have
enjoy
it
for


less
than
a
year
,
however
.




she
have
let
the
flower
fall
from
her
basket
,
Lily
think
,
screw
up


her
eye
and
stand
back
as
if
to
look
at
her
picture
,
which
she
be


not
touch
,
however
,
with
all
her
faculty
in
a
trance
,
freeze
over


superficially
but
move
underneath
with
extreme
speed
.




she
let
her
flower
fall
from
her
basket
,
scatter
and
tumble
they
on


to
the
grass
and
,
reluctantly
and
hesitatingly
,
but
without
question
or


complaint
-
have
she
not
the
faculty
of
obedience
to
perfection
?
-
go


too
.
down
field
,
across
valley
,
white
,
flower
-
strew
-
that
be


how
she
would
have
paint
it
.
the
hill
be
austere
.
it
be
rocky
;


it
be
steep
.
the
wave
sound
hoarse
on
the
stone
beneath
.
they


go
,
the
three
of
they
together
,
Mrs.
Ramsay
walk
rather
fast
in


front
,
as
if
she
expect
to
meet
some
one
round
the
corner
.




suddenly
the
window
at
which
she
be
look
be
whiten
by
some
light


stuff
behind
it
.
at
last
then
somebody
have
come
into
the
drawing
-
room
;


somebody
be
sit
in
the
chair
.
for
Heaven
's
sake
,
she
pray
,
let


they
sit
still
there
and
not
come
flounder
out
to
talk
to
she
.


mercifully
,
whoever
it
be
stay
still
inside
;
have
settle
by
some


stroke
of
luck
so
as
to
throw
an
odd
-
shape
triangular
shadow
over
the


step
.
it
alter
the
composition
of
the
picture
a
little
.
it
be


interesting
.
it
might
be
useful
.
her
mood
be
come
back
to
she
.
one


must
keep
on
look
without
for
a
second
relax
the
intensity
of


emotion
,
the
determination
not
to
be
put
off
,
not
to
be
bamboozle
.


one
must
hold
the
scene
-
so
-
in
a
vise
and
let
nothing
come
in
and


spoil
it
.
one
want
,
she
think
,
dip
her
brush
deliberately
,
to


be
on
a
level
with
ordinary
experience
,
to
feel
simply
that
be
a
chair
,


that
be
a
table
,
and
yet
at
the
same
time
,
it
be
a
miracle
,
it
be
an


ecstasy
.
the
problem
might
be
solve
after
all
.
ah
,
but
what
have


happen
?
some
wave
of
white
go
over
the
window
pane
.
the
air
must


have
stir
some
flounce
in
the
room
.
her
heart
leap
at
she
and


seize
she
and
torture
she
.




"
Mrs.
Ramsay
!
Mrs.
Ramsay
!
"
she
cry
,
feel
the
old
horror
come


back
-
to
want
and
want
and
not
to
have
.
could
she
inflict
that
still
?


and
then
,
quietly
,
as
if
she
refrain
,
that
too
become
part
of


ordinary
experience
,
be
on
a
level
with
the
chair
,
with
the
table
.


Mrs.
Ramsay
-
it
be
part
of
her
perfect
goodness
-
sit
there
quite


simply
,
in
the
chair
,
flick
her
needle
to
and
fro
,
knit
she


reddish
-
brown
stocking
,
cast
her
shadow
on
the
step
.
there
she
sit
.




and
as
if
she
have
something
she
must
share
,
yet
could
hardly
leave
she


easel
,
so
full
her
mind
be
of
what
she
be
think
,
of
what
she
be


see
,
Lily
go
past
Mr.
Carmichael
hold
her
brush
to
the
edge
of


the
lawn
.
where
be
that
boat
now
?
and
Mr.
Ramsay
?
she
want
he
.






13






Mr.
Ramsay
have
almost
do
reading
.
one
hand
hover
over
the
page
as


if
to
be
in
readiness
to
turn
it
the
very
instant
he
have
finish
it
.


he
sit
there
bareheade
with
the
wind
blow
his
hair
about
,


extraordinarily
expose
to
everything
.
he
look
very
old
.
he
look
,


James
think
,
get
his
head
now
against
the
lighthouse
,
now
against


the
waste
of
water
run
away
into
the
open
,
like
some
old
stone


lie
on
the
sand
;
he
look
as
if
he
have
become
physically
what
be


always
at
the
back
of
both
of
their
mind
-
that
loneliness
which
be


for
both
of
they
the
truth
about
thing
.




he
be
read
very
quickly
,
as
if
he
be
eager
to
get
to
the
end
.


indeed
they
be
very
close
to
the
Lighthouse
now
.
there
it
loom
up
,


stark
and
straight
,
glare
white
and
black
,
and
one
could
see
the


wave
break
in
white
splinter
like
smash
glass
upon
the
rock
.


one
could
see
line
and
crease
in
the
rock
.
one
could
see
the


window
clearly
;
a
dab
of
white
on
one
of
they
,
and
a
little
tuft
of


green
on
the
rock
.
a
man
have
come
out
and
look
at
they
through
a


glass
and
go
in
again
.
so
it
be
like
that
,
James
think
,
the


lighthouse
one
have
see
across
the
bay
all
these
year
;
it
be
a
stark


tower
on
a
bare
rock
.
it
satisfy
he
.
it
confirm
some
obscure


feeling
of
his
about
his
own
character
.
the
old
lady
,
he
think
,


thinking
of
the
garden
at
home
,
go
drag
their
chair
about
on
the


lawn
.
Old
Mrs.
Beckwith
,
for
example
,
be
always
say
how
nice
it
be


and
how
sweet
it
be
and
how
they
ought
to
be
so
proud
and
they
ought


to
be
so
happy
,
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
,
James
think
,
look
at
the


lighthouse
stand
there
on
its
rock
,
it
be
like
that
.
he
look
at
his


father
read
fiercely
with
his
leg
curl
tight
.
they
share
that


knowledge
.
"
we
be
drive
before
a
gale
-
we
must
sink
,
"
he
begin


say
to
himself
,
half
aloud
,
exactly
as
his
father
say
it
.




nobody
seem
to
have
speak
for
an
age
.
Cam
be
tired
of
look
at


the
sea
.
little
bit
of
black
cork
have
float
past
;
the
fish
be


dead
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
.
still
her
father
read
,
and
James


look
at
he
and
she
look
at
he
,
and
they
vow
that
they
would


fight
tyranny
to
the
death
,
and
he
go
on
read
quite
unconscious
of


what
they
think
.
it
be
thus
that
he
escape
,
she
think
.
yes
,


with
his
great
forehead
and
his
great
nose
,
hold
his
little
mottled


book
firmly
in
front
of
he
,
he
escape
.
you
might
try
to
lay
hand
on


he
,
but
then
like
a
bird
,
he
spread
his
wing
,
he
float
off
to


settle
out
of
your
reach
somewhere
far
away
on
some
desolate
stump
.


she
gaze
at
the
immense
expanse
of
the
sea
.
the
island
have
grow
so


small
that
it
scarcely
look
like
a
leaf
any
long
.
it
look
like


the
top
of
a
rock
which
some
wave
big
than
the
rest
would
cover
.


yet
in
its
frailty
be
all
those
path
,
those
terrace
,
those
bedroom
-


all
those
innumberable
thing
.
but
as
,
just
before
sleep
,
thing


simplify
themselves
so
that
only
one
of
all
the
myriad
detail
have


power
to
assert
itself
,
so
,
she
feel
,
look
drowsily
at
the
island
,


all
those
path
and
terrace
and
bedroom
be
fade
and
disappear
,


and
nothing
be
leave
but
a
pale
blue
censer
swinge
rhythmically
this


way
and
that
across
her
mind
.
it
be
a
hang
garden
;
it
be
a


valley
,
full
of
bird
,
and
flower
,
and
antelope
...
she
be
fall


asleep
.




"
come
now
,
"
say
Mr.
Ramsay
,
suddenly
shut
his
book
.




come
where
?
to
what
extraordinary
adventure
?
she
wake
with
a
start
.


to
land
somewhere
,
to
climb
somewhere
?
where
be
he
lead
they
?
for


after
his
immense
silence
the
word
startle
they
.
but
it
be
absurd
.


he
be
hungry
,
he
say
.
it
be
time
for
lunch
.
besides
,
look
,
he


say
.
"
there
be
the
lighthouse
.
we
be
almost
there
.
"




"
he
be

very
well
,
"
say
Macalister
,
praise
James
.
"
he
be
keep


her
very
steady
.
"




but
his
father
never
praise
he
,
James
think
grimly
.




Mr.
Ramsay
open
the
parcel
and
share
out
the
sandwich
among
they
.


now
he
be
happy
,
eat
bread
and
cheese
with
these
fisherman
.
he


would
have
like
to
live
in
a
cottage
and
lounge
about
in
the
harbour


spit
with
the
other
old
man
,
James
think
,
watch
he
slice
his


cheese
into
thin
yellow
sheet
with
his
penknife
.




this
be
right
,
this
be
it
,
Cam
keep
feel
,
as
she
peel
her
hard-


boil
egg
.
now
she
feel
as
she
do
in
the
study
when
the
old
man
be


read
the
TIMES
.
now
I
can
go
on
think
whatever
I
like
,
and
I


sha
n't
 
fall
over
a
precipice
or
be
drown
,
for
there
he
be
,
keep


his
eye
on
I
,
she
think
.




at
the
same
time
they
be
sail
so
fast
along
by
the
rock
that
it


be
very
exciting
-
it
seem
as
if
they
be
do
two
thing
at
once
;


they
be
eat
their
lunch
here
in
the
sun
and
they
be
also
make


for
safety
in
a
great
storm
after
a
shipwreck
.
would
the
water
last
?


would
the
provision
last
?
she
ask
herself
,
tell
herself
a
story


but
know
at
the
same
time
what
be
the
truth
.




they
would
soon
be
out
of
it
,
Mr.
Ramsay
be
say
to
old
Macalister
;


but
their
child
would
see
some
strange
thing
.
Macalister
say
he


be
seventy
-
five
last
March
;
Mr.
Ramsay
be
seventy
-
one
.
Macalister
say


he
have
never
see
a
doctor
;
he
have
never
lose
a
tooth
.
and
that
be
the


way
I
'd
like
my
child
to
live
-
Cam
be
sure
that
her
father
be


think
that
,
for
he
stop
she
throw
a
sandwich
into
the
sea
and


tell
she
,
as
if
he
be
think
of
the
fisherman
and
how
they
live
,


that
if
she
do
not
want
it
she
should
put
it
back
in
the
parcel
.
she


should
not
waste
it
.
he
say
it
so
wisely
,
as
if
he
know
so
well
all


the
thing
that
happen
in
the
world
that
she
put
it
back
at
once
,
and


then
he
give
she
,
from
his
own
parcel
,
a
gingerbread
nut
,
as
if
he
be


a
great
spanish
gentleman
,
she
think
,
hand
a
flower
to
a
lady
at
a


window
 
so
courteous

manner
be
.
he
be
shabby
,
and
simple
,


eat
bread
and
cheese
;
and
yet
he
be
lead
they
on
a
great


expedition
where
,
for
all
she
know
,
they
would
be
drown
.




"

.
and
Mr.

a
look
at
the


spot
be
about
,
James
and
Cam
be
afraid
,
to
burst
out
:






but
I
beneath
a
rougher
sea
,






and
if
he
do
,
they
could
not
bear
it
;
they
would
shriek
aloud
;
they


could
not
endure
another
explosion
of
the
passion
that
boil
in
he
;


but
to
their
surprise
all
he
say
be
"
ah
"
as
if
he
think
to
himself
.


but
why
make
a
fuss
about
that
?
naturally
man
be
drown
in
a
storm
,


but
it
be
a
perfectly
straightforward
affair
,
and
the
depth
of
the
sea


 
he
sprinkle
the
crumb
from
his
sandwich
paper
over
they
 
be
only


water
after
all
.
then
having
light
his
pipe
he
take
out
his
watch
.


he
look
at
it
attentively
;
he
make
,
perhaps
,
some
mathematical


calculation
.
at
last
he
say
,
triumphantly
:




"
well
do
!
"
James
have
steer
they
like
a
bear
sailor
.




there
!
Cam
think
,
address
herself
silently
to
James
.
you
've
 
get


it
at
last
.
for
she
know
that
this
be
what
James
have
be
want
,


and
she
know
that
now
he
have
get
it
he
be
so
pleased
that
he
would
not


look
at
she
or
at
his
father
or
at
any
one
.
there
he
sit
with
his
hand


on
the
tiller
sitting
bolt
upright
,
look
rather
sulky
and
frown


slightly
.
he
be
so
pleased
that
he
be
not
go
to
let
anybody
share


a
grain
of
his
pleasure
.
his
father
have
praise
he
.
they
must
think


that
he
be
perfectly
indifferent
.
but
you
've
 
get
it
now
,
Cam
think
.




they
have
tack
,
and
they
be
sail
swiftly
,
buoyantly
on
long


rock
wave
which
hand
they
on
from
one
to
another
with
an


extraordinary
lilt
and
exhilaration
beside
the
reef
.
on
the
left
a


row
of
rock
show
brown
through
the
water
which
thin
and


become
green
and
on
one
,
a
high
rock
,
a
wave
incessantly
break


and
spurt
a
little
column
of
drop
which
fall
down
in
a
shower
.
one


could
hear
the
slap
of
the
water
and
the
patter
of
fall
drop
and
a


kind
of
hush
and
hiss
sound
from
the
wave
roll
and
gambol


and
slap
the
rock
as
if
they
be
wild
creature
who
be


perfectly
free
and
toss
and
tumble
and
sport
like
this
for
ever
.




now
they
could
see
two
man
on
the
lighthouse
,
watch
they
and
make


ready
to
meet
they
.




Mr.
Ramsay
button
his
coat
,
and
turn
up
his
trouser
.
he
take
the


large
,
badly
packed
,
brown
paper
parcel
which
Nancy
have
get
ready
and


sit
with
it
on
his
knee
.
thus
in
complete
readiness
to
land
he
sit


look
back
at
the
island
.
with
his
long
-
sighted
eye
perhaps
he


could
see
the
dwindle
leaf
-
like
shape
stand
on
end
on
a
plate
of


gold
quite
clearly
.
what
could
he
see
?
Cam
wonder
.
it
be
all
a


blur
to
she
.
what
be
he
think
now
?
she
wonder
.
what
be
it
he


seek
,
so
fixedly
,
so
intently
,
so
silently
?
they
watch
he
,
both


of
they
,
sit
bareheade
with
his
parcel
on
his
knee
staring
and


stare
at
the
frail
blue
shape
which
seem
like
the
vapour
of


something
that
have
burn
itself
away
.
what
do
you
want
?
they
both


want
to
ask
.
they
both
want
to
say
,
ask
we
anything
and
we
will


give
it
you
.
but
he
do
not
ask
they
anything
.
he
sit
and
look
at


the
island
and
he
might
be
think
,
we
perish
,
each
alone
,
or
he


might
be
think
,
I
have
reach
it
.
I
have
find
it
;
but
he
say


nothing
.




then
he
put
on
his
hat
.




"
bring
those
parcel
,
"
he
say
,
nod
his
head
at
the
thing
Nancy


have
do
up
for
they
to
take
to
the
lighthouse
.
"
the
parcel
for
the


lighthouse
man
,
"
he
say
.
he
rise
and
stand
in
the
bow
of
the
boat
,


very
straight
and
tall
,
for
all
the
world
,
James
think
,
as
if
he
be


say
,
"
there
be
no
God
,
"
and
Cam
think
,
as
if
he
be
leap
into


space
,
and
they
both
rise
to
follow
he
as
he
spring
,
lightly
like
a


young
man
,
hold
his
parcel
,
on
to
the
rock
.






14






"
he
must
have
reach
it
,
"
say
Lily
Briscoe
aloud
,
feel
suddenly


completely
tired
out
.
for
the
Lighthouse
have
become
almost
invisible
,


have
melt
away
into
a
blue
haze
,
and
the
effort
of
look
at
it
and


the
effort
of
thinking
of
he
land
there
,
which
both
seem
to
be


one
and
the
same
effort
,
have
stretch
her
body
and
mind
to
the
utmost
.


ah
,
but
she
be
relieve
.
whatever
she
have
want
to
give
he
,
when
he


leave
she
that
morning
,
she
have
give
he
at
last
.




"
he
have
land
,
"
she
say
aloud
.
"
it
be
finish
.
"
then
,
surge
up
,


puff
slightly
,
old
Mr.
Carmichael
stand
beside
she
,
look
like
an


old
pagan
god
,
shaggy
,
with
weed
in
his
hair
and
the
trident
 
it
be


only
a
french
novel
 
in
his
hand
.
he
stand
by
she
on
the
edge
of
the


lawn
,
sway
a
little
in
his
bulk
and
say
,
shade
his
eye
with
his


hand
:
"
they
will
have
land
,
"
and
she
feel
that
she
have
be
right
.


they
have
not
need
to
speak
.
they
have
be
think
the
same
thing


and
he
have
answer
she
without
she
ask
he
anything
.
he
stand


there
as
if
he
be
spread
his
hand
over
all
the
weakness
and


suffering
of
mankind
;
she
think
he
be
survey
,
tolerantly
and


compassionately
,
their
final
destiny
.
now
he
have
crown
the
occasion
,


she
think
,
when
his
hand
slowly
fall
,
as
if
she
have
see
he
let
fall


from
his
great
height
a
wreath
of
violet
and
asphodel
which
,


flutter
slowly
,
lie
at
length
upon
the
earth
.




quickly
,
as
if
she
be
recall
by
something
over
there
,
she
turn
to


her
canvas
.
there
it
be
-
her
picture
.
yes
,
with
all
its
green
and


blue
,
its
line
run
up
and
across
,
its
attempt
at
something
.
it


would
be
hang
in
the
attic
,
she
think
;
it
would
be
destroy
.
but


what
do
that
matter
?
she
ask
herself
,
take
up
her
brush
again
.


she
look
at
the
step
;
they
be
empty
;
she
look
at
her
canvas
;
it


be
blur
.
with
a
sudden
intensity
,
as
if
she
see
it
clear
for
a


second
,
she
draw
a
line
there
,
in
the
centre
.
it
be
do
;
it
be


finish
.
yes
,
she
think
,
lay
down
her
brush
in
extreme
fatigue
,


I
have
have
my
vision
.

END
