




                                  
I




in
my
young
and
more
vulnerable
year
my
father
give
I
some
advice


that
I
’ve
be
turn
over
in
my
mind
ever
since
.




"
whenever
you
feel
like
criticize
anyone
,
"
he
tell
I
,
"
just


remember
that
all
the
people
in
this
world
have
n’t
have
the
advantage


that
you
’ve
have
.
"




he
do
n’t
say
any
more
,
but
we
’ve
always
be
unusually
communicative


in
a
reserved
way
,
and
I
understand
that
he
mean
a
great
deal
more


than
that
.
in
consequence
,
I
’m
inclined
to
reserve
all
judgement
,
a


habit
that
have
open
up
many
curious
nature
to
I
and
also
make
I


the
victim
of
not
a
few
veteran
bore
.
the
abnormal
mind
be
quick
to


detect
and
attach
itself
to
this
quality
when
it
appear
in
a
normal


person
,
and
so
it
come
about
that
in
college
I
be
unjustly
accuse
of


be
a
politician
,
because
I
be
privy
to
the
secret
grief
of
wild
,


unknown
man
.
Most
of
the
confidence
be
unsought
—
frequently
I
have


feign
sleep
,
preoccupation
,
or
a
hostile
levity
when
I
realize
by


some
unmistakable
sign
that
an
intimate
revelation
be
quiver
on


the
horizon
;
for
the
intimate
revelation
of
young
man
,
or
at
least


the
term
in
which
they
express
they
,
be
usually
plagiaristic
and


mar
by
obvious
suppression
.
reserve
judgement
be
a
matter
of


infinite
hope
.
I
be
still
a
little
afraid
of
miss
something
if
I


forget
that
,
as
my
father
snobbishly
suggest
,
and
I
snobbishly


repeat
,
a
sense
of
the
fundamental
decency
be
parcel
out


unequally
at
birth
.




and
,
after
boast
this
way
of
my
tolerance
,
I
come
to
the
admission


that
it
have
a
limit
.
conduct
may
be
found
on
the
hard
rock
or
the


wet
marsh
,
but
after
a
certain
point
I
do
n’t
care
what
it
’s
found


on
.
when
I
come
back
from
the
East
last
autumn
I
feel
that
I
want


the
world
to
be
in
uniform
and
at
a
sort
of
moral
attention
forever
;
I


want
no
more
riotous
excursion
with
privileged
glimpse
into
the


human
heart
.
only
Gatsby
,
the
man
who
give
his
name
to
this
book
,
be


exempt
from
my
reaction
—
Gatsby
,
who
represent
everything
for
which
I


have
an
unaffected
scorn
.
if
personality
be
an
unbroken
series
of


successful
gesture
,
then
there
be
something
gorgeous
about
he
,
some


heighten
sensitivity
to
the
promise
of
life
,
as
if
he
be
relate


to
one
of
those
intricate
machine
that
register
earthquake
ten


thousand
mile
away
.
this
responsiveness
have
nothing
to
do
with
that


flabby
impressionability
which
be
dignified
under
the
name
of
the


"
creative
temperament”—it
be
an
extraordinary
gift
for
hope
,
a


romantic
readiness
such
as
I
have
never
find
in
any
other
person
and


which
it
be
not
likely
I
shall
ever
find
again
.
no
—
Gatsby
turn
out


all
right
at
the
end
;
it
be
what
prey
on
Gatsby
,
what
foul
dust


float
in
the
wake
of
his
dream
that
temporarily
close
out
my


interest
in
the
abortive
sorrow
and
short
-
wind
elation
of
man
.




------------------------------------------------------------------------




my
family
have
be
prominent
,
well
-
to
-
do
people
in
this
middle


western
city
for
three
generation
.
the
Carraways
be
something
of
a


clan
,
and
we
have
a
tradition
that
we
’re
descend
from
the
duke
of


buccleuch
,
but
the
actual
founder
of
my
line
be
my
grandfather
’s


brother
,
who
come
here
in
fifty
-
one
,
send
a
substitute
to
the
Civil


war
,
and
start
the
wholesale
hardware
business
that
my
father


carry
on
today
.




I
never
see
this
great
-
uncle
,
but
I
’m
suppose
to
look
like
he
—
with


special
reference
to
the
rather
hard
-
boil
painting
that
hang
in


father
’s
office
.
I
graduate
from
New
Haven
in
1915
,
just
a
quarter
of


a
century
after
my
father
,
and
a
little
later
I
participate
in
that


delay
teutonic
migration
know
as
the
Great
War
.
I
enjoy
the


counter
-
raid
so
thoroughly
that
I
come
back
restless
.
instead
of
be


the
warm
centre
of
the
world
,
the
Middle
West
now
seem
like
the


ragged
edge
of
the
universe
—
so
I
decide
to
go
East
and
learn
the
bond


business
.
everybody
I
know
be
in
the
bond
business
,
so
I
suppose
it


could
support
one
more
single
man
.
all
my
aunt
and
uncle
talk
it


over
as
if
they
be
choose
a
prep
school
for
I
,
and
finally
say
,


"
why
—
ye
-
es
,
"
with
very
grave
,
hesitant
face
.
Father
agree
to
finance


I
for
a
year
,
and
after
various
delay
I
come
East
,
permanently
,
I


think
,
in
the
spring
of
twenty
-
two
.




the
practical
thing
be
to
find
room
in
the
city
,
but
it
be
a
warm


season
,
and
I
have
just
leave
a
country
of
wide
lawn
and
friendly


tree
,
so
when
a
young
man
at
the
office
suggest
that
we
take
a


house
together
in
a
commuting
town
,
it
sound
like
a
great
idea
.
he


find
the
house
,
a
weather
-
beat
cardboard
bungalow
at
eighty
a


month
,
but
at
the
last
minute
the
firm
order
he
to
Washington
,
and


I
go
out
to
the
country
alone
.
I
have
a
dog
—
at
least
I
have
he
for
a


few
day
until
he
run
away
—
and
an
old
Dodge
and
a
finnish
woman
,
who


make
my
bed
and
cook
breakfast
and
mutter
finnish
wisdom
to


herself
over
the
electric
stove
.




it
be
lonely
for
a
day
or
so
until
one
morning
some
man
,
more


recently
arrive
than
I
,
stop
I
on
the
road
.




"
how
do
you
get
to
West
Egg
village
?
"
he
ask
helplessly
.




I
tell
he
.
and
as
I
walk
on
I
be
lonely
no
long
.
I
be
a
guide
,


a
pathfinder
,
an
original
settler
.
he
have
casually
confer
on
I
the


freedom
of
the
neighbourhood
.




and
so
with
the
sunshine
and
the
great
burst
of
leave
grow
on
the


tree
,
just
as
thing
grow
in
fast
movie
,
I
have
that
familiar


conviction
that
life
be
begin
over
again
with
the
summer
.




there
be
so
much
to
read
,
for
one
thing
,
and
so
much
fine
health
to


be
pull
down
out
of
the
young
breath
-
give
air
.
I
buy
a
dozen


volume
on
banking
and
credit
and
investment
security
,
and
they


stand
on
my
shelf
in
red
and
gold
like
new
money
from
the
mint
,


promise
to
unfold
the
shine
secret
that
only
Midas
and
Morgan
and


Maecenas
know
.
and
I
have
the
high
intention
of
read
many
other


book
besides
.
I
be
rather
literary
in
college
—
one
year
I
write
a


series
of
very
solemn
and
obvious
editorial
for
the
Yale
News
—
and
now


I
be
go
to
bring
back
all
such
thing
into
my
life
and
become


again
that
most
limited
of
all
specialist
,
the
"
well
-
rounded
man
.
"


this
be
n’t
just
an
epigram
—
life
be
much
more
successfully
look
at


from
a
single
window
,
after
all
.




it
be
a
matter
of
chance
that
I
should
have
rent
a
house
in
one
of


the
strange
community
in
North
America
.
it
be
on
that
slender


riotous
island
which
extend
itself
due
east
of
New
York
—
and
where


there
be
,
among
other
natural
curiosity
,
two
unusual
formation
of


land
.
twenty
mile
from
the
city
a
pair
of
enormous
egg
,
identical
in


contour
and
separate
only
by
a
courtesy
bay
,
jut
out
into
the
most


domesticate
body
of
salt
water
in
the
western
hemisphere
,
the
great


wet
barnyard
of
Long
Island
Sound
.
they
be
not
perfect
oval
—
like
the


egg
in
the
Columbus
story
,
they
be
both
crush
flat
at
the
contact


end
—
but
their
physical
resemblance
must
be
a
source
of
perpetual


wonder
to
the
gull
that
fly
overhead
.
to
the
wingless
a
more


interesting
phenomenon
be
their
dissimilarity
in
every
particular


except
shape
and
size
.




I
live
at
West
Egg
,
the
—
well
,
the
less
fashionable
of
the
two
,
though


this
be
a
most
superficial
tag
to
express
the
bizarre
and
not
a
little


sinister
contrast
between
they
.
my
house
be
at
the
very
tip
of
the


egg
,
only
fifty
yard
from
the
sound
,
and
squeeze
between
two
huge


place
that
rent
for
twelve
or
fifteen
thousand
a
season
.
the
one
on


my
right
be
a
colossal
affair
by
any
standard
—
it
be
a
factual


imitation
of
some
Hôtel
de
Ville
in
Normandy
,
with
a
tower
on
one


side
,
spank
new
under
a
thin
beard
of
raw
ivy
,
and
a
marble


swim
pool
,
and
more
than
forty
acre
of
lawn
and
garden
.
it
be


Gatsby
’s
mansion
.
or
,
rather
,
as
I
do
n’t
know
Mr.
Gatsby
,
it
be
a


mansion
inhabit
by
a
gentleman
of
that
name
.
my
own
house
be
an


eyesore
,
but
it
be
a
small
eyesore
,
and
it
have
be
overlook
,
so
I


have
a
view
of
the
water
,
a
partial
view
of
my
neighbour
’s
lawn
,
and


the
consoling
proximity
of
millionaire
—
all
for
eighty
dollar
a


month
.




across
the
courtesy
bay
the
white
palace
of
fashionable
East
Egg


glitter
along
the
water
,
and
the
history
of
the
summer
really
begin


on
the
evening
I
drive
over
there
to
have
dinner
with
the
Tom


Buchanans
.
Daisy
be
my
second
cousin
once
remove
,
and
I
’d
know
Tom


in
college
.
and
just
after
the
war
I
spend
two
day
with
they
in


Chicago
.




her
husband
,
among
various
physical
accomplishment
,
have
be
one
of


the
most
powerful
end
that
ever
play
football
at
New
Haven
—
a


national
figure
in
a
way
,
one
of
those
man
who
reach
such
an
acute


limited
excellence
at
twenty
-
one
that
everything
afterward
savour
of


anticlimax
.
his
family
be
enormously
wealthy
—
even
in
college
his


freedom
with
money
be
a
matter
for
reproach
—
but
now
he
’d
leave
Chicago


and
come
East
in
a
fashion
that
rather
take
your
breath
away
:
for


instance
,
he
’d
bring
down
a
string
of
polo
pony
from
Lake


forest
.
it
be
hard
to
realize
that
a
man
in
my
own
generation
be


wealthy
enough
to
do
that
.




why
they
come
East
I
do
n’t
know
.
they
have
spend
a
year
in
France
for


no
particular
reason
,
and
then
drift
here
and
there
unrestfully


wherever
people
play
polo
and
be
rich
together
.
this
be
a


permanent
move
,
say
Daisy
over
the
telephone
,
but
I
do
n’t
believe


it
—
I
have
no
sight
into
Daisy
’s
heart
,
but
I
feel
that
Tom
would
drift


on
forever
seek
,
a
little
wistfully
,
for
the
dramatic
turbulence
of


some
irrecoverable
football
game
.




and
so
it
happen
that
on
a
warm
windy
evening
I
drive
over
to
East


egg
to
see
two
old
friend
whom
I
scarcely
know
at
all
.
their
house


be
even
more
elaborate
than
I
expect
,
a
cheerful
red
-
and
-
white


georgian
Colonial
mansion
,
overlook
the
bay
.
the
lawn
start
at


the
beach
and
run
towards
the
front
door
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
,


jump
over
sundial
and
brick
walk
and
burn
garden
—
finally
when


it
reach
the
house
drift
up
the
side
in
bright
vine
as
though


from
the
momentum
of
its
run
.
the
front
be
break
by
a
line
of
French


window
,
glow
now
with
reflect
gold
and
wide
open
to
the
warm


windy
afternoon
,
and
Tom
Buchanan
in
ride
clothe
be
stand
with


his
leg
apart
on
the
front
porch
.




he
have
change
since
his
New
Haven
year
.
now
he
be
a
sturdy


straw
-
haired
man
of
thirty
,
with
a
rather
hard
mouth
and
a


supercilious
manner
.
two
shine
arrogant
eye
have
establish


dominance
over
his
face
and
give
he
the
appearance
of
always
lean


aggressively
forward
.
not
even
the
effeminate
swank
of
his
riding


clothe
could
hide
the
enormous
power
of
that
body
—
he
seem
to
fill


those
glisten
boot
until
he
strain
the
top
lacing
,
and
you
could


see
a
great
pack
of
muscle
shift
when
his
shoulder
move
under
his


thin
coat
.
it
be
a
body
capable
of
enormous
leverage
—
a
cruel
body
.




his
speak
voice
,
a
gruff
husky
tenor
,
add
to
the
impression
of


fractiousness
he
convey
.
there
be
a
touch
of
paternal
contempt
in


it
,
even
toward
people
he
like
—
and
there
be
man
at
New
Haven
who


have
hate
his
gut
.




"
now
,
do
n’t
think
my
opinion
on
these
matter
be
final
,
"
he
seem
to


say
,
"
just
because
I
’m
strong
and
more
of
a
man
than
you
be
.
"
we


be
in
the
same
senior
society
,
and
while
we
be
never
intimate
I


always
have
the
impression
that
he
approve
of
I
and
want
I
to
like


he
with
some
harsh
,
defiant
wistfulness
of
his
own
.




we
talk
for
a
few
minute
on
the
sunny
porch
.




"
I
’ve
get
a
nice
place
here
,
"
he
say
,
his
eye
flash
about


restlessly
.




turn
I
around
by
one
arm
,
he
move
a
broad
flat
hand
along
the


front
vista
,
include
in
its
sweep
a
sink
italian
garden
,
a
half


acre
of
deep
,
pungent
rose
,
and
a
snub
-
nosed
motorboat
that
bump


the
tide
offshore
.




"
it
belong
to
Demaine
,
the
oil
man
.
"
he
turn
I
around
again
,


politely
and
abruptly
.
"
we
’ll
go
inside
.
"




we
walk
through
a
high
hallway
into
a
bright
rosy
-
colour
space
,


fragilely
bind
into
the
house
by
french
window
at
either
end
.
the


window
be
ajar
and
gleaming
white
against
the
fresh
grass
outside


that
seem
to
grow
a
little
way
into
the
house
.
a
breeze
blow
through


the
room
,
blow
curtain
in
at
one
end
and
out
the
other
like
pale


flag
,
twist
they
up
toward
the
frost
wedding
-
cake
of
the


ceiling
,
and
then
ripple
over
the
wine
-
colour
rug
,
make
a
shadow


on
it
as
wind
do
on
the
sea
.




the
only
completely
stationary
object
in
the
room
be
an
enormous


couch
on
which
two
young
woman
be
buoy
up
as
though
upon
an


anchor
balloon
.
they
be
both
in
white
,
and
their
dress
be


ripple
and
flutter
as
if
they
have
just
be
blow
back
in
after
a


short
flight
around
the
house
.
I
must
have
stand
for
a
few
moment


listen
to
the
whip
and
snap
of
the
curtain
and
the
groan
of
a


picture
on
the
wall
.
then
there
be
a
boom
as
Tom
Buchanan
shut
the


rear
window
and
the
catch
wind
die
out
about
the
room
,
and
the


curtain
and
the
rug
and
the
two
young
woman
balloon
slowly
to
the


floor
.




the
young
of
the
two
be
a
stranger
to
I
.
she
be
extend
full


length
at
her
end
of
the
divan
,
completely
motionless
,
and
with
she


chin
raise
a
little
,
as
if
she
be
balance
something
on
it
which


be
quite
likely
to
fall
.
if
she
see
I
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye


she
give
no
hint
of
it
—
indeed
,
I
be
almost
surprised
into
murmur


an
apology
for
having
disturb
she
by
come
in
.




the
other
girl
,
Daisy
,
make
an
attempt
to
rise
—
she
lean
slightly


forward
with
a
conscientious
expression
—
then
she
laugh
,
an
absurd
,


charming
little
laugh
,
and
I
laugh
too
and
come
forward
into
the


room
.




"
I
’m
p
-
paralysed
with
happiness
.
"




she
laugh
again
,
as
if
she
say
something
very
witty
,
and
hold
my


hand
for
a
moment
,
look
up
into
my
face
,
promise
that
there
be


no
one
in
the
world
she
so
much
want
to
see
.
that
be
a
way
she


have
.
she
hint
in
a
murmur
that
the
surname
of
the
balance
girl
be


Baker
.
(
I
’ve
hear
it
say
that
Daisy
’s
murmur
be
only
to
make
people


lean
toward
she
;
an
irrelevant
criticism
that
make
it
no
less


charming
.
)




at
any
rate
,
Miss
Baker
’s
lip
flutter
,
she
nod
at
I
almost


imperceptibly
,
and
then
quickly
tip
her
head
back
again
—
the
object


she
be
balance
have
obviously
totter
a
little
and
give
she


something
of
a
fright
.
again
a
sort
of
apology
arise
to
my
lip
.


almost
any
exhibition
of
complete
self
-
sufficiency
draw
a
stunned


tribute
from
I
.




I
look
back
at
my
cousin
,
who
begin
to
ask
I
question
in
her
low
,


thrill
voice
.
it
be
the
kind
of
voice
that
the
ear
follow
up
and


down
,
as
if
each
speech
be
an
arrangement
of
note
that
will
never
be


play
again
.
her
face
be
sad
and
lovely
with
bright
thing
in
it
,


bright
eye
and
a
bright
passionate
mouth
,
but
there
be
an
excitement


in
her
voice
that
man
who
have
care
for
she
find
difficult
to
forget
:


a
singing
compulsion
,
a
whispered
"
listen
,
"
a
promise
that
she
have


do
gay
,
exciting
thing
just
a
while
since
and
that
there
be
gay
,


exciting
thing
hover
in
the
next
hour
.




I
tell
she
how
I
have

off
in
Chicago
for
a
day
on
my
way
East

their

"

hour

wake
up
out

the

with
an
utterly
abandon
feeling
,

ask
the
nurse
right


away

it
be
a
boy

a

she
tell
I
it
be
a

so
I


turn
my
head
away

weep
.

right

I
say
,
'
I
’m
glad

a

I
hope
she
’ll
be
a
fool

that
’
the
good
thing
a

can
be


in
this

convince
way

so

advanced

her
eye
flash
around
she
in
a
defiant
way
,
rather
like
Tom
’s
,
and


she
laugh
with
thrill
scorn
.
"
sophisticated

God

sophisticated

"




the
instant
her
voice
break
off
,
cease
to
compel
my
attention
,
my


belief
,
I
feel
the
basic
insincerity
of
what
she
have
say
.
it
make
I


uneasy
,
as
though
the
whole
evening
have
be
a
trick
of
some
sort
to


exact
a
contributory
emotion
from
I
.
I
wait
,
and
sure
enough
,
in
a


moment
she
look
at
I
with
an
absolute
smirk
on
her
lovely
face
,
as


if
she
have
assert
her
membership
in
a
rather
distinguished
secret


society
to
which
she
and
Tom
belong

true

know
what
they
be
refer
to

but
I
be

even


vaguely
engaged
.
the
fact
that
gossip
have
publish
the
banns
be
one


of
the
reason
I
have
come
East
.
you
ca
n’t
stop
go
with
an
old


friend
on
account
of
rumour
,

on
the
other
hand
I
have
no
intention


of
be
rumour
into
marriage
.




their
interest
rather
touch
I
and
make
they
less
remotely


rich
—
nevertheless
,
I
be
confused
and
a
little
disgusted
as
I
drive


away
.
it
seem
to
I
that
the
thing
for
Daisy
to
do
be
to
rush
out


of
the
house
,
child
in
arm
—
but
apparently
there
be
no
such


intention
in
her
head
.
as
for
Tom
,
the
fact
that
he
"
have
some
woman


in
New
York
"
be
really
less
surprising
than
that
he
have
be


depress
by
a
book
.
something
be
make
he
nibble
at
the
edge
of


stale
idea
as
if
his
sturdy
physical
egotism
no
long
nourish
his


peremptory
heart
.




already
it
be
deep
summer
on
roadhouse
roof
and
in
front
of
wayside


garage
,
where
new
red
petrol
-
pump
sit
out
in
pool
of
light
,
and


when
I
reach
my
estate
at
West
Egg
I
run
the
car
under
its
shed
and


sit
for
a
while
on
an
abandon
grass
roller
in
the
yard
.
the
wind
have


blow
off
,
leave
a
loud
,
bright
night
,
with
wing
beat
in
the


tree
and
a
persistent
organ
sound
as
the
full
bellow
of
the
earth


blow
the
frog
full
of
life
.
the
silhouette
of
a
move
cat
waver


across
the
moonlight
,
and
,
turn
my
head
to
watch
it
,
I
see
that
I


be
not
alone
—
fifty
foot
away
a
figure
have
emerge
from
the
shadow
of


my
neighbour
’s
mansion
and
be
stand
with
his
hand
in
his
pocket


regard
the
silver
pepper
of
the
star
.
something
in
his
leisurely


movement
and
the
secure
position
of
his
foot
upon
the
lawn
suggest


that
it
be
Mr.
Gatsby
himself
,
come
out
to
determine
what
share
be


his
of
our
local
heaven
.




I
decide
to
call
to
he
.
Miss
Baker
have
mention
he
at
dinner
,
and


that
would
do
for
an
introduction
.
but
I
do
n’t
call
to
he
,
for
he


give
a
sudden
intimation
that
he
be
content
to
be
alone
—
he
stretch


out
his
arm
toward
the
dark
water
in
a
curious
way
,
and
,
far
as
I
be


from
he
,
I
could
have
swear
he
be
tremble
.
involuntarily
I
glance


seaward
—
and
distinguish
nothing
except
a
single
green
light
,
minute


and
far
away
,
that
might
have
be
the
end
of
a
dock
.
when
I
look


once
more
for
Gatsby
he
have
vanish
,
and
I
be
alone
again
in
the


unquiet
darkness
.






                                  
II




about
halfway
between
West
Egg
and
New
York
the
motor
road
hastily


join
the
railroad
and
run
beside
it
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
,
so
as


to
shrink
away
from
a
certain
desolate
area
of
land
.
this
be
a
valley


of
ashe
—
a
fantastic
farm
where
ashe
grow
like
wheat
into
ridge
and


hill
and
grotesque
garden
;
where
ashe
take
the
form
of
house
and


chimney
and
rise
smoke
and
,
finally
,
with
a
transcendent
effort
,
of


ash
-
grey
man
,
who
move
dimly
and
already
crumble
through
the
powdery


air
.
occasionally
a
line
of
grey
car
crawl
along
an
invisible
track
,


give
out
a
ghastly
creak
,
and
come
to
rest
,
and
immediately
the


ash
-
grey
man
swarm
up
with
leaden
spade
and
stir
up
an
impenetrable


cloud
,
which
screen
their
obscure
operation
from
your
sight
.




but
above
the
grey
land
and
the
spasm
of
bleak
dust
which
drift


endlessly
over
it
,
you
perceive
,
after
a
moment
,
the
eye
of
Doctor
T.


J.
Eckleburg
.
the
eye
of
Doctor
T.
J.
Eckleburg
be
blue
and


gigantic
—
their
retina
be
one
yard
high
.
they
look
out
of
no
face
,


but
,
instead
,
from
a
pair
of
enormous
yellow
spectacle
which
pass


over
a
nonexistent
nose
.
evidently
some
wild
wag
of
an
oculist
set


they
there
to
fatten
his
practice
in
the
borough
of
Queens
,
and
then


sink
down
himself
into
eternal
blindness
,
or
forget
they
and
move


away
.
but
his
eye
,
dim
a
little
by
many
paintless
day
,
under
sun


and
rain
,
brood
on
over
the
solemn
dump
ground
.




the
valley
of
ashe
be
bound
on
one
side
by
a
small
foul
river
,
and
,


when
the
drawbridge
be
up
to
let
barge
through
,
the
passenger
on


wait
train
can
stare
at
the
dismal
scene
for
as
long
as
half
an


hour
.
there
be
always
a
halt
there
of
at
least
a
minute
,
and
it
be


because
of
this
that
I
first
meet
Tom
Buchanan
’s
mistress
.




the
fact
that
he
have
one
be
insist
upon
wherever
he
be
know
.
his


acquaintance
resent
the
fact
that
he
turn
up
in
popular
cafés


with
she
and
,
leave
she
at
a
table
,
saunter
about
,
chat
with


whomsoever
he
know
.
though
I
be
curious
to
see
she
,
I
have
no
desire


to
meet
she
—
but
I
do
.
I
go
up
to
New
York
with
Tom
on
the
train
one


afternoon
,
and
when
we
stop
by
the
ash
-
heap
he
jump
to
his
foot


and
,
take
hold
of
my
elbow
,
literally
force
I
from
the
car
.




"
we
’re
get
off
,
"
he
insist
.
"
I
want
you
to
meet
my
girl
.
"




I
think
he
’d
tank
up
a
good
deal
at
luncheon
,
and
his
determination


to
have
my
company
border
on
violence
.
the
supercilious
assumption


be
that
on
Sunday
afternoon
I
have
nothing
well
to
do
.




I
follow
he
over
a
low
whitewash
railroad
fence
,
and
we
walk


back
a
hundred
yard
along
the
road
under
Doctor
Eckleburg
’s


persistent
stare
.
the
only
building
in
sight
be
a
small
block
of


yellow
brick
sit
on
the
edge
of
the
waste
land
,
a
sort
of
compact


Main
Street
ministering
to
it
,
and
contiguous
to
absolutely
nothing
.


one
of
the
three
shop
it
contain
be
for
rent
and
another
be
an


all
-
night
restaurant
,
approach
by
a
trail
of
ashe
;
the
third

I

Tom
inside

the
interior
be
unprosperous
and
bare
;
the
only
car
visible
be
the


dust
-
cover
wreck
of
a
Ford
which
crouch
in
a
dim
corner
.
it
have


occur
to
I
that
this
shadow
of
a
garage
must
be
a
blind
,
and
that


sumptuous
and
romantic
apartment
be
conceal
overhead
,
when
the


proprietor
himself
appear
in
the
door
of
an
office
,
wipe
his
hand


on
a
piece
of
waste
.
he
be
a
blond
,
spiritless
man
,
anaemic
,
and


faintly
handsome
.
when
he
see
we
a
damp
gleam
of
hope
spring
into
his


light
blue
eye
.




"
hello
,
Wilson
,
old
man
,

say
Tom
,
slap
he
jovially
on
the


shoulder
.
"
how
’s
business
?
"




"
I
ca
n’t
complain

"
answer
Wilson
unconvincingly
.
"
when
be
you


go
to
sell
I
that
car
?
"




"

"




"
no

say
Tom
coldly
.
"
and
if
you
feel
that
way
about
it
,


maybe
I
’d
well
sell
it
somewhere
else
after
all
.
"




"
I
do
n’t

that
,
"
explain
Wilson
quickly
.
"
I
just
mean
—
"




his
voice
fade
off
and
Tom
glance
impatiently
around
the
garage
.


then
I
hear
footstep
on
a
stair
,
and
in
a
moment
the
thickish


figure
of
a
woman
block
out
the
light
from
the
office
door
.
she
be


in
the
middle
thirty
,
and
faintly
stout
,
but
she
carry
her
flesh


sensuously
as
some
woman
can
.
her
face
,
above
a
spotted
dress
of
dark


blue
crêpe
-
de
-
chine
,
contain
no
facet
or
gleam
of
beauty
,
but
there


be
an
immediately
perceptible
vitality
about
she
as
if
the
nerve
of


her
body
be
continually
smoulder
.
she
smile
slowly
and
,
walk


through
her
husband
as
if
he
be
a
ghost
,
shake
hand
with
Tom
,


look
he
flush
in
the
eye
.
then
she
wet
her
lip
,
and
without


turn
around
speak
to
her
husband
in
a
soft
,
coarse
voice
:




"

some
chair
,
why
do
n’t
you

so
somebody

"




"

agree
Wilson
hurriedly
,
and
go
toward
the
little


office
,
mingle
immediately
with
the
cement
colour
of
the
wall
.
a


white
ashen
dust
veil
his
dark
suit
and
his
pale
hair
as
it
veil


everything
in
the
vicinity
—
except
his
wife
,
who
move
close
to
Tom
.




"
I

say
Tom
intently
.

nod
and
move
away
from

just
as
George
Wilson
emerge
with


two
chair
from
his
office
door

we
wait
for

down
the
road

I
go
up
together
to
New

—
or
not


quite
together
,
for
Mrs.
Wilson
sit
discreetly
in
another
car
.
Tom


defer
that
much
to
the
sensibility
of
those
East
Eggers
who
might


be
on
the

stretch


tight
over
her
rather
wide
hip

Tom

Upstairs
,
in
the
solemn
echo
drive

let
four
taxicab

away
before
she
select
a
new
one

lavender

colour
with
grey
upholstery

in
this
we
slide
out
from


the
mass
of
the

the
glow
sunshine

forward

the
corner
.
when
I

chapter

then
draw
on
again
at
a
more


rakish
angle
,

the
effort
of
nature
toward
the
restoration
of
the


old
alignment
give
a
blurred
air
to
her
face

they
get
into
automobile
which
bear
they
out


to
Long
Island
,
and
somehow
they
end
up
at

for
the

a
chauffeur
in
a
uniform
of
robin’s
-
egg


blue
cross
my
lawn
early
that
Saturday
morning
with
a
surprisingly


formal
note
from
his
employer
:
the
honour
would
be
entirely
Gatsby
’s
,


it
say
,
if
I
would
attend
his
"
little
party
"
that
night
.
he
have
see


I
several
time
,
and
have
intend
to
call
on
I
long
before
,
but
a


peculiar
combination
of
circumstance
have
prevent
it
—
sign
Jay


Gatsby
,
in
a
majestic
hand
.




dress
up
in
white
flannel
I
go
over
to
his
lawn
a
little
after


seven
,
and
wander
around
rather
ill
at
ease
among
swirl
and
eddy


of
people
I
do
n’t
know
—
though
here
and
there
be
a
face
I
have
notice


on
the
commuting
train
.
I
be
immediately
strike
by
the
number
of


young
englishman
dot
about
;
all
well
dressed
,
all
look
a
little


hungry
,
and
all
talk
in
low
,
earnest
voice
to
solid
and
prosperous


american
.
I
be
sure
that
they
be
sell
something
:
bond
or


insurance
or
automobile
.
they
be
at
least
agonizingly
aware
of
the


easy
money
in
the
vicinity
and
convince
that
it
be
theirs
for
a
few


word
in
the
right
key
.




as
soon
as
I
arrive
I
make
an
attempt
to
find
my
host
,
but
the
two
or


three
people
of
whom
I
ask
his
whereabouts
stare
at
I
in
such
an


amazed
way
,
and
deny
so
vehemently
any
knowledge
of
his
movement
,


that
I
slunk
off
in
the
direction
of
the
cocktail
table
—
the
only
place


in
the
garden
where
a
single
man
could
linger
without
look


purposeless
and
alone
.




I
be
on
my
way
to
get
roar
drunk
from
sheer
embarrassment
when


Jordan
Baker
come
out
of
the
house
and
stand
at
the
head
of
the
marble


step
,
lean
a
little
backward
and
look
with
contemptuous


interest
down
into
the
garden
.




welcome
or
not
,
I
find
it
necessary
to
attach
myself
to
someone


before
I
should
begin
to
address
cordial
remark
to
the
passersby
.




"
hello

"
I
roar
,
advance
toward
she
.
my
voice
seem
unnaturally


loud
across
the
garden
.




"
I
think
you
might
be
here
,

she
respond
absently

I
come
up
.


"

door
to

she
hold
my
hand
impersonally
,
as
a
promise
that
she
’d
take
care
of
I


in
a
minute
,
and
give
ear
to
two
girl
in
twin
yellow
dress
,
who


stop
at
the
foot
of
the
step

cry
together
.

for
the
golf

in
the
final
the

with
complete

------------------------------------------------------------------------




read
over
what
I
have
write
so
far
,
I
see
I
have
give
the


impression
that
the
event
of
three
night
several
week
apart
be


all
that
absorb
I
.
on
the
contrary
,
they
be
merely
casual
event


in
a
crowded
summer
,
and
,
until
much
later
,
they
absorb
I


infinitely
less
than
my
personal
affair
.




Most
of
the
time
I
work
.
in
the
early
morning
the
sun
throw
my


shadow
westward
as
I
hurry
down
the
white
chasm
of
low
New
York


to
the
Probity
Trust
.
I
know
the
other
clerk
and
young
bond
-
salesman


by
their
first
name
,
and
lunch
with
they
in
dark
,
crowd


restaurant
on
little
pig
sausage
and
mashed
potato
and
coffee
.
I


even
have
a
short
affair
with
a
girl
who
live
in
Jersey
City
and


work
in
the
accounting
department
,
but
her
brother
begin
throw


mean
look
in
my
direction
,
so
when
she
go
on
her
vacation
in
July
I


let
it
blow
quietly
away
.




I
take
dinner
usually
at
the
Yale
Club
—
for
some
reason
it
be
the


gloomy
event
of
my
day
—
and
then
I
go
upstairs
to
the
library
and


study
investment
and
security
for
a
conscientious
hour
.
there


be
generally
a
few
rioter
around
,
but
they
never
come
into
the


library
,
so
it
be
a
good
place
to
work
.
after
that
,
if
the
night
be


mellow
,
I
stroll
down
Madison
Avenue
past
the
old
Murray
Hill
Hotel
,


and
over
33rd
Street
to
the
Pennsylvania
Station
.




I
begin
to
like
New
York
,
the
racy
,
adventurous
feel
of
it
at
night
,


and
the
satisfaction
that
the
constant
flicker
of
man
and
woman
and


machine
give
to
the
restless
eye
.
I
like
to
walk
up
Fifth
Avenue


and
pick
out
romantic
woman
from
the
crowd
and
imagine
that
in
a
few


minute
I
be
go
to
enter
into
their
life
,
and
no
one
would
ever


know
or
disapprove
.
sometimes
,
in
my
mind
,
I
follow
they
to
their


apartment
on
the
corner
of
hide
street
,
and
they
turn
and


smile
back
at
I
before
they
fade
through
a
door
into
warm


darkness
.
at
the
enchanted
metropolitan
twilight
I
feel
a
haunting


loneliness
sometimes
,
and
feel
it
in
other
—
poor
young
clerk
who


loiter
in
front
of
window
wait
until
it
be
time
for
a
solitary


restaurant
dinner
—
young
clerk
in
the
dusk
,
waste
the
most
poignant


moment
of
night
and
life
.




again
at
eight
o’clock
,
when
the
dark
lane
of
the
Forties
be
line


five
deep
with
throbbing
taxicab
,
bind
for
the
theatre
district
,
I


feel
a
sinking
in
my
heart
.
form
lean
together
in
the
taxi
as
they


wait
,
and
voice
sing
,
and
there
be
laughter
from
unheard
joke
,


and
light
cigarette
make
unintelligible
circle
inside
.
imagine


that
I
,
too
,
be
hurry
towards
gaiety
and
share
their
intimate


excitement
,
I
wish
they
well
.




for
a
while
I
lose
sight
of
Jordan
Baker
,
and
then
in
midsummer
I


find
she
again
.
at
first
I
be
flatter
to
go
place
with
she
,


because
she
be
a
golf
champion
,
and
everyone
know
her
name
.
then
it


be
something

I
be
n’t
actually
in
love
,
but
I
feel
a
sort
of


tender
curiosity
.
the
bored
haughty
face
that
she
turn
to
the
world


conceal
something
—
most
affectation
conceal
something
eventually
,


even
though
they
do
n’t
in
the
beginning
—
and
one
day
I
find
what
it


be
.
when
we
be
on
a
house
-
party
together
up
in
Warwick
,
she
leave
a


borrow
car
out
in
the
rain
with
the
top
down
,
and
then
lie
about


it
—
and
suddenly
I
remember
the
story
about
she
that
have
elude
I


that
night
at
Daisy
’s
.
at
her
first
big
golf
tournament
there
be
a


row
that
nearly
reach
the
newspaper
—
a
suggestion
that
she
have
move


her
ball
from
a
bad
lie
in
the
semifinal
round
.
the
thing
approach


the
proportion
of
a
scandal
—
then
die
away
.
a
caddy
retract
his


statement
,
and
the
only
other
witness
admit
that
he
might
have
be


mistaken
.
the
incident
and
the
name
have
remain
together
in
my
mind
.




Jordan
Baker
instinctively
avoid
clever
,
shrewd
man
,
and
now
I
see


that
this
be
because
she
feel
safe
on
a
plane
where
any
divergence


from
a
code
would
be
think
impossible
.
she
be
incurably
dishonest
.


she
be
n’t
able
to
endure
be
at
a
disadvantage
and
,
give
this


unwillingness
,
I
suppose
she
have
begin
deal
in
subterfuge
when
she


be
very
young
in
order
to
keep
that
cool
,
insolent
smile
turn
to


the
world
and
yet
satisfy
the
demand
of
her
hard
,
jaunty
body
.




it
make
no
difference
to
I
.
dishonesty
in
a
woman
be
a
thing
you


never
blame
deeply
—
I
be
casually
sorry
,
and
then
I
forget
.
it
be
on


that
same
house
-
party
that
we
have
a
curious
conversation
about
drive


a
car
.
it
start
because
she
pass
so
close
to
some
workman
that
our


fender
flick
a
button
on
one
man
’s
coat
.




"
you
’re
a
rotten
driver
,
"
I
protest
.
"
either
you
ought
to
be
more


careful
,
or
you
ought
n’t
to
drive
at
all
.
"




"
I
be
careful
.
"




"
no
,
you
’re
not
.
"




"
well
,
other
people
be
,
"
she
say
lightly
.




"
what
’s
that
get
to
do
with
it
?
"




"
they
’ll
keep
out
of
my
way
,
"
she
insist
.
"
it
take
two
to
make
an


accident
.
"




"
suppose
you
meet
somebody
just
as
careless
as
yourself
.
"




"
I
hope
I
never
will
,
"
she
answer
.
"
I
hate
careless
people
.
that
’


why
I
like
you
.
"




her
grey
,
sun
-
strain
eye
stare
straight
ahead
,
but
she
have


deliberately
shift
our
relation
,
and
for
a
moment
I
think
I
love


she
.
but
I
be
slow
-
thinking
and
full
of
interior
rule
that
act
as


brake
on
my
desire
,
and
I
know
that
first
I
have
to
get
myself


definitely
out
of
that
tangle
back
home
.
I
’d
be
write
letter
once


a
week
and
sign
they
:
"
love
,
Nick
,
"
and
all
I
could
think
of
be


how
,
when
that
certain
girl
play
tennis
,
a
faint
moustache
of


perspiration
appear
on
her
upper
lip
.
nevertheless
there
be
a
vague


understanding
that
have
to
be
tactfully
break
off
before
I
be
free
.




everyone
suspect
himself
of
at
least
one
of
the
cardinal
virtue
,
and


this
be
mine
:
I
be
one
of
the
few
honest
people
that
I
have
ever


know

at
nine
o’clock
,
one
morning
late
in
July
,
Gatsby
’s
gorgeous
car


lurch
up
the
rocky
drive
to
my
door
and
give
out
a
burst
of
melody


from
its
three
-
note
horn
.




it
be
the
first
time
he
have
call
on
I
,
though
I
have
go
to
two
of


his
party
,
mount
in
his
hydroplane
,
and
,
at
his
urgent
invitation
,


make
frequent
use
of
his
beach
.




"
good
morning
,
old
sport
.
you
’re
have
lunch
with
I
today
and
I


think
we
’d
ride
up
together
.
"




he
be
balance
himself
on
the
dashboard
of
his
car
with
that


resourcefulness
of
movement
that
be
so
peculiarly
american
—
that
come
,


I
suppose
,
with
the
absence
of
lift
work
in
youth
and
,
even
more
,


with
the
formless
grace
of
our
nervous
,
sporadic
game
.
this
quality


be
continually
break
through
his
punctilious
manner
in
the
shape


of
restlessness
.
he
be
never
quite
still
;
there
be
always
a
tap


foot
somewhere
or
the
impatient
opening
and
closing
of
a
hand
.




he
see
I
look
with
admiration
at
his
car
.




"
it
’
pretty
,
be
n’t
it
,
old
sport
?
"
he
jump
off
to
give
I
a
well


view
.
"
have
n’t
you
ever
see
it
before
?
"




I
’d
see
it
.
everybody
have
see
it
.
it
be
a
rich
cream
colour
,
bright


with
nickel
,
swell
here
and
there
in
its
monstrous
length
with


triumphant
hatbox
and
supper
-
box
and
toolbox
,
and
terrace
with


a
labyrinth
of
windshield
that
mirror

dozen

sit
down


behind
many
layer
of
glass
in
a
sort
of
green
leather
conservatory
,


we
start
to
town
.




I
have
talk
with
he
perhaps
half
a
dozen
time
in
the
past
month
and


find
,
to
my
disappointment
,
that
he
have
little
to
say
.
so
my
first


impression
,
that
he
be
a
person
of
some
undefined
consequence
,
have


gradually
fade
and
he
have
become
simply
the
proprietor
of
an


elaborate

so
I
do
n’t
see
Daisy
very


often
.
she
go
with
a
slightly
old
crowd
—
when
she
go
with
anyone


at
all
.
wild
rumour
be
circulate
about
she
—
how
her
mother
have


find
she
pack
her
bag
one
winter
night
to
go
to
New
York
and
say


goodbye
to
a
soldier
who
be
go
overseas
.
she
be
effectually


prevent
,
but
she
be
n’t
on
speak
term
with
her
family
for


several
week
.
after
that
she
do
n’t
play
around
with
the
soldier
any


more
,
but
only
with
a
few
flat
-
footed
,
shortsighted
young
man
in
town
,


who
could
n’t
get
into
the
army
at
all
.




by
the
next
autumn
she
be
gay
again
,
gay
as
ever
.
she
have
a
début


after
the
armistice
,
and
in
February
she
be
presumably
engage
to
a


man
from
New
Orleans
.
in
June
she
marry
Tom
Buchanan
of
Chicago
,


with
more
pomp
and
circumstance
than
Louisville
ever
know
before
.
he


come
down
with
a
hundred
people
in
four
private
car
,
and
hire
a


whole
floor
of
the
Muhlbach
Hotel
,
and
the
day
before
the
wedding
he


give
she
a
string
of
pearl
value
at
three
hundred
and
fifty
thousand


dollar
.




I
be
a
bridesmaid
.
I
come
into
her
room
half
an
hour
before
the


bridal
dinner
,
and
find
she
lie
on
her
bed
as
lovely
as
the
June


night
in
her
flowered
dress
—
and
as
drunk
as
a
monkey
.
she
have
a
bottle


of
sauterne
in
one
hand
and
a
letter
in
the
other
.




"
 
'
gratulate
I
,
"
she
mutter
.
"
never
have
a
drink
before
,
but
oh
how


I
do
enjoy
it
.
"




"
what
’
the
matter
,
Daisy
?
"




I
be
scared
,
I
can
tell
you
;
I
’d
never
see
a
girl
like
that
before
.




"
here
,
dearie
.
"
she
grope
around
in
a
wastebasket
she
have
with
she


on
the
bed
and
pull
out
the
string
of
pearl
.
"
take
’em
downstairs


and
give
’em
back
to
whoever
they
belong
to
.
tell
’em
all
Daisy
’s


change
'
her
mine
.
say
:
'
Daisy
’s
change
'
her
mine
!
'
 
"




she
begin
to
cry
—
she
cry
and
cry
.
I
rush
out
and
find
she


mother
’s
maid
,
and
we
lock
the
door
and
get
she
into
a
cold
bath
.


she
would
n’t
let
go
of
the
letter
.
she
take
it
into
the
tub
with
she


and
squeeze
it
up
in
a
wet
ball
,
and
only
let
I
leave
it
in
the


soap
-
dish
when
she
see
that
it
be
come
to
piece
like
snow
.




but
she
do
n’t
say
another
word
.
we
give
her
spirit
of
ammonia
and


put
ice
on
her
forehead
and
hook
she
back
into
her
dress
,
and
half


an
hour
later
,
when
we
walk
out
of
the
room
,
the
pearl
be
around


her
neck
and
the
incident
be
over
.
next
day
at
five
o’clock
she


marry
Tom
Buchanan
without
so
much
as
a
shiver
,
and
start
off
on
a


three
month
’
trip
to
the
South
Seas
.




I
see
they
in
Santa
Barbara
when
they
come
back
,
and
I
think
I
’d


never
see
a
girl
so
mad
about
her
husband
.
if
he
leave
the
room
for
a


minute
she
’d
look
around
uneasily
,
and
say
:
"
where
’s
Tom
go
?
"
and


wear
the
most
abstract
expression
until
she
see
he
come
in
the


door
.
she
use
to
sit
on
the
sand
with
his
head
in
her
lap
by
the


hour
,
rub
her
finger
over
his
eye
and
look
at
he
with


unfathomable
delight
.
it
be
touch
to
see
they
together
—
it
make
you


laugh
in
a
hush
,
fascinated
way
.
that
be
in
August
.
a
week
after
I


leave
Santa
Barbara
Tom
run
into
a
wagon
on
the
Ventura
road
one
night
,


and
rip
a
front
wheel
off
his
car
.
the
girl
who
be
with
he
get


into
the
paper
,
too
,
because
her
arm
be
break
—
she
be
one
of
the


chambermaid
in
the
Santa
Barbara
Hotel
.




the
next
April
Daisy
have
her
little
girl
,
and
they
go
to
France
for


a
year
.
I
see
they
one
spring
in
Cannes
,
and
later
in
Deauville
,
and


then
they
come
back
to
Chicago
to
settle
down
.
Daisy
be
popular
in


Chicago
,
as
you
know
.
they
move
with
a
fast
crowd
,
all
of
they
young


and
rich
and
wild
,
but
she
come
out
with
an
absolutely
perfect


reputation
.
perhaps
because
she
do
n’t
drink
.
it
’
a
great
advantage


not
to
drink
among
hard
-
drink
people
.
you
can
hold
your
tongue
and
,


moreover
,
you
can
time
any
little
irregularity
of
your
own
so
that


everybody
else
be
so
blind
that
they
do
n’t
see
or
care
.
perhaps
Daisy


never
go
in
for
amour
at
all
—
and
yet
there
’
something
in
that
voice


of
her
…




well
,
about
six
week
ago
,
she
hear
the
name
Gatsby
for
the
first


time
in
year
.
it
be
when
I
ask
you
—
do
you
remember?—if
you
know


gatsby
in
West
Egg
.
after
you
have
go
home
she
come
into
my
room
and


wake
I
up
,
and
say
:
"
what
Gatsby
?
"
and
when
I
describe
he
—
I
be


half
asleep
—
she
say
in
the
strange
voice
that
it
must
be
the
man


she
use
to
know
.
it
be
n’t
until
then
that
I
connect
this
Gatsby


with
the
officer
in
her
white
car
.




------------------------------------------------------------------------




when
Jordan
Baker
have
finish
tell
all
this
we
have
leave
the
Plaza


for
half
an
hour
and
be
drive
in
a
victoria
through
Central
Park
.


the
sun
have
go
down
behind
the
tall
apartment
of
the
movie
star
in


the
West
Fifties
,
and
the
clear
voice
of
child
,
already
gather


like
cricket
on
the
grass
,
rise
through
the
hot
twilight
:




 
"
I
’m
the
Sheik
of
Araby
.
your
love
belong
to
I
.
at
night
when


 
you
’re
asleep
into
your
tent
I
’ll
creep
—
"




"
it
be
a
strange
coincidence
,
"
I
say
.




"
but
it
be
n’t
a
coincidence
at
all
.
"




"
why
not
?
"




"
Gatsby
buy
that
house
so
that
Daisy
would
be
just
across
the
bay
.
"




then
it
have
not
be
merely
the
star
to
which
he
have
aspire
on
that


June
night
.
he
come
alive
to
I
,
deliver
suddenly
from
the
womb
of


his
purposeless
splendour
.




"
he
want
to
know
,
"
continue
Jordan
,
"
if
you
’ll
invite
Daisy
to
your


house
some
afternoon
and
then
let
he
come
over
.
"




the
modesty
of
the
demand
shake
I
.
he
have
wait
five
year
and


buy
a
mansion
where
he
dispense
starlight
to
casual
moth
—
so
that


he
could
"
come
over

some
afternoon
to
a
stranger

garden
.

I

such
a
little
thing

"




"
he
’
afraid

he
’s

so
long

think

"




"

"




"
I
think
he
half
expect
she
to
wander
into
one
of
his
party
,
some


night
,
"
go
on
Jordan
,
"
but
she
never
do
.
then
he
begin
ask


people
casually
if
they
know
she
,
and
I
be
the
first
one
he
find
.
it


be
that
night
he
send
for
I
at
his
dance
,
and
you
should
have
hear


the
elaborate
way
he
work
up
to
it
.
of
course
,
I
immediately


suggest
a
luncheon
in
New
York
—
and
I
think
he
’d
go
mad
:




"
 
'
I
do
n’t
want
to
do
anything
out
of
the
way

'
he
keep
say
.
'
I


want
to
see
she
right
next
door
.
'




"
when
I
say
you
be
a
particular
friend
of
Tom
’s
,
he
start
to


abandon
the
whole
idea
.
he
do
n’t
know
very
much
about
Tom
,
though
he


say
he
’s
read
a
Chicago
paper
for
year
just
on
the
chance
of


catch
a
glimpse
of
Daisy
’s
name
.
"




it
be
dark
now
,
and
as
we
dip
under
a
little
bridge
I
put
my
arm


around
Jordan
’s
golden
shoulder
and
draw
she
toward
I
and
ask
she


to
dinner
.
suddenly
I
be
n’t
think
of
Daisy
and
Gatsby
any
more
,


but
of
this
clean
,
hard
,
limited
person
,
who
deal
in
universal


scepticism
,
and
who
lean
back
jauntily
just
within
the
circle
of
my


arm
.
a
phrase
begin
to
beat
in
my
ear
with
a
sort
of
heady


excitement
:
"
there
be
only
the
pursued
,
the
pursuing
,
the
busy
,
and


the
tired
.
"




"
and
Daisy
ought
to
have
something
in
her
life
,
"
murmur
Jordan
to


I
.




"
do
she
want
to
see
Gatsby
?
"




"
she
’
not
to
know
about
it
.
Gatsby
do
n’t
want
she
to
know
.
you
’re


just
suppose
to
invite
she
to
tea
.
"




we
pass
a
barrier
of
dark
tree
,
and
then
the
façade
of
Fifty
-
Ninth


Street
,
a
block
of
delicate
pale
light
,
beam
down
into
the
park
.


unlike
Gatsby
and
Tom
Buchanan
,
I
have
no
girl
whose
disembody
face


float
along
the
dark
cornice
and
blinding
sign
,
and
so
I
draw
up


the
girl
beside
I
,
tighten
my
arm
.
her
wan
,
scornful
mouth


smile
,
and
so
I
draw
she
up
again
close
,
this
time
to
my
face
.






                                  
v




when
I
come
home
to
West
Egg
that
night
I
be
afraid
for
a
moment
that


my
house
be
on
fire
.
two
o’clock
and
the
whole
corner
of
the


peninsula
be
blaze
with
light
,
which
fall
unreal
on
the
shrubbery


and
make
thin
elongate
glint
upon
the
roadside
wire
.
turn
a


corner
,
I
see
that
it
be
Gatsby
’s
house
,
light
from
tower
to
cellar
.




at
first
I
think
it
be
another
party
,
a
wild
rout
that
have
resolve


itself
into
"
hide
-
and
-
go
-
seek
"
or
"
sardine
-
in
-
the
-
box
"
with
all
the


house
throw
open
to
the
game
.
but
there
be
n’t
a
sound
.
only
wind
in


the
tree
,
which
blow

automatic
quality

we
all
back
at
least


another
minute
.
I
have
they
both
on
their
foot
with
the
desperate


suggestion
that
they
help
I
make
tea
in
the
kitchen
when
the
demoniac


Finn
bring
it
in
on
a
tray

amid
the
welcome
confusion
of
cup

physical


decency
establish
itself
.
Gatsby
get
himself
into
a
shadow
and
,


while
Daisy
and
I
talk
,
look
conscientiously
from
one
to
the
other


of
we
with
tense
,
unhappy
eye
.
however
,
as
calmness
be
n’t
an
end
in


itself
,
I
make
an
excuse
at
the
first
possible
moment
,
and
get
to
my


foot
.




"

immediate
alarm

be
back

he
follow
I
wildly
into
the
kitchen
,
close
the
door
,
and


whisper
:
"
oh
,
God
!

in
a
miserable
way

he
raise
his
hand
to
stop
my
word
,
look
at
I
with
unforgettable


reproach
,
and
,
open
the
door
cautiously
,
go
back
into
the
other


room
.




I
walk
out
the
back
way
—
just
as
Gatsby
have
when
he
have
make
his


nervous
circuit
of
the
house
half
an
hour
before
—
and
run
for
a
huge


black
knotted
tree
,
whose
mass
leave
make
a
fabric
against
the


rain
.
once
more
it
be
pour
,
and
my
irregular
lawn
,
well
-
shave
by


Gatsby
’s
gardener
,
abound
in
small
muddy
swamp
and
prehistoric


marsh
.
there
be
nothing
to
look
at
from
under
the
tree
except


Gatsby
’s
enormous
house
,
so
I
stare
at
it
,
like
Kant
at
his
church


steeple
,
for
half
an
hour
.
a
brewer
have
build
it
early
in
the
"
period
"


craze
,
a
decade
before
,
and
there
be
a
story
that
he
’d
agree
to
pay


five
year
’
taxis
on
all
the
neighbouring
cottage
if
the
owner
would


have
their
roof
thatch
with
straw
.
perhaps
their
refusal
take
the


heart
out
of
his
plan
to
Found

american
,
while
willing
,
even
eager
,
to
be
serf
,
have


always
be
obstinate
about
be

.




after
half
an
hour
,
the
sun
shine
again
,
and
the
grocer
’s
automobile


round
Gatsby
’s
drive
with
the
raw
material
for
his
servant
'


dinner
—
I
feel
sure
he
would
n’t
eat
a
spoonful
.
a
maid
begin
open


the
upper
window
of
his
house
,
appear
momentarily
in
each
,
and
,


lean
from
the
large
central
bay
,
spit
meditatively
into
the


garden
.
it
be
time
I
go
back
.
while
the
rain
continue
it
have


seem
like
the
murmur
of
their
voice
,
rise
and
swell
a
little


now
and
then
with
gust
of
emotion
.
but
in
the
new
silence
I
feel
that


silence
have
fall
within
the
house
too
.




I
go
in
—
after
make
every
possible
noise
in
the
kitchen
,
short
of


push
over
the
stove
—
but
I
do
n’t
believe
they
hear
a
sound
.
they


be
sit
at
either
end
of
the
couch
,
look
at
each
other
as
if


some
question
have
be
ask
,
or
be
in
the
air
,
and
every
vestige
of


embarrassment
be
go
.
Daisy
’s
face
be
smear
with
tear
,
and
when


I
come
in
she
jump
up
and
begin
wipe
at
it
with
her
handkerchief


before
a
mirror
.
but
there
be
a
change
in
Gatsby
that
be
simply


confound
.
he
literally
glow
;
without
a

smile

ecstatic

not
through

because

the
colossal
vitality

his
illusion

it
have
go
beyond


she

beyond
everything

he
have
throw
himself
into
it
with
a

passion

to
it
all
the

it

feather

fire

a

can

himself

take


hold

as
she

something
low
in

he
turn


toward
she
with
a
rush
of
emotion

I
think
that
voice
hold
he
most

its
fluctuating
,

warmth

it

about
this
time
an
ambitious
young
reporter
from
New
York
arrive
one


morning
at
Gatsby
’s
door
and
ask
he
if
he
have
anything
to
say
.




"
anything
to
say
about
what
?
"
inquire

politely
.




"
why
—
any
statement
to
give
out
.
"




it
transpire
after
a
confused
five
minute
that
the
man
have
hear


Gatsby
’s
name
around
his
office
in
a
connection
which
he
either


would
n’t
reveal
or
do
n’t
fully
understand
.
this
be
his
day
off
and


with
laudable
initiative
he
have
hurry
out
"
to
see
.
"




it
be
a
random
shot
,
and
yet
the
reporter
’s
instinct
be
right
.


Gatsby
’s
notoriety
,
spread
about
by
the
hundred
who
have
accept
his


hospitality
and
so
become
authority
upon
his
past
,
have
increase
all


summer
until
he
fall
just
short
of
be
news
.
contemporary
legend


such
as
the
"
underground
pipeline
to
Canada
"
attach
themselves
to


he
,
and
there
be
one
persistent
story
that
he
do
n’t
live
in
a
house


at
all
,
but
in
a
boat
that
look
like
a
house
and
be
move
secretly


up
and
down
the
Long
Island
shore
.
just
why
these
invention
be
a


source
of
satisfaction
to
James
Gatz
of
North
Dakota
,
be
n’t
easy
to


say
.




James
Gatz
—
that
be
really
,
or
at
least
legally
,
his
name
.
he
have


change
it
at
the
age
of
seventeen
and
at
the
specific
moment
that


witness
the
beginning
of
his
career
—
when
he
see
Dan
Cody
’s
yacht


drop
anchor
over
the
most
insidious
flat
on
Lake
Superior
.
it
be


James
Gatz
who
have
be
loaf
along
the
beach
that
afternoon
in
a


tear
green
jersey
and
a
pair
of
canvas
pant
,
but
it
be
already
Jay


Gatsby
who
borrow
a
rowboat
,
pull
out
to
the
Tuolomee
,
and


inform
Cody
that
a
wind
might
catch
he
and
break
he
up
in
half
an


hour
.




I
suppose
he
’d
have
the
name
ready
for
a
long
time
,
even
then
.
his


parent
be
shiftless
and
unsuccessful
farm
people
—
his
imagination


have
never
really
accept
they
as
his
parent
at
all
.
the
truth
be


that
Jay
Gatsby
of
West
Egg
,
Long
Island
,
spring
from
his
platonic


conception
of
himself
.
he
be
a
son
of
God
—
a
phrase
which
,
if
it
mean


anything
,
mean
just
that
—
and
he
must
be
about
his
Father
’s
business
,


the
service
of
a
vast
,
vulgar
,
and
meretricious
beauty
.
so
he
invent


just
the
sort
of
Jay
Gatsby
that
a
seventeen
-
year
-
old
boy
would
be


likely
to
invent
,
and
to
this
conception
he
be
faithful
to
the
end
.




for
over
a
year
he
have
be
beat
his
way
along
the
south
shore
of


Lake
Superior
as
a
clam
-
digger
and
a
salmon
-
fisher
or
in
any
other


capacity
that
bring
he
food
and
bed
.
his
brown
,
harden
body


live
naturally
through
the
half
-
fierce
,
half
-
lazy
work
of
the
bracing


day
.
he
know
woman
early
,
and
since
they
spoil
he
he
become


contemptuous
of
they
,
of
young
virgin
because
they
be
ignorant
,
of


the
other
because
they
be
hysterical
about
thing
which
in
his


overwhelm
self
-
absorption
he
take
for
grant
.




but
his
heart
be
in
a
constant
,
turbulent
riot
.
the
most
grotesque


and
fantastic
conceit
haunt
he
in
his
bed
at
night
.
a
universe
of


ineffable
gaudiness
spin
itself
out
in
his
brain
while
the
clock


tick
on
the
washstand
and
the
moon
soak
with
wet
light
his
tangle


clothe
upon
the
floor
.
each
night
he
add
to
the
pattern
of
his


fancy
until
drowsiness
close
down
upon
some
vivid
scene
with
an


oblivious
embrace
.
for
a
while
these
reverie
provide
an
outlet
for


his
imagination
;
they
be
a
satisfactory
hint
of
the
unreality
of


reality
,
a
promise
that
the
rock
of
the
world
be
found
securely
on


a
fairy
’s
wing
.




an
instinct
toward
his
future
glory
have
lead
he
,
some
month
before
,


to
the
small
Lutheran
College
of
St.
Olaf
’s
in
southern
Minnesota
.
he


stay
there
two
week
,
dismay
at
its
ferocious
indifference
to
the


drum
of
his
destiny
,
to
destiny
itself
,
and
despise
the
janitor
’s


work
with
which
he
be
to
pay
his
way
through
.
then
he
drift
back
to


Lake
Superior
,
and
he
be
still
search
for
something
to
do
on
the


day
that
Dan
Cody
’s
yacht
drop
anchor
in
the
shallow
alongshore
.




cody
be
fifty
year
old
then
,
a
product
of
the
Nevada
silver
field
,


of
the
Yukon
,
of
every
rush
for
metal
since
seventy
-
five
.
the


transaction
in
Montana
copper
that
make
he
many
time
a
millionaire


find
he
physically
robust
but
on
the
verge
of
soft
-
mindedness
,
and
,


suspect
this
,
an
infinite
number
of
woman
try
to
separate
he


from
his
money
.
the
none
too
savoury
ramification
by
which
Ella
Kaye
,


the
newspaper
woman
,
play
Madame
de
Maintenon
to
his
weakness
and


send
he
to
sea
in
a
yacht
,
be
common
property
of
the
turgid


journalism
in
1902
.
he
have
be
coast
along
all
too
hospitable


shore
for
five
year
when
he
turn
up
as
James
Gatz
’s
destiny
in


little
Girl
Bay
.




to
young
Gatz
,
rest
on
his
oar
and
look
up
at
the
railed
deck
,


that
yacht
represent
all
the
beauty
and
glamour
in
the
world
.
I


suppose
he
smile
at
Cody
—
he
have
probably
discover
that
people
like


he
when
he
smile
.
at
any
rate
Cody
ask
he
a
few
question
(
one
of


they
elicit
the
brand
new
name
)
and
find
that
he
be
quick
and


extravagantly
ambitious
.
a
few
day
later
he
take
he
to
Duluth
and


buy
he
a
blue
coat
,
six
pair
of
white
duck
trouser
,
and
a


yacht
cap
.
and
when
the
Tuolomee
leave
for
the
West
Indies
and
the


Barbary
Coast
,
Gatsby
leave
too
.




he
be
employ
in
a
vague
personal
capacity
—
while
he
remain
with


cody
he
be
in
turn
steward
,
mate
,
skipper
,
secretary
,
and
even


jailor
,
for
Dan
Cody
sober
know
what
lavish
doing
Dan
Cody
drunk


might
soon
be
about
,
and
he
provide
for
such
contingency
by


repose
more
and
more
trust
in
Gatsby
.
the
arrangement
last
five


year
,
during
which
the
boat
go
three
time
around
the
continent
.


it
might
have
last
indefinitely
except
for
the
fact
that
Ella
Kaye


come
on
board
one
night
in
Boston
and
a
week
later
Dan
Cody


inhospitably
die
.




I
remember
the
portrait
of
he
up
in
Gatsby
’s
bedroom
,
a
grey
,
florid


man
with
a
hard
,
empty
face
—
the
pioneer
debauchee
,
who
during
one


phase
of
american
life
bring
back
to
the
eastern
seaboard
the
savage


violence
of
the
frontier
brothel
and
saloon
.
it
be
indirectly
due
to


cody
that
Gatsby
drink
so
little
.
sometimes
in
the
course
of
gay


party
woman
use
to
rub
champagne
into
his
hair
;
for
himself
he


form
the
habit
of
let
liquor
alone
.




and
it
be
from
Cody
that
he
inherit
money
—
a
legacy
of
twenty
-
five


thousand
dollar
.
he
do
n’t
get
it
.
he
never
understand
the
legal


device
that
be
use
against
he
,
but
what
remain
of
the
million


go
intact
to
Ella
Kaye
.
he
be
leave
with
his
singularly
appropriate


education
;
the
vague
contour
of
Jay
Gatsby
have
fill
out
to
the


substantiality
of
a
man
.




------------------------------------------------------------------------




he
tell
I
all
this
very
much
later
,
but
I
’ve
put
it
down
here
with


the
idea
of
explode
those
first
wild
rumour
about
his
antecedent
,


which
be
n’t
even
faintly
true
.
moreover
he
tell
it
to
I
at
a
time


of
confusion
,
when
I
have
reach
the
point
of
believe
everything
and


nothing
about
he
.
so
I
take
advantage
of
this
short
halt
,
while


Gatsby
,
so
to
speak
,
catch
his
breath
,
to
clear
this
set
of


misconception
away
.




it
be
a
halt
,
too
,
in
my
association
with
his
affair
.
for
several


week
I
do
n’t
see
he
or
hear
his
voice
on
the
phone
—
mostly
I
be
in


New
York
,
trot
around
with
Jordan
and
try
to
ingratiate
myself


with
her
senile
aunt
—
but
finally
I
go
over
to
his
house
one
Sunday


afternoon
.
I
have
n’t
be
there
two
minute
when
somebody
bring
Tom


buchanan
in
for
a
drink
.
I
be
startled
,
naturally
,
but
the
really


surprising
thing
be
that
it
have
n’t
happen
before
.




they
be
a
party
of
three
on
horseback
—
Tom
and
a
man
name
Sloane
and


a
pretty
woman
in
a
brown
riding
-
habit
,
who
have
be
there
previously
.




"
I
’m
delighted
to
see
you
,
"
say
Gatsby
,
stand
on
his
porch
.
"

as
though

"

"

walk
around

room
quickly
,

bell
.
"
I
’ll
have
something
to
drink
for
you
in


just
a
minute
.
"




he
be
profoundly
affect
by
the
fact
that
Tom
be
there
.
but
he


would
be
uneasy
anyhow
until
he
have
give
they
something
,
realize
in


a
vague
way
that
that
be
all
they
come
for
.

Sloane

lounge
back


haughtily
in
his

unexpectedly
,

two

,
would


blot
out
those
five
year
of
unwavering
devotion
.




I
stay
late
that
night
.
Gatsby
ask
I
to
wait
until
he
be
free
,


and
I
linger
in
the
garden
until
the
inevitable
swimming
party
have


run
up
,
chill
and
exalt
,
from
the
black
beach
,
until
the
light


be
extinguish
in
the
guestroom
overhead
.
when
he
come
down
the


step
at
last
the
tan
skin
be
draw
unusually
tight
on
his
face
,


and
his
eye
be
bright
and
tired
.




"
she
do
n’t
like
it
,
"
he
say
immediately
.




"
of
course
she
do
.
"




"
she

he
insist
.
"
she
do
n’t
have
a
good
time
.
"




he
be
silent
,
and
I
guess
at
his
unutterable
depression
.




"
I
feel
far
away
from
she
,
"
he
say
.
"
it
’
hard
to
make
she


understand
.
"




"
you
mean
about
the
dance
?
"




"
the
dance
?
"
he
dismiss
all
the
dance
he
have
give
with
a
snap
of


his
finger
.
"
old
sport
,
the
dance
be
unimportant
.
"




he
want
nothing
less
of
Daisy
than
that
she
should
go
to
Tom
and


say
:
"
I
never
love
you
.
"
after
she
have
obliterate
four
year
with


that
sentence
they
could
decide
upon
the
more
practical
measure
to
be


take
.
one
of
they
be
that
,
after
she
be
free
,
they
be
to
go
back


to
Louisville
and
be
marry
from
her
house
—
just
as
if
it
be
five


year
ago
.




"
and
she
do
n’t
understand
,
"
he
say
.
"
she
use
to
be
able
to


understand
.
we
’d
sit
for
hour
—
"




he
break
off
and
begin
to
walk
up
and
down
a
desolate
path
of
fruit


rind
and
discard
favour
and
crush
flower
.




"
I
would
n’t
ask
too
much
of
she
,
"
I
venture
.
"
you
ca
n’t
repeat
the


past
.
"




"
ca
n’t
repeat
the
past
?
"
he
cry
incredulously
.
"
why
of
course
you


can
!
"




he
look
around
he
wildly
,
as
if
the
past
be
lurk
here
in
the


shadow
of
his
house
,
just
out
of
reach
of
his
hand
.




"
I
’m
go
to
fix
everything
just
the
way
it
be
before
,
"
he
say
,


nod
determinedly
.
"
she
’ll
see
.
"




he
talk
a
lot
about
the
past
,
and
I
gather
that
he
want
to


recover
something
,
some
idea
of
himself
perhaps
,
that
have
go
into


love
Daisy
.
his
life
have
be
confuse
and
disorder
since
then
,


but
if
he
could
once
return
to
a
certain
starting
place
and
go
over
it


all
slowly
,
he
could
find
out
what
that
thing
be
…




…
one
autumn
night
,
five
year
before
,
they
have
be
walk
down
the


street
when
the
leave
be
fall
,
and
they
come
to
a
place
where


there
be
no
tree
and
the
sidewalk
be
white
with
moonlight
.
they


stop
here
and
turn
toward
each
other
.
now
it
be
a
cool
night


with
that
mysterious
excitement
in
it
which
come
at
the
two
change


of
the
year
.
the
quiet
light
in
the
house
be
hum
out
into
the


darkness
and
there
be
a
stir
and
bustle
among
the
star
.
out
of
the


corner
of
his
eye
Gatsby
see
that
the
block
of
the
sidewalk
really


form
a
ladder
and
mount
to
a
secret
place
above
the
tree
—
he
could


climb
to
it
,
if
he
climb
alone
,
and
once
there
he
could
suck
on
the


pap
of
life
,
gulp
down
the
incomparable
milk
of
wonder
.




his
heart
beat
fast
as
Daisy
’s
white
face
come
up
to
his
own
.
he


know
that
when
he
kiss
this
girl
,
and
forever
we
d
his
unutterable


vision
to
her
perishable
breath
,
his
mind
would
never
romp
again
like


the
mind
of
God
.
so
he
wait
,
listen
for
a
moment
long
to
the


tuning
-
fork
that
have
be
strike
upon
a
star
.
then
he
kiss
she
.
at


his
lip
'
touch
she
blossom
for
he
like
a
flower
and
the


incarnation
be
complete
.




through
all
he
say
,
even
through
his
appalling
sentimentality
,
I
be


remind
of
something
—
an
elusive
rhythm
,
a
fragment
of
lose
word
,


that
I
have
hear
somewhere
a
long
time
ago
.
for
a
moment
a
phrase


try
to
take
shape
in
my
mouth
and
my
lip
part
like
a
dumb
man
’s
,


as
though
there
be
more
struggling
upon
they
than
a
wisp
of
startled


air
.
but
they
make
no
sound
,
and
what
I
have
almost
remember
be


uncommunicable
forever
.






                                 
VII




it
be
when
curiosity
about
Gatsby
be
at
its
high
that
the
light


in
his
house
fail
to
go
on
one
Saturday
night
—
and
,
as
obscurely
as


it
have
begin
,
his
career
as
Trimalchio
be
over
.
only
gradually
do
I


become
aware
that
the
automobile
which
turn
expectantly
into
his


drive
stay
for
just
a
minute
and
then
drive
sulkily
away
.
wonder


if
he
be
sick
I
go
over
to
find
out
—
an
unfamiliar
butler
with
a


villainous
face
squint
at
I
suspiciously
from
the
door
.




"
be
Mr.
Gatsby
sick
?
"




"
nope
.
"
after
a
pause
he
add
"
sir
"
in
a
dilatory
,
grudging
way
.




"
I
have
n’t
see
he
around
,
and
I
be
rather
worried
.
tell
he
Mr.


Carraway
come
over
.
"




"
who
?

he
demand
rudely
.




"
Carraway
.
"




"
carraway
.
all
right
,
I
’ll
tell
he
.
"




abruptly
he
slam
the
door
.




my
Finn
inform
I
that
Gatsby
have
dismiss
every
servant
in
his


house
a
week
ago
and
replace
they
with
half
a
dozen
other
,
who
never


go
into
West
Egg
village
to
be
bribe
by
the
tradesman
,
but
order


moderate
supply
over
the
telephone
.
the
grocery
boy
report
that


the
kitchen
look
like
a
pigsty
,
and
the
general
opinion
in
the


village
be
that
the
new
people
be
n’t
servant
at
all
.




next
day
Gatsby
call
I
on
the
phone
.




"
go
away
?
"
I
inquire
.




"
no
,
old
sport
.
"




"
I
hear
you
fire
all
your

"
I

often

the
afternoon
.
"




so
the
whole
caravansary
have
fall
in
like
a
card

the


disapproval
in
her
eye
.




"

Miss
Baker

an
hour
later

seem
relieved
to
find
that
I
be


come

something
be
up
.
and
yet
I
could
n’t
believe
that
they
would


choose
this
occasion
for
a
scene
—
especially
for
the
rather
harrowing


scene
that
Gatsby
have
outline
in
the
garden
.




the
next
day
be
broil
,
almost
the
last
,
certainly
the
warm
,
of


the
summer
.
as
my
train
emerge
from
the
tunnel
into
sunlight
,
only


the
hot
whistle
of
the
National
Biscuit
Company
break
the
simmer


hush
at
noon
.
the
straw
seat
of
the
car
hover
on
the
edge
of


combustion
;

woman
next
to

perspire
delicately
for
a
while
into


her
white
shirtwaist
,
and
then
,
as
her
newspaper
dampen
under
she


finger
,
lapse
despairingly
into
deep
heat
with
a
desolate
cry

pick
it
up
with
a
weary
bend
and
hand
it
back
to
she
,
hold
it


at
arm
’s
length
and
by
the
extreme
tip
of
the
corner
to
indicate
that


I
have
no
design
upon
it
—
but
everyone
near
by
,

the
woman

o’clock

as
remote
from

I
as
the
foreign
clamour
on


the
sidewalk

the
tumult
of
the
elevated
overhead
.
human
sympathy


have
its
limit

we
be
content
to
let
all
their
tragic
argument


fade
with
the
city
light
behind
.
thirty
—
the
promise
of
a
decade
of


loneliness
,
a
thinning
list
of
single
man
to
know
,
a
thinning


briefcase
of
enthusiasm
,
thin
hair
.
but
there
be
Jordan
beside


I
,
who
,
unlike
Daisy

be
too
wise
ever
to
carry
well
-
forget


dream
from
age
to
age
.
as
we
pass
over
the
dark
bridge
her
wan
face


fall
lazily
against
my
coat
’s
shoulder
and
the
formidable
stroke
of


thirty
die
away
with
the
reassuring
pressure
of
her
hand

through

five

really
sick

pale


as
his

pale

shake
all
over

Michaelis
advise
he
to
go

refuse

that

astonish

for
four
year

Wilson
have
never
seem
faintly
capable
of
such
a
statement
.


generally
he
be
one
of
these
worn
-
out
man
:
when
he
be
n’t
work
,
he


sit
on
a
chair
in
the
doorway
and
stare
at
the
people
and
the
car


that
pass
along
the
road
.
when
anyone
speak
to
he
he
invariably


laugh
in
an
agreeable
,
colourless
way
.
he
be
his
wife
’s
man
and
not


his
own

so
naturally
Michaelis
try
to
find
out
what
have
happen
,

Wilson


would
n’t
say
a
word

instead
he
begin
to
throw
curious
,
suspicious


glance
at
his
visitor
and
ask
he
what
he
’d
be
do
at
certain


time
on
certain
day
.
just
as
the

be
get
uneasy
,

workman
come
past
the
door
bind
for
his
restaurant
,
and
Michaelis


take
the
opportunity
to
get
away
,
intend
to
come
back
later
.
but
he


do

again

of
the

he

Mrs.

voice

loud
and
scold

downstairs
in


the
garage

a
moment
later
she
rush
out
into
the
dusk
,
wave
her
hand
and


shout
—
before
he

move
from
his
door

over

the
gathering
darkness

tragically
for
a
moment

around
the
next
bend

mavro
Michaelis
be

I

aware
now

wail
sound

issue
incessantly


from
the

a
sound

as
we
get
out
of

and
walk


toward
the

resolve
itself
into
the
word
"

over

up
on

peer
over
a
circle
of
head
into
the


garage
,

be
light
only
by
a
yellow
light
in
a
swinge
metal


basket
overhead

then
he
make
a
harsh
sound
in
his
throat
,

with
a


violent
thrusting
movement
of
his
powerful
arm
push
his
way


through
.




the
circle
close
up
again
with
a
run
murmur
of
expostulation
;
it


be
a
minute
before
I
could
see
anything

another

first
I


could

the
source
of
the
high

groan
word
that
echo


clamorously
through

bare
garage

drop
slowly


from

the
wall
,

then
jerk


back
to
the
light
again
,

he
give
out
incessantly

horrible

look
at

bright


window
downstairs

the

from

lawn

the
gravel


softly
,

tiptoe
up
the
veranda
step
.
the
drawing
-
room
curtain


be
open
,
and
I
see
that
the
room
be
empty
.
cross
the
porch
where


we
have
dine
that
June
night
three
month
before
,
I
come
to
a
small


rectangle
of
light
which
I
guess
be
the
pantry
window
.
the
blind


be
draw
,
but
I
find
a
rift
at
the
sill
.




Daisy
and
Tom
be
sit
opposite
each
other
at
the
kitchen
table
,


with
a
plate
of
cold
fry
chicken
between
they
,
and
two
bottle
of


ale
.
he
be
talk
intently
across
the
table
at
she
,
and
in
his


earnestness
his
hand
have
fall
upon
and
cover
her
own
.
once
in
a


while
she
look
up
at
he
and
nod
in
agreement
.




they
be
n’t
happy
,
and
neither
of
they
have
touch
the
chicken
or
the


ale
—
and
yet
they
be
n’t
unhappy
either
.
there
be
an
unmistakable
air


of
natural
intimacy
about
the
picture
,
and
anybody
would
have
say


that
they
be
conspire
together
.




as
I
tiptoe
from
the
porch
I
hear
my
taxi
feel
its
way
along
the


dark
road
toward
the
house
.

be
wait
where
I
have
leave
he
in


the
drive
.




"
be
it
all
quiet
up
there
?

he
ask
anxiously
.




"

all
quiet

I
hesitate
.
"
you
’d
well
come
home
and
get


some
sleep
.

he
shake
his
head
.




"
I
want
to
wait
here
till
Daisy
go
to
bed
.
good
night
,
old
sport
.
"




he
put
his
hand
in
his
coat
pocket
and
turn
back
eagerly
to
his


scrutiny
of
the
house
,
as
though
my
presence
mar
the
sacredness
of


the
vigil
.
so
I
walk
away
and
leave
he
stand
there
in
the


moonlight
—
watch
over
nothing
.

I
could
n’t
sleep
all
night
;
a
foghorn
be
groan
incessantly
on
the


sound
,
and
I
toss
half
-
sick
between
grotesque
reality
and
savage
,


frightening
dream
.
toward
dawn
I
hear
a
taxi
go
up
Gatsby
’s
drive
,


and
immediately
I
jump
out
of
bed
and
begin
to
dress
—
I
feel
that
I


have
something
to
tell
he
,
something
to
warn
he
about
,
and
morning


would
be
too
late
.




cross
his
lawn
,
I
see
that
his
front
door
be
still
open
and
he
be


lean
against
a
table
in
the
hall
,
heavy
with
dejection
or
sleep
.




"
nothing
happen
,
"
he
say
wanly
.
"
I
wait
,
and
about
four
o’clock


she
come
to
the
window
and
stand
there
for
a
minute
and
then
turn


out
the
light
.
"




his
house
have
never
seem
so
enormous
to
I
as
it
do
that
night
when


we
hunt
through
the
great
room
for
cigarette
.
we
push
aside


curtain
that
be
like
pavilion
,
and
feel
over
innumerable
foot
of


dark
wall
for
electric
light
switch
—
once
I
tumble
with
a
sort
of


splash
upon
the
key
of
a
ghostly
piano
.
there
be
an
inexplicable


amount
of
dust
everywhere
,
and
the
room
be
musty
,
as
though
they


have
n’t
be
air
for
many
day
.
I
find
the
humidor
on
an
unfamiliar


table
,
with
two
stale
,
dry
cigarette
inside
.
throw
open
the
french


window
of
the
drawing
-
room
,
we
sit
smoke
out
into
the
darkness
.




"
you
ought
to
go
away
,
"
I
say
.
"
it
’
pretty
certain
they

trace


your
car

away
now

"
go
to
Atlantic
City
for
a
week
,
or
up
to
Montreal
.
"




he
would
n’t
consider
it
.
he
could
n’t
possibly
leave
Daisy
until
he


know
what
she
be
go
to
do
.
he
be
clutch
at
some
last
hope
and


I
could
n’t
bear
to
shake
he
free
.




it
be
this
night
that
he
tell
I
the
strange
story
of
his
youth
with


Dan
Cody
—
tell
it
to
I
because
"
Jay
Gatsby
"
have
break
up
like
glass


against
Tom
’s
hard
malice
,
and
the
long
secret
extravaganza
be
play


out
.
I
think
that
he
would
have
acknowledge
anything
now
,
without


reserve
,
but
he
want
to
talk
about
Daisy
.




she
be
the
first
"
nice
"
girl
he
have
ever
know
.
in
various
unreveale


capacity
he
have
come
in
contact
with
such
people
,
but
always
with


indiscernible
barbed
wire
between
.
he
find
she
excitingly


desirable
.
he
go
to
her
house
,
at
first
with
other
officer
from


Camp
Taylor
,
then
alone
.
it
amaze
he
—
he
have
never
be
in
such
a


beautiful
house
before
.
but
what
give
it
an
air
of
breathless


intensity
,
be
that
Daisy
live
there
—
it
be
as
casual
a
thing
to
she


as
his
tent
out
at
camp
be
to
he
.
there
be
a
ripe
mystery
about
it
,


a
hint
of
bedroom
upstairs
more
beautiful
and
cool
than
other


bedroom
,
of
gay
and
radiant
activity
take
place
through
its


corridor
,
and
of
romance
that
be
not
musty
and
lay
away
already


in
lavender
but
fresh
and
breathing
and
redolent
of
this
year
’s


shine
motorcar
and
of
dance
whose
flower
be
scarcely


wither
.
it
excite
he
,
too
,
that
many
man
have
already
love


Daisy
—
it
increase
her
value
in
his
eye
.
he
feel
their
presence
all


about
the
house
,
pervade
the
air
with
the
shade
and
echo
of
still


vibrant
emotion
.




but
he
know
that
he
be
in
Daisy
’s
house
by
a
colossal


accident
.
however
glorious
might
be
his
future
as
Jay
Gatsby
,
he
be


at
present
a
penniless
young
man
without
a
past
,
and
at
any
moment
the


invisible
cloak
of
his
uniform
might
slip
from
his
shoulder
.
so
he


make
the
most
of
his
time
.
he
take
what
he
could
get
,
ravenously
and


unscrupulously
—
eventually
he
take
Daisy
one
still
October
night
,
take


she
because
he
have
no
real
right
to
touch
her
hand
.




he
might
have
despise
himself
,
for
he
have
certainly
take
she
under


false
pretence
.
I
do
n’t
mean
that
he
have
trade
on
his
phantom


million
,
but
he
have
deliberately
give
Daisy
a
sense
of
security
;
he


let
she
believe
that
he
be
a
person
from
much
the
same
strata
as


herself
—
that
he
be
fully
able
to
take
care
of
she
.
as
a
matter
of


fact
,
he
have
no
such
facility
—
he
have
no
comfortable
family
standing


behind
he
,
and
he
be
liable
at
the
whim
of
an
impersonal
government


to
be
blow
anywhere
about
the
world
.




but
he
do
n’t
despise
himself
and
it
do
n’t
turn
out
as
he
have


imagine
.
he
have
intend
,
probably
,
to
take
what
he
could
and
go
—
but


now
he
find
that
he
have
commit
himself
to

irresistible
journey
to


Louisville
on
the
last
of
his
army
pay
.
he
stay
there
a

footstep
have
click
together
through

always


seem
to
he
more
mysterious

gay

melancholy
beauty

out
into
the
spring
field
,

a
yellow


trolley
race
they
for
a
minute
with
people
in
it
who
might
once
have

the
pale
magic

along

itself
in
benediction
over
the
vanishing


city

her
breath

stretch
out
his

desperately

house
make
she
hard

abruptly
we

I


lean

noon

when
I
pass
the
ash

heap
on
the
train
that
morning
I
have
cross


deliberately
to
the
other
side
of
the
car
.
I
suppose
there
’d
be
a


curious
crowd
around
there
all
day
with
little
boy
search
for
dark


spot
in
the
dust
,
and
some
garrulous
man
tell
over
and
over
what


have
happen
,
until
it
become
less
and
less
real
even
to
he
and
he


could
tell
it
no
long
,
and
Myrtle
Wilson
’s
tragic
achievement
be


forget
.
now
I
want
to
go
back
a
little
and
tell
what
happen
at


the
garage
after
we
leave
there
the
night
before
.




they
have
difficulty
in
locate
the
sister
,
Catherine
.
she
must
have


break
her
rule
against
drinking
that
night
,
for
when
she
arrive
she


be
stupid
with
liquor
and
unable
to
understand
that
the
ambulance
have


already
go
to
Flushing
.
when
they
convince
she
of
this
,
she


immediately
faint
,
as
if
that
be
the
intolerable
part
of
the


affair
.
someone
,
kind
or
curious
,
take
she
in
his
car
and
drive
she
in


the
wake
of
her
sister
’s
body
.




until
long
after
midnight
a
change
crowd
lap
up
against
the
front


of
the
garage
,
while
George
Wilson
rock
himself
back
and
forth
on


the
couch
inside
.
for
a
while
the
door
of
the
office
be
open
,
and


everyone
who
come
into
the
garage
glance
irresistibly
through
it
.


finally
someone
say
it
be
a
shame
,
and
close
the
door
.
Michaelis


and
several
other

five

still
later
Michaelis
have
to
ask
the
last
stranger


to
wait
there
fifteen
minute
long
,
while
he
go
back
to
his
own


place
and
make
a
pot
of
coffee
.
after
that
,
he
stay
there
alone
with


Wilson
until
dawn
.




about
three
o’clock
the
quality
of
Wilson
’s
incoherent
muttering


change
—
he
grow
quieter
and
begin
to
talk
about
the
yellow
car
.
he


announce
that
he
have
a
way
of
find
out
whom
the
yellow
car


belong
to
,
and
then
he
blurt
out
that
a
couple
of
month
ago

wife
have
come
from
the
city
with
her
face
bruise
and
her
nose


swell
.




but
when
he
hear
himself
say
this
,
he
flinch
and
begin
to
cry
"
oh
,


my
God
!
"
again
in
his
groan
voice
.
Michaelis
make
a
clumsy
attempt


to
distract
he
.




"

whenever
Michaelis

a
car

along
the
road
outside

a


car
stop
outside
.
it
be
one
of
the
watcher
of
the
night
before


who
have
promise
to
come
back
,
so
he
cook
breakfast
for
three
,
which


he
and
the
other
man
eat
together
.
Wilson
be
quieter
now
,
and


Michaelis
go
home
to
sleep
;
when
he
awake
four
hour
later
and


hurry
back
to
the
garage
,
Wilson
be
go
.




his
movement
—
he
be
on
foot
all
the
time
—
be
afterward
trace
to


Port
Roosevelt
and
then
to
Gad
’s
Hill
,
where
he
buy
a
sandwich
that


he
do
n’t
eat
,
and
a
cup
of
coffee
.
he
must
have
be
tired
and


walk
slowly
,
for
he
do
n’t
reach
Gad
’s
Hill
until
noon
.
thus
far


there
be
no
difficulty
in
account
for
his
time
—
there
be
boy
who


have
see
a
man
"
acting
sort
of
crazy
,
"
and
motorist
at
whom
he
stare


oddly
from
the
side
of
the
road
.
then
for
three
hour
he
disappear


from
view
.
the
police
,
on
the
strength
of
what
he
say
to
Michaelis
,


that
he
"
have
a
way
of
find
out
,
"
suppose
that
he
spend
that
time


go
from
garage
to
garage
thereabout
,
inquire
for
a
yellow
car
.
on


the
other
hand
,
no
garage
man
who
have
see
he
ever
come
forward
,
and


perhaps
he
have
an
easy
,
surer
way
of
find
out
what
he
want
to


know
.
by
half
-
past
two
he
be
in
West
Egg
,
where
he
ask
someone
the


way
to
Gatsby
’s
house
.
so
by
that
time
he
know
Gatsby
’s
name
.




------------------------------------------------------------------------




at
two
o’clock
Gatsby
put
on
his
bathing
-
suit
and
leave
word
with
the


butler
that
if
anyone
phone
word
be
to
be
bring
to
he
at
the


pool
.
he
stop
at
the
garage
for
a
pneumatic
mattress
that
have


amuse
his
guest
during
the
summer
,
and
the
chauffeur
help
he
to


pump
it
up
.
then
he
give
instruction
that
the
open
car
be
n’t
to
be


take
out
under
any
circumstance
—
and
this
be
strange
,
because
the


front
right
fender
need
repair
.




Gatsby
shoulder
the
mattress
and
start
for
the
pool
.
once
he


stop
and
shift
it
a
little
,
and
the
chauffeur
ask
he
if
he


need
help
,
but
he
shake
his
head
and
in
a
moment
disappear
among


the
yellowing
tree
.




no
telephone
message
arrive
,
but
the
butler
go
without
his
sleep


and
wait
for
it
until
four
o’clock
—
until
long
after
there
be
anyone


to
give
it
to
if
it
come
.
I
have
an
idea
that
Gatsby
himself
do
n’t


believe
it
would
come
,
and
perhaps
he
no
long
care
.
if
that
be


true
he
must
have
feel
that
he
have
lose
the
old
warm
world
,
pay
a


high
price
for
live
too
long
with
a
single
dream
.
he
must
have


look
up
at
an
unfamiliar
sky
through
frightening
leave
and
shiver


as
he
find
what
a
grotesque
thing
a
rose
be
and
how
raw
the
sunlight


be
upon
the
scarcely
create
grass
.
a
new
world
,
material
without


be
real
,
where
poor
ghost
,
breathe
dream
like
air
,
drift


fortuitously
about
…
like
that
ashen
,
fantastic
figure
glide
toward


he
through
the
amorphous
tree
.




the
chauffeur
—
he
be
one
of
Wolfshiem
’s
protégés
—
hear
the


shot
—
afterwards
he
could
only
say
that
he
have
n’t
think
anything


much
about
they
.
I
drive
from
the
station
directly
to
Gatsby
’s
house


and
my
rush
anxiously
up
the
front
step
be
the
first
thing
that


alarm
anyone
.
but
they
know
then
,
I
firmly
believe
.
with
scarcely
a


word
say
,
four
of
we
,
the
chauffeur
,
butler
,
gardener
,
and
I
hurry


down
to
the
pool
.




there
be
a
faint
,
barely
perceptible
movement
of
the
water
as
the


fresh
flow
from
one
end
urge
its
way
toward
the
drain
at
the
other
.


with
little
ripple
that
be
hardly
the
shadow
of
wave
,
the
laden


mattress
move
irregularly
down
the
pool
.
a
small
gust
of
wind
that


scarcely
corrugate
the
surface
be
enough
to
disturb
its
accidental


course
with
its
accidental
burden
.
the
touch
of
a
cluster
of
leave


revolve
it
slowly
,
trace
,
like
the
leg
of
transit
,
a
thin
red


circle
in
the
water
.




it
be
after
we
start
with
Gatsby
toward
the
house
that
the
gardener


see
Wilson
’s
body
a
little
way
off
in
the
grass
,
and
the
holocaust
be


complete
.






                                  
ix




after
two
year
I
remember
the
rest
of
that
day
,
and
that
night
and


the
next
day
,
only
as
an
endless
drill
of
police
and
photographer
and


newspaper
man
in
and
out
of
Gatsby
’s
front
door
.
a
rope
stretch


across
the
main
gate
and
a
policeman
by
it
keep
out
the
curious
,
but


little
boy
soon
discover
that
they
could
enter
through
my
yard
,
and


there
be
always
a
few
of
they
cluster
open
-
mouthed
about
the


pool
.
someone
with
a
positive
manner
,
perhaps
a
detective
,
use
the


expression
"
madman
"
as
he
bend
over
Wilson
’s
body
that
afternoon
,
and


the
adventitious
authority
of
his
voice
set
the
key
for
the
newspaper


report
next
morning
.




Most
of
those
report
be
a
nightmare
—
grotesque
,
circumstantial
,


eager
,
and
untrue
.
when
Michaelis
’s
testimony
at
the
inquest
bring


to
light
Wilson
’s
suspicion
of
his
wife
I
think
the
whole
tale


would
shortly
be
serve
up
in
racy
pasquinade
—
but
Catherine
,
who
might


have
say
anything
,
do
n’t
say
a
word
.
she
show
a
surprising
amount


of
character
about
it
too
—
look
at
the
coroner
with
determined
eye


under
that
correct
brow
of
hers
,
and
swear
that
her
sister
have
never


see
Gatsby
,
that
her
sister
be
completely
happy
with
her
husband
,


that
her
sister
have
be
into
no
mischief
whatever
.
she
convince


herself
of
it
,
and
cry
into
her
handkerchief
,
as
if
the
very


suggestion
be
more
than
she
could
endure
.
so
Wilson
be
reduce
to
a


man
"
derange
by
grief
"
in
order
that
the
case
might
remain
in
its


simple
form
.
and
it
rest
there
.




but
all
this
part
of
it
seem
remote
and
unessential
.
I
find
myself


on
Gatsby
’s
side
,
and
alone
.
from
the
moment
I
telephone
news
of
the


catastrophe
to
West
Egg
village
,
every
surmise
about
he
,
and
every


practical
question
,
be
refer
to
I
.
at
first
I
be
surprised
and


confused
;
then
,
as
he
lie
in
his
house
and
do
n’t
move
or
breathe
or


speak
,
hour
upon
hour
,
it
grow
upon
I
that
I
be
responsible
,
because


no
one
else
be
interested
—
interested
,
I
mean
,
with
that
intense


personal
interest
to
which
everyone
have
some
vague
right
at
the
end
.




I
call
up
Daisy
half
an
hour
after
we
find
he
,
call
she


instinctively
and
without
hesitation
.
but
she
and
Tom
have
go
away


early
that
afternoon
,
and
take
baggage

he
:

Meyer
Wolfshiem
’s

in
the
phone
book
.
the
butler
give
I


his
office
address
on
Broadway
,

I
call
information
,

by
the

the

suddenly

,
though
they
draw
back
the
sheet
and
look
at
Gatsby
with


shock
eye
,

protest

in

"




someone
start
to
ask
I
question
,
but
I
break
away
and
go


upstairs
look
hastily
through
the
unlocked
part
of
his
desk
—
he’d


never
tell
I
definitely
that
his
parent
be
dead
.
but
there
be


nothing
—
only
the
picture
of
Dan
Cody
,
a
token
of
forget
violence
,


stare
down
from
the
wall
.




next
morning
I
send
the
butler
to
New
York
with
a
letter
to
Wolfshiem
,


which
ask
for
information
and
urge
he
to
come
out
on
the
next


train
.
that
request
seem
superfluous
when
I
write
it
.
I
be
sure


he
’d
start
when
he
see
the
newspaper
,
just
as
I
be
sure
there
’d
be
a


wire
from
Daisy
before
noon
—
but
neither
a
wire
nor
Mr.
Wolfshiem


arrive
;
no
one
arrive
except
more
police
and
photographer
and


newspaper
man
.
when
the
butler
bring
back
Wolfshiem
’s
answer
I
begin


to
have
a
feeling
of
defiance
,
of
scornful
solidarity
between
Gatsby


and
I
against
they
all
.




 
Dear
Mr.
Carraway
.
this
have
be
one
of
the
most
terrible
shock
of


 
my
life
to
I
I
hardly
can
believe
it
that
it
be
true
at
all
.
such
a


 
mad
act
as
that
man
do
should
make
we
all
think
.
I
can
not
come
down


 
now
as
I
be
tie
up
in
some
very
important
business
and
can
not
get


 
mix
up
in
this
thing
now
.
if
there
be
anything
I
can
do
a
little


 
later
let
I
know
in
a
letter
by
Edgar
.
I
hardly
know
where
I
be
when


 
I
hear
about
a
thing
like
this
and
be
completely
knock
down
and


 
out
.




                               
Yours
truly




                             
Meyer

and
then
hasty
addenda
beneath
:




 
let
I
know
about
the
funeral
etc
do
not
know
his
family
at
all
.




when
the
phone
ring
that
afternoon
and
Long
Distance
say
Chicago
be


call
I
think
this
would
be
Daisy
at
last
.
but
the
connection
come


through
as
a
man
’s
voice
,
very
thin
and

old

up
in
a

cheap
ulster
against

warm
September

his

leak
continuously
with
excitement
,

when
I
take
the

he
begin
to

so
incessantly

difficulty
in

up

down

out

eagerly

and
then
seek
admiration
from
my
eye
.
he
have
show
it
so


often
that
I
think
it
be
more
real
to
he
now
than
the

itself

a

before

to

out

do


Gatsby
’s
father

as
the
time
pass

the

come
in

stand
wait
in

hall

to
blink
anxiously
,

speak
of
the

in
a
worried
,
uncertain
way
.
the
minister
glance


several
time
at
his
watch
,
so
I
take
he
aside

ask
he
to
wait


for
half
an
hour

it

any

nobody

------------------------------------------------------------------------




about
five
o’clock
our
procession
of
three
car
reach
the
cemetery


and
stop
in
a
thick
drizzle
beside
the
gate
—
first
a
motor
hearse
,


horribly
black
and
wet
,
then
Mr.
Gatz
and
the
minister
and
I
in
the


limousine
,
and
a
little
later
four
or
five
servant
and
the
postman


from
West
Egg
,
in
Gatsby
’s
station
wagon
,
all
wet
to
the
skin
.
as
we


start
through
the
gate
into
the
cemetery
I
hear
a
car
stop
and
then


the
sound
of
someone
splash
after
we
over
the
soggy
ground
.
I


look
around
.
it
be
the
man
with
owl
-
eyed
glass
whom
I
have
find


marvel
over
Gatsby
’s
book
in
the
library
one
night
three
month


before
.




I
’d
never
see
he
since
then
.
I
do
n’t
know
how
he
know
about
the


funeral
,
or
even
his
name
.
the
rain
pour
down
his
thick
glass
,
and


he
take
they
off
and
wipe
they
to
see
the
protect
canvas
unrolled


from
Gatsby
’s
grave
.




I
try
to
think
about
Gatsby
then
for
a
moment
,
but
he
be
already


too
far
away
,
and
I
could
only
remember
,
without
resentment
,
that


Daisy
have
n’t
send
a
message
or
a
flower
.
dimly
I
hear
someone
murmur


"
bless
be
the
dead
that
the
rain
fall
on
,
"
and
then
the
owl
-
eye


man
say
"
amen
to
that
,
"
in
a
brave
voice
.




we
straggle
down
quickly
through
the
rain
to
the
car
.
owl
-
eye
speak


to
I
by
the
gate
.




"
I
could
n’t
get
to
the
house
,
"
he
remark
.




"
neither
could
anybody
else
.
"




"
go
on
!
"
he
start
.
"
why
,
my
God
!
they
use
to
go
there
by
the


hundred
.
"




he
take
off
his
glass
and
wipe
they
again
,
outside
and
in
.




"
the
poor
son
-
of

a
-
bitch
,
"
he
say
.




------------------------------------------------------------------------




one
of
my
most
vivid
memory
be
of
come
back
West
from
prep
school


and
later
from
college
at
Christmas
time
.
those
who
go
far
than


Chicago
would
gather
in
the
old
dim
Union
Station
at
six
o’clock
of
a


December
evening
,
with
a
few
Chicago
friend
,
already
catch
up
into


their
own
holiday
gaiety
,
to
bid
they
a
hasty
goodbye
.
I
remember


the
fur
coat
of
the
girl
return
from
Miss
This
-
or
-
that
’s
and
the


chatter
of
frozen
breath
and
the
hand
wave
overhead
as
we
catch


sight
of
old
acquaintance
,
and
the
matching
of
invitation
:
"
be
you


go
to
the
ordway
'
?
the
hersey
'
?
the
Schultzes
'
?
"
and
the
long


green
ticket
clasp
tight
in
our
gloved
hand
.
and
last
the
murky


yellow
car
of
the
Chicago
,
Milwaukee
and
St.
Paul
railroad
look


cheerful
as
Christmas
itself
on
the
track
beside
the
gate
.




when
we
pull
out
into
the
winter
night
and
the
real
snow
,
our
snow
,


begin
to
stretch
out
beside
we
and
twinkle
against
the
window
,
and


the
dim
light
of
small
Wisconsin
station
move
by
,
a
sharp
wild


brace
come
suddenly
into
the
air
.
we
draw
in
deep
breath
of
it
as
we


walk
back
from
dinner
through
the
cold
vestibule
,
unutterably
aware


of
our
identity
with
this
country
for
one
strange
hour
,
before
we


melt
indistinguishably
into
it
again
.




that
’
my
Middle
West
—
not
the
wheat
or
the
prairie
or
the
lost
swede


town
,
but
the
thrilling
return
train
of
my
youth
,
and
the
street


lamp
and
sleigh
bell
in
the
frosty
dark
and
the
shadow
of
holly


wreath
throw
by
light
window
on
the
snow
.
I
be
part
of
that
,
a


little
solemn
with
the
feel
of
those
long
winter
,
a
little
complacent


from
grow
up
in
the
Carraway
house
in
a
city
where
dwelling
be


still
call
through
decade
by
a
family
’s
name
.
I
see
now
that
this


have
be
a
story
of
the
West
,
after
all
—
Tom
and
Gatsby
,
Daisy
and


Jordan
and
I
,
be
all
Westerners
,
and
perhaps
we
possess
some


deficiency
in
common
which
make
we
subtly
unadaptable
to
eastern
life
.




even
when
the
East
excite
I
most
,
even
when
I
be
most
keenly
aware


of
its
superiority
to
the
bored
,
sprawling
,
swollen
town
beyond
the


Ohio
,
with
their
interminable
inquisition
which
spare
only
the


child
and
the
very
old
—
even
then
it
have
always
for
I
a
quality
of


distortion
.
West
Egg
,
especially
,
still
figure
in
my
more
fantastic


dream
.
I
see
it
as
a
night
scene
by
El
Greco
:
a
hundred
house
,
at


once
conventional
and
grotesque
,
crouch
under
a
sullen
,
overhang


sky
and
a
lustreless
moon
.
in
the
foreground
four
solemn
man
in
dress


suit
be
walk
along
the
sidewalk
with
a
stretcher
on
which
lie
a


drunken
woman
in
a
white
evening
dress
.
her
hand
,
which
dangle
over


the
side
,
sparkle
cold
with
jewel
.
gravely
the
man
turn
in
at
a


house
—
the
wrong
house
.
but
no
one
know
the
woman
’s
name
,
and
no
one


care
.




after
Gatsby
’s
death
the
East
be
haunt
for
I
like
that
,
distort


beyond
my
eye
’
power
of
correction
.
so
when
the
blue
smoke
of
brittle


leave
be
in
the
air
and
the
wind
blow
the
wet
laundry
stiff
on
the


line
I
decide
to
come
back
home
.




there
be
one
thing
to
be
do
before
I
leave
,
an
awkward
,
unpleasant


thing
that
perhaps
have
well
have
be
let
alone
.
but
I
want
to


leave
thing
in
order
and
not
just
trust
that
obliging
and
indifferent


sea
to
sweep
my
refuse
away
.
I
see
Jordan
Baker
and
talk
over
and


around
what
have
happen
to
we
together
,
and
what
have
happen


afterward
to
I
,
and
she
lie
perfectly
still
,
listen
,
in
a
big


chair
.




she
be
dressed
to
play
golf
,
and
I
remember
think
she
look
like


a
good
illustration
,
her
chin
raise
a
little
jauntily
,
her
hair
the


colour
of
an
autumn
leaf
,
her
face
the
same
brown
tint
as
the


fingerless
glove
on
her
knee
.
when
I
have
finish
she
tell
I
without


comment
that
she
be
engage
to
another
man
.
I
doubt
that
,
though


there
be
several
she
could
have
marry
at
a
nod
of
her
head
,
but
I


pretend
to
be
surprised
.
for
just
a
minute
I
wonder
if
I
be
n’t


make
a
mistake
,
then
I
think
it
all
over
again
quickly
and
get
up


to
say
goodbye
.




"
nevertheless
you
do
throw
I
over
,
"
say
Jordan
suddenly
.
"
you
throw


I
over
on
the
telephone
.
I
do
n’t
give
a
damn
about
you
now
,
but
it


be
a
new
experience
for
I
,
and
I
feel
a
little
dizzy
for
a
while
.
"




we
shake
hand
.




"
oh
,
and
do
you
remember”—she
added—“a
conversation
we
have
once
about


drive
a
car
?
"




"
why
—
not
exactly
.
"




"
you
say
a
bad
driver
be
only
safe
until
she
meet
another
bad
driver
?


well
,
I
meet
another
bad
driver
,
do
n’t
I
?
I
mean
it
be
careless
of
I


to
make
such
a
wrong
guess
.
I
think
you
be
rather
an
honest
,


straightforward
person
.
I
think
it
be
your
secret
pride
.
"




"
I
’m
thirty
,
"
I
say
.
"
I
’m
five
year
too
old
to
lie
to
myself
and


call
it
honour
.
"




she
do
n’t
answer
.
angry
,
and
half
in
love
with
she
,
and
tremendously


sorry
,
I
turn
away
.




------------------------------------------------------------------------




one
afternoon
late
in
October
I
see
Tom
Buchanan
.
he
be
walk
ahead


of
I
along
Fifth
Avenue
in
his
alert
,
aggressive
way
,
his
hand
out
a


little
from
his
body
as
if
to
fight
off
interference
,
his
head
move


sharply
here
and
there
,
adapt
itself
to
his
restless
eye
.
just
as


I
slow
up
to
avoid
overtake
he
he
stop
and
begin
frown
into


the
window
of
a
jewellery
store
.
suddenly
he
see
I
and
walk
back
,


hold
out
his
hand
.




"
what
’
the
matter
,
Nick
?
do
you
object
to
shake
hand
with
I
?
"




"
yes
.
you
know
what
I
think
of
you
.
"




"
you
’re
crazy
,
Nick
,
"
he
say
quickly
.
"
Crazy
as
hell
.
I
do
n’t
know


what
’
the
matter
with
you
.
"




"
Tom
,
"
I
inquire
,
"
what
do
you
say
to
Wilson
that
afternoon
?
"




he
stare
at
I
without
a
word
,
and
I
know
I
have
guess
right
about


those
miss
hour
.
I
start
to
turn
away
,
but
he
take
a
step
after


I
and
grab
my
arm
.




"
I
tell
he
the
truth
,
"
he
say
.
"
he
come
to
the
door
while
we
be


get
ready
to
leave
,
and
when
I
send
down
word
that
we
be
n’t
in


he
try
to
force
his
way
upstairs
.
he
be
crazy
enough
to
kill
I
if


I
have
n’t
tell
he
who
own
the
car
.
his
hand
be
on
a
revolver
in
his


pocket
every
minute
he
be
in
the
house
—
"
he
break
off
defiantly
.


"
what
if
I
do
tell
he
?
that
fellow
have
it
come
to
he
.
he
throw


dust
into
your
eye
just
like
he
do
in
Daisy
’s
,
but
he
be
a
tough


one
.
he
run
over
Myrtle
like
you
’d
run
over
a
dog
and
never
even


stop
his
car
.
"




there
be
nothing
I
could
say
,
except
the
one
unutterable
fact
that
it


be
n’t
true
.




"
and
if
you
think
I
do
n’t
have
my
share
of
suffering
—
look
here
,
when


I
go
to
give
up
that
flat
and
see
that
damn
box
of
dog
biscuit


sit
there
on
the
sideboard
,
I
sit
down
and
cry
like
a
baby
.
by


God
it
be
awful
—
"




I
could
n’t
forgive
he
or
like
he
,
but
I
see
that
what
he
have
do


be
,
to
he
,
entirely
justified
.
it
be
all
very
careless
and


confused
.
they
be
careless
people
,
Tom
and
Daisy
—
they
smash
up


thing
and
creature
and
then
retreat
back
into
their
money
or
their


vast
carelessness
,
or
whatever
it
be
that
keep
they
together
,
and
let


other
people
clean
up
the
mess
they
have
make
…




I
shake
hand
with
he
;
it
seem
silly
not
to
,
for
I
feel
suddenly
as


though
I
be
talk
to
a
child
.
then
he
go
into
the
jewellery


store
to
buy
a
pearl
necklace
—
or
perhaps
only
a
pair
of
cuff


button
—
rid
of
my
provincial
squeamishness
forever
.




------------------------------------------------------------------------




Gatsby
’s
house
be
still
empty
when
I
leave
—
the
grass
on
his
lawn
have


grow
as
long
as
mine
.
one
of
the
taxi
driver
in
the
village
never


take
a
fare
past
the
entrance
gate
without
stop
for
a
minute
and


point
inside
;
perhaps
it
be
he
who
drive
Daisy
and
Gatsby
over
to


East
Egg
the
night
of
the
accident
,
and
perhaps
he
have
make
a
story


about
it
all
his
own
.
I
do
n’t
want
to
hear
it
and
I
avoid
he
when


I
get
off
the
train
.




I
spend
my
Saturday
night
in
New
York
because
those
gleaming
,


dazzle
party
of
his
be
with
I
so
vividly
that
I
could
still


hear
the
music
and
the
laughter
,
faint
and
incessant
,
from
his
garden
,


and
the
car
go
up
and
down
his
drive
.
one
night
I
do
hear
a


material
car
there
,
and
see
its
light
stop
at
his
front
step
.
but
I


do
n’t
investigate
.
probably
it
be
some
final
guest
who
have
be
away


at
the
end
of
the
earth
and
do
n’t
know
that
the
party
be
over
.




on
the
last
night
,
with
my
trunk
pack
and
my
car
sell
to
the
grocer
,


I
go
over
and
look
at
that
huge
incoherent
failure
of
a
house
once


more
.
on
the
white
step
an
obscene
word
,
scrawl
by
some
boy
with
a


piece
of
brick
,
stand
out
clearly
in
the
moonlight
,
and
I
erase
it
,


draw
my
shoe
raspingly
along
the
stone
.
then
I
wander
down
to
the


beach
and
sprawl
out
on
the
sand
.




Most
of
the
big
shore
place
be
close
now
and
there
be
hardly
any


light
except
the
shadowy
,
move
glow
of
a
ferryboat
across
the


sound
.
and
as
the
moon
rise
high
the
inessential
house
begin
to


melt
away
until
gradually
I
become
aware
of
the
old
island
here
that


flower
once
for
dutch
sailor
’
eye
—
a
fresh
,
green
breast
of
the
new


world
.
its
vanish
tree
,
the
tree
that
have
make
way
for
Gatsby
’s


house
,
have
once
pander
in
whisper
to
the
last
and
great
of
all


human
dream
;
for
a
transitory
enchanted
moment
man
must
have
hold
his


breath
in
the
presence
of
this
continent
,
compel
into
an
aesthetic


contemplation
he
neither
understand
nor
desire
,
face
to
face
for
the


last
time
in
history
with
something
commensurate
to
his
capacity
for


wonder
.




and
as
I
sit
there
brood
on
the
old
,
unknown
world
,
I
think
of


Gatsby
’s
wonder
when
he
first
pick
out
the
green
light
at
the
end
of


Daisy
’s
dock
.
he
have
come
a
long
way
to
this
blue
lawn
,
and
his
dream


must
have
seem
so
close
that
he
could
hardly
fail
to
grasp
it
.
he


do
not
know
that
it
be
already
behind
he
,
somewhere
back
in
that


vast
obscurity
beyond
the
city
,
where
the
dark
field
of
the
republic


roll
on
under
the
night
.




Gatsby
believe
in
the
green
light
,
the
orgastic
future
that
year
by


year
recede
before
we
.
it
elude
we
then
,
but
that
’
no


matter
—
tomorrow
we
will
run
fast
,
stretch
out
our
arm
far
…
and


one
fine
morning
—




so
we
beat
on
,
boat
against
the
current
,
borne
back
ceaselessly
into


the
past
.
