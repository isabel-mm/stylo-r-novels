once
an
angry
man
drag
his
father
along
the
ground
through
his
own
orchard
.
"
stop
!
"
cry
the
groan
old
man
at
last
,
"
stop
!
I
do
not
drag
my
father
beyond
this
tree
.
"




it
be
hard
live
down
the
temper
we
be
bear
with
.
we
all
begin
well
,
for
in
our
youth
there
be
nothing
we
be
more
intolerant
of
than
our
own
sin
writ
large
in
other
and
we
fight
they
fiercely
in
ourselves
;
but
we
grow
old
and
we
see
that
these
our
sin
be
of
all
sin
the
really
harmless
one
to
own
,
nay
that
they
give
a
charm
to
any
character
,
and
so
our
struggle
with
they
die
away
.










it
have
always
seem
to
I
a
rare
privilege
,
this
,
of
be
an
American
,
a
real
American
,
one
whose
tradition
it
have
take
scarcely
sixty
year
to
create
.
we
need
only
realise
our
parent
,
remember
our
grandparent
and
know
ourselves
and
our
history
be
complete
.




the
old
people
in
a
new
world
,
the
new
people
make
out
of
the
old
,
that
be
the
story
that
I
mean
to
tell
,
for
that
be
what
really
be
and
what
I
really
know
.




some
of
the
father
we
must
realise
so
that
we
can
tell
our
story
really
,
be
little
boy
then
,
and
they
come
across
the
water
with
their
parent
,
the
grandparent
we
need
only
just
remember
.
some
of

and
our
mother
,
be
not
even
make
then
,
and
the
woman
,

perhaps
just
have

all
country
be
full
of
woman
who
bring
with
they
many
child
;
but
only
certain
man
and
woman
and
the
child
they
have
in
they
,
to
make
many

for
they
,
will
fill
up
this

.




many

never
find
how
they
could
make

some
of
all

of
this
family
and
its
progress
.




these
first
four
woman
,
the
grandmother
we
need
only
just
remember
,
mostly
never
see
each
other
.
it
be
their
child
and
grandchild
who
,
later
,
wander
over
the
new
land
,
where
they
be
seek
first
,
just
to
make
a
living
,
and
then
later
,
either
to
grow
rich
or
to
gain
wisdom
,
meet
with
one
another
and
be
marry
,
and
so
together
they
make
a
family
whose
progress
we
be
now
soon
to
be
watch
.










we
,
live
now
,
be
always
to
ourselves
young
man
and
woman
.
when
we
,
live
always
in
such
feeling
,
think
back
to
they
who
make
for
we
a
beginning
,
it
be
always
as
grown
and
old
man
and
woman
or
as
little
child
that
we
feel
they
,
these
whose
life
we
have
just
be
think
.
we
sometimes
talk
it
long
,
but
really
,
it
be
only
very
little
time
we
feel
ourselves
ever
to
have
be
as
old
man
and
woman
or
as
child
.
such
part
of
our
living
be
little
ever
really
there
to
we
as
present
in
our
feeling
.
yes
;
we
,
who
be
always
all
our
life
,
to
ourselves
grow
young
man
and
woman
,
when
we
think
back
to
they
who
make
for
we
a
beginning
,
it
be
always
as
grow
old
man
and
woman
or
as
little
child
that
we
feel
they
,
such
as
they
whose
life
we
have
just
be
think
.




yes
it
be
easy
to
think
ourselves
and
our
friend
,
all
our
life
as
young
grown
man
and
woman
,
indeed
it
be
hard
for
we
to
feel
even
when
we
talk
it
long
,
that
we
be
old
like
old
man
and
woman
or
little
as
a
baby
or
as
child
.
such
part
of
our
living
be
never
really
there
to
we
as
present
,
to
our
feeling
.




yes
we
be
very
little
child
when
we
first
begin
to
be
to
ourselves
grown
man
and
woman
.
we
say
then
,
yes
we
be
child
,
but
we
know
then
,
way
inside
we
,
we
be
not
to
ourselves
real
as
child
,
we
be
grow
to
ourselves
,
as
young
grown
man
and
woman
.
nay
we
never
know
ourselves
as
other
than
young
and
grown
man
and
woman
.
when
we
know
we
be
no
long
to
ourselves
as
child
.
very
little
thing
we
be
then
and
very
full
of
such
feeling
.
no
,
to
be
feel
ourselves
to
be
as
child
be
like
the
state
between
when
we
be
asleep
and
when
we
be
just
wake
,
it
be
never
really
there
to
we
as
present
to
our
feeling
.




and
so
it
be
to
be
really
old
to
ourselves
in
our
feeling
;
we
be
weary
and
be
old
,
and
we
know
it
in
our
working
and
our
thinking
,
and
we
talk
it
long
,
and
we
can
see
it
just
by
look
,
and
yet
we
be
a
very
little
time
really
old
to
ourselves
in
our
feeling
,
old
as
old
man
and
old
woman
once
be
and
still
be
to
our
feeling
.
no
,
no
one
can
be
old
like
that
to
himself
in
his
feeling
.
no
it
must
be
always
as
grown
and
young
man
and
woman
that
we
know
ourselves
and
our
friend
in
our
feeling
.
we
know
it
be
not
so
,
by
our
saying
,
but
it
must
be
so
always
to
our
feeling
.
to
be
old
to
ourselves
in
our
feeling
be
a
losing
of
ourselves
like
just
drop
off
into
sleeping
.
to
be
awake
,
we
must
have
it
that
we
be
to
ourselves
young
and
grown
man
and
woman
.




to
be
ourself
like
an
old
man
or
an
old
woman
to
our
feeling
must
be
a
horrid
lose
-
self
sense
to
be
have
.
it
must
be
a
horrid
feeling
,
like
the
hard
leaving
of
our
sense
when
we
be
force
into
sleeping
or
the
come
to
it
when
we
be
just
wake
.
it
must
be
a
horrid
feeling
to
have
such
a
strong
sense
of
lose
,
such
a
feeling
as
be
to
ourselves
like
child
or
like
grow
old
man
and
woman
.
perhaps
to
some
it
be
a
gentle
sense
of
lose
some
who
like
themselves
to
be
without
a
self
sense
feeling
,
but
certainly
it
must
be
always
a
sense
of
self
lose
in
each
one
who
find
himself
really
have
a
very
young
or
very
old
self
feeling
.




our
mother
,
father
,
grandmother
and
grandfather
,
in
the
history
,
and
the
story
,
all
the
other
,
they
all
be
always
little
baby
grow
old
man
and
woman
or
as
child
for
we
.
no
,
old
generation
and
past
age
never
have
grow
young
man
and
woman
in
they
.
so
long
ago
they
be
,
why
they
must
be
old
grown
man
and
woman
or
as
baby
or
as
child
.
no
,
they
we
never
can
feel
as
young
grown
man
and
woman
.
such
only
be
ourselves
and
our
friend
with
whom
we
have
be
live
.




and
so
since
there
be
no
other
way
to
do
with
our
kind
of
thinking
we
will
make
our
elder
to
be
for
we
the
grown
old
man
and
woman
in
our
story
,
or
the
baby
or
the
child
.
we
will
be
always
,
in
ourselves
,
the
young
grow
man
and
woman
.




and
so
now
we
begin
,
and
with
such
man
and
woman
as
we
have
old
or
as
very
little
,
in
we
,
to
our
thinking
.




one
of
these
four
woman
,
the
grandmother
old
always
to
we
the
generation
of
grandchild
,
be
a
sweet
good
woman
,
strong
just
to
bear
many
child
and
then
she
die
away
and
leave
they
for
that
be
all
she
know
then
to
do
for
they
.




like
all
good
old
woman
she
have
all
her
life
bear
many
child
and
she
have
make
herself
a
faithful
work
woman
to
her
husband
who
be
a
good
enough
ordinary
old
man
.




her
husband
live
some
year
after
his
wife
have
die
away
and
leave
he
.




he
be
just
a
decent
well
-
mean
faithful
good
-
enough
ordinary
man
.
he
be
honest
,
and
he
leave
that
very
strongly
to
his
child
and
he
work
hard
,
but
he
never
come
to
very
much
with
all
his
faithful
working
.




he
be
just
a
decent
honest
good
-
enough
man
to
do
ordinary
working
.
he
always
be
good
to
his
wife
and
always
like
she
to
be
with
he
,
and
to
have
good
child
,
and
to
help
he
with
she
working
.
he
always
like
all
of
his
child
and
he
always
do
all
that
he
could
to
help
they
,
but
they
be
all
soon
strong
enough
to
leave
he
,
and
now
that
his
wife
have
die
away
and
leave
he
,
he
be
not
really
need
much
by
the
world
or
by
his
child
.




they
be
good
daughter
and
son
to
he
,
but
his
saying
and
his
old
ordinary
way
of
do
have
not
much
importance
for
they
.
they
be
strong
,
all
of
they
,
in
their
work
and
in
their
new
way
of
feeling
and
full
always
of
their
new
way
of
living
.
it
be
alright
,
he
always
say
it
to
they
,
and
he
think
it
so
really
in
he
,
but
it
be
all
too
new
,
it
could
never
be
any
comfort
to
he
.
he
have
be
leave
out
of
all
life
while
he
be
still
live
.
it
be
all
too
new
for
his
feeling
and
his
wife
be

Henry

be
a

for
his
day
a
rich
one
when
his
father
die
away
and
leave
they
.
truly
he
have
make
everything
for
himself
very
different
;
but
it
be
not
as
a
young
man
make
himself
rich
that
we
be
now
to
feel
he
,
he
be
for
we
an
old
grown
man
tell
it
all
over
to
his
child

he
be
a
middle
aged
man
now
when
he
talk
about
it
all
to
his
child
,
middle
aged
as
perhaps
sometimes
we
ourselves
be
now
to
our
talking
,
but
he
,
he
be
grow
old
man
to
our
thinking
.
yes
truly
this
Henry
Dehning
have
make
everything
for
himself
to
be
very
different
.
his
way
and
his
need
and
how
much
money
it
take
now
to
live
to
be
decent
,
and
all
the
habit
of
his
daily
life
,
they
be
all
now
for
he
very
different
.




and
it
be
strange
how
all
forget
when
they
have
once
make
thing
for
themselves
to
be
very
different
.
a
man
like
Dehning
never
can
feel
it
real
to
himself
,
thing
as
they
be
in
his
early
manhood
,
now
that
he
have
make
his
life
and
habit
and
his
feeling
all
so
different
.
he
say
it
often
,
as
we
all
do
childhood
and
old
age
and
pain
and
sleeping
,
but
it
can
never
anymore
be
really
present
to
his
feeling
.




now
the
common
need
in
his
life
be
very
different
.
no
,
not
he
,
nor
they
all
who
have
make
it
for
themselves
to
be
so
different
,
can
remember
meekness
,
nor
poor
way
,
nor
self
attendance
,
nor
no
comfort
,
all
such
thing
be
to
all
of
they
as
indifferent
as
if
they
in
their
own
life
time
themselves
have
not
make
it
different
.
it
be
not
their
not
want
to
remember
these
thing
that
be
so
different
.
nay
they
love
to
remember
,
and
to
tell
it
over
,
and
most
often
to
their
child
,
what
they
have
be
and
what
they
have
do
and
how
they
themselves
have
make
it
all
to
be
so
different
and
how
well
it
be
for
these
child
that
they
have
have
a
strong
father
who
know
how
to
do
it
so
that
youngster
could
so
have
it
.




yes
,
they
say
it
long
and
often
and
yet
it
be
never
real
to
they
while
they
be
thus
talk
.
no
it
be
not
as
really
present
to
their
thinking
as
it
be
to
the
young
one
who
never
really
have
the
feeling
.
these
have
it
through
their
fear
,
which
make
it
for
they
a
really
present
feeling
.
the
old
one
have
not
such
a
fear
and
they
have
it
all
only
like
a
dim
beginning
,
like
the
being
as
baby
or
as
child
or
as
grow
old
man
and
woman
.




and
this
father
Dehning
be
always
very
full
of
such
talk
.
he
have
make
everything
for
himself
and
for
his
child
.
he
be
a
good
and
honest
man
be
Henry
Dehning
.
he
be
strong
and
rich
and
good
temper
and
respected
and
he
show
it
in
his
look
,
that
look
that
make
young
people
think
old
one
be
very
aged
,
and
he
love
to
tell
it
over
to
his
child
,
how
he
have
make
it
all
for
they
so
they
could
have
it
and
not
have
to
work
to
make
it
different
.




"
yes
,
"
he
would
often
say
to
his
child
,
look
at
they
with
that
sharp
,
side
-
long
,
shrewd
glance
that
make
father
so
fearful
and
so
aged
to
their
child
.
not
that
he
,
Dehning
,
be
ever
very
dreadful
to
his
child
,
but
there
be
a
burr
in
a
man
's
voice
that
always
make
for
terror
in
his
child
and
there
be
a
sharp
,
narrow
,
outward
,
shut
off
glance
from
an
old
man
that
will
always
fill
with
dread
young
grown
man
and
woman
.
no
it
be
only
by
long
equal
living
that
their
wife
know
that
there
be
no
terror
in
they
,
but
the
young
never
can
be
equal
enough
with
they
to
really
rid
themselves
of
such
feeling
.
no
,
they
only
really
can
get
rid
of
such
a
feeling
when
they
have
find
in
an
old
man
a
complete
pathetic
fall
away
into
a
hapless
failing
.
but
mostly
for
all
child
and
young
grown
man
and
woman
there
be
much
terror
in
an
old
man
's
look
.




not
,
we
repeat
,
that
the
Dehnings
have
much
of
such
a
feeling
.
their
mother
have
learn
,
by
perhaps
more
than
equal
living
that
there
really
be
no
terror
in
he
and
through
she
they
have
lose
much
of
such
feeling
.
but
always
they
have
something
of
that
dread
in
they
when
he
would
begin
talk
to
they
of
what
have
be
and
what
he
have
do
for
they
.
then
it
be
that
he
always
become
very
aged
to
they
and
he
would
strongly
hold
they
with
his
sharp
narrow
outward
kind
of
look
that
,
close
he
,
go
very
straight
into
they
.




"
yes
,
"
he
would
often
say
to
his
child
,

and
they
like
it
too
with
he
,
to
light
strongly
against
he
in
the
everlasting
struggle
of
conscious
unproved
power
in
the
young
against
dogmatic
pride
in
having
do
it
,
of
the
old
one

always
there
be
a
little
of
the
dread
in
they
that
come
to
even
grow
young
man
and
woman
from
an
old
man
's
sharp
looking
,
for
deep
down
be
the
fear
,
perhaps
he
really
know
,
his
look
be
so
outward
from
he
,
he
certainly
have
use
it
all
up
the
thing
inside
he
at
which
young
one
be
still
always
look
.
and
then
come
the
strong
feeling
,
no
he
never
have
have
it
inside
he
the
way
that
give
it
a
real
meaning
,
and
so
the
young
one
be
firm
to
go
on
with
their
fighting
.
and
always
they
stay
with
their
father
and
listen
to
he
.




his
wife
from
she
more
than
equal
living
,
as
it
sometimes
be
in
woman
,
have
not
such
a
dread
of
his
really
know
when
it
come
to
their
way
of
living
,
and
then
it
be
really
only
talk
with
he
for
now
it
be
completely
his
own
only
way
of
living
,
and
so
she
never
listen
to
he
,
be
deaf
to
he
or
go
away
when
he
begin
this
kind
of
talk
.
but
his
child
always
stay
and
listen
to
he
.
they
be
ready
very
strongly
to
explain
their
new
way
to
he
.
but
he
do
not
listen
to
they
,
he
go
on
tell
what
he
have
do
and
what
he

leave
home
to
come
and
make
our
way
here
.
we
do
not
have
much
money
so
all
the
family
could
not
come
over
on
the
same
ship
together
,
and
I
remember
how
lonesome
Adolph
and
I
be
when
we
go
away
from
home
alone
together
.
I
remember
too
while
we
be
wait
in
a
big
bare
room
for
they
to
give
we
ticket
,
I
remember
we
hear
some
one
say
our
father
's
name
,
some
man
in
the
same
room
with
we
.
we
do
not
dare
speak
to
the
man
near
we
and
we
do
not
know
which
man
it
be
that
know
we
,
but
it
make
we
feel
a
little
well
.
yes
I
say
you
youngster
have
an
easy
time
of
it
nowadays
do
nothing
.
and
that
be
all
year
ago
and
now
everything
be
all
very
different
with
I
.
and
my
poor
mother
,
peace
be
with
she
,
she
never
have
a
big
house
and
servant
to
work
for
she
like
your
mother
,
and
everything
she
ever
want
I
could
give
she
like
your
mother
have
now
that
I
can
buy
it
for
she
.
no
,
my
poor
mother
,
peace
be
with
she
,
it
be
very
different
for
she
.
you
be
name
after
her
Julia
but
you
do
n't
any
of
you
child
look
much
like
she
.
yes
she
be
a
good
strong
woman
be
my
mother
,
peace
be
with
she
.
no
you
do
n't
any
of
you
ever
look
much
like
she
and
she
could
do
more
than
all
her
grandchild
ever
can
do
now
all
put
together
.
yes
she
be
a
wonderful
woman
your
grandmother
,
peace
be
with
she
.
she
take
care
of
all
we
child
,
we
be
ten
then
,
and
she
make
our
clothe
and
do
her
own
washing
and
in
between
she
make
peppermint
candy
for
the
little
one
to
sell
.
she
be
a
wonderful
good
woman
your
grandmother
,
not
like
you
child
who
never
will
be
good
for
anything
.
yes
!
I
say
,
I
be
only
a
little
old
than
that
lazy
George
here
when
my
poor
mother
,
peace
be
with
she
,
die
away
,
and
we
be
leave
there
,
ten
child
,
and
we
have
to
get
along
without
she
,
and
my
father
,
he
be
an
honest
and
a
good
man
but
he
never
know
much
how
to
make
a
living
,
and
so
he
never
could
help
along
any
of
his
child
.
and
so
what
we
want
we
have
to
go
out
and
find
out
how
to
get
it
.
and
now
you

have
it
very
different
,
you
have
everything
you
can
ever
think
you
can
be
need
,
and
you
do
n't
ever
show
that
you
can
work
hard
to
deserve
it
.
well
you
get
your
literary
effect
and

new
fangled
notion
and
all

now
when

fangled
notion
and
all
your
kind
of
improvement
will
do
for
you
.
see

it
can
teach
you
more
than
we
learn
work
hard
and
sell
candy
and
anything
else
we
could
do
to
get
some
money
.

way
proud
that
he
himself
have
do
it
.
she
like
his
power
,
and
when
she
ever
think
about
it
she
like
the
honest
way
she
know
that
he
have
do

.
and
like
he
too
she
be
very
proud
in

but
to
her
thinking
there

very
little
they
could
teach
she
.
she
know
it
all
always
very
well
and
much
well
than
they
could
ever
know
it
.
but
she
be
very
proud
of
these
educate
child
and
she
be
very
proud
of
her
husband
Henry
dehne
though
she
know
he
always
do
little
thing
so
badly
and
that
he
would
still
always
play
like
a
poor
man
with
his
finger
and
he
never
would
learn
not
to
do
it
.
yes
she
be
very
proud
of
her
husband
though
he
always
do
little
thing
so
badly
and
she
have
always
to
be
tell
he
how
a
man
in
his
position
should
know
how
to
do
it
.
she
come
towards
he
now
when
he
be
through
with
his
talking
,
and

one
rebuke
to
he
for
his

with
his
finger
.
"
do

"
she
say
to
he
loudly
.




Mrs.
Dehning
be
the
quintessence
of
loud
-
voice
good
-
look
prosperity
.
she
be
a
fair
heavy
woman
,
well
-
look
and
firmly
compact
and
hit
the
ground
as
she
walk
with
the
same
hard
jerk
with
which
she
rebuke
her
husband
for
his
sin
.
yes
Mrs.
Dehning
be
a
woman
whose
rasp
insensibility
to
gentle
courtesy
deserve
the
prejudice
one
cherish
against
she
,
but
she
be
a
woman
,
to
do
her
justice
,
generous
and
honest
,
one
whom
one
might
like
well
the
more
one
see
she
less
.




yes
it
be
now
all
very
different
for
they
.
it
be
very
pleasant
always
for
Henry
Dehning
then
,
to
stand
and
to
look
about
he
,
yes
truly
it
be
now
all
very
different
with
he
.
he
have
his
family
there
about
he
,
a
family
certain
to
be
a
satisfaction
to
he
.
they
be
a
group
to
gratify
the
feeling
of
pride
in
he
,
they
be
so
prosperous
vigorous
good
-
look
,
honest
,
and
always
respectful
to
he
,
and
surely
they
would
have
later
,
good
hope
of
win
for
themselves
all
that
he
could
ever
wish
to
they
.




yes
it
certainly
be
very
different
now
with
he
.
could
one
ever
have
it
real
to
he
that
in
one
life
time
a
man
could
have
it
all
so
different
for
he
,
that
a
man
all
alone
in
his
single
lifetime
could
make
it
so
that
he
could
have
it
to
be
truly
all
so
different
in
he
.




nay
for
a
man
to
have
it
in
a
single
life
time
all
so
different
for
he
be
more
strange
than
be
bear
and
be
then
a
baby
and
then
a
child
and
then
a
young
grow
man
and
then
old
like
a
man
grow
old
and
then
dead
and
so
no
more
of
living
,
it
be
more
strange
because
it
make
so
many
life
in
this
one
living
.
each
one
of
these
life
that
he
forget
or
remember
only
as
a
dim
beginning
be
a
whole
life
to
we
in
our
thinking
,
and
so
Henry
Dehning
have
have
many
life
in
he
to
our
feeling
.




could
one
believe
it
that
he
be
a
grown
man
and
he
be
then
live
like
the
man
who
come
into
his
place
now
to
do
a
little
selling
to
the
servant
in
the
kitchen
.
and
yet
that
be
one
whole
full
life
for
he
;
and
then
there
be
the
old
world
where
there
have
be
for
he
such
a
very
different
kind
of
living
.
yes
as
he
stand
there
talk
to
his
child
of
the
thing
that
be
never
real
now
any
more
to
his
feeling
,
a
man
come
up
the
walk
and
slink
back
when
he
see
they
and
go
sneak
to
the
kitchen
and
there
he
sell
little
thing
to
the
woman
who
buy
they
out
of
irish
fun
or
just
to
be
kind
to
he
,
for
his
thing
be
really
not
good
enough
for
they
,
they
be
thing
for
people
poor
than
any
that
work
in
a
kitchen
;
and
so
Mr.
Dehning
go
on
talk
to
his
child
and
it
be
all
more
real
to
their
feeling
than
it
be
now
to
his
thinking
,
for
they
have
it
in
their
fear
which
young
one
always
have
inside
they
,
and
he
,
he
have
it
only
as
a
dim
beginning
as
be
like
a
baby
or
an
old
grown
man
or
woman
.
nay
how
can
he
ever
have
it
in
he
to
feel
it
now
as
really
present
to
he
,
such
thing
as
meekness
or
poor
way
or
self
attendance
or
no
comfort
,
it
be
only
a
fear
that
could
make
such
thing
be
now
as
present
to
he
,
and
he
have
no
such
a
fear
ever
inside
he
,
not
for
himself
ever
or
even
for
his
child
,
for
he
be
strong
in
a
sense
of
always
win
.
it
be
they
,
the
child
,
who
,
though
they
too
feel
a
strength
inside
they
and
talk
about
it
very
often
,
yet
way
down
deep
in
they
they
know
they
have
no
way
to
be
really
certain
;
and
always
they
be
brave
,
good
-
look
,
honest
,
prosperous
child
and
the
father
feel
strong
pride
as
he
look
around
he
.




the
Dehning
family
be
make
of
this
father
and
mother
and
three
child
.
Mr.
Dehning
be
very
proud
of
his
child
and
proud
of
all
the
thing
he
know
that
they
could
teach
he
.
there
be
two
daughter
and
a
son
of
they
.




Julia
Dehning
be
name
after
her
grandmother
,
but
,
as
her
father
often
tell
she
,
she
never
look
the
least
bit
like
she
and
yet
there
be
a
little
in
she
that
make
the
old
world
not
all
lose
to
she
,
a
little
that
make
one
always
remember
that
her
grandmother
and
her
father
have
have
always
a
worn
old
world
to
remember
.




yes
Julia
look
much
like
her
mother
.
that
fair
good
-
look
prosperous
woman
have
stamp
her
image
on
each
one
of
her
child
,
and
with
her
eld
,
Julia
,
the
stamp
go
deep
,
far
deep
than
just
for
the
fair
good
-
look
exterior
.




Julia
Dehning
be
now
just
eighteen
and
she
show
in
all
its
vigor
,
the
self
-
satisfied
crude
domineering
american
girlhood
that
be
strong
inside
she
.
perhaps
she
be
bear
too
near
to
the
old
world
to
ever
attain
quite
altogether
that
crude
virginity
that
make
the
american
girl
safe
in
all
her
liberty
.
yes
the
american
girl
be
a
crude
virgin
and
she
be
safe
in
her
freedom
.




and
now
,
so
think
her
mother
,
and
Julia
be
quite
of
the
same
opinion
,
the
time
have
come
for
Julia
to
have
a
husband
and
to
begin
her
real
important
living
.




under
Julia
's
very
american
face
,
body
,
clothe
and
manner
and
her
vigor
of
the
domineering
and
crude
virgin
,
there
be
now
and
then
flash
of
passion
that
light
up
an
old
well
hide
tradition
.
yes
in
Julia
dehne
the
prosperous
,
good
-
look
,
domineering
woman
be
a
very
attractive
being
.
Julia
irradiate
energy
and
brilliant
enjoying
,
she
be
vigorous
,
and
like
her
mother
,
fair
and
firmly
compact
,
and
she
be
full
of
bright
hope
,
and
strong
in
the
spirit
of
success
that
she
feel
always
in
she
.
Julia
be
much
give
to
hearty
joyous
laughing
and
to
an
ardent
honest
feeling
,
and
she
hit
the
ground
as
she
walk
with
the
same
hard
jerk
with
which
her
mother
Mrs.
Dehning
always
rebuke
her
husband
's
sinning
.
yes
Julia
Dehning
be
bright
and
full
of
vigor
,
and
with
something
always
a
little
harsh
in
she
,
make
underneath
her
young
bright
vigorous
ardent
honest
feeling
a
little
of
the
sense
of
rasp
that
be
just
now
in
her
mother
's
talk
.




and
so
those
who
read
much
in
story
book
surely
now
can
tell
what
to
expect
of
she
,
and
yet
,
please
reader
,
remember
that
this
be
perhaps
not
the
whole
of
our
story
either
,
neither
her
father
for
she
,
nor
the
live
down
her
mother
who
be
in
she
,
for
I
be
not
ready
yet
to
take
away
the
character
from
our
Julia
,
for
truly
she
may
work
out
as
the
story
book
would
have
she
or
we
may
find
all
different
kind
of
thing
for
she
,
and
so
reader
,
please
remember
,
the
future
be
not
yet
certain
for
she
,
and
be
you
well
warned
reader
,
from
the
vain
-
glory
of
be
sudden
in
your
judgment
of
she
.




after
Julia
come
the
boy
George
and
he
be
not
name
after
his
grandfather
.
and
so
it
be
right
that
in
his
name
he
should
not
sound
as
if
he
be
the
son
of
his
father
,
so
at
least
his
mother
decide
for
he
,
and
the
father
,
he
laugh
and
let
she
do
the
way
she
like
it
.
and
so
the
boy
be
name
George
and
the
other
be
there
but
hide
as
an
initial
to
be
only
use
for
sign
.




the
boy
George
bid
fair
to
do
credit
to
his
christening
.
George
Dehning
now
about
fourteen
be
strong
in
sport
and
washing
.
he
be
not
foreign
in
his
washing
.
oh
,
no
,
he
be
really
an
American
.




it
be
a
great
question
this
question
of
washing
.
one
never
can
find
any
one
who
can
be
satisfied
with
anybody
else
's
washing
.
I
know
a
man
once
who
never
as
far
as
any
one
could
see
ever
do
any
washing
,
and
yet
he
describe
another
with
contempt
,
why
he
be
a
dirty
hog
sir
,
he
never
do
any
washing
.
the
French
tell
I
it
be
the
Italians
who
never
do
any
washing
,
the
French
and
the
Italians
both
find
the
Spanish
a
little
short
in
their
washing
,
the
English
find
all
the
world
lax
in
this
business
of
washing
,
and
the
East
find
all
the
West
a
pig
,
which
never
be
clean
with
just
the
little
cold
water
washing
.
and
so
it
go
.




yes
it
have
be
say
that
even
a
flea
have
other
little
flea
to
bite
he
,
and
so
it
be
with
this
washing
,
everybody
can
find
some
one
to
condemn
for
his
lack
of
washing
.
even
the
man
who
,
when
he
want
to
take
a
little
hut
in
the
country
to
live
in
,
and
they
say
to
he
,
but
there
be
no
water
to
have
there
,
and
he
say
,
what
do
that
matter
,
in
this
country
one
can
always
have
wine
for
his
drinking
,
he
too
have
other
who
for
he
do
n't
think
enough
about
their
washing
;
and
then
there
be
the
man
who
take
the
bath
-
tub
out
of
his
house
because
he
do
n't
believe
in
promiscuous
bathing
;
and
there
be
the
plumber
who
say
,
yes
I
have
always
get
to
be
fix
bath
-
tub
for
other
people
to
get
clean
in
,
and
I
,
I
have
n't
get
time
enough
to
wash
my
hand
even
;
and
then
there
be
the
french
bohemian
,
now
one
never
would
think
of
they
as
extravagantly
cleanly
being
,
and
yet
in
a
village
in
Spain
they
be
an
astonishment
to
all
the
native
,
why
do
you
do
so
much
washing
,
they
all
demand
of
they
,
when
your
skin
be
so
white
and
clean
even
when
you
first
begin
to
clean
they
;
and
then
there
be
the
dubious
smelly
negro
woman
who
tell
you
about
another
woman
who
be
as
dirty
as
a
dog
and
as
rag
as
a
spring
chicken
,
and
yet
some
dog
certainly
do
sometimes
do
some
washing
and
this
woman
have
certainly
not
much
sign
of
ever
having
had
such
a
thing
happen
;
and
then
there
be
the
virtuous
poor
woman
who
bring
her
child
to
the
dispensary
for
a
treatment
and
the
doctor
say
to
she
,
no
I
wo
n't
touch
she
now
anymore
until
you
clean
she
,
and
the
woman
cry
out
in
her
indignation
,
what
you
think
I
be
poor
like
a
beggar
,
I
get
money
enough
to
pay
for
a
doctor
,
I
show
you
I
can
hire
a
real
doctor
,
and
she
slam
the
door
and
rush
out
with
her
daughter
.
yes
it
certainly
be
very
queer
in
she
.
all
this
washing
business
be
certainly
most
peculiar
.
surely
it
be
true
that
even
little
flea
have
always
littler
one
to
bite
they
.




and
then
when
we
be
all
through
with
the
pleasant
summer
and
its
gorgeous
washing
,
then
come
the
dreadful
question
of
the
winter
washing
.
it
be
easy
enough
to
wash
often
when
the
sun
be
hot
and
they
be
sticky
and
perspiring
and
the
water
in
a
natural
kind
of
a
way
be
always
flow
,
but
when
it
come
to
be
nasty
cold
as
it
always
be
in
winter
,
then
it
be
not
any
more
a
pleasure
,
it
be
a
harsh
duty
then
and
hard
to
follow
.




yes
it
certainly
be
all
very
funny
,
and
so
we
come
back
to
talk
some
more
about
George
Dehning
,
George
who
in
this
washing
be
always
strong
to
do
all
his
duty
.




George
Dehning
be
a
fair
athletic
chap
,
cheery
as
his
father
and
full
of
excellent
intention
,
and
though
these
be
almost
all
lose
in
their
way
to
their
fulfillment
,
remember
,
George
be
only
fourteen
just
then
,
that
time
with
a
boy
when
he
never
can
have
much
sense
in
he
,
for
it
nearly
always
be
then
with
boy
that
the
meek
of
they
be
reckless
dare
-
devil
heedless
unreflecte
fellow
,
and
so
reader
do
not
make
too
much
for
he
of
any
present
weakness
in
he
.




yes
,
George
Dehning
be
not
at
all
foreign
in
his
washing
but
for
he
,
too
,
the
old
world
be
not
altogether
lose
behind
he
.
sometimes
the
boy
have
a
way
with
he
,
and
it
would
show
clear
in
spite
of
the
fair
cheery
sporty
nature
he
have
in
he
,
a
way
of
look
sleepy
and
reflect
,
and
his
lid
would
never
be
really
ever
very
open
,
and
he
would
be
always
only
half
show
his
clear
grey
eye
that
,
very
often
,
be
bright
alive
and
laugh
.




later
such
a
way
of
look
could
be
of
great
service
to
he
.
it
would
not
matter
if
he
never
really
could
have
wisdom
in
he
,
this
look
could
help
he
always
in
his
dealing
with
all
man
and
be
of
much
service
too
to
he
with
woman
.
he
will
listen
then
,
and
with
his
veiled
eye
it
will
be
as
if
he
be
full
with
thinking
,
and
with
himself
always
well
hidden
,
and
so
he
will
be
wise
;
or
for
a
woman
,
it
will
be
as
if
he
be
always
in
a
dream
of
they
.
wisdom
and
dreaming
,
both
good
thing
when
show
at
the
right
time
by
a
young
grow
man
,
who
want
to
be
succeed
,
always
,
in
every
kind
of
living
.




and
so
for
the
moment
we
leave
the
sporty
cheery
well
wash
George
Dehning
with
his
background
and
his
future
of
wisdom
and
of
dream
,
both
now
pretty
well
hide
away
in
the
depth
of
he
.




and
then
there
be
the
littlest
one
whose
name
have
be
all
give
without
regard
to
the
old
world
behind
they
.
they
call
her
Hortense
for
that
be
both
elegant
and
new
then
.
the
father
let
the
mother
do
as
she
like
with
the
naming
,
he
laugh
and
a
little
he
do
not
like
it
in
he
and
then
a
little
he
be
proud
of
his
Miss
Jenny
and
her
way
of
do
.




and
so
the
littlest
be
Hortense
Dehning
.
she
too
have
the
stamp
of
the
fair
prosperous
woman
who
have
set
her
seal
so
firmly
on
her
child
,
but
little
Hortense
have
perhaps
a
little
more
in
she
of
that
sweet
good
woman
who
have
bear
many
child
and
then
have
die
away
and
leave
they
for
that
be
all
she
know
then
to
do
for
they
.




the
little
Hortense
Dehning
be
not
of
much
importance
yet
in
the
family
live
.
Hortense
be
ten
now
and
full
of
adoration
for
her
big
sister
and
yet
most
of
all
for
her
brother
.
she
be
not
very
strong
and
she
could
not
run
after
he
in
his
playing
,
but
sometimes
he
would
sit
and
talk
to
she
about
himself
and
his
resolution
and
the
elaborate
purpose
that
he
be
always
lose
.
George
be
always
very
moral
and
too
he
be
very
hopeful
.
he
always
begin
his
to
-
morrow
with
himself
full
of
a
firm
resolution
to
do
all
thing
every
minute
and
to
do
they
all
very
complicatedly
.
George
feel
always
he
must
bring
up
this
little
sister
for
he
George
be
the
only
one
who
know
the
right
way
for
she
.




and
so
he
preach
a
great
deal
to
she
,
and
little
Hortense
be
very
devout
and
adore
her
instructor
.
there
be
always
a
dependent
loyal
up
-
gaze
sweetness
in
she
.




be
the
baby
of
the
family
she
be
much
pet
by
her
father
and
always
she
be
overawe
by
her
brother
,
who
be
very
careful
to
be
noble
to
she
.
she
be
not
just
then
very
much
with
her
mother
for
she
be
not
at
this
time
very
important
to
she
.
the
mother
be
so
busy
with
her
Julia
,
to
find
an
important
and
good
husband
for
she
.
and
so
little
Hortense
be
leave
much
to
her
brother
and
to
the
governess
they
have
for
she
.




for
we
now
as
well
as
for
the
mother
the
important
matter
in
the
history
of
the
Dehning
family
be
the
marrying
of
Julia
.
I
have
say
that
a
strong
family
likeness
bind
all
the
three
child
firmly
to
their
mother
.
that
fair
good
-
look
prosperous
woman
have
stamp
her
image
on
each
one
of
her
child
,
but
with
only
the
eld
Julia
be
the
stamp
deep
,
deep
than
for
the
fair
good
-
look
exterior
.




all
the
family
have
always
look
up
to
Julia
.
they
delight
in
her
daring
and
in
a
kind
of
heroical
sweetness
there
be
in
she
.
they
respect
in
she
,
her
educate
way
and
her
know
always
what
be
the
right
way
she
and
all
of
they
should
be
do
.
it
be
not
for
nothing
she
be
a
crude
domineering
virgin
.
and
she
be
strong
in
the
success
she
know
always
that
she
have
inside
she
,
and
the
family
always
admire
and
follow
after
.




her
father
love
her
energy
and
vigor
,
he
love
her
happiness
and
the
ardent
honest
feeling
in
she
.
he
be
always
very
ready
to
yield
to
she
,
he
like
to
hear
she
when
she
explain
to
he
in
her
quick
decisive
manner
the
new
faith
she
have
so
strongly
in
she
,
the
new
illusion
and
the
theory
and
new
movement
that
the
spirit
of
her
generation
have
teach
to
she
.
and
he
laugh
at
her
new
fangled
notion
and
her
educate
literary
business
and
all
her
modern
kind
of
improvement
as
he
call
they
,
and
he
abuse
they
and
too
the
way
she
have
of
believe
that
she
know
more
than
her
mother
,
but
always
it
amuse
the
father
to
have
his
bright
quick
daughter
explain
all
these
new
way
to
he
.
Mr.
Dehning
know
well
the
value
of
what
he
have
learn
by
living
,
but
his
be
a
nature
generous
in
its
feeling
and
he
be
always
ready
to
listen
to
his
child
when
they
could
fairly
demonstrate
their
idea
to
he
.




but
Herman
Dehning
's
pride
and
pleasure
in
his
Julia
be
all
exceed
by
the
loud
voice
satisfaction
of
the
mother
to
whom
this
brilliant
daughter
always
seem
as
the
product
of
the
mother
's
own
exertion
.
in
she
it
be
the
vanity
and
exultation
of
creation
as
well
as
of
possession
and
she
never
fairly
learn
how
completely
it
be
the
girl
who
govern
all
the
family
life
and
how
very
much
of
this
young
life
be
hide
from
her
knowledge
.




Mr.
Dehning
have
never
concern
himself
very
much
with
the
management
of
the
family
's
way
of
living
and
the
social
life
of
his
wife
and
child
.
these
thing
be
all
always
arrange
by
Mrs.
Dehning
and
he
be
well
content
to
let
she
do
it
though
he
often
grumble
at
the
foolishness
and
the
expense
and
at
his
child
always
have
everything
they
ever
want
and
so
be
sure
to
be
always
good
for
nothing
.




but
always
he
be
very
proud
of
his
wife
and
of
his
child
,
though
,
a
little
,
he
always
feel
it
be
not
right
,
their
new
fangled
way
of
do
,
and
yet
,
truly
,
he
be
very
proud
of
they
always
,
and
indeed
they
be
a
group
to
gratify
the
pride
that
he
have
in
he
,
they
be
so
vigorous
prosperous
and
good
-
look
,
and
honest
,
and
always
respectful
to
he
,
and
surely
they
have
good
hope
of
later
win
for
themselves
all
the
happiness
and
success
he
could
wish
they
.




Julia
dehne
at
eighteen
have
live
through
much
of
the
experience
that
can
prepare
a
girl
for
womanhood
and
marriage
.




I
have
say
,
there
be
a
number
of
young
man
and
boy
connect
with
the
Dehning
family
,
uncle
and
cousin
,
generous
decent
considerate
fellow
,
frank
and
honest
in
their
friendship
,
and
simple
in
the
fashion
of
the
elder
Dehning
.
with
this
kindre
Julia
have
always
live
as
with
the
member
of
one
family
.
these
man
do
not
supply
for
she
the
training
and
experience
that
help
to
clear
the
way
for
an
impetuous
woman
through
a
world
of
passion
,
they
only
make
a
sane
and
moral
back
-
ground
on
which
she
in
her
late
life
could
learn
to
lean
.




with
any
member
of
this
kindre
there
would
be
,
in
a
young
and
ardent
mind
,
no
thought
of
love
or
marriage
;
nor
be
the
sober
business
man
,
young
,
old
,
or
middle
-
aged
,
who
come
a
great
deal
to
the
house
,
attractive
to
her
temper
,
for
Julia
be
ambitious
for
passion
and
position
and
she
need
,
too
,
a
strain
of
romance
.
no
such
kind
of
a
man
have
really
come
to
she
and
Julia
be
all
ripe
for
real
experience
,
for
even
with
she
well
guard
life
she
have
find
the
sickened
sense
that
come
with
learn
that
some
man
do
wrong
.
passionate
temper
have
greatly
this
advantage
of
the
unpassionate
variety
;
you
can
never
guard
they
with
such
care
but
that
they
find
themselves
full
up
with
real
experience
and
with
the
after
-
taste
of
disillusion
,
but
vitally
as
they
be
always
hit
they
always
rise
and
plunge
once
more
,
while
their
poorly
passionate
fellow
who
receive
a
vital
blow
never
rise
to
faith
again
.




Julia
as
a
little
girl
have
have
the
usual
experience
of
governess
guard
child
.
she
be
first
the
confidant
,
then
the
advisor
,
and
last
the
arranger
of
the
love
affair
of
her
establish
guardian
.
then
at
her
finish
school
she
became
acquaint
with
that
dubious
character
,
the
adventuress
,
the
type
to
be
find
always
in
all
kind
of
place
,
a
character
eternally
attractive
in
its
mystery
and
daring
,
and
always
able
to
attach
unto
itself
the
most
intelligent
and
honest
of
its
comrade
and
introduce
they
to
queer
vice
.




and
so
Julia
Dehning
,
like
all
other
young
girl
,
learn
many
kind
of
lesson
,
and
she
see
many
of
the
kind
of
way
that
lead
to
wisdom
,
and
always
her
life
be
healthy
vigorous
and
active
.
she
learn
very
well
all
the
thing
young
girl
of
her
class
be
teach
then
and
she
learn
too
,
in
all
kind
of
way
,
all
the
thing
girl
always
can
learn
,
somehow
,
to
be
wise
in
.
and
so
Julia
be
well
prepared
now
to
be
a
woman
.
she
have
singing
and
piano
-
playing
and
sport
and
all
regular
school
learning
,
she
have
good
look
,
honesty
,
and
brilliant
courage
,
and
in
her
young
way
a
certain
kind
of
wisdom
.




always
Julia
be
a
passionate
young
woman
and
she
have
too
a
heroical
kind
of
sweetness
in
her
way
of
win
.
she
be
a
passionate
young
woman
in
the
sense
that
always
she
be
all
alive
and
always
all
the
emotion
she
have
in
her
being
be
as
intense
and
present
to
her
feeling
as
a
sensation
like
a
pain
be
to
other
who
be
less
alive
in
their
living
.
and
all
this
time
too
,
Julia
Dehning
be
busily
arrange
and
direct
the
life
and
aspiration
of
her
family
,
for
she
be
strong
always
in
her
good
right
to
lead
they
.




and
so
Julia
Dehning
when
she
be
seventeen
come
out
upon
the
world
,
and
she
be
fill
full
with
courage
and
experience
and
wisdom
,
and
she
be
well
ready
now
with
this
energy
and
wisdom
to
cope
with
and
conquer
all
the
world
and
all
man
and
woman
.




there
be
nothing
more
joyous
than
be
healthful
young
and
energetic
,
and
love
movement
sunshine
and
clean
air
.
Combine
all
this
with
owning
of
a
horse
and
courage
enough
to
ride
he
wildly
,
and
God
be
good
to
overflow
to
his
child
.
it
be
pleasant
too
to
have
occasionally
a
sympathetic
comrade
on
such
ride
.
Jameson
be
a
pleasant
man
of
thirty
five
or
thereabout
,
a
good
free
rider
and
an
easy
talker
.
Julia
know
he
first
at
home
and
meet
he
usually
while
ride
to
the
station
to
meet
her
father
and
the
city
train
.
they
would
then
either
gallop
home
together
or
go
about
ride
through
the
glowing
meadow
of
low
oak
,
race
cheerily
along
the
country
road
,
and
dipping
here
and
there
into
a
pleasant
wood
that
break
the
open
country
into
shadow
.
they
meet
too
,
occasionally
,
in
ride
party
that
go
in
search
of
new
country
to
discover
and
explore
.
it
be
all
very
pleasant
and
unaggressive
,
but
Julia
begin
to
notice
that
Mrs.
Jameson
frown
on
she
in
anger
now
,
whenever
they
all
meet
together
.
then
too
Jameson
grow
gradually
less
comradely
,
more
intimate
,
and
gross
.
Julia
understand
at
last
and
do
not
ride
with
he
again
.




such
incident
as
these
be
common
in
the
life
of
all
young
woman
and
only
be
important
in
those
intenser
nature
that
,
by
their
understanding
,
make
each
incident
into
a
situation
.
such
nature
suck
a
full
experience
from
every
act
,
and
live
so
much
in
what
,
to
other
,
mean
so
little
,
for
be
it
not
all
common
and
to
be
expect
.




in
Julia
dehne
all
experience
have
go
to
make
she
wise
now
in
a
desire
for
a
master
in
the
art
of
life
,
and
it
come
to
pass
that
in
Alfred
Hersland
bring
by
a
cousin
to
visit
at
the
house
she
find
a
man
who
embody
her
ideal
in
a
way
to
make
her
heart
beat
with
surprise
.




to
a
bourgeois
mind
that
have
within
it
a
little
of
the
fervor
for
diversity
,
there
can
be
nothing
more
attractive
than
a
strain
of
singularity
that
yet
keep
well
within
the
limit
of
conventional
respectability
a
singularity
that
be
,
so
to
speak
,
well
dressed
and
well
set
up
.
this
be
the
near
approach
the
middle
class
young
woman
can
ever
hope
to
make
to
the
indifference
and
distinction
of
the
really
noble
.
when
singularity
go
far
and
so
get
to
be
always
strong
,
there
come
to
be
in
it
too
much
real
danger
for
any
middle
class
young
woman
to
follow
it
far
.
then
come
the
danger
of
be
mix
by
it
so
that
no
one
just
see
you
can
know
it
,
and
they
will
take
you
for
the
low
,
those
who
be
simply
poor
or
because
they
have
no
other
way
to
do
it
.
surely
no
young
person
with
any
kind
of
middle
class
tradition
will
ever
do
so
,
will
ever
put
themselves
in
the
way
of
such
danger
,
of
get
so
that
no
one
can
tell
by
just
look
that
they
be
not
like
they
who
by
their
nature
be
always
in
an
ordinary
undistinguished
degradation
.
no
!
such
kind
of
a
danger
can
never
have
to
a
young
one
of
any
middle
class
tradition
any
kind
of
an
attraction
.




now
singularity
that
be
neither
crazy
,
sporty
,
faddish
,
or
a
fashion
,
or
low
class
with
distinction
,
such
a
singularity
,
I
say
,
we
have
not
make
enough
of
yet
so
that
any
other
one
can
really
know
it
,
it
be
as
yet
an
unknown
product
with
we
.
it
take
time
to
make
queer
people
,
and
to
have
other
who
can
know
it
,
time
and
a
certainty
of
place
and
mean
.
custom
,
passion
,
and
a
feel
for
mother
earth
be
need
to
breed
vital
singularity
in
any
man
,
and
alas
,
how
poor
we
be
in
all
these
three
.




Brother
Singulars
,
we
be
misplace
in
a
generation
that
know
not
Joseph
.
we
flee
before
the
disapproval
of
our
cousin
,
the
courageous
condescension
of
our
friend
who
gallantly
sometimes
agree
to
walk
the
street
with
we
,
from
all
they
who
never
any
way
can
understand
why
such
way
and
not
the
other
be
so
dear
to
we
,
we
fly
to
the
kindly
comfort
of
an
old
world
accustom
to
take
all
manner
of
strange
form
into
its
bosom
and
we
leave
our
noble
order
to
be
know
under
such
form
as
Alfred
Hersland
,
a
poor
thing
,
and
even
hardly
then
our
own
.




the
Herslands
be
a
western
family
.
David
Hersland
,
the
father
,
have
go
out
to
a
western
state
to
make
his
money
.
his
wife

up
in
the

later
Mr.

have
send
his

Alfred
back
there

go
to
college
and
then
to
stay
on
and
to
study
to
become
a
lawyer
.
now
it
be
some
year
later
and
Alfred
Hersland
have
come
again
to
Bridgepoint
,
to
settle
down
there
to
practice

,
and
to
make
for
himself
his
own
money
.




the
Hersland
family
have
not
have
their
money
any
long
than
the
other
of
this
community
,
but
they
have
take
to
culture
and
to
idea
quick
.




Alfred
Hersland
be
well
put
together
to
impress
a
courageous
crude
young
woman
,
who
have
an
ambition
for
both
passion
and
position
and
who
need
too
to
have
a
strain
of
romance
with
they
.




Hersland
be
tall
and
well
dressed
and
sufficiently
good
-
look
,
and
he
carry
himself
always

a
certain
easy
dignity
and
grace
.
his

hair
,
which
he
wear
parted
in
the
middle
,
a
way
of

at
that
time
show
both
courage
and
conviction
,
cover
a
well
shaped
head
.

strongly
mark
,
regular
and
attractive
,
his

be
pleasing
,
his

always
interesting
,
and
his
manner
be

and
friendly
.

"




it
have
be
a
wonderful
time
for
Julia
dehne
these
few
month
of
know
Hersland
.
she
have
had
,
always
,
stir
within
she
,
a
longing
for
the
knowledge
of
make
thing
,
of
work
of
art
,
of
all
the
wonder
that
make
,
she
know
,
a
world
,
for
certain
other
people
.
(
twenty
year
ago
,
you
know
,
it
be
still
the
dark
age
in
America
and
lecture
on
art
do
not
grow
on
every
tongue
that
have
taste
the
salt
air
of
the
mid
-
atlantic
.
it
be
a
feat
then
to
know
about
hill
town
in
Italy
,
one
might
have
hear
of
Titian
and
of
Rembrandt
but
Giorgone
and
Botticelli
be
still
sacred
to
the
few
,
one
do
not
then
yet
have
to
seek
,
to
find
for
oneself
new
painter
and
new
place
.
)
it
be
a
very
real
desire
,
this
longing
for
the
wisdom
of
all
culture
,
this
that
have
be
always
strong
in
Julia
.
of
course
,
mostly
,
such
longing
in
Julia
,
take
the
form
of
moral
idealism
,
the
only
form
of
culture
the
spare
american
imagination
take
natural
refuge
in
.




Julia
Dehning
,
like
all
of
her
kind
of
people
,
need
everything
,
for
anything
could
feed
she
.
it
be
not
strong
meat
that
Hersland
offer
to
she
,
but
her
palate
be
eager
,
this
have
the
flavour
of
the
dish
she
long
to
have
eat
and
to
have
inside
she
.
to
her
young
crude
virgin
desire
the
food
he
offer
to
she
be
plenty
real
enough
to
deeply
content
she
.




of
the
family
about
she
,
it
be
only
Julia
who
find
he
worthy
to
be
so
important
to
she
.
the
cousin
and
the
uncle
,
the
man
who
could
make
for
she
the
sane
and
moral
background
that
would
give
a
wholesome
middle
class
condition
always
to
she
,
they
do
not
like
it
much
that
Hersland
be
now
so
important
for
she
.
they
say
nothing
to
she
,
but
they
do
not
like
to
have
he
always
about
with
she
.
he

out
in

they
always
have
have
with

these
man
could
not
find
Hersland
's
knowledge
worth
much
for
they

they
do
not
have
it
in

that
it
have
a
meaning
for
they
that
he
Hersland
have
in
he
,
knowledge
and
a
certain
kind
of
feeling
that
they
never
could
have
inside
they
.
what
could
a
pleasant
mystery
in
a
man
mean
to
they

only
that
any
man
with
any
sense
in
he
would
not
ever
trust
anything
real
to
he

but
they
say
nothing
,
any
of
they
,
they
know
nothing
real
against
he

,
anyhow
,
it
be
not
business
for
they
to
interfere
with
other
people
's

after
all
it
be
to
the

it
do
not
in
any

do
not

later
to

always
in
such
a
far

out
from

Henry

have
a
long

to
make
use
of
man

slow

tenacious

he
be
of
the
old
generation
,
they
of
the
new
,
with
all
his
wisdom
surely
he
must
fail
to
see
the
meaning
in
the
unaccustomed
.

Mr.

go
on
after
a
silent
interval

pretty
busy
with
their

I
would

"
yes
Julia

those
be
your
literary
notion

a
lawyer
have
get
to
be
a
business
man
now

you
like
success

money
as
well
as
any

you
have
always
have
everything
you
want

you
do
n't
want
to
get
along
without
it
.
literary
effect
and
modern
improvement
be
alright
for
woman
but
with
Hersland
it
ought
to
be
different
,
it
ought
to
be
that
he
have
the
kind
of
sense
he
need
in
his
business
.
I
do
n't
say
he
have
n't
get
good
sense
in
he
to
make
a
success
in
he

you
want
to
be
careful

far
you
go
with

be
alright

you
know
yourself

be
it

I
know

how
you
feel

you
think
we
young
one
be
all
wrong

way
we
look
at
it

you
say
yourself
papa
how
different
thing
be
nowadays
from
the
way
they
use
to
be
when
you
begin
with
it

and
surely
papa
it
ca
n't
hurt
a
man
to
be
interesting

shake
his
head

he
do
not
so
carry
much
conviction
to
his
daughter

on
this
day
they
say
no
more
about
the
matter

and
so
Julia
begin
and
surely
she
would
win
in
the
struggle
.
she
work
every
day

very
hard
,

slowly
she
begin
to
bring
her
father

Mrs.

would
have
to
agree

no

else
's
opinion

again

have
succeed

he
like
to
hear
she
say
it

he
listen
with
amusement
,

he
approve
when
she
know
how
to
do
it
,
when
she
bring
out
with
great
fervor

with
much
repeat

great
argument
against
all
his
objection

he
always
openly
admire
the
bright
way

have
then
to
make
clear

new
faith
in
she

the
new
idea

have
of
life

then
Julia
would
be
sure
she
have
convince
he

for
how
could
a
reasonable
man
ever
resist
it

she
know
she
have
good
reason
in
she
.




and
each
day
when
their
talk
be
end
and
she
be

to

then
he
would
have
stop
listen
to
she

his
mind
would
have
sort
of
shut
up
away
from

she
still
hold
his
arm

quite
slip
away
from

full

of
a
meaning
.




and
then
he
would
for
that
time
altogether
leave
she
and
the
last
thing
he
always
would
say
to
she
,
with
the
quick
movement
he
have
when
he
feel
no
more
time
in
he
then
for
she
.
"
alright
,
yes
,
well
tomorrow
be
another
day
Julia
I
say
to
-
morrow
be
another
day
Julia
and
you
think
it
all
over
and
we
will
talk
about
it
far
,
perhaps
to
-
morrow
,
I
say
to
-
morrow
be
another
day
Julia
.
there
be
your
mother
there
now
Julia
,
you
well
go
in
now
to
she
.
"




it
be
hard
for
Julia
to
have
such
a
kind
of
resistance
fight
against
she
.
it
be
hard
for
an
impatient
and
eager
temper
to
endure
the
kind
of
a
way
her
father
always
finish
off
his
long
talk
with
she
.
it
be
hard
for
Julia
to
have
to
always
begin
over
every
time
she
start
to
talk
about
it
with
her
father
.
but
he
be
very
proud
of
she
,
she
know
very
well
his
feeling
for
she
,
she
know
very
well
too
how
to
win
he
to
agree
in
the
end
with
she
.
she
love
it
in
a
way
the
struggle
he
make
each
day
a
new
one
for
she
.
they
love
and
admire
and
respect
each
other
very
much
this
daughter
and
her
father
.
they
understand
very
well
both
of
they
how
to
please
while
they
be
combat
with
each
other
.
and
so
each
to
-
morrow
they
meet
,
and
Julia
be
sturdy
and
have
strong
faith
in
she
,
and
always
,
her
father
,
a
long
time
each
day
listen
to
she
.




Hersland
could
do
nothing
all
this
time
but
wait
for
Julia
to
persuade
her
father
.
they
be
both
agree
,
Hersland
and
Julia
,
that
any
effort
on
his
part
to
change
Mr.
Dehning
's
opinion
would
only
make
the
fight
for
Julia
so
much
hard
.
it
be
always
there
that
Mr.
Dehning
do
not
like
young
Hersland
,
and
the
noble
word
and
the
good
act
,
never
,
in
any
kind
of
a
distrusted
person
,
give
any
evidence
against
his
condemnation
.
it
be
never
fact
that
tell
,
they
be
the
same
when
they
mean
very
different
thing
.
it
be
never
fact
that
can
make
a
man
feel
any
thing
to
be
make
different
to
he
when
he
have
any
kind
of
a
judgment
in
he
.
fact
can
never
tell
he
anything
truly
about
another
man
in
his
opinion
.
it
be
always
there
,
Mr.
Dehning
somehow
do
not
trust
this
man
.
and
so
it
be
only
Julia
,
who
by
always
repeat
,
perhaps
could
find
a
way
to
change
he
.




so
Julia
struggle
every
day
,
to
have
he
,
argue
discourse
explain
and
appeal
.
she
be
always
win
but
it
be
slow
progress
like
that
in
very
steep
and
slippery
climbing
.
for
every
forward
movement
of
three
foot
she
always
slip
back
two
,
sometimes
all
three
and
often
four
and
five
and
six
and
seven
.
it
be
long
eager
steady
fighting
but
the
father
be
slowly
understand
that
his
daughter
want
this
thing
enough
to
stand
hard
by
it
and
with
such
a
feeling
and
no
real
fact
against
the
man
,
such
a
father
be
bind
to
let
she
some
time
get
married
to
he
.




"
I
tell
you
what
Julia
what
I
been
think
.
when
we
all
get
back
to
town
you
can
tell
well
whether
you
do
really
want
he
.
I
say
we
well
leave
off
all
this
talking
and
just
wait
till
we
get
home
now
again
.
I
do
n't
say
no
Julia
and
I
do
n't
say
yes
to
you
.
when
everybody
get
back
to
town
and
you
be
busy
and
run
around
with
your
girl
and
talk
and
meet
all
the
other
people
and
the
other
kind
of
young
man
,
you
can
tell
much
well
then
whether
all
this
business
be
not
all
just
talk
with
you
.
I
say
now
Julia
we
will
wait
and
just
see
how
you
feel
about
it
later
.
I
say
we
will
talk
it
all
over
when
we
get
home
and
you
be
altogether
with
all
your
friend
there
.
I
say
Julia
I
do
n't
say
no
to
you
and
I
do
n't
say
yes
yet
to
you
.
I
say
when
we
get
home
we
will
talk
it
over
again
all
together
and
then
if
nothing
turn
up
new
against
he
,
and
you
still
want
he
,
I
say
if
then
you
still
want
he
enough
to
trust
to
he
and
to
trust
to
your
own
judgment
about
he
,
we
will
see
what
we
can
do
about
he
.
"




"
alright
papa
,
"
Julia
say
to
he
,
"
alright
I
wo
n't
even
see
Alfy
any
more
till
we
get
back
to
town
then
,
and
papa
I
wo
n't
say
another
word
to
you
about
it
.
I
'll
just
go
and
ride
around
the
country
and
think
hard
the
way
you
like
to
have
I
do
it
about
what
we
both
have
say
about
it
.
"




it
be
a
well
mean
intention
this
in
Julia
of
ride
by
herself
around
the
country
and
think
hard
about
what
they
have
both
say
about
it
,
but
not
the
certain
way
to
end
in
a
passionate
young
woman
her
first
intense
emotion
.
the
wide
and
glow
meadow
of
low
oak
,
the
clean
clear
tingling
autumn
air
,
the
blaze
of
color
in
the
bit
of
wood
,
the
freedom
and
the
rush
of
rapid
motion
on
the
open
road
,
the
joy
of
live
in
a
vital
world
,
the
ecstasy
of
love
and
of
love
,
the
intensity
of
feeling
in
the
ardent
young
,
it
surely
be
not
so
that
Julia
Dehning
could
win
the
sober
reason
that
should
judge
of
man
.




and
always
every
day
it
come
and
always
every
day
when
it
be
end
it
would
be
the
same
.
"
yes
I
certainly
do
care
for
he
and
I
do
know
he
.
and
he
and
I
will
live
our
life
together
always
learn
thing
and
do
thing
,
good
thing
they
will
be
for
we
whatever
other
people
may
think
or
say
.
"




and
so
at
last
,
fill
full
with
faith
and
hope
and
fine
new
joy
she
go
back
to
her
busy
city
life
,
strong
in
the
passion
of
her
eager
young
imagining
.




the
home
the
rich
and
self
make
merchant
make
to
hold
his
family
and
himself
be
always
like
the
city
where
his
fortune
have
be
make
.
in
London
it
be
like
that
rich
and
endless
dark
and
gloomy
place
,
in
Paris
it
be
fill
with
pleasant
toy
,
cheery
and
light
and
make
of
gilded
decoration
and
white
paint
,
and
in
Bridgepoint
it
be
neither
gloomy
nor
yet
joyous
but
like
a
large
and
splendid
canvas
completely
paint
over
but
paint
full
of
empty
space
.




the
Dehning
city
house
be
of
this
sort
.
a
nervous
restlessness
of
luxury
be
through
it
all
.
often
the
father
would
complain
of
the
unreasoning
extravagance
to
which
his
family
be
addict
but
these
upbraiding
have
not
much
result
for
the
rebuke
come
from
conviction
and
not
from
any
habit
of
his
own
.




it
be
good
solid
rich
in
the
Dehning
house
,
a
parlor
full
of
ornate
marble
place
on
yellow
onyx
stand
,
chair
gold
and
white
of
various
size
and
shape
,
a
delicate
blue
silk
brocade
cover
on
the
wall
and
a
ceiling
paint
pink
with
angel
and
cupid
all
about
,
a
dining
room
all
dark
and
gold
,
a
living
room
all
rich
and
gold
and
red
with

the
german

and
large
and
dress
up
bedroom
all
light
and
blue
and
white
.
(
all
this
be
twenty
year
ago
in
the
dark
age
,
you
know
,
before
the
passion
for
the
simple
line
and
the
toned
burlap
on
the
wall
and
wooden
panelling
all
classic
and
severe
.
)
Marbles
and
bronze
and
crystal
chandelier
and
gas
log
finish
out
each
room
.
and
always
everywhere
there
be
complicated
way
to
wash
,
and
dress
table
fill
full
of
brush
,
sponge
,
instrument
,
and
way
to
make
one
clean
,
and
to
help
out
all
the
special
doctor
in
their
work
.




it
be
good
rich
in
this
house
and
here
it
be
that
Julia
Dehning
dream
of
other
world
and
here
each
day
she
grow
more
firm
in
her
resolve
for
that
free
wide
and
cultured
life
to
which
for
her
young
Hersland
have
the
key
.




at
last
it
be
agree
that
these
two
young
people
should
become
engaged
,
but
not
be
marry
for
a
year
to
come
,
and
if
nothing
new
have
then
turn
up
,
the
father
say
he
would
then
no
long
interfere
.
and
so
the
marriage
now
be
make
for
with
these
kind
of
people
an
engagement
always
mean
a
marriage
except
only
for
the
grave
cause
.
and
Alfred
Hersland
and
Julia
have
this
time
to
learn
each
other
's
nature
and
prepare
themselves
for
the
event
.




when
the
twelve
month
have
pass
away
no
grave
cause
have
come
to
make
a
reason
why
this
marriage
should
not
be
.
Julia
be
twelve
month
old
now
,
and
wise
,
and
through
this
wisdom
have
in
general
a
little
more
distrust
in
she
,
but
never
in
any
kind
of
a
way
be
she
change
about
the
new
world
she
need
now
to
content
she
and
she
be
firm
always
in
her
intention
to
marry
Alfred
Hersland
.
she
love
he
then
with
all
the
strength
of
her
eager
young
imagining
,
though
dimly
,
somewhere
,
in
her
head
and
heart
now
there
be
sometimes
a
vague
dread
that
come
of
ignorance
and
a
begin
wisdom
,
a
distrust
she
could
not
then
yet
seize
and
look
on
so
that
she
could
really
know
it
,
but
a
distrust
that
often
be
there
,
somewhere
in
the
background
,
somehow
sometimes
mix
there
to
her
sense
,
in
with
her
energy
,
her
new
faith
,
and
her
feeling
.




for
a
girl
like
Julia
Dehning
,
all
man
,
except
those
of
an
outside
unknown
world
,
these
one
read
about
in
book
and
never
really
could
believe
in
,
for
it
be
a
strange
feeling
one
have
in
one
's
later
live
,
when
one
find
the
story
-
book
really
have
truth
in
they
,
for
one
love
the
story
-
book
early
,
one
love
to
read
they
but
one
never
really
believe
there
be
truth
in
they
,
and
later
when
one
by
living
have
gain
a
new
illusion
and
a
kind
of
wisdom
,
and
one
read
again
in
they
,
there
it
be
,
the
thing
we
have
learn
since
to
believe
in
,
there
it
be
and
we
know
then
that
the
man
or
the
woman
who
write
they
have
just
the
same
kind
of
wisdom
in
they
we
have
be
spend
our
life
win
,
and
this
show
to
any
one
wise
in
learn
that
no
young
people
can
learn
wisdom
from
the
talking
of
the
old
one
around
they
.
if
they
can
not
believe
the
thing
they
read
in
the
story
-
book
where
it
be
all
make
lifelike
,
real
and
interesting
for
they
,
how
should
they
ever
learn
thing
from
old
people
's
talk
.
its
foolish
to
expect
such
thing
of
they
.
no
let
they
read
the
story
-
book
we
write
for
they
,
they
do
n't
learn
much
,
to
be
sure
,
but
more
than
they
can
from
their
father
'
,
mother

,
aunt
'
and
uncle
'
talk
.
yes
from
their
father
'
and
their
mother
'
living
they
can
get
some
wisdom
,
yes
supply
they
with
a
tradition
by
your
life
,
you

man
and
woman
,
and
for
the
rest
let
they
come
to
we
for
their
teaching
.




but
now
to
come
back
to
Julia
Dehning
.
as
I
be
say
,
to
a
girl
like
Julia
Dehning
,
all
man
,
except
those
of
an
outside
unknown
world
,
those
one
read
about
in
book
and
never
really
can
believe
in
,
or
man
like
Jameson
to
whom
one
never
could
belong
and
whom
one
always
know
,
now
after
having
once
begin
with
one
's
living
,
for
what
they
be
whenever
one
meet
with
they
,
I
say
for
a
girl
like
Julia
Dehning
,
with
the
family
with
which
she
have
all
her
life
be
live
,
to
she
all
man
that
could
be
count
as
man
by
she
and
could
be
think
of
as
belong
ever
to
she
,
they
must
be
,
all
,
good
strong
gentle
creature
,
honest
and
honorable
and
honor
.
for
she
to
doubt
this
of
all
man
,
of
decent
man
,
of
man
whom
she
could
ever
know
well
or
belong
to
,
to
doubt
this
would
be
for
she
to
recreate
the
world
and
make
one
all
from
her
own
head
.
surely
,
of
course
,
she
know
it
,
there
be
the
man
one
could
read
of
in
the
book
and
hear
of
in
the
scandal
of
the
daily
news
,
but
never
could
such
thing
be
true
of
man
of
her
own
world
.
for
she
to
think
it
in
herself
as
real
any
such
a
thing
would
be
for
she
to
imagine
a
vain
thing
,
to
recreate
the
world
and
make
a
new
one
all
out
of
her
own
head
.




no
,
this
be
a
thought
that
could
not
come
to
she
to
really
think
,
and
so
for
she
the
warning
of
her
father
carry
no
real
truth
.
of
course
Alfred
Hersland
be
a
good
and
honest
man
.
all
decent
man
,
all
man
who
belong
to
her
own
kind
and
to
whom
she
could
by
any
chance
belong
,
be
good
and
straight
.
they
have
this
as
they
have
all
simple
right
in
a
sane
and
simple
world
.
Hersland
have
besides
that
he
be
brilliant
,
that
he
know
that
there
be
thing
of
beauty
in
the
world
,
and
that
he
be
in
his
bearing
and
appearance
a
distinguished
man
.
and
then
over
and
above
all
this
,
he
be
so
freely
passionate
in
his
fervent
love
.




and
so
the
marriage
be
really
to
be
make
.
Mrs.
Dehning
now
all
reconcile
and
eager
,
begin
the
trousseau
and
the
preparation
of
the
house
that
the
young
couple
be
to
have
as
a
wedding
portion
from
the
eld
dehning
.




in
dress
,
hat
and
shoe
and
glove
and
underwear
,
and
jewel
ornament
,
Julia
be
very
ready
to
follow
her
mother
in
her
choice
and
to
agree
with
she
in
all
variety
and
richness
of
trim
in
material
,
but
in
the
furnishing
of
her
own
house
it
must
be
as
she
wish
,
teach
as
she
now
have
be
that
there
be
thing
of
beauty
in
the
world
and
that
decoration
should
be
strange
and
like
old
fashion
,
not
be
in
the
new
.
to
have
the
old
thing
themselves
have
not
yet
come
to
she
to
know
,
nor
just
how
old
be
the
good
time
that
they
should
be
.
it
be
queer
in
its
result
this
mingling
of
old
taste
and
new
desire
.




the
mother
be
all
disgusted
,
half
-
impressed
;
she
sneer
at
these
new
notion
to
her
daughter
and
brag
of
it
to
all
of
her
acquaintance
.
she
follow
Julia
about
now
from
store
to
store
,
struggle
to
put
in
a
little
her
own
way
,
but
always
she
be
beat
back
and
overbear
by
the
eagerness
of
know
and
the
hardness
of
unconsidere
disregard
with
which
her
daughter
meet
her
word
.




the
wedding
day
draw
quickly
near
with
all
this
sharp
endeavor
of
make
her
new
home
just
what
it
should
be
for
the
life
which
be
to
come
.
Julia
think
more
of
her
ideal
these
day
than
of
her
man
.
Hersland
have
always
,
a
little
,
mean
more
to
she
as
an
ideal
than
as
a
creature
to
be
know
and
love
.
she
have
make
he
,
to
herself
,
as
she
be
now
make
her
new
house
,
an
unharmonious
unreality
,
a
bring
complicated
natural
taste
to
the
simplicity
of
fitness
and
of
decoration
of
a
self
-
digest
old
world
.




I
say
again
,
this
be
all
twenty
year
ago
before
the
passion
for
the
simple
line
and
toned
green
burlap
on
the
wall
and
wooden
panelling
all
classic
and
severe
.
but
the
moral
force
be
make
then
,
as
now
,
in
art
,
all
for
the
simple
line
,
though
then
it
have
not
come
to
be
,
as
now
alas
it
be
,
that
natural
sense
for
gilding
and
all
kind
of
paint
and
complicated
decoration
in
design
all
must
be
suppress
and
thrust
away
,
and
so
take
from
we
the
last
small
hope
that
something
real
might
spring
from
crudity
and
luxury
in
ornament
.
in
those
day
there
be
still
some
freedom
leave
to
love
elaboration
in
good
workmanship
and
ornate
rococoness
and
complication
in
design
.
and
all
the
house
of
one
's
friend
and
new
school
room
and
settlement
in
slum
and
dining
hall
and
city
club
,
have
not
yet
take
on
this
modern
sad
resemblance
to
a
college
woman
's
college
room
.




Julia
Dehning
's
new
house
be
in
arrangement
a
small
edition
of
her
mother
's
.
in
way
to
wash
,
to
help
out
all
the
special
doctor
in
their
work
,
in
sponge
,
brush
,
run
water
everywhere
,
in
hygienic
way
to
air
thing
and
keep
one
self
and
everything
all
clean
,
this
house
that
Julia
be
to
make
fit
for
her
new
life
which
be
to
come
,
in
this
it
be
very
like
the
old
one
she
have
live
in
,
but
always
here
there
be
more
plunge
,
douche
,
shower
,
way
to
get
cold
water
,
luxury
in
freezing
,
in
hardening
,
than
her
mother
's
house
have
ever
afford
to
they
.
in
her
mother
's
house
there
be
many
way
to
get
clean
but
they
mostly
suggest
warm
water
and
a
certain
comfort
,
here
in
the
new
house
be
a
sterner
feeling
,
it
must
be
a
cold
world
,
that
one
could
keep
one
's
soul
high
and
clean
in
.




all
through
this
new
house
there
be
no
solid
warm
substantial
rich
.
there
be
no
silk
in
curtain
,
no
blue
brocade
here
,
no
glass
chandelier
to
make
prism
and
give
tinkling
.
here
the
parlor
be
cover
with
modern
sombre
tapestry
,
the
ceiling
all
in
tone
the
chair
as
near
to
good
colonial
as
modern
imitation
can
effect
,
and
all
about
dark
aesthetic
ornament
from
China
and
Japan
.
painting
there
be
none
,
only

,
in
dull
and
wooden
frame
.




the
dining
room
be
without
brilliancy
,
for
there
can
be
no
brilliance
in
a
real
aesthetic
aspiration
.
the
chair
be
make
after
some
old
french
fashion
,
not
very
certain
what
,
and
cover
with
dull
tapestry
,
copy
without
life
from
old
design
,
the
room
be
all
a
discreet
green
with
simple
oaken
wood
-
work
underneath
.
the
live
room
be
a
prevail
red
,
that
certain
shade
of
red
like
that
certain
shade
of
green
,
dull
,
without
hope
,
the
shade
that
so
completely
body
forth
the
ethically
aesthetic
aspiration
of
the
spare
american
emotion
.
everywhere

with

,
finish
out
each
room
.




these
be
triumphant
day
for
Julia
.
every
day
she
lead
her
family
a
new
flight
and
they
follow
after
agape
with
wonderdisapproval
and
with
pride
.
the
mother
almost
lose
all
sense
of
her
creation
of
this
original
and
brilliant
daughter
,
she
be
almost
ready
to
admit
the
obedience
and
defeat
she
now
have
in
she
.
sometimes
she
still
have
a
little
resistance
to
she
but
mostly
she
be
swell
inside
and
to
all
around
she
with
her
admiration
and
her
pride
in
this
new
wonderful
kind
of
a
daughter
.




the
father
have
always
be
convince
and
proud
even
when
he
have
disapprove
the
opinion
of
his
daughter
.
he
now
take
a
solid
satisfaction
in
the
completeness
of
accomplishment
she
now
have
in
she
.
to
her
father
,
to
know
well
what
one
want
,
and
to
win
it
,
by
patient
steady
fighting
for
it
,
be
the
good
act
a
man
or
woman
could
accomplish
,
and
well
have
his
daughter
do
it
.
she
have
win
it
,
she
know
very
well
what
she
want
and
she
have
it
.
he
still
shake
his
head
at
her
new
fangled
notion
,
her
literary
effect
,
the
artistic
kind
of
new
improvement
,
as
he
call
it
,
that
she
put
into
her
new
house
to
make
it
perfect
.
he
do
not
understand
it
and
he
always
say
it
,
but
he
be
very
proud
to
see
she
do
it
,
and
he
brag
to
everybody
and
make
they
listen
to
it
,
of
his
daughter
and
the
wonderful
new
kind
of
a
house
she
have
,
and
the
bright
way
she
know
how
to
do
it
.




the
little
Hortense
have
always
worship
this
wonderful
big
sister
,
and
the
boy
George
admire
too
,
and
follow
after
.




altogether
these
last
week
be
brilliant
day
for
Julia
.




but
always
,
a
little
,
through
all
this
pride
in
domination
and
in
the
admiration
of
her
family
,
there
be
there
,
somewhere
,
in
the
background
,
to
her
sense
,
a
vague
uncertain
kind
of
feeling
as
to
her
understanding
and
her
right
.
mostly
she
have
a
firm
strong
feeling
in
she
,
but
always
,
a
little
,
there
be
there
,
a
kind
of
a
doubt
somewhere
in
she
.
she
never
in
these
day
do
any
very
real
thinking
about
Hersland
as
a
man
to
be
to
she
as
a
husband
to
control
she
.
but
,
somehow
,
a
little
,
he
be
there
in
she
as
an
unknown
power
that
might
attack
she
,
though
she
know
very
well
she
have
in
she
a
wisdom
and
experience
of
life
that
she
could
feel
strong
now
always
inside
she
.




a
few
week
before
the
day
they
be
to
be
marry
and
to
begin
their
new
free
life
together
,
this
vague
distrust
in
Julia
become
a
little
sharp
.
Alfy
be
talk
to
her
one
night
about
the
good
life
they
be
to
have
soon
together
,
about
their
prospect
and
his
hope
for
the
future
.
"

good
scheme

my
head

through
now
I
think
I
can

Julia
somehow
be
startled
though
this
kind
of
say
in
he
be
not
new
to
she
.

he
say

and
he
be

Julia
would
not
speak
of
such
thing
now
to
her
father
.
no
torment
of
doubt
,
no
certainty
of
misery
could
bring
she
to
ask
question
of

the
new

Hersland
be
safe
,
though
very
simply
now
,
he
often
make
for
she
that
sharp
uncertain
feeling
more
dreadful
and
more
clear
before
she
.
he
be
not
different
in
his
way
or
in
his
talk
to
she
from
the
way
he
always
have
be
with
she
,
but
somehow
now
it
have
come
to
she

to
see
,
as
die
man
be
say
to
see
,
clearly
and
freely

as
they
be

not
as
she
have
wish
they
to
be
for
she
.




and
then
she
would
remember
suddenly
what
she
have
really
think
he
be
,
and
she
feel
,
she
know
that
all
that
former
thought
be
truer
well
judgment
than
this
sudden
sight
,
and
so
she
dull
her
momentary
clearing
mind
and
hug
her
old
illusion
to
her
breast

over

he
could
n't

he
only

that
papa
would
help
he
along
in

anyhow
I
will
ask
he
what
he
really

.
"




and
she
ask
he
and
he
freely
make
she
understand
just
what
it
be
he
mean
.
it
sound
well
then
,
a
little
well
as
he
tell
it
to
she
more
at
length
,
but
it
leave
she
a
foreboding
sense
that
perhaps
the
world
have
meaning
in
it
that
could
be
hard
for
she
to
understand

now
she
have
to

a
little

how
could
she
not

she
have
to
marry

so
she
have
to
think
it
so
,

she
would
think
it
so
,
and
do
.




in

just
begin
.

be
ground
about
ten
acre
large
,
fence
in
with
just
ordinary
kind
of
rail
fencing
,
it
have
a
not
very
large
wooden
house
stand
on
the
rise
ground
in
the
center

a
wind
avenue
of
eucalyptus
,
blue
gum
,
lead
from

to
the
gateway

,
just
around

pleasant
garden
,
in
front
be
green
lawn
not
very
carefully
attend
and
with
large
tree
in
the
center
whose
root
always
suck
up
for
themselves
almost
all
the
moisture
,
water
in
this
dry
western
country
could
not
be
use
just
to
keep
thing
green
and
pretty
and
so
,
often
,
the
grass
be
very
dry
in
summer
,
but
it
be
very
pleasant
then
lie
there
watch
the
bird
,
black
in
the
bright
sunlight
and
sailing
,
and
the
firm
white
summer
cloud
break
away
from
the
horizon
and
slowly
move
.
it
be
very
wonderful
there
in
the
summer
with
the
dry
heat
,
and
the
sun
burn
,
and
the
hot
earth
for
sleep
;
and
then
in
the
winter
with
the
rain
,
and
the
north
wind
blow
that
would
bend
the
tree
and
often
break
they
,
and
the
owl
in
the
wall
scare
you
with
their
tumbling
.




all
the
rest
of
the
ten
acre
be
for
hay
and
a
little
vegetable
gardening
and
an
orchard
with
all
the
kind
of
fruit
tree
that
could
be
get
there
to
do
any
growing
.




in
the
summer
it
be
good
for
generous
sweating
to
help
the
man
make
the
hay
into
bail
for
its
preserving
and
it
be
well
for
one
grow
to
eat
radish
pull
with
the
black
earth
stick
to
they
and
to
chew
the
mustard
and
find
root
with
all
kind
of
funny
flavor
in
they
,
and
to
fill
one
hat
with
fruit
and
sit
on
the
dry
plough
ground
and
eat
and
think
and
sleep
and
read
and
dream
and
never
hear
they
when
they
would
all
be
call
;
and
then
when
the
quail
come
it
be
fun
to
go
shoot
,
and
then
when
the
wind
and
the
rain
and
the

the

would
blow
the
leave
and
branch
of
the

down
around
they
and
you
could
shout
and

and
be
all
soak
and
run
out
full
into
the

her

like
it
very
well
to

in
he
when

take
the
thing
he
have
be
so
important
about
when
his

then
it
be
a
very
different
feeling
he
have
in
he
.
it
be
hard
for
he
then

ending
.
he
have
like

very
well
while
they
be

he
have
like
the
feeling
of

it
have
be
very
pleasant
to
he
.
he
never
really
have
to

he
have
all
the
emotion
and
the
important
feeling
,
it
be
just
like
in
religion
.




but
it
be
not
so
pleasant
for
he
when
the
people
come
and
take
the
thing
it
have
be
so
pleasant
selling
.
it
hurt
he
to
have
the
thing
he
love
go
away
from
he
,
and
he
want
to
give
back
the
money
to
all
of
they
so
that
he
could
keep
they
.
but
he
know
that
that
could
not
be
do
and
he
still
keep
his
important
feeling
that
be
so
pleasant
to
he
;
and
then
too
Martha
would
not
let
he
.
he
say
nothing
to
the
people
when
they
come
to
take
the
thing
it
have
be
so
pleasant
selling
to
they
,
he
be
only
very
slow
in
give
the
thing
to
they
.
he
would
lose
they
so
that
it
be
hard
to
find
they
but
the
child
and
Martha
always
find
they
.




almost
everything
be
sell
and
the
people
come
and
take
they
.
he
could
not
stop
they
.
now
the
thing
do
not
belong
to
he
any
more
.
nothing
now
belong
to
he
.
there
be
another
man
in
his
shop
and
he
act
,
in
stand
there
and
in
selling
,
just
as
if
it
have
all
always
belong
to
he
.
it
make
poor
David
Hersland
very
sad
to
see
he
stand
there
,
chop
,
talk
,
sell
,
wipe
his
hand
on
his
apron
,
act
as
if
it
have
all
always
belong
to
he
,
now
when
there
be
no
place
anymore
anywhere
for
Hersland
,
a
place
that
really
belong
to
he
.




it
be
too
late
now
,
he
have
do
as
his
Martha
have
make
he
.
he
would
have
like
to
buy
back
all

it
be
very
hard

keep
he
go
.
now
he
want
to
settle
down
again
and
keep
on
stay
.
perhaps
the
man
who
have
buy
his
shop
would
sell
it
back
to
he
if
they
would
pay
he

and
know
there
be
no
press
through
it
,
there
be
no

to
win
out
beyond
it
,
it
be
just
a
dreary
dull
dead
tired
,

you
must
learn
to
know
it

all
the
springiness
have
leave

be
a
weary
conscious
move
the
way

always
be
before

to
the
time
of

she
know

,
it
be
right
for
he
to
have
it
,
the
kind
of
a
feeling

have
about

.
it
be
a
way
he
have
,
she
be
not
impatient
with
he
,
he
be
right
to
have
that
kind
of
a
feeling
in
he
.
it
be
right
for
he
to
act
that
way
to
see
about
not
forget
.
it
be
only
that
she
know
he
would
like
it
and
it
would
be
so
good
for
the
child
that
make
she
want
to
urge
he
not
to
give
up
now
they
have
make
their
beginning
.




but
she
be
not
in
any
way
impatient
to

,
she
have
no
impatient
feeling
in
she
against
he
.
it
be
just
his
way
and
now
she
would
coax
he
and
he
would
come
back
with
she
to
the
wagon
.
it
be
only
a
way
he
always
have
have
whenever
he
have
to
do
a
new
thing
.
and
so
she
walk
a
little
with
he
and
begin
to
talk
about
the
child
and
how
nice
it
would
be
when
they
would
all
get
rich
and
how
the
child
would
like
it
to
work
and
help
he
,
and
they
sit
down
and
after
they
have
be
rest
,
when
they
get
up
again
she
do
not
do
any
discussing
,
she
just
start
he
back
toward
the
wagon
,
and
always
she
be
tell
about
how
good
he
be
to
do
what
be
good
for
she
and
the
child
.
soon
they
come
up
with
the
wagon
which
be
still
very
slowly
move
.




it
be
so
hot
do
so
much
walking
,
she
say
then
to
he
,
he
look
a
little
sick
,
she
think
he
ought
not
to
do
any
more
walking
,
perhaps
it
would
be
well
if
he
would
get
into
the
wagon
and
ride
a
little
with
the
little
child
.
it
would
be
awful
if
he
get
sick
and
nobody
to
take
care
of
they
for
he
be
the
only
one
that
could
do
their
talking
.
and
so
she
coax
he
into
the
wagon
with
the
child
.




they
go
on
and
soon
it
be
too
far
,
there
be
not
now
any
more
go
back
for
he
.
and
then
he
be
content
,
and
he
have
the
new
city
and
the
ship
,
and
then
he
be
content
with
the
new
world
around
he
.




they
have
,
for
a
little
while
,
a
hard
time
begin
,
but
on
the
whole
thing
go
very
well
with
they
.
the
son
make
money
for
they
,
the
daughter
work
and
then
get
marry
to
man
whom
they
find
make
money
around
they
.
some
do
very
well
then
and
some
not
so
well
,
and
they
all
have
their
trouble
as
all
people
have
they
,
and
some
die
,
and
some
live
and
be
prosperous
and
have
child
.
one
as
I
be
say
die
a
glutton
and
spoil
he
be
the
one
weak
thing
the
strong
mother
do
to
harm
any
of
they
.




the
old
man
never
make
much
of
a
fortune
but
with
the
help
his
child
give
he
he
live
very
well
and
when
he
die
he
leave
his
wife
a
nice
little
fortune
.
she
live
long
and
be
strong
to
the
last
and
firmly
support
and
her
back
be
straight
and
firm
and
always
she
be
like
a
great
mountain
,
and
always
she
be
direct
and
lead
all
whom
she
find
need
direct
.




she
be
then
very
old
,
and
always
well
,
and
always
work
,
and
then
she
have
a
stroke
,
and
then
another
,
and
then
she
die
and
that
be
the
end
of
that
generation
.




there
have
be
bear
to
Martha
and
David
Hersland
many
son
and
daughter
.
all
who
live
to
be
grow
up
have
get
married
and
almost
all
of
these
be
prosperous
.
one
,
the
glutton
,
die
and
leave
his
wife
and
child

,
he
have
not

the
money
to

they
.




of
the
daughter
two
of
they
be
well

.
the
third

and
then
later
in

life
start
they
out
in
their

on
the
whole

a
substantial
progress
the
family

in
all

the
mother
be
variously
mixed
to
make
they

who
be
strong
in
they
.
some
,
like

have
the
strength
and
solid
power
in
they
that
the
mother
have
it
in
she
to
give
to
all
of
they
.
Most
of
they
begin
and
keep
on
well
after
they
have
make
a
beginning
.
and
so
they
be
mostly
very
successful
in
the
business
of
living
.




in
every
one
of
they
the
father
and
mother
be
very
variously
mix
up
in
they
.
the
fourth
son
,
David
Hersland
,
one
of
the
father
we
must
soon
be
realise
so
that
we
can
understand
our
own
being
,
be
the
only
one
of
all
of
they
who
have
go
to
the
far
west
to
make
his
fortune
.
it
be
a
little
hard
to
see
just
how
the
mixture
of
this
father
and
this
mother
come
to
make
he
.
he
be
in
some
way
,
as
I
be
say
,
a
very
splendid
kind
of
person
.
he
be
big
and
abundant
and
full
of
new
way
of
thinking
,
and
this
be
all
his
mother
in
he
,
but
he
have
not
her
patient
steadfast
working
.
he
be
irritable
and
impatient
and
uncertain
and
not
always
very
strong
at
keep
go
,
though
always
he
be
abundant
and
forceful
and
joyous
and
determined
and
always
powerful
in
start
.
and
then
too
he
be
in
his
way
important
inside
to
he
as
his
father
have
be
when
he
feel
his
religion
in
he
.
but
all
this
will
show
more
and
more
in
he
as
I
tell
you
slowly
the
history
of
he
.




he
have
go
as
a
young
man
to
Gossols
to
make
his
fortune
.
this
be
the
new
world
in
a
new
world
and
it
take
this
new
part
of
this
new
world
to
content
he
.
he
alone
of
all
the
brother
have
this
restless
feeling
in
he
.
all
the
other
do
very
well
where
the
mother
have
bring
they
.
he
alone
have
need
to
go
far
to
find
for
himself
his
life
and
a
sufficient
fortune
.




as
I
be
say
he
have
bring
his
wife
to
Gossols
with
he
.
he
have
marry
she
in
Bridgepoint
where
one
of
his
sister
have
settle
with
her
man
who
make
there
a
very
good
living
.
at
this
time
David
though
he
be
quite
a
young
man
have
already
make
enough
money
to
support
he
and
a
wife
and
child
.
this
he
have
do
before
he
have
think
to
go
to
Gossols
where
he
be
to
make
his
great
fortune
.
and
so
it
be
right
for
his
sister
at
this
time
to
be
anxious
to
arrange
a
marriage
for
he
.
now
the
idea
of
go
to
the
far
west
be
just
begin
to
work
in
he
.
perhaps
marrying
might
keep
he
with
they
,
anyway
it
would
be
good
for
he
to
have
a
good
wife
to
go
to
Gossols
with
he
,
and
so
he
meet
little
Fanny
Hissen
.
it
be
arrange
by
his
sister
that
this
young
woman
should
be
married
to
he
.




Fanny
Hersland
all
her
life
be
a
sweet
gentle
little
woman
.
not
that
she
do
not
have
a
fierce
little
temper
sometimes
in
she
and
one
that
could
be
very
stubborn
,
but
mostly
she
be
a
sweet
little
gentle
mother
woman
and
only
would
be
hurt
,
not
angry
,
when
any
bad
thing
happen
to
they
.




her
mother
be
one
of
those
four
good
foreign
woman
the
grandmother
,
always
old
woman
or
as
little
child
to
we
the
generation
of
grandchild
.
these
four
good
foreign
woman
,
the
grandmother
we
need
only
to
be
just
remember
,
have
each
one
a
different
kind
of
a
foreign
man
to
be
a
master
to
they
.
these
four
foreign
woman
,
the
one
strong
to
bear
many
child
and
then
always
after
strong
to
lead
they
,
the
steady
good
one
who
be
patient
to
bear
her
many
child
and
then
always
be
patient
to
suffer
with
they
,
the
sweet
pure
one
who
die
as
soon
as
she
have
bear
all
of
they
for
that
be
all
she
know
then
to
do
for
they
,
and
the
little
gentle
weep
hopeless
one
who
sorrow
in
she
have
they
and
always
after
sorrow
in
they
,
all
these
four
foreign
woman
have
very
many
and
very
different
kind
of
child
.




the
gentle
little
hopeless
one
who
weep
out
all
the
sorrow
for
her
child
have
many
and
very
little
child
.
she
be
the
mother
of
the
pretty
gentle
little
woman
that
David
Hersland
marry
in
Bridgepoint
and
take
out
to
Gossols
with
he
.




the
little
weary
weep
mother
of
all
these
gentle
cheery
little
child
have
a
foreign
husband
who
be
not
very
pleasant
to
his
child
.
he
too
be
little
like
his
wife
and
like
all
his
child
but
there
be
a
great
deal
in
he
to
cause
terror
to
his
wife
and
child
.
he
be
like
old
David
Hersland
important
in
religion
.
it
be
very
deep
inside
he
and
with
he
it
be
much
hard
on
his
child
.
his
wife
too
have
sorrow
in
religion
,
she
have
sorrow
from
his
be
so
important
in
religion
and
she
have
sorrow
too
from
her
own
self
in
her
own
religion
.
but
then
it
be
all
sorrow
and
sadness
,
and
always
a
trickle
kind
of
weep
that
she
have
every
moment
in
her
living
,
and
it
really
be
not
much
bad
in
religion
.
it
be
just
a
way
she
have
,
this
trickling
weeping
,
even
as
when
it
sometimes
do
happen
she
be
laugh
.
she
never
ever
really
stop
her
sad
trickling
,
to
her
joy
be
as
it
have
be
say
of
laugh
,
it
be
madness
,
and
of
mirth
who
doeth
it
,
for
even
in
laughter
the
heart
be
sorrowful
and
the
end
of
that
mirth
be
heaviness
.
it
be
in
she
as
it
be
say
by
the
quaker
woman
.
I
often
think
if
I
could
be
so
fix
as
never
to
laugh
or
to
smile
I
should
be
one
step
well
,
it
fill
I
with
sorrow
when
I
see
people
so
full
of
laugh
.




it
be
a
hard
father
and
a
dreary
mother
that
give
the
world
so
many
and
such
pleasant
little
child
.
mostly
they
be
cheerful
little
child
.
perhaps
it
be
that
the
mother
have
weep
out
all
the
sorrow
for
they
.
there
be
no
weeping
that
she
have
leave
over
to
they
.
they
be
mostly
all
in
their
later
live
cheerful
hopeful
gentle
little
man
and
woman
.
they
live
without
ambition
or
excitement
but
they
be
each
in
their
little
circle
joyful
in
the
present
.
they
live
and
die
in
mildness
and
contentment
.




it
be
one
of
these
cheerful
gentle
little
Hissen
people
that
David
Hersland
marry
there
in
Bridgepoint
and
then
take
to
Gossols
with
he
.
and
now
he
with
all
the
mixed
up
father
and
strong
mother
in
he
and
this
little
gentle
cheerful
pretty
little
woman
who
yet
have
a
fierce
little
temper
that
could
be
very
stubborn
be
to
come
together
and
make
a
life
together
and
to
mix
up
well
and
then
to
have
many
different
kind
of
child
through
she
.




they
have
mix
up
very
well
.
they
have
make
a
good
enough
success
with
their
living
.




they
have
have
five
child
through
she
.
two
of
these
have
die
as
little
child
.
three
of
they
have
grow
up
and
be
now
grow
young
man
and
woman
,
and
these
three
be
of
they
who
be
to
be
always
in
this
history
of
we
young
grown
man
and
woman
to
we
,
for
it
be
only
thus
that
we
can
ever
feel
they
to
be
real
inside
in
we
,
they
who
be
of
the
same
generation
with
we
.




the
mother
,
little
gentle
Mrs.
Hersland
,
be
very
loving
in
her
feeling
to
all
of
her
child
,
but
they
have
be
always
all
three
,
after
they
have
stop
be
very
little
child
,
too
big
for
she
ever
to
control
they
.
she
could
not
lead
they
nor
could
she
know
what
they
need
inside
they
.
she
could
not
help
they
,
she
could
only
be
hurt
not
angry
when
any
bad
thing
happen
to
they
.




she
love
they
and
be
very
proud
of
all
three
of
they
.
often
she
wonder
as
she
look
at
they
,
how
could
they
be
so
perfect
and
so
wonderful
and
yet
all
three
of
they
be
so
different
from
the
other
of
they
that
there
be
hardly
anything
alike
in
the
three
of
they
.




they
be
big
child
and
each
one
of
they
in
his
own
way
be
strong
to
do
what
they
need
to
find
themselves
free
inside
they
.
they
be
big
child
and
she
be
only
a
very
little
mother
to
they
.
and
they
be
not
very
love
child
,
they
be
too
strong
at
find
their
own
way
to
feel
free
and
important
each
one
to
himself
inside
he
.
they
be
to
her
very
good
child
.
she
never
have
any
trouble
with
they
.
and
now
she
be
a
little
ail
and
they
be
good
but
then
she
never
have
be
very
important
to
they
.




now
we
begin
to
learn
more
about
the
Hersland
family
and
their
way
of
living
.




as
I
be
say
the
father
David
Hersland
be
in
some
way
a
very
splendid
kind
of
person
but
he
have
some
very
uncertain
thing
inside
he
.
he
too
be
very
proud
of
his
child
but
it
be
not
easy
for
they
to
be
free
of
he
.
sometimes
he
be
very
angry
with
they
.
sometimes
it
come
to
his
do
very
hard
pound
on
the
table
at
which
they
would
be
sit
and
dispute
,
and
end
with
the
angry
word
that
he
be
the
father
,
they
be
his
child
,
they
must
obey
he
,
he
be
master
and
he
know
how
to
make
they
do
as
he
would
have
they
.
such
scene
be
very
hard
on
the
little
gentle
mother
woman
who
be
all
lose
in
between
the
angry
father
and
the
three
big
resentful
child
who
know
very
well
what
they
need
to
have
give
to
they
so
that
they
could
be
free
inside
they
.




this
be
the
way
the
three
Hersland
child
grow
up
to
be
strong
each
one
to
be
free
inside
he
.
they
be
all
big
in
themselves
and
in
their
way
of
win
.
soon
you
will
learn
slowly
the
history
of
each
one
of
they
,
how
each
one
be
important
to
himself
in
he
,
and
how
they
win
a
kind
of
freedom
for
themselves
each
one
inside
they
.




the
little
mother
be
not
very
important
to
they
.
they
be
good
enough
child
in
their
daily
living
but
they
be
never
very
loving
to
she
inside
they
.
they
have
it
too
strongly
in
they
to
win
their
own
freedom
.




they
turn
to
their
father
,
altogether
,
in
their
thinking
.
it
be
against
he
inside
,
and
strongly
always
around
they
,
that
they
have
to
do
the
fighting
for
their
freedom
.
now
the
mother
be
a
little
ailing
.
she
be
all
lose
between
the
father
and
the
three
big
struggle
child
.




in
their
young
day
the
father
be
proud
of
his
child
,
proud
that
they
be
important
each
one
to
himself
inside
he
,
proud
that
they
need
to
win
for
themselves
their
own
freedom
.
always
then
he
encourage
their
disputing
,
he
want
then
that
they
should
fight
and
win
out
against
he
.
as
I
be
say
David
Hersland
the
father
of
these
big
resentful
child
be
in
some
way
a
splendid
kind
of
person
.
but
now
thing
be
go
less
easily
around
he
.
Joy
be
a
little
dim
inside
now
for
all
of
they
.
now
he
would
often
be
angry
and
be
give
to
pound
on
the
table
and
loudly
declare
,
he
be
the
father
,
they
be
the
child
,
they
must
obey
else
he
would
know
how
to
make
they
.
and
the
gentle
little
mother
who
every
day
be
give
sign
of
weakening
would
sit
scared
,
and
afterwards
she
would
be
weep
,
lose
between
the
father
and
the
three
big
resentful
child
.




but
this
be
all
when
they
have
become
grow
young
man
and
woman
and
joy
be
a
little
dim
inside
for
all
of
they
.




now
listen
to
their
life
as
child
,
their
early
struggle
each
one
to
find
for
themselves
freedom
,
the
abundant
father
in
they
in
those
day
full
of
joyous
beginning
,
proud
of
himself
and
of
his
child
,
glad
to
feel
that
they
be
strong
all
of
they
to
make
for
themselves
their
own
beginning
.




now
I
will
tell
you
more
of
the
Hersland
way
of
live
in
the
old
home
with
the
wind
and
the
sun
and
the
rain
beating
,
and
the
dog
and
chicken
and
the
open
life
,
and
the
hay
,
and
the
man
work
,
and
the
father
's
way
of
educate
the
three
child
so
that
they
could
be
strong
to
make
for
themselves
their
own
beginning
,
and
the
gentle
little
mother
who
be
not
very
important
to
they
,
who
have
sometimes
a
fierce
little
temper
that
could
be
very
stubborn
but
mostly
she
be
only
sad
,
not
angry
,
when
any
bad
thing
happen
to
they
,
and
the
three
child
with
the
mixed
up
father
and
the
little
unimportant
mother
in
they
.




as
I
be
say
Mr.
Hersland
be
big
and
abundant
and
always
be
very
full
of
new
way
of
thinking
.
always
he
be
abundant
and
joyous
and
determined
and
always
powerful
in
start
.
also
sometimes
he
would
be
irritable
and
impatient
and
uncertain
.
also
he
be
in
his
way
important
inside
to
he
,
and
all
these
thing
come
out
in
his
educating
of
his
child
.




truly
he
love
education
.
it
be
to
he
almost
all
there
be
of
living
.
he
do
not
do
it
with
steadfast
steady
work
,
thing
always
be
a
little
uncertain
with
he
.
one
never
know
which
way
it
would
break
out
from
he
the
thing
he
be
very
good
at
start
and
then
other
thing
would
happen
to
he
and
to
all
the
people
around
who
be
dependent
on
he
.




it
be
a
very
good
kind
of
live
the
Hersland
child
have
in
their
beginning
,
and
their
freedom
in
the
ten
acre
where
all
kind
of
thing
be
grow
,
where
they
could
have
all
anybody
could
want
of
joyous
sweating
,
of
rain
and
wind
,
of
hunting
,
of
cow
and
dog
and
horse
,
of
chop
wood
,
of
make
hay
,
of
dream
,
of
lie
in
a
hollow
all
warm
with
the
sun
shine
while
the
wind
be
howl
,
of
know
all
queer
poor
kind
of
people
that
live
in
this
part
of
Gossols
where
the
Herslands
be
live
and
where
no
other
rich
people
be
live
.
and
so
they
grow
up
with
this
kind
of
living
,
such
kind
of
queer
poor
,
for
they
,
people
around
they
,
such
uncertain
way
of
get
education
that
they
have
from
the
father
's
passion
for
all
kind
of
educating
,
from
his
strong
love
of
start
and
the
uncertain
thing
he
have
inside
he
.




altogether
it
be
a
good
way
of
live
for
they
who
have
a
passion
to
be
free
inside
they
and
this
be
true
of
all
three
of
the
Hersland
child
but
mostly
with
Martha
the
eld
and
the
only
daughter
live
,
and
the
young
David
who
be
always
search
to
decide
in
he
and
no
one
could
ever
understand
he
,
from
day
to
day
what
life
mean
to
he
to
make
it
worth
his
living
.
it
be
less
in
Alfred
,
this
love
of
freedom
,
in
Alfred
who
be
soon
now
to
be
marry
Julia
Dehning
.
he
have
some
of
it
in
he
but
not
so
strongly
inside
he
as
Martha
and
David
and
his
father
have
it
in
they
.
yes
I
say
it
again
now
to
all
of
you
,
all
you
who
have
it
a
little
in
they
to
be
free
inside
they
.
I
say
it
again
to
you
,
we
must
leave
they
,
we
can
not
stay
where
there
be
none
to
know
it
,
none
who
can
tell
we
from
the
low
from
they
who
be
simply
poor
or
bad
because
they
have
no
other
way
to
do
it
.
no
here
there
be
none
who
can
know
it
,
we
must
leave
ourselves
to
a
poor
thing
like
Alfred
Hersland
to
show
it
,
one
who
be
a
little
different
with
it
,
not
with
real
singularity
to
be
free
in
it
,
but
it
be
well
with
he
than
to
have
no
one
to
do
it
,
and
so
we
leave
it
,
and
we
leave
the
Alfred
Herslands
to
do
it
,
poor
thing
to
represent
it
,
singularity
to
be
free
inside
with
it
,
poor
thing
and
hardly
our
own
in
it
,
but
all
we
can
leave
behind
to
show
a
little
how
some
can
begin
to
do
it
.




yes
real
singularity
we
have
not
make
enough
of
yet
so
that
any
other
one
can
really
know
it
.
I
say
vital
singularity
be
as
yet
an
unknown
product
with
we
,
we
who
in
our
habit
,
dress
-
suit
case
,
clothe
and
hat
and
way
of
thinking
,
walk
,
make
money
,
talk
,
have
simple
line
in
decorate
,
in
way
of
reform
,
all
with
a
metallic
click
like
the
type
-
writing
which
be
our
only
way
of
thinking
,
our
way
of
educating
,
our
way
of
learning
,
all
always
the
same
way
of
do
,
all
the
way
down
as
far
as
there
be
any
way
down
inside
to
we
.
we
all
be
the
same
all
through
we
,
we
never
have
it
to
be
free
inside
we
.
no
brother
singular
,
it
be
sad
here
for
we
,
there
be
no
place
in
an
adolescent
world
for
anything
eccentric
like
we
,
machine
making
do
not
turn
out
queer
thing
like
we
,
they
can
never
make
a
world
to
let
we
be
free
each
one
inside
we
.




and
yet
a
little
I
have
make
it
too
strong
against
we
in
say
Alfred
Hersland
be
the
only
one
who
could
in
this
adolescent
world
represent
we
.
the
father
David
Hersland
we
can
not
count
for
we
,
it
be
an
old
world
that
give
he
the
stamp
to
be
different
from
the
adolescent
world
around
we
.
but
there
be
still
some
hope
for
we
in
the
young
David
who
be
different
from
the
people
all
around
we
,
in
he
who
always
be
seek
to
be
free
inside
he
,
to
know
it
in
he
,
and
no
one
could
ever
understand
he
,
what
it
be
inside
he
that
make
it
right
that
he
should
go
on
with
his
living
.
he
as
you
shall
hear
in
the
history
of
he
,
do
not
really
belong
to
the
adolescent
metallic
world
around
he
,
and
yet
there
be
not
that
vital
steadfast
singularity
inside
he
that
custom
passion
and
a
feel
for
mother
earth
can
breed
in
man
.
he
do
not
have
it
really
for
he
,
custom
,
passion
,
certainty
of
place
and
mean
of
living
,
stability
within
himself
and
around
he
,
a
feeling
to
be
really
free
inside
he
and
strong
to
be
singular
in
his
clothe
and
in
his
way
of
living
.




but
now
to
make
again
a
beginning
,
to
tell
of
the
father
David
Hersland
and
the
way
he
have
in
he
to
make
himself
strong
and
important
inside
to
he
and
to
prove
the
right
way
to
educate
his
child
and
the
singularity
the
old
world
have
stamp
on
he
.




David
Hersland
believe
in
harden
his
child
.
he
believe
that
everyone
should
make
for
himself
his
own
beginning
,
that
every
one
should
win
for
himself
his
own
freedom
.
this
be
always
strong
inside
he
with
all
the
uncertain
way
that
he
have
in
he
,
with
all
the
strong
start
and
sudden
change
in
his
way
of
educate
the
three
child
who
have
such
different
way
in
they
from
the
thing
he
mean
to
give
they
.




mostly
at
first
they
the
child
feel
this
in
he
in
the
way
they
be
ashamed
of
he
in
just
the
simple
way
he
have
of
do
in
the
ordinary
every
day
live
.




it
be
hard
on
child
when
the
father
have
queer
way
in
he
.
even
when
they
love
he
they
can
never
keep
themselves
from
have
shame
inside
they
when
all
the
people
be
look
and
wonder
and
laugh
and
give
he
a
name
for
the
queer
way
of
he
.




Mr.
Hersland
as
I
have
be
often
say
be
in
some
way
a
splendid
kind
of
person
,
and
that
be
one
way
one
could
look
at
he
.
in
other
way
he
be
an
uncertain
changeful
angry
irritable
kind
of
a
person
with
a
strong
feeling
of
be
important
to
himself
inside
he
and
not
always
certain
to
make
other
man
see
why
he
have
so
much
important
feeling
in
he
.
and
then
one
could
think
of
he
,
as
child
when
they
be
young
girl
and
boy
feel
he
,
queer
in
the
way
he
have
of
do
thing
that
make
they
feel
a
little
ashamed
to
say
he
be
a
father
to
they
when
other
child
speak
about
he
.




these
be
some
of
the
queer
way
he
have
in
he
,
the
way
that
make
his
child
feel
uncomfortable
beside
he
.
they
be
mostly
just
simple
thing
in
their
ordinary
living
that
give
his
child
this
uncomfortable
feeling
for
he
.




David
Hersland
be
a
big
man
.
he
be
big
in
the
size
of
he
and
in
his
way
of
thinking
.
his
eye
be
brown
and
little
and
sharp
and
pierce
and
sometimes
dance
with
laugh
and
often
angry
with
irritation
.
his
hand
would
be
quiet
a
long
time
and
then
impatient
in
their
moving
.
his
hair
be
grey
now
,
his
eyebrow
long
and
rough
and
they
could
give
his
eye
a
very
angry
way
of
look
,
and
yet
one
could
love
he
,
in
a
way
one
be
not
afraid
of
he
.
he
never
would
go
so
far
as
his
irritation
seem
to
drive
he
,
and
somehow
one
always
know
that
of
he
.
he
have
not
so
much
terror
for
his
child
as
father
with
more
kindness
and
more
steadfast
way
of
do
.
one
always
have
a
kind
of
feeling
that
what
one
need
to
protect
one
from
he
be
to
stand
up
strongly
against
he
.
he
would
stop
short
of
where
he
seem
to
be
go
,
anger
be
there
but
it
would
not
force
he
on
to
the
final
end
of
angry
acting
.
all
one
have
to
do
be
to
say
then
to
he
"
alright
but
I
've
get
a
good
right
to
my
opinion
.
you
start
we
in
this
way
of
do
,
you
have
no
right
to
change
now
and
say
that
its
no
way
for
we
to
be
act
.
"
and
so
each
one
of
the
three
child
,
Martha
,
Alfred
and
David
would
each
in
their
own
way
resist
he
,
and
it
make
a
household
where
there
be
much
fierce
talking
and
much
frowning
,
and
then
the
father
would
end
with
pound
on
the
table
and
threaten
and
say
that
he
be
the
father
they
be
the
child
,
he
be
the
master
,
they
must
obey
else
he
would
know
the
way
to
make
they
.
and
the
little
unimportant
mother
would
be
all
lose
then
in
between
the
angry
father
and
the
three
big
resentful
child
.
but
all
this
be
when
they
be
begin
to
be
grow
young
man
and
woman
.
when
they
be
still
child
there
be
not
any
fierceness
in
the
house
among
they
.




and
now
to
come
back
to
the
queer
way
of
he
.
as
I
be
say
the
father
be
a
big
man
.
he
like
eat
,
he
like
strange
way
of
educate
his
child
and
he
be
always
change
,
and
sometimes
he
be
very
generous
to
they
and
then
he
would
change
toward
they
and
it
would
be
hard
for
they
to
get
even
little
thing
that
they
need
in
the
position
that
be
give
to
they
by
their
father
's
fortune
and
large
way
of
living
.




in
the
street
in
his
walking
,
and
it
be
then
his
child
be
a
little
ashamed
of
he
,
he
always
have
his
hat
back
on
his
head
so
that
it
always
look
as
if
it
be
fall
,
and
he
would
march
on
,
he
be
a
big
man
and
love
walking
,
with
two
or
three
of
his
child
follow
behind
he
or
with
one
beside
he
,
and
he
always
forget
all
about
they
,
and
everybody
would
stop
short
to
look
at
he
,
accustom
as
they
be
to
see
he
,
for
he
have
a
way
of
toss
his
head
to
get
freedom
and
a
way
of
mutter
to
himself
in
his
thinking
and
he
have
always
a
movement
of
throw
his
body
and
his
shoulder
from
side
to
side
as
he
be
argue
to
himself
about
thing
he
want
to
be
change
,
and
always
he
have
the
important
feeling
to
himself
inside
he
.




and
then
as
I
be
say
he
be
a
big
man
and
he
be
very
fond
of
eat
,
he
have
have
a
brother
who
have
die
a
glutton
,
and
he
like
to
buy
thing
that
look
good
to
he
,
and
it
would
always
be
a
very
big
one
,
he
never
like
to
undertake
anything
that
be
not
large
in
its
beginning
.
the
only
time
in
his
life
that
he
ever
take
a
little
thing
be
when
he
choose
his
wife
the
little
gentle
Fanny
Hissen
who
as
I
have
often
be
say
could
only
be
sad
not
angry
when
any
bad
thing
happen
to
they
,
but
yet
she
have
a
fierce
little
temper
in
she
that
could
be
very
stubborn
when
it
be
well
rouse
inside
she
and
she
sometimes
have
such
a
sharp
angry
feeling
at
some
of
the
way
her
husband
have
of
do
,
mostly
when
it
concern
his
not
give
thing
she
think
they
need
to
the
child
.
but
mostly
they
live
very
well
together
the
father
and
mother
and
three
child
,
that
be
when
they
be
young
child
,
later
it
be
hard
for
they
when
the
father
would
get
his
very
angry
feeling
and
the
mother
be
a
little
ail
and
the
fierce
little
temper
break
into
weakness
and
helplessness
inside
she
and
the
three
big
struggle
young
grown
man
and
woman
be
seek
each
one
his
own
freedom
and
his
own
beginning
.
but
now
as
child
it
be
just
the
little
uncomfortable
feeling
of
be
ashamed
of
the
queer
way
he
have
of
do
that
his
child
have
to
endure
with
he
,
then
he
be
joyous
and
it
be
mostly
pleasant
enough
live
with
he
,
and
the
mother
be
gentle
and
pleasant
then
with
they
and
strong
enough
to
support
her
little
temper
that
could
be
very
stubborn
whenever
it
arise
against
he
.




but
even
when
he
be
not
do
really
queer
thing
there
be
always
a
marked
character
about
he
.
it
come
from
inside
he
,
from
the
strong
way
he
have
of
beginning
,
from
the
important
feeling
he
have
always
inside
he
from
his
continual
thinking
and
in
a
different
way
from
that
in
which
all
the
other
people
around
about
he
be
think
,
and
this
thinking
somehow
mark
he
even
when
he
be
just
simply
walk
and
then
stop
to
talk
with
somebody
or
just
stop
to
ask
a
question
of
some
stranger
or
to
talk
about
the
weather
or
other
just
ordinary
enough
talk
,
the
kind
of
thing
anybody
could
be
say
,
and
yet
the
power
of
be
free
inside
he
make
he
a
marked
man
even
then
,
and
nobody
could
take
he
to
be
an
ordinary
person
or
ever
forget
he
.




as
he
would
be
walk
along
with
a
child
beside
he
or
several
of
they
behind
he
,
he
would
stop
and
sweep
the
prospect
with
his
cane
and
begin
talk
and
somebody
near
he
would
come
to
listen
.
it
be
just
ordinary
talk
that
he
would
be
do
,
about
the
weather
or
the
country
or
the
fruit
and
it
do
not
seem
to
have
any
deep
meaning
but
it
be
the
power
and
completeness
of
the
identification
of
this
big
man
with
all
creation
that
force
people
to
think
of
he
.
this
man
be
big
as
all
the
world
in
his
beginning
,
it
be
nothing
in
he
even
if
he
do
not
always
keep
go
,
he
have
be
as
big
as
all
the
world
once
in
his
feeling
and
that
he
never
could
lose
with
he
.




and
so
he
would
stand
talk
and
the
unhappy
uncomfortable
child
beside
he
would
keep
say
,
when
he
be
not
afraid
to
break
in
on
he
,
"
come
on
papa
all
those
people
be
look
.
"




"
what
!
"
the
father
be
not
listen
to
he
but
would
keep
right
on
with
his
talking
.
the
child
as
much
as
he
dare
would
twitch
or
pull
at
he
,
"
what
!
"
but
the
father
never
really
hear
he
and
he
would
go
on
with
the
queer
way
in
he
.
slowly
his
child
learn
endurance
of
he
.
later
in
their
life
they
be
queer
too
like
he
.




often
when
he
be
walk
with
his
child
and
pass
a
shop
and
see
some
fruit
or
cake
or
something
that
please
he
he
take
it
and
give
it
to
his
child
and
they
would
be
most
uncomfortable
then
and
say
something
about
not
want
it
to
he
.
"
what
!
"
and
he
never
listen
to
they
.
the
child
suffer
so
because
they
be
not
sure
that
the
man
inside
know
that
their
father
would
pay
he
.
the
father
of
course
always
pay
for
they
but
there
be
something
in
the
manner
of
he
that
give
one
a
kind
of
feeling
that
he
be
as
big
as
all
the
world
about
he
,
one
include
the
other
in
they
,
the
world
and
he
,
the
earth
the
sky
the
people
around
he
the
fruit
the
shop
,
it
be
all
one
and
the
same
,
all
of
it
and
he
,
and
this
kind
of
a
feeling
he
always
give
to
they
who
see
he
walk
stand
thinking
talk
,
that
the
world
be
all
he
,
there
be
no
difference
in
it
in
he
,
and
the
fruit
inside
or
outside
he
there
be
no
separation
of
he
or
from
he
,
and
the
whole
world
he
live
in
always
live
inside
he
.




it
be
all
so
simply
to
he
as
the
world
as
all
he
,
and
it
be
this
that
give
he
a
big
freedom
and
this
big
important
feeling
and
the
big
way
of
beginning
and
so
make
a
queer
man
of
he
,
an
eccentric
from
the
other
around
he
,
and
all
that
stop
it
from
make
a
god
of
he
be
his
way
of
be
impatient
inside
he
and
not
be
very
good
at
keep
go
but
always
make
for
himself
a
new
beginning
.




this
large
way
of
he
when
it
make
he
take
up
fruit
from
shop
to
eat
and
to
give
to
his
child
make
a
very
uncomfortable
shamed
child
beside
he
,
and
it
would
be
protest
to
he
,
and
its
father
would
say
,
"
what
,
"
but
he
never
listen
to
he
.
the
child
never
do
learn
that
the
fruit
man
would
not
be
worried
with
he
,
that
they
all
know
his
father
and
the
queer
way
of
he
,
and
that
the
father
always
pay
they
.
the
fruit
man
all
know
he
and
like
the
abundant
world
embrace
feeling
of
he
and
they
like
to
see
he
,
but
his
child
never
could
lose
,
until
they
grow
up
to
be
queer
themselves
each
one
inside
he
,
the
uncomfortable
feeling
that
his
queer
way
give
they
.




to
he
,
David
Hersland
,
education
be
almost
the
whole
of
living
.
in
it
be
always
the
making
of
a
new
beginning
,
the
have
idea
,
and
often
change
.
and
then
there
be
so
many
way
of
consider
the
question
.




there
be
so
many
different
way
of
see
the
meaning
of
the
various
part
that
make
education
.
there
be
the
health
,
the
mind
,
the
notion
of
right
living
,
the
learning
cooking
and
all
useful
thing
that
he
know
they
should
know
now
to
be
do
,
and
then
there
be
his
system
of
hardening
so
that
they
would
be
ready
to
make
each
one
their
own
beginning
;
and
all
these
need
for
they
and
the
many
way
to
look
at
they
lead
to
many
queer
thing
that
his
child
have
to
endure
from
he
.




their
education
be
a
mixing
of
hardening
,
of
force
themselves
into
a
kind
of
living
as
if
they
be
poor
people
and
have
no
one
to
do
thing
for
they
,
with
a
way
of
be
very
rich
,
that
be
have
everything
the
father
ever
could
imagine
would
do
any
good
to
any
one
of
they
.




this
make
a
queer
mixture
in
they
.
they
find
it
a
great
trouble
to
they
,
this
past
education
,
when
they
first
begin
to
be
young
grown
man
and
woman
.
later
in
their
living
they
like
it
that
they
have
have
such
a
mixing
of
be
rich
and
poor
,
together
,
in
they
.




as
child
they
all
three
have
love
very
well
this
kind
of
living
.
as
I
be
say
they
have
their
ten
acre
,
with
a
rose
hedge
to
fence
their
joy
in
,
in
that
part
of
Gossols
where
no
other
rich
people
be
live
.
they
have
all
around
they
,
for
they
,
poor
people
to
know
in
their
daily
living
,
and
from
they
they
learn
their
way
which
be
queer
way
for
they
who
have
from
their
father
's
fortune
a
very
different
kind
of
position
to
be
natural
to
they
.




in
Gossols
the
Herslands
could
be
free
inside
they
than
if
the
father
have
remain
with
his
brother
where
the
mother
have
bring
they
and
this
freedom
he
use
in
the
education
of
his
child
.
they
never
know
any
one
of
they
nor
the
father
who
be
direct
it
for
they
just
where
their
learning
be
come
from
or
how
it
would
touch
they
.
Mr.
Hersland
have
all
kind
of
way
of
see
education
.
he
be
fondest
of
all
of
the
idea
of
hardening
but
this
be
difficult
for
he
to
keep
steadfast
in
he
with
his
great
interest
in
every
kind
of
new
invention
,
in
want
that
his
child
should
always
have
anything
that
could
do
any
good
to
any
one
of
they
.




there
be
joy
in
they
all
in
their
later
living
that
it
have
be
Gossols
where
they
have
have
their
youthful
feeling
and
later
when
they
learn
to
know
other
young
grown
man
and
woman
they
love
the
freedom
that
they
have
inside
they
,
that
their
father
have
in
his
queer
way
win
for
they
.
as
I
be
say
they
have
ten
acre
where
they
have
every
kind
of
fruit
tree
that
could
be
get
there
to
do
any
growing
,
and
they
have
cow
and
dog
and
horse
and
hay
making
,
and
the
sun
in
the
summer
dry
and
bake
,
and
the
wind
in
the
autumn
and
in
the
winter
the
rain
beat
and
then
in
the
spring
time
the
hedge
of
rose
to
fence
all
these
joy
in
.




the
mother
have
always
be
accustomed
to
a
well
to
do
middle
class
living
,
to
keep
a
good
table
for
her
husband
and
the
child
,
to
dress
herself
and
her
child
in
simple
expensive
clothing
,
to
have
the
child
get
as
present
whatever
any
one
of
they
want
to
have
at
that
time
to
amuse
they
.
she
be
a
sweet
contented
little
woman
who
live
in
her
husband
and
her
child
,
who
could
only
know
well
to
do
middle
class
living
,
who
never
know
what
it
be
her
husband
and
her
child
be
work
out
inside
they
and
around
they
.
she
have
strongly
inside
she
the
sense
of
be
mistress
of
the
household
,
the
wife
of
a
wealthy
and
good
man
and
the
mother
of
nice
child
.
when
they
be
little
child
they
like
to
cuddle
to
she
when
she
take
they
out
to
visit
the
rich
people
who
live
in
the
other
part
of
Gossols
.
they
be
all
bashful
child
,
live
as
they
do
in
the
part
of
the
town
where
no
rich
people
be
live
and
so
be
use
to
poor
queer
kind
of
people
and
only
feel
really
at
home
with
they
who
be
not
people
in
the
position
that
their
father
's
fortune
and
large
way
of
living
would
naturally
make
companion
for
they
.
and
so
as
little
child
when
they
go
to
visit
with
their
mother
in
the
part
of
Gossols
where
other
rich
people
be
live
,
they
clung
to
she
or
on
the
sofa
where
she
would
be
sit
and
talk
,
they
climb
behind
she
,
and
then
too
she
wear
seal
-
skin
and
pleasant
stuff
for
child
to
rub
against
and
feel
as
rich
thing
to
touch
and
have
near
they
and
so
they
like
to
go
with
she
,
and
this
and
the
habit
of
be
child
with
a
mother
be
mostly
all
of
the
feeling
that
they
have
for
she
until
later
when
she
be
ail
and
the
little
stubborn
temper
in
she
break
into
weakness
and
helplessness
inside
she
and
they
have
in
a
way
to
be
good
to
she
.




they
always
in
a
way
be
good
to
she
that
be
as
much
as
they
could
remember
to
think
about
she
,

it
be
not
important
inside
to
any
of
they
to
remember
about
she
neither
when
as
child
they
be
near
she
or
when
later
she
be
ail
and
need
they
to
be
good
to
she
.




she
be
a
little
unimportant
mother
always
to
they
and
it
be
only
as
a
part
of
the
physical
home
around
they
that
she

go
out
visit
to
that
part
of
Gossols
where
the
other
rich
people
be

.
she
could
know
the
value
of
they
and
the
way
other
people
must
feel
toward
they
but
these
thing
give
she
no
strong
feeling
of
be
important
to
they
,
the
other
people
,
who
do
not
come
close
to
she
in
her
daily
living
.
with
they
it
be
only
a
continue
of
she
well
to
do
living
which
be
the
only
kind
of
living
it
be
right

well
to
do
good
husband
and
nice
child
and
all
in
simple
and
expensive
clothing
,
but
in
the
ten
acre
place
in
that
part
of
Gossols
where
no
other
rich
people
be
live
she
be
cut
off
from
a
lively
feeling
of
this
right
kind
of
living
.
here
it
be
she
herself
who
be
important
to
her
feeling
,
here
she
be
not
only
a
right
part
of
a
right
way
of
living
,
as
it
have
be
for
she
in
Bridgepoint
in
her
family
in
the
way
the
Hissens
have
always

but
she
have
an
individual
feeling
,
not
with
her
child
they
be
completely
of
she
and
apart
from

the
right
well
to
do
middle
class
living
,
it
be
always
there
so
be
her
child
but
they
be
not
important
to
her
feeling
.
the
thing
that
make
she
important
to
herself
in
her
feeling
be
the
sometimes
control
her
husband
by
her
little
temper
when
it
arise
to
be
fierce
inside
she
and
the
stubborn
way
it
sometimes
give
she
in
acting
,
and
in
be
mistress
and
decide
and
be
above
they
and
yet
in
their
daily
living
and
so
interfere
with
the
seamstress
and
governess
and
servant
and
all
the
people
they
ever
have
work
for
they
.
be
cut
off
from
the
simple
rich
ordinary
way
of
living
never
give
she
any
feeling
.
it
be
not
be
cut
off
with
any
sense
of
lose
,
it
be
always
there
exist
,
in
she
and
for
she
,
this
kind
of
living
and
it
be
not
important
to
her
feeling
.
it
be
as
if
one
could
ever
be
think
about
the
different
kind
of
air
in
different
part
of
the
world
where
one
happen
to
be
live
,
the
atmosphere
of
well
to
do
living
be
to
she
as
the
air
she
be
breathe
,
it
be
always
there
she
could
not
feel
it
important
in
her
feeling
or
her
thinking
,
breathing
be
there
,
one
do
not
know
it
as
important
to
one
's
feeling
until
one
be
in
some
way
sick
and
it
stop
or
make
hard
one
's
breathing
,
but
so
long
as
one
be
strong
and
live
one
go
on
like
everybody
else
with
one
's
breathing
.
and
so
it
be
with
Mrs.
Hersland
and
well
to
do
live
,
she
could
not
feel
it
to
be
important
in
her
feeling
whether
it
be
in
the
rich
part
of
Gossols
that
they
be
live
,
or
in
Bridgepoint
,
or
in
the
part
of
Gossols
where
no
other
rich
people
be
live
.
always
she
be
of
well
to
do
be
,
with
a
good
rich
husband
and
nice
child
and
when
she
want
to
have
it
simple
and
expensive
clothing
.
the
sense
of
belong
to
this
kind
of
living
could
never
give
she
any
kind
of
important
feeling
.
her
husband
David
Hersland
with
the
queer
nature
of
he
might
have
an
important
feeling
come
to
he
from
just
breathing
,
that
feeling
could
come
to
he
from
the
singular
nature
of
he
,
from
his
be
as
big
as
all
the
world
in
his
beginning
,
but
to
an
ordinary
gentle
little
mother
woman
there
could
never
come
such
a
feeling
,
this
well
to
do
live
could
only
come
to
be
important
to
she
in
her
feeling
if
she
could
ever
come
to
it
through
a
losing
,
by
their
money
go
or
by
their
lose
position
by
some
wrong
doing
,
and
such
a
kind
of
lose
it
could
never
come
to
Mrs.
Hersland
to
ever
think
of
as
come
to
they
.
and
so
visit
and
be
,
well
to
do
living
and
her
child
,
these
never
give
she
a
strong
feeling
of
be
important
inside
she
through
they
,
it
be
only
through
her
husband
and
the
governess
and
seamstress
and
servant
and
dependent
that
she
could
ever
have
an
individual
kind
of
feeling
.
it
be
queer
that
her
child
be
to
she
like
well
to
do
living
,
not
important
to
her
feeling
.
as
I
be
say
David
Hersland
have
make
a
decent
fortune
even
before
he
have
leave
Bridgepoint
.
he
have
make
enough
money
to
give
his
wife
and
child
a
good
position
.
and
so
when
they
first
come
to
Gossols
where
he
be
to
make
for
himself
a
great
fortune
they
could
afford
to
live
in
as
good
a
hotel
as
be
then
there
exist
.

well
in

to
they
.
here
Mrs.

a
little
lonesome
.




Mrs.
Hersland
have
leave
friend
and
family
feel
behind
she
.
here
in
Gossols
it
would
have
be
natural
for
she
to
find
other
people
to
continue
with
she
the
well
to
do
living
which
be
the
only
right
way
of
be
to
she
.




they
live
for
a
year
in
that
part
of
Gossols
where
all
the
rich
people
be
live
.
here
she
have
her
first
important
feeling
.
here
she
meet
a
Miss
Sophie
Shilling
and
her
sister
Pauline
Shilling
and
their
mother
old
Mrs.
Shilling
.




always
Mrs.
David
Hersland
have
be
a
right

after
the

way
that
make
all
they

these
be
the
hard
to
live
with
and
never

when
they
have
be
hurt
or
angry
by
something
some

woman
be
gentle
cheerful
little
man
and
woman
,
mostly
they
live

present
.
mostly
they
live
and
die
in

contentment
.




until
they
be
all
really

and
succeed
in
shut
they
all
up
to
be
always
with

.
this
be
not
in
he
from
any
small
feeling
inside
he
but
from
the
important
feeling
he
have
in
he
of
be
all
there
be
for
he
of
religion
and
it
be
his
sense
of
the
right
way
for
they
to
be
as
child
that
make
he
shut
they
up
so
and
keep

there
close
to

later
when

when
they

they
belong
there
and
he
hold
they
shut
in
with
he
,
when
they
leave
he
,
grow
up
man
and
woman
,
it
be
no
long
for
he
to
act
upon
they
,
they
no
long
be
his
necessary
way

living
.
it
be
never
his

,
his
power
over
they
when
they
be
shut
up
with

any
kind
of

no
it
be
his
be
all
there
be
of

,
not
his

nothing
in
such
a
way
could
give
he
an
important
feeling
.
they
be
his
daily
living
,
the
necessary
right
way
of
do
,
they
be
not
important

in
he
that
come
from
they
either
as
they
be
or
as
he
make
they
.
such
thing
could
never
come
to
he
as
an
important
feeling
of
himself
inside
he
.
it
be
only
be
all
there
be
of
religion
that
give
he
such
an
important
feeling
.




it
be
queer
unless
you
really
could
understand
he
,
could
really
see
how
the
important
feeling
come
to
be
in
he
,
it
be
certainly
queer
to
just
ordinary
thinking
to
see
a
man
who
have
be
so
rigid
with
his
child
,
keep
they
shut
up
with
he
,
make
they
live
every
minute
as
he
would
have
they
,
have
no
power
with
anyone
who
do
not
live
so
with
he
,
it
be
queer
that
when
these
child
come
to
be
grow
man
and
woman
,
that
be
independent
and
live
away
from
he
,
that
he
never
in
any
way
want
to
keep
his
hold
on
they
.
he
have
for
they
then
as
much
affection
as
he
ever
have
have
for
they
,
he
always
go
to
see
they
and
be
open
and
friendly
with
they
but
not
in
any
way
have
he
ever
any
kind
of
desire
in
he
to
interfere
with
they
or
their
way
of
living
or
their
thinking
or
their
doing
,
no
not
even
with
their
feeling
in
religion
.
they
be
his
child
,
yes
,
but
not
now
a
part
of
his
necessary
living
,
even
when
,
as
he
do
some
year
before
die
,
even
when
he
be
live
with
one
of
they
who
with
her
husband
have
very
different
way
of
living
,
of
thinking
,
and
of
feeling
,
in
religion
than
he
have
it
in
he
,
even
then
he
never
interfere
with
they
who
be
now
independent
of
he
,
grow
man
and
woman
.
the
only
thing
that
give
he
an
important
feeling
be
be
all
there
be
of
religion
.
when
his
child
be
shut
in
with
he
they
be
a
part
of
he
,
they
have
to
do
with
his
necessary
way
of
be
,
they
have
to
live
in
his
important
feeling
,
with
his
be
all
there
be
of
religion
,
but
when
they
have
leave
he
,
when
later
he
even
live
with
they
,
they
be
then
no
long
a
part
of
he
,
he
be
then
,
all
alone
,
all
there
be
of
religion
.
by
that
time
his
wife
too
have
leave
he
,
have
die
away
and
leave
he
.
always
in
her
living
she
have
never
be
quite
of
he
,
she
have
be
cut
off
from
he
,
by
she
have
from
her
constant
trickling
cry
an
almost
important
feeling
.
and
so
this
old
man
who
be
to
himself
all
there
be
of
religion
,
to
whom
religion
and
himself
be
all
there
be
of
living
,
who
have
keep
his
child
close
shut
up
with
he
every
minute
of
their
living
until
they
be
for
he
grow
up
man
and
woman
this
old
man
who
never
have
have
any
power
in
he
for
any
one
who
be
not
shut
up
with
he
,
this
old
man
have
a
queer
way
of
be
almost
perfect
in
his
toleration
of
thing
that
be
all
different
from
his
way
of
thinking
and
feeling
and
believe
,
even
with
religion
,
even
with
his
child
,
now
when
they
be
independent
of
he
.




so
strong
be
it
in
he
,
this
tolerate
spirit
toward
they
when
they
be
grow
man
and
woman
to
he
,
that
even
when
later
in
their
living
they
sometimes
ask
he
to
guide
they
he
would
refuse
it
to
they
,
for
they
be
then
apart
from
he
,
he
be
all
there
be
of
religion
,
religion
be
all
there

for
he
;
that
make
he
important
to
himself
inside
he

it
be
not
for
he
to
guide
they
they
who
be
apart
from

,
then

have
be
,
he
have
no
power
over
anything
not
shut
up
with
he
,
and
so
he
have
a
tolerant
spirit
for
everything
that
be
not
he
,
for
his
child
now
when
they
be

that
they
be
apart
from
he
be
grow
man
and
woman
to
he
,
even
though
they
be
all
together
every
minute
with
he
,
although
he
be
up
to
the
last
moment
of
die
as
strong
as
ever
in
the
faith
of
he
,
to
be
himself
and
to
be
all
there
be
of
religion
,
yet
now
it
be
not
for
he
to
ever
in
any
way
interfere
with
any
one
of
they
.
he
never
find
out
anything
that
be
happen
,
anything
that
he
would
not
wish
to
know
that
any
one
of
they
be
do
.
what
a
man
do
not
know
can
never
be
a
worry
to
he
.
this
be
his
answer
to
his
child
whenever
any
one
of
they
want
to
explain
anything
to
he
or
to
get
he
to
agree
to
any
new
thing
in
their
living
.
and
so
he
go
on
to
the
last
minute
of
his
living
,
never
having
have
any
power
in
he
over
any
one
who
be
not
shut
up
with
he
and
a
necessary
part
of
his
living
,
strong
always
in
his
be
to
himself
all
that
be
be
of
religion
,
strong
in
know
that
religion
be
all
there
be
of
be
.
and
so
he
go
on
with
his
living
,
now
never
interfere
with
anybody
's
living
,
now
that
he
be
himself
for
himself
all
there
be
of
living
,
all
there
be
of
religion
,
and
religion
always
be
all
there
be
of
living
.
and
so
he
go
on
to
his
dying
and
through
his
being
so
all
himself
all
there
be
of
living
and
of
religion
,
he
be
in
his
old
age
full
of
toleration
,
and
slowly
in
his
die
it
be
a
great
death
that
meet
he
.
he
be
himself
all
there
be
of
he
,
all
there
be
of
religion
,
and
religion
be
all
there
be
of
live
for
he
,
and
so
the
die
from
old
age
that
come
slowly
to
he
all
come
together
to
be
he
.
he
be
religion
,
death
could
not
rob
he
,
he
could
lose
nothing
in
his
dying
,
he
be
all
that
there
be
of
he
,
all
there
be
of
religion
,
and
religion
be
all
there
be
of
living
,
and
so
he
,
die
of
old
age
,
without
struggle
,
meet
himself
by
himself
in
his
dying
,
for
religion
be
everlasting
,
and
so
for
he
there
could
be
no
ending
,
he
and
religion
and
living
and
dying
be
all
one
and
everything
and
every
one
and
it
be
for
himself
that
he
be
all
one
,
live
,
die
,
being
,
and
religion
.




even
his
dead
wife
with
her
trickling
crying
that
have
be
to
she
almost
an
important
feeling
of
herself
inside
she
,
even
she
have
be
apart
from
he
,
and
his
child
when
they
be
no
long
shut
up
with
he
be
apart
from
he
.
all
and
everything
be
apart
from
he
,
and
so
he
die
,
and
with
he
die
his
important
feeling
,
for
even
in
his
dying
he
have
no
power
in
he
for
any
one
not
shut
up
with
he
.
he
be
all
of
power
for
he
for
he
be
for
himself
all
there
be
of
religion
.
and
that
be
all
and
he
never
have
have
any
power
in
he
for
anything
not
shut
up
with
he
.
and
so
he
die
away
and
leave
they
and
his
important
feeling
die
inside
he
.




all
of
his
child
have
each
mix
up
in
they
the
father
,
important
to
himself
in
his
religion
,
and
the
mother
,
with
she
almost
important
feeling
,
with
her
constant
trickling
crying
that
make
she
have
inside
she
she
almost
important
feeling
.
she
with
the
way
it
come
from
within
she
this
almost
important
feeling
that
she
have
inside
she
,
could
have
a
power
with
all
who
know
she
.
she
be
not
like
her
husband
with
his
important
feeling
give
power
only
with
they
like
his
little
child
who
be
shut
up
with
he
.




the
child
have
many
way
of
have
the
father
and
the
mother
mix
up
to
make
they
.
one
of
they
,
as
I
be
say
,
the
eld
of
they
,
be
stubborn
and
gloomy
and
hard
in
her
religion
and
it
give
she
a
power
with
her
child
but
it
be
not
so
perfect
to
give
she
her
own
important
feeling
as
religion
have
be
to
her
father
to
give
he
the
important
feeling
that
be
all
he
.
in
her
own
being
she
be
not
all
there
be
of
religion
,
she
as
a
woman
have
hard
way
that
give
her
power
,
not
from
her
religion
but
from
her
power
as
a
woman
,
as
any
one
can
have
it
by
use
the
hard
way
everybody
have
inside
they
,
and
so
she
be
less
in
religion
,
she
have
no
toleration
,
she
be
hard
stubborn
and
gloomy
in
religion
,
and
always
she
make
it
strong
by
her
power
as
a
woman
,
and
so
she
have
not
the
greatness
in
she
that
her
father
have
who
make
she
,
and
she
have
not
the
almost
greatness
in
she
that
the
mother
have
arise
inside
she
with
the
dreary
trickling
cry
that
be
all
she
.
and
so
in
each
one
the
father
and
the
mother
be
variously
mix
up
in
they
.
some
of
they
have
it
in
they
as
an
almost
important
feeling
like
Fanny
Hissen
who
with
this
way
of
have
it
as
a
beginning
,
the
almost
important
feeling
that
the
mother
have
with
her
dreary
trickling
have
it
bring
to
a
real
beginning
of
a
really
important
feeling
,
by
the
know
old
fat
Mrs.
Shilling
and
her
daughter
Sophie
Shilling
and
her
other
daughter
Pauline
Shilling
,
and
then
in
her
later
living
cut
off
from
a
lively
sense
of
be
part
of
be
which
be
for
she
the
natural
way
of
living
she
get
it
more
and
more
then
from
her
servant
and
governess
and
seamstress
and
dependent
and
the
for
her
poor
queer
kind
of
people
that
she
have
around
she
in
this
later
live
in
that
part
of
Gossols
where
no
other
rich
people
be
live
,
she
get
it
from
her
power
with
they
,
be
as
she
be
with
they
of
they
,
and
from
her
position
and
her
dignity
of
Hissen
live
always
above
they
.
from
those
way
that
she
later
live
in
that
part
of
Gossols
away
from
where
the
other
rich
people
be
live
give
to
she
,
in
this
later
living
there
come
to
she
a
kind
of
importance
of
herself
inside
she
that
be
nearly
an
individual
kind
of
feeling
and
this
be
what
give
to
her
family
later
when
she
come
to
pay
visit
to
they
out
of
the
far
west
to
they
,
give
they
a
sense
as
if
she
be
almost
a
princess
for
they
,
out
of
from
they
,
belong
to
they
,
have
a
different
feeling
of
herself
inside
she
from
any
other
one
of
they
.
not
that
this
be
,
in
she
,
in
any
sense
the
complete
thing
of
be
important
to
herself
inside
she
,
it
be
only
more
mark
in
she
than
any
other
of
they
have
find
it
from
the
natural
way
of
living
it
have
come
to
all
the
rest
of
they
to
be
lead
.




it
be
not
different
in
she
from
the
rest
of
they
in
one
important
thing
.
it
be
mix
up
in
she
with
the
stubborn
feeling
that
the
not
have
the
complete
important
feeling
that
the
father
have
from
be
all
there
be
of
religion
give
to
all
of
they
who
have
a
little
of
he
in
they
.




all
of
they
,
as
they
have
more
or
less
of
he
in
they
,
have
it
as
a
stubborn
feeling
,
for
none
of
they
have
it
as
a
complete
thing
as
he
have
have
it
inside
he
,
and
with
the
eld
of
they
,
as
I
be
say
,
she
who
have
most
of
the
religion
,
with
she
it
be
a
hard
gloomy
stubborn
feeling
and
so
this
eld
one
who
have
as
much
important
feeling
as
the
Fanny
who
have
live
away
from
they
and
then
have
have
in
she
come
this
for
they
important
thing
,
this
eld
of
they
although
she
be
a
power
to
all
the
rest
of
they
by
reason
of
the
important
feeling
they
know
inside
she
for
they
,
be
never
a
princess
to
they
,
she
have
not
the
gentleness
and
generous
dignity
that
win
they
as
their
other
sister
have
for
they
she
who
have
have
make
to
she
the
important
feeling
of
herself
inside
she
by
the
be
away
from
all
of
they
,
away
from
the
natural
way
of
live
for
they
.




then
there
be
other
of
they
who
have
all
the
sweetness
in
they
that
have
turn
to
dreary
trickle
in
the
mother
who
have
bear
all
they
,
and
one
of
those
who
have
this
sweetness
in
her
dignity
and
gentleness
and
generous
way
and
so
be
a
power
to
they
be
the
one
that
the
father
live
with
after
his
dreary
wife
have
die
away
and
leave
they
.




with
these
who
have
sweetness
in
they
,
with
those
who
have
change
into
sweetness
the
dreary
trickling
of
the
mother
that
have
bear
they
,
many
of
they
,
strong
in
they
after
the
sweetness
and
gentle
dignity
that
make
they
,
have
it
as
the
strong
thing
inside
they
to
be
hurt
not
angry
when
any
bad
thing
happen
to
they
,
they
would
be
hurt
then
and
their
mouth
would
be
droop
.
and
always
all
of
these
,
the
sweetest
of
they
,
have
in
they
some
of
the
stubbornness
that
not
be
the
complete
thing
as
their
father
have
be
was
sure
to
put
into
they
.




in
some
of
they
the
mixing
of
the
trickling
and
the
stubbornness
inside
they
come
to
make
an
angry
feeling
that
come
in
flash
from
they
,
in
some
of
they
it
come
to
make
a
suspicious
feeling
inside
they
that
make
it
hard
for
they
to
trust
in
woman
or
in
man
,
and
always
,
as
I
be
say
,
the
father
and
the
dreary
mother
be
very
variously
mix
up
in
each
one
of
they
.




as
I
be
say
,
one
of
they
who
even
more
than
Fanny
Hissen
have
the
almost
important
feeling
that
the
mother
have
inside
she
with
her
constant
trickling
crying
that
be
always
rise
in
she
,
this
one
come
to
have
it
even
more
in
she
,
come
to
have
it
almost
really
in
she
by
an
individual
kind
of
thinking
that
arise
of
itself
inside
she
.
she
have
the
gentle
tenderness
in
she
that
make
constant
dreary
trickle
in
her
mother
,
and
it
come
all
from
inside
she
,
and
she
have
no
stubborn
way
in
she
,
she
be
pure
as
the
sweet
one
of
those
around
she
those
who
have
turn
to
sweetness
the
dreariness
of
their
mother
,
and
she
have
not
stubbornness
inside
she
,
she
have
only
from
her
father
the
thinking
that
have
make
he
for
himself
to
be
all
there
be
of
power
.
and
this
one
of
the
Hissen
woman
come
very
near
to
win
,
come
very
near
to
seeing
,
come
very
nearly
make
of
herself
to
herself
a
really
individual
being
.
she
be
a
little
not
strong
enough
in
keep
go
,
and
so
with
she
it
come
only
to
be
a
very
nearly
really
important
feeling
of
herself
to
herself
inside
she
.
and
she
be
the
near
any
of
they
ever
come
to
win
.




there
be
very
many
of
they
and
each
one
,
of
course
,
have
his
or
her
own
individual
way
of
feeling
,
thinking
,
and
of
do
,
and
with
all
of
they
the
father
and
the
mother
be
variously
mix
up
in
they
,
and
with
some
of
they
it
be
more
the
father
and
it
make
sometimes
a
stubborn
feeling
to
be
the
most
important
thing
inside
they
after
the
family
that
make
all
they
and
sometimes
this
the
stubborn
feeling
meet
in
they
with
the
other
thing
they
have
within
they
and
sometimes
then
it
be
a
sharp
bright
angry
feeling
that
be
strong
in
they
after
the
family
way
that
have
make
all
they
,
and
these
then
would
have
a
stubborn
or
an
angry
feeling
when
anything
happen
to
any
one
of
they
.
and
then
in
some
of
they
it
be
the
dreary
mother
that
be
strong
in
they
and
they
have
a
sweetness
in
they
and
these
then
would
have
hurt
feeling
in
they
and
very
often
with
they
then
,
their
mouth
would
be
droop
and
these
would
then
be
hurt
not
angry
when
any
bad
thing
happen
to
they
.
and
sometimes
there
be
a
mixing
up
of
all
these
way
together
in
they
.




but
mostly
all
of
they
be
cheerful
hopeful
contented
man
and
woman
,
mostly
they
live
without
ambition
or
excitement
but
they
be
each
in
their
little
circle
joyful
in
the
present
.
mostly
they
live
and
die
in
mildness
and
contentment
.




David

enough

at
this
time
to
arrange

marriage
for
he
.
the
idea
of

in
he
.
perhaps
marrying
might
keep
he
from

any
way
it
would
be
good
for
he
to

soon
after
the
first
meeting
and
then
they
mix
up
their
two
nature
in
they
and
then
through
they
there
come
the
three
child
,
Martha
,
Alfred
,
and
young
David
,
and
these
three
be
of
they
who
be
to
be
always
in
this
history
of
we
young
grown
man
and
woman
to
we
.
in
the
history
of
they
we
will
be
always
ourselves
and
our
friend
inside
they
for
so
we
know
they
those
who
be
for
we
always
young
grown
man
and
woman
to
we
even
when
they

age
of
child
or
later
grow
old
man
and
woman
.
always
they
be
we
and
we
they
and
so
always
they
be
for
we
young
grown
man
and
woman
.




so
now
then
we
begin
again
this
history
of
we
and
always
we
must
keep
in
we
the
knowledge
of
the
man
and
woman
who
as
parent
and
grandparent
come
together
and
mix
up
to
make
we
and
we
must
have
always
in
we
a
lively
sense
of
these
mother
and
these
father
,
of
how
they
live
and
marry
and
then
they
have
we
and
we
come
to
be
inside
we
in
we
.
we
must
realise
always
in
we
,
so
that
we
can
know
what
be
we
,
we
must
realise
inside
we
their
life
and
marriage
and
feeling
and
how
they
all
slowly
come
to
make
we
.
all
thing
in
they
must
be
important
to
we
.
and
so
we
must
know
slowly
inside
we
how
they
come
to
be
marry
and
so
make
we
,
and
we
must
know
,
so
that
we
can
know
what
we
feel
inside
we
,
we
must
know
the
kind
of
important
feeling
in
they
that
make
they
what
they
be
in
their
living
marrying
and
thinking
,
the
thing
that
be
always
inside
they
,
the
thing
that
give
each
one
of
they
their
individual
feeling
.




in
the
slow
history
of
three
of
those
who
be
to
be
always
in
this
history
of
we
young
grown
man
and
woman
to
we
,
in
the
slow
history
of
Martha
Alfred
and
young
David
Hersland
,
of
how
they
come
each
one
to
have
their
kind
of
important
individual
feeling
inside
they
in
they
,
in
this
slow
history
of
they
the
thing
that
we
have
as
a
beginning
be
the
history
of
Fanny
Hissen
and
David
Hersland
,
of
their
living
marrying
and
their
important
feeling
,
and
so
now
we
leave
the
rest
of
the
Hissen
live
and
begin
with
Fanny
and
David
Hersland
and
their
marrying
and
then
we
go
on
with
the
important
feeling
that
be
always
in
he
and
the
important
feeling
and
its
beginning
in
she
with
the
new
kind
of
living
,
and
then
in
her
later
live
how
she
come
to
be
so
strong
in
this
important
feeling
that
when
she
come
back
to
Bridgepoint
to
visit
the
rest
of
they
,
the
Hissens
who
have
lead
the
for
they
natural
way
of
living
,
she
be
then
a
kind
of
princess
to
they
.
they
do
not
know
,
any
of
they
,
what
it
be
that
make
she
so
different
from
they
.
it
be
only
her
kind
of
feeling
,
rich
way
and
simple
and
expensive
clothing
and
far
western
living
could
never
give
they
the
sense
of
she
be
as
a
princess
to
they
,
it
be
that
she
have
in
she
,
from
her
way
of
living
that
be
not
the
natural
way
of
live
for
she
,
it
be
from
this
living
that
have
come
to
she
and
from
the
mother
who
have
be
begin
again
inside
she
that
she
have
come
to
have
a
small
almost
important
feeling
of
herself
inside
she
.
this
make
she
different
from
the
other
of
they
.
only
the
eld
of
they
have
it
as
a
power
in
she
,
an
important
feeling
of
herself
inside
she
,
and
they
all
could
not
bear
it
from
she
for
she
have
no
sweetness
toward
they
in
she
.
but
all
this
history
of
she
will
come
later
.
now
David
Hersland
be
to
be
married
to
she
and
she
be
to
leave
her
family
feel
all
behind
she
.




later
there
will
be
more
talk
of
the
natural
Hissen
way
of
living
.
later
when
the
Hersland
child
have
grow
to
be
ready
to
begin
their
later
living
then
we
will
know
more
of
some
of
they
,
of
some
of
the
Hissen
family
in
the
,
for
they
,
natural
way
of
living
,
of
what
it
be
in
each
one
of
they
that
make
he
different
from
the
other
of
they
,
even
though
they
have
not
ever
inside
in
they
a
really
individual
feeling
.
the
mixture
in
they
of
the
father
who
be
to
himself
all
there
be
of
living
and
the
dreary
mother
who
have
almost
an
important
feeling
be
different
in
every
one
of
they
.
later
Alfred
and
young
David
come
to
know
they
the
gentle
cheerful
Hissen
man
and
woman
.
Alfred
later
live
with
some
of
they
.
when
he
come
to
college
he
stay
with
they
and
later
he
be
there
near
they
when
he
be
married
to
Julia
Dehning
.
and
then
young
David
stay
with
some
of
they
and
always
he
be
puzzle
himself
and
they
and
no
one
of
they
could
help
he
,
but
they
all
be
kind
and
listen
to
he
,
he
be
puzzle
in
he
every
day
to
find
out
what
it
be
that
could
make
life
worth
his
living
.
Martha
Hersland
never
come
to
see
they
,
she
have
her
trouble
far
from
all
of
they
and
then
she
go
out
of
her
trouble
back
to
Gossols
and
so
she
never
see
they
.
in
american
teaching
marrying
be
just
love
but
that
be
not
enough
for
marry
.
love
be
alright
as
a
beginning
but
then
there
be
marry
and
that
be
very
different
.
in
many
town
there
be
many
in
each
generation
,
decent
well
to
do
man
,
who
keep
on
in
their
daily
living
and
never
come
to
any
marrying
.
they
all
do
a
little
love
.
everybody
sometime
do
a
little
loving
.
it
take
more
for
marry
,
sometimes
it
need
a
sister
of
the
man
to
make
his
marrying
,
sometimes
the
mother
of
the
girl
who
be
to
be
married
to
he
.
mostly
it
be
not
the
mother
of
the
man
nor
any
sister
who
have
not
already
then
a
husband
and
child
who
make
marriage
for
they
.
mostly
for
marry
it
take
a
sister
of
the
man
,
one
who
have
already
for
herself
a
husband
and
child
or
a
mother
of
the
girl
who
be
to
be
married
to
he
.
this
be
not
so
when
they
be
young
,
the
man
and
woman
,
and
both
be
lively
in
the
feeling
of
love
.
it
be
so
when
the
man
have
come
to
be
fix
in
his
way
of
living
,
when
he
find
it
pleasant
to
go
on
as
he
be
do
.
it
be
then
that
it
be
not
enough
to
feel
a
little
love
,
it
take
then
his
sister
,
or
the
girl
herself
if
she
be
strong
to
do
the
work
for
win
,
or
a
mother
of
the
girl
,
to
get
the
man
really
ripe
for
marry
.




the
american
teaching
be
very
well
for
young
people
or
for
poor
one
or
for
those
who
be
strong
in
a
sense
of
loving
,
who
have
a
lively
sense
of
wanting
,
who
have
strongly
the
instinct
for
mating
,
but
for
most
of
they
,
the
well
to
do
,
comfortable
man
and
woman
,
it
take
more
to
make
a
marriage
for
they
,
it
take
other
who
be
strong
to
help
they
,
who
have
strongly
inside
they
the
need
that
all
the
world
keep
on
go
,
who
have
strongly
inside
they
the
sense
of
the
right
way
of
living
.
mostly
those
who
have
a
strong
sense
inside
they
of
the
right
way
of
living
,
of
have
all
the
world
go
on
to
marry
be
the
sister
of
the
man
,
they
who
have
already
then
for
themselves
a
man
and
child
,
and
the
mother
of
the
girl
who
be
to
be
married
to
the
man
,
and
sometimes
it
happen
that
the
mother
of
the
man
have
strongly
inside
she
this
sense
of
right
doing
,
those
mother
who
be
not
strong
in
jealous
feeling
whose
son
be
not
as
lover
to
they
,
and
this
be
the
way
it
happen
to
almost
all
the
comfortable
well
to
do
man
and
woman
and
the
american
tradition
make
we
lie
about
they
and
mostly
in
our
writing
there
be
none
of
these
ordinary
,
good
enough
,
comfortable
,
well
to
do
man
and
woman
.




american
teaching
say
it
be
all
love
but
all
who
know
many
family
of
woman
,
all
who
know
comfortable
well
to
do
man
with
a
regular
way
of
living
know
that
it
be
all
mostly
lie
that
say
it
be
love
that
be
strong
to
make
a
beginning
,
they
need
a
sister
who
have
already
for
herself
her
own
man
and
child
or
a
girl
who
be
strong
to
make
for
herself
her
own
winning
or
the
mother
of
the
girl
who
be
to
be
married
to
he
.
it
take
one
and
sometimes
even
all
three
of
they
and
with
it
a
fair
amount
of
love
to
make
the
marrying
of
well
to
do
man
and
woman
.
love
be
good
but
it
have
to
be
a
very
lively
sense
inside
he
to
make
it
enough
for
a
well
to
do
man
to
get
married
to
a
woman
.
love
be
good
,
and
the
girl
have
to
be
pleasing
to
he
,
but
it
need
coax
,
arrange
,
flattering
teasing
,
urge
,
a
little
good
temper
irritated
force
,
or
else
the
man
will
forget
all
about
his
loving
.
it
be
so
easy
to
forget
a
little
love
.
and
then
he
must
see
she
very
often
and
when
he
be
drift
he
must
be
bring
back
out
of
his
forgetting
.
and
it
be
right
that
they
should
do
this
for
he
else
how
would
there
be
the
right
kind
of
marry
,
how
would
there
come
to
be
exist
the
decent
,
honest
enough
,
comfortable
man
and
woman
that
never
get
in
the
american
tradition
any
recognition
,
but
they
be
always
in
the
world
exist
these
decent
well
to
do
man
and
woman
with
the
not
very
lively
sense
in
they
of
love
and
their
easy
forgetting
,
and
there
be
the
woman
,
they
be
always
exist
,
they
who
have
inside
they
strongly
the
right
feeling
of
how
the
world
be
in
its
beginning
and
how
it
must
keep
on
go
.
and
so
there
be
the
right
kind
of
marry
and
decent
well
to
do
father
and
good
mother
be
always
exist
who
have
a
decent
loyal
feeling
of
the
right
kind
of
love
and
they
have
their
child
and
so
they
keep
on
go
and
we
decent
respectable
well
to
do
comfortable
good
people
be
all
of
they
.
this
business
of
marry
and
loving
be
very
different
with
the
very
young
,
or
poor
or
with
quite
old
man
.
with
all
of
these
love
be
strong
inside
they
,
they
be
not
so
peaceable
with
their
forgetting
,
they
be
quick
with
marry
than
comfortable
well
to
do
young
man
.




they
be
many
family
of
woman
and
the
man
find
some
in
each
one
of
they
pleasing
,
and
then
the
man
go
drift
,
do
a
little
love
and
then
a
little
forgetting
,
and
then
restart
,
until
they
get
so
strongly
the
feeling
of
love
,
if
they
have
the
right
kind
of
helping
,
that
they
come
to
have
so
strongly
in
they
the
feeling
of
love
that
then
it
be
an
effort
for
they
to
begin
again
with
their
forgetting
,
and
then
they
be
ripe
for
marrying
,
and
one
of
the
family
of
woman
have
he
and
marry
content
they
and
they
have
the
right
kind
of
live
for
they
and
everything
keep
on
as
it
be
in
the
beginning
.
it
be
the
truth
that
I
have
be
tell
.

.
she

whenever
it
be

one
of
all
of
they
to
arrange
a
marriage
for
a
brother
who
need
to
have
a
good
wife
to
go
out
to
Gossols
with

.
Martha
be
very
like
her
father
.
she
be
a
small
good
enough
look
woman
with
blue
eye
and
with
a
manner
that
be
not
very
unpleasing
.
she
be
like
her
father
because
she
love
to
be
important
,
but
with
she
it
be
not
in
religion
.
she
be
different
from
he
because
she
love
to
be
do
.
she
love
to
be
important
by
the
doing
of
all
the
thing
that
be
right
to
do
to
her
feeling
.
one
of
these
thing
be
the
marry
her
brother
so
that
he
would
have
a
good
wife
to
follow
he
and
serve
he
.
she
think
a
great
deal
about
it
and
she
do
a
good
deal
of
talk
and
at
last
she
decide
to
choose
Fanny
Hissen
.




Martha
,
David
Hersland
's
sister
,
who
always
do
whatever
it
be
right
for
she
to
do
,
to
her
feeling
,
be
not
very
unpleasing
.
in
some
way
she
be
quite
pleasing
,
she
be
so
to
her
husband
,
to
he
she
be
very
pleasing
.
she
be
not
really
pleasing
to
her
brother
David
Hersland
,
to
he
she
be
not
appeal
nor
domineering
and
it
take
woman
of
these
two
kind
to
be
pleasing
to
he
,
but
he
know
she
be
a
good
woman
who
would
always
do
what
be
right
for
she
to
do
to
her
feeling
,
and
mostly
he
think
she
be
right
in
her
feeling
and
in
her
way
of
do
what
be
right
to
her
feeling
and
so
he
be
willing
that
she
should
choose
a
wife
to
content
he
.




to
her
husband
this
Martha
be
almost
always
pleasing
.
he
be
a
big
man
with
strong
passion
in
he
and
a
sentimental
feeling
and
he
want
a
wife
,
not
to
be
domineering
,
but
to
hold
he
with
her
attraction
,
and
always
to
be
equal
to
he
.
he
do
not
want
a
wife
to
appeal
to
he
,
he
would
not
have
one
to
domineer
over
he
.
it
be
his
sentimental
feeling
that
make
he
not
want
his
wife
to
be
appeal
,
he
want
to
make
she
an
ideal
to
he
.
he
be
a
man
to
be
master
in
his
living
and
so
he
never
would
have
a
wife
to
domineer
over
he
.




Martha
Hersland
who
be
married
to
he
be
just
right
for
he
.
she
be
the
woman
to
hold
he
and
this
one
can
see
from
the
nature
of
she
as
it
will
come
out
from
she
in
the
history
of
she
as
she
make
the
marriage
for
her
brother
.




in
some
way
Martha
be
not
very
pleasing
,
she
be
a
woman
to
make
a
beginning
and
to
keep
on
go
when
it
be
right
to
do
so
,
to
her
feeling
.
when
she
meet
with
strong
woman
she
would
not
stop
herself
from
win
,
she
would
not
know
that
she
be
then
lose
she
only
drop
out
of
that
working
and
make
for
herself
a
new
beginning
.
she
be
not
a
strong
woman
,
as
her
mother
have
be
,
the
mother
who
be
like
a
mountain
,
who
have
it
in
she
to
uphold
around
she
,
her
man
,
her
family
,
and
everybody
whom
she
see
need
directing
.
Martha
be
not
in
such
a
way
a
strong
woman
,
she
be
not
in
any
such
way
pleasing
.
she
be
like
her
father
in
her
important
feeling
,
but
she
be
strong
than
he
ever
have
be
,
in
keep
go
,
she
be
fonder
of
make
a
beginning
,
she
always
like
to
be
do
,
and
so
she
be
not
very
pleasing
,
in
some
way
she
be
very
pleasing
.




it
be
this
that
we
must
use
as
a
beginning
to
understand
this
kind
of
woman
,
to
feel
what
she
be
do
in
arrange
a
marriage
for
her
brother
David
to
content
he
,
to
see
what
she
have
strongly
inside
she
of
an
important
feeling
,
to
know
why
she
have
the
right
way
of
do
whatever
be
right
to
her
feeling
in
the
business
of
living
,
to
know
how
her
husband
could
find
she
so
satisfying
,
to
find
out
how
she
be
pleasing
.




Martha
be
a
good
woman
in
do
whatever
it
be
right
for
she
to
do
,
to
her
feeling
.
she
be
fond
of
do
,
good
at
make
a
beginning
,
and
almost
strong
enough
to
keep
on
go
.
it
be
always
all
right
for
she
when
there
be
not
any
strong
person
resist
,
for
then
she
be
always
strong
enough
to
keep
on
go
and
then
,
though
mostly
,
not
altogether
win
,
she
come
then
near
enough
to
win
to
give
to
she
her
important
feeling
.
she
would
not
end
in
any
kind
of
win
if
any
other
one
keep
up
any
resist
,
then
Martha
would
not
know
she
be
lose
,
she
would
begin
with
some
other
beginning
and
so
she
never
could
lose
her
important
feeling
.
her
husband
listen
to
her
talk
,
he
know
what
she
do
from
her
telling
,
she
be
not
strong
to
be
domineering
,
she
be
strong
enough
not
to
be
appeal
,
she
be
always
attractive
to
he
,
she
fill
up
his
sentimental
feeling
,
she
be
an
ideal
to
he
with
no
power
to
disturb
he
,
she
be
always
pleasing
to
he
.
as
I
be
say
her
brother
do
not
find
her
pleasing
but
he
know
she
be
a
good
woman
,
he
feel
that
she
be
mostly
right
in
her
feeling
and
in
her
way
of
do
,
he
be
willing
that
she
should
choose
a
wife
for
he
to
content
he
and
he
be
right
to
let
she
choose
for
he
.




Martha
's
husband
have
a
cousin
who
have
once
work
for
old
Mr.
Hissen
.
this
cousin
and
his
wife
come
to
know
they
enough
to
see
they
very
often
.
there
be
not
many
people
who
come
to
know
they
enough
to
see
they
very
often
.
the
old
man
Hissen
have
his
wife
and
child
shut
up
with
he
as
much
and
as
long
as
he
could
keep
they
.
one
of
they
,
the
eld
girl
among
they
,
the
one
that
have
most
in
she
,
of
all
of
they
,
of
religion
,

see
they
and
she
want
he
and
he
want
she
to
take
care
of
he
,
and
then
they
make
the
father
consent
to
their
marrying
.
perhaps
he
like
it
well
that
they
have
no
good
prospect
before
they
.
Marrying
should
be
a
sorrow
to
they
,
and
the
mother
sorrow
in
they
,
live
be
all
sadness
and
she
know
that
it
would
be
so
for
they
.
anyway
they
be
married
and
they
be
live
happily
enough
when
the
wife
do
not
feel
too
strongly
her
importance
in
religion
.
now
that
they
be
marry
the
old
folk
do
not
interfere
with
they
.

a
good
deal
of

and
another
of
the
Hissen
sister
,
one
of
the
pleasantest
of

.
it
be
a
good
chance
for
she
for
the
brother
of
the
cousin
be
a
very
well
to
do
man
and
he
be
a
good
enough
man
though
a
very
stupid
and
a
dull
one
.
it
be
a
good
chance
for
one
of
they
and
this
one
,
one
of
the
pleasant
one
of

grow
angry
and
that
be
the
end
of
her
marrying
.
she
never

again
to
the
point
of
have
a
man
want
she
to
content
he
.
there
be
a
number
of
the

to
they
.
they
do
not
have
in

then
the

they
do
not
have
any

could
never

or
woman
.




to
the
Hissen
woman
this
Martha
be
always
a
little
common
.
but
they
be
wrong
in
their
feeling
.
this
Martha
be
not
really
inside
she
even
a
little
common
,
it
be
her
hard
way
of
thinking
that
give
the
Hissens
such
a
feeling
.
it
be
that
she
do
not
have
in
she
any
fine
feeling
.
all
the
Hissen
man
and
woman
have
fine
feeling
.
this
Martha
do
not
have
any
fine
feeling
but
she
be
not
common
in
her
feeling
.
in
Martha
it
be
a
hard
way
of
thinking
that
be
deceive
.




any
way
the
Hissen
girl
who
be
come
now
to
be
woman
and
who
begin
to
feel
in
they
the
liking
to
have
man
choose
they
to
content
they
,
be
very
willing
to
let
this
Martha
do
what
they
could
not
do
themselves
with
the
fine
kind
of
feel
they
all
have
in
they
.
not
that
Martha
ever
have
a
common
match
make
feeling
or
ever
want
to
do
anything
except
just
what
it
be
right
for
she
to
do
to
her
feeling
.
it
be
not
a
common
or
mean
feeling
that
make
Martha
do
what
she
do
for
they
.
it
be
a
strong
sense
of
what
be
right
for
she
to
do
in
the
business
of
live
to
make
the
world
go
on
as
it
be
in
the
beginning
;
it
be
too
,
that
she
have
a
feeling
for
the
gentle
dignity
that
be
the
most
important
thing
in
all
Hissen
man
and
woman
so
that
they
could
not
help
themselves
to
win
for
themselves
the
thing
every
one
need
to
have
for
his
living
.




and
so
it
come
that
she
choose
Fanny
Hissen
to
be
the
one
that
should
be
married
to
her
brother
David
Hersland
who
need
now
to
have
a
wife
to
content
he
,
to
go
to
Gossols
with
he
,
to
help
he
in
his
living
,
to
have
child
for
he
so
that
the
world
could
go
on
as
it
have
from
the
beginning
.
Martha
be
right
to
choose
Fanny
Hissen
to
content
he
.
as
I
be
say
Martha
be
not
very
pleasing
to
her
brother
David
Hersland
who
need
a
woman
to
be
appeal
or
a
woman
to
have
power
,
to
make
she
attractive
to
he
.
one
can
see
by
the
feeling
that
this
Martha
have
for
all
the
Hissen
man
and
woman
that
she
be
not
appeal
nor
have
strongly
a
power
of
attract
,
and
yet
she
be
a
good
woman
,
and
not
very
unpleasing
,
and
David
be
right
to
let
she
choose
a
wife
to
content
he
.
she
could
never
have
any
reason
to
do
anything
that
be
not
right
to
her
feeling
.
she
have
enough
of
important
feeling
so
that
she
would
not
have
any
jealous
feeling
to
interfere
with
her
right
judging
,
and
she
have
a
hard
feeling
and
that
give
she
a
kind
of
common
being
that
make
she
have
in
she
a
feeling
that
always
would
respect
the
fine
being
in
the
Hissen
man
and
woman
,
and
yet
she
never
could
feel
that
she
be
not
right
to
manage
for
they
,
for
they
have
the
weakness
in
they
from
be
so
fine
in
the
gentle
dignity
and
feeling
that
make
all
they
,
that
they
could
never
do
for
themselves
what
be
necessary
,
for
they
to
ever
be
win
what
they
need
for
their
living
.
and
so
she
arrange
a
marriage
for
they
for
marry
David
Hersland
and
Fanny
Hissen
.




it
go
very
quickly
from
the
beginning
for
Fanny
Hissen
be
very
pleasing
to
he
and
David
Hersland
have
nothing
common
in
he
for
they
.
he
be
too
big
in
his
feeling
and
in
the
way
he
make
any
one
who
see
he
feel
he
ever
to
give
any
one
,
even
gentle
Hissen
man
and
woman
any
such
feeling
.




Martha
be
in
a
way
common
to
they
.
David
never
give
any
one
of
they
any
such
feeling
.
Martha
be
not
low
in
her
feeling
.
it
be
her
hard
being
that
give
they
such
a
feeling
.
she
be
always
consider
they
in
her
feeling
,
she
have
respect
for
they
and
feel
in
they
all
the
fine
thing
they
have
inside
they
but
to
they
she
be
not
sensitive
in
her
feeling
,
she
be
always
a
little
common
to
they
always
a
little
low
to
they
,
they
feel
it
always
inside
in
they
.
with
her
brother
David
Hersland
they
never
have
any
such
feeling
.
David
never
give
any
one
of
they
any
such
feeling
.
and
yet
,
as
I
be
say
,
it
be
not
because
Martha
be
low
in
she
be
that
they
have
always
this
feeling
.
the
old
man
Hissen
have
not
such
a
feeling
.
Martha
be
more
pleasing
to
he
then
than
she
be
to
any
of
the
other
of
they
.
to
the
other
of
they
it
be
a
certain
thing
inside
she
that
be
not
so
much
hard
but
not
sensitive
or
appeal
that
make
they
feel
she
to
be
a
little
common
,
to
their
feeling
.
David
Hersland
never
give
any
of
they
such
a
feeling
.




it
be
not
because
Martha
be
low
in
her
feeling
.
Martha
be
not
low
in
her
feeling
,
she
have
no
dirty
way
inside
she
in
her
feeling
.
always
she
would
do
what
it
be
right
to
do
to
her
feeling
.
but
not
have
the
delicate
kind
of
feeling
make
she
feel
thing
to
be
right
that
be
right
to
the
Hissen
feeling
but
be
not
pleasant
to
they
to
see
anybody
do
.
as
I
be
say
,
the
old
man
Hissen
have
not
any
such
feeling
.
no
Martha
be
not
low
in
her
feeling
and
she
be
strong
to
do
what
be
right
to
her
feeling
and
only
in
little
way
be
she
unpleasant
to
the
Hissen
man
and
woman
,
though
she
be
never
really
pleasing
to
they
.
she
have
not
in
she
any
power
to
impress
they
or
anything
appeal
to
win
they
.




no
Martha
be
not
low
in
her
feeling
.
David
have
thing
in
he
that
would
be
very
low
to
they
if
they
know
they
be
inside
he
but
they
never
could
come
to
know
such
thing
in
he
.
he
be
so
big
in
his
feeling
he
could
always
carry
they
along
inside
he
,
inside
he
or
outside
he
it
be
all
one
,
he
be
in
they
they
be
in
he
and
they
could
never
come
to
any
judgment
toward
he
and
so
they
never
could
come
to
know
any
low
thing
in
he
.
it
be
very
different
with
the
feeling
they
always
have
that
Martha
be
below
they
Martha
have
very
little
of
any
low
or
dirty
feeling
.
she
be
not
delicate
in
her
feeling
.
she
be
a
good
enough
look
woman
,
not
unpleasing
,
always
neat
in
her
dressing
and
attractive
enough
like
most
good
enough
look
woman
.
it
be
mostly
never
a
low
feeling
she
have
in
she
and
never
toward
any
one
of
they
but
they
mostly
all
always
have
inside
they
a
certain
sense
that
she
be
common
to
they
.
David
Hersland
never
give
to
any
of
they
any
such
feeling
.
he
be
as
big
as
all
the
world
in
his
beginning
and
low
and
high
and
noisy
and
delicate
it
be
all
in
he
,
he
be
it
,
they
be
in
he
and
low
thing
be
big
in
he
so
that
no
one
could
ever
feel
they
in
he
as
low
thing
inside
he
,
no
never
not
even
when
he
be
an
old
man
and
thing
be
fall
down
inside
he
and
around
he
in
his
being
.




the
only
one
who
have
a
feeling
that
Martha
be
really
pleasing
be
her
husband
and
she
be
just
right
for
he
.
he
only
hear
what
she
say
to
he
in
anything
that
she
have
be
concern
in
and
so
he
never
come
to
any
feeling
that
she
be
not
a
strong
woman
to
win
out
in
the
thing
she
always
love
to
be
begin
.
he
never
could
know
that
she
be
not

.
she
always
do
,
to
herself
,
whatever
it
be
right
for
she
to
do
,
to
her
feeling
when
she
meet
with
the
beginning
of
a
losing
she
would
not
stop
herself
from
win
,
she
would
not
know
that
she
be
then

,
she
only
drop
out
of
that
working
and
make
for
herself
a
new
beginning
.
she
be
not
a
strong
woman
as
her
mother
have
be
.
mostly
she
be
not
pleasing
for
she
be
not
strong
in
win
nor
begin
and
she
have
nothing
appeal
to
make
she
attractive
to
man
or
woman
and
so
she
be
not
very
pleasing
,
but
she
be
a
good
enough
woman
to
become
a
friend
of
the
Hissen
man
and
woman
,
to
be
satisfy
to
old
Mr.

and
to
have
her

David
Hersland
let
she
choose
a
wife
for
he
to
content
he

good
in
do
whatever
it
be
right
for
she
to
do
,
to
her
feeling
.
she
be
fond
of
do
,
good
at
make
a
beginning
,
almost
strong
enough
to
keep
on
go
.
it
be
always
all
right
for
she
when
there
be
not
any
strong
person
resist
,
for
then
she
be
always
strong
enough
to
keep
on
go
,
and
then
,
though
mostly
not
altogether
win
,
she
would
come
near
enough
to
win
to
keep
in
she
her
important
feeling
.
she
would
not
end
in
any
kind
of
win
if
any
one
keep
up
any

Martha
would
not
know
she
be
lose
,
she
would
begin
with
some
other
beginning
,

be
altogether

that
he
want
a

so
that
his
passion
could
have
a
solid
thing
to
bring
it
together
in
he
,
so
that
his
wife
should
always
be

to

.
he
do
not

who
be
to
bear

,
she
perhaps
would
come
to
an
important
feeling
,

it
as
a
natural
thing

from
a
,
to
she
,
not
natural
way
of
living

beginning
with
her
friendship
with
the
Shilling
woman
.
then
it
come
to
be
strong
with
the
living
in
Gossols
in
the
ten
acre
place
in
the
part
of

where
she
be
cut
off
from

rich
living
which
be
for
she
the
natural
way
of

.




Mrs.
Fanny
Hersland
have
always
have
in
she
the
beginning
of
an
almost
important
feeling
which
she
have
from
be
like
her
mother
in
her
nature
,
the
mother
who
have
have
,
in
her
sad
trickling
arise
of
itself
inside
she
,
an
almost
important
feeling
.
this
beginning
of
an
almost
important
feeling
,
have
never
in
Fanny
Hissen
be
very
real
inside
she
while
she
be
live
in
Bridgepoint
,
for
then
the
strong
thing
in
she
be
the
family
way
of
be
and
that
always
would
have
be
just
so
strong
in
she
and
it
never
would
have
come
to
she
to
have
any
realler
feeling
of
be
important
to
herself
inside
she
if
she
have
not
go
to
Gossols
and
leave
the
family
way
of
be
behind
she
.
it
be
only
when
she
leave
the
family
way
of
living
,
when
she
go
out
to
Gossols
where
she
be
to
have
none
of
the
be
always
a
part
of
the
well
to
do
living
,
that
it
come
to
she
to
begin
to
have
this
almost
important
feeling
.
it
be
not
marry
that
give
she
such
a
feeling
.
Marrying
would
never
have
change
she
from
her
family
way
of
be
,
it
be
go
to
Gossols
and
leave
the
family
being
and
have
a
for
her
unnatural
way
of
living
that
awake
in
she
a
sense
inside
she
of
the
almost
important
feeling
that
be
to
come
to
be
inside
in
she
.




it
have
its
beginning
with
she
know
,
in
the
hotel
where
the
Herslands
be
live
before
they
settle
down
in
the
ten
acre
place
,
it
have
its
beginning
with
she
know
old
Mrs.
Shilling
and
her
daughter
Sophie
Shilling
and
her
other
daughter
Pauline
Shilling
.
with
they
there
begin
inside
she
a
sense
of
individual
being
,
not
that
it
be
different
in
she
to
her
feeling
,
it
be
only
different
in
her
being
.
now
she
have
no
long
in
she
as
the
strong
thing
inside
she
the
Hissen
way
of
be
that
be
then
all
she
and
be
the
natural
way
of
be
to
she
.
later
it
grow
strong
in
she
,
this
being
,
that
never
be
different
to
she
in
her
feeling
that
she
know
inside
she
,
but
later
it
grow
strong
in
she
,
a
very
little
by
her
husband
and
the
power
over
he
she
have
in
she
,
but
mostly
with
the
living
that
come
soon
to
be
all
the
being
there
be
of
she
,
the
living
with
her
servant
and
governess
and
dependent
and
the
for
her
poor
queer
kind
of
people
who
live
near
she
,
and
the
way
she
have
of
be
a
power
,
of
be
of
they
,
with
they
,
and
always
above
they
,
and
the
feeling
they
have
in
they
;
and
all
this
give
to
she
the
real
being
of
an
almost
important
feeling
.




when
one
just
meet
with
they
,
old
heavy
flabby
Mrs.
Shilling
and
her
daughter
the
fat
Sophie
Shilling
and
the
other
daughter
the
thin
Pauline
Shilling
,
they
be
at
first
meeting
and
even
after
long
know
like
many
other
ordinary
woman
.
yet
always
one
have
a
little
uncertain
feeling
that
perhaps
each
one
of
they
have
something
queer
in
she
.
one
could
never
be
very
certain
with
they
whether
this
possible
queerness
of
they
be
because
of
something
queer
inside
in
all
they
or
that
they
be
queer
because
something
have
be
leave
out
in
each
one
of
they
in
the
making
of
they
or
that
they
have
lose
something
out
of
they
that
should
have
be
inside
in
they
,
that
something
have
drop
out
of
each
one
of
they
and
they
have
be
indolent
of
stupid
or
stare
each
one
of
they
then
and
they
have
not
notice
such
a
dropping
out
of
they
.
each
one
of
they
have
perhaps
a
hole
then
somewhere
inside
in
they
and
this
may
have
be
that
which
give
to
each
one
of
they
the
queerness
that
it
be
never
certain
be
ever
really
there
in
any
one
of
they
.
one
never
be
certain
with
they
that
there
be
anything
queer
about
they
.
mostly
they
be
just
ordinary
stupid
enough
woman
like
million
of
they
.




the
mother
be
one
of
those
fat
heavy
woman
who
be
all
straight
down
the
whole
front
of
they
when
they
be
sit
.
when
they
be
walk
they
be
always
slowly
waddle
with
heavy
breathing
.
many
such
heavy
fat
flabby
waddle
woman
have
something
queer
about
they
.
these
have
big
doughy
empty
head
on
top
of
they
.
these
head
on
they
give
to
one
a
kind
of
feel
such
as
a
baby
's
head
give
to
one
in
the
first
month
of
its
being
live
,
that
the
head
be
not
well
fasten
to
they
,
that
it
will
fall
off
they
if
one
do
not
hold
it
together
on
they
.
this
kind
of
a
head
on
they
be
what
give
these
fat
flabby
woman
the
queerness
about
they
that
make
strange
thing
of
they
.
they
have
be
live

work
,
cooking

they
have
be

,
they
have
have
child
come
into
the
world
through
they
,
sometimes
strong

and
woman
have
be
bear
from
inside
they
,
they
have
make
marriage
for
their
child
and
manage
people
around
they
,
they
have
live
and
suffer
and
some
of
they
have
have
power
in
they
,
and
they
be
flabby
now
with
big
doughy
head
that
wobble
on
they
.




it
be
a
queer
feeling
that
one
have
in
they
and
perhaps
it
be
,
that
they
have
something
queer
in
they
something
that
give
to
one
a

on
big
woman
that
look

and
wobbly
on
they
.




Old
Mrs.
Shilling
be
such
a
one
.
it
be
uncertain
always
even
after
a
long
knowing
of
she
whether
the
wobbly
head
on
she
be
all
that
make
a
strange
thing
of
she
or
whether
there
be
something
queer
inside
in
she
,
different
from
the
other
of
they
,
different
from
all
of
they
who
always
give
to
one
a
strange
uncertain
feeling
,
all
the
many
fat
one
who
be
make
just
like
she
.
perhaps
that
be
all
that
be
queer
in
she
,
that
which
be
always
queer
in
all
the
many
fat
one
who
be
make
just
like
she
.




the
fat
daughter
Sophie
Shilling
in
the
way
one
mostly
feel
she
have
many
million
who
be
make
just
like
she
.
the
fat
daughter
Sophie
Shilling
be
a
little
like
her
mother
but
her
head
be
not
yet
wobbly
on
she
.
sometimes
there
be
something
about
she
that
perhaps
come
from
something
queer
inside
she
.
mostly
she
be
just
an
ordinary
rather
fat
young
woman
and
there
be
many
million
make
just
like
she
.




as
one
know
she
with
her
mother
and
her
sister
she
be
an
amiable
enough
good
sister
and
daughter
.
mostly
one
feel
that
she
be
a
very
good
sister
and
a
very
good
daughter
.
not
that
it
be
a
family
of
woman
that
as
far
as
one
could
know
they
be
very
try
to
one
another
.
they
seem
to
have
enough
money
to
live
comfortably
in
the
hotel
together
.
they
have
a
poodle
dog
who
be
company
for
the
mother
.
they
never
quarrel
with
each
other
.
they
do
not
have
any
trouble
there
at
the
hotel
where
they
be
comfortably
live
together
.




Sophie
Shilling
and
Pauline
Shilling
be
sisterly
with
one
another
.
Sophie
Shilling
like
most
fat
sister
be
afraid
of
the
thin
.
sometimes
it
be
the
thin
who
be
afraid
of
the
fatter
when
two
daughter
be
sisterly
together
but
most
often
it
be
the
fat
sister
who
be
afraid
of
the
thin
.
it
be
not
so
much
be
old
or
young
that
make
sister
afraid
of
one
another
,
it
be
a
kind
of
power
that
always
one
have
over
the
other
,
mostly
it
be
the
fat
one
who
be
afraid
of
the
other
because
it
would
hurt
more
if
pin
be
stick
into
she
,
not
that
the
thin
be
always
in
any
way
meaner
,
sometimes
it
be
the
fat
one
who
be
afraid
who
be
the
meaner
,
but
there
be
so
much
more
of
she
,
there
be
so
much
more
unprotected
surface
to
she
,
somehow
,
it
be
that
which
make
she
afraid
of
the
thin
even
when
the
thin
one
be
really
never
nasty
to
she
.
this
be
true
of
the
sister
Sophie
Shilling
and
Pauline
Shilling
,
the
fat
one
always
have
fear
in
she
but
the
thin
one
never
in
any
way
be
ever
mean
or
nasty
to
she
.
it
be
this
fear
that
the
fat
one
have
in
she
that
often
make
the
people
who
know
she
and
see
the
mother
and
the
sister
with
she
feel
that
the
thin
one
have
mean
way
in
she
.
not
that
the
fat
one
complain
of
she
but
there
be
a
fear
in
she
,
and
often
it
be
only
a
fear
from
there
be
so
much
of
she
,
but
when
other
feel
the
fear
in
she
they
be
sure
it
must
come
from
the
mean
thing
the
thin
one
do
to
she
.
so
it
be
with
Sophie
Shilling
and
they
be
very
sisterly
together
.




it
be
a
month
or
so
after
the
Herslands
have
come
to
the
hotel
that
Mrs.
Hersland
begin
to
know
Sophie
Shilling
.
she
have
meet
she
go
about
in
the
hotel
and
sometimes
when
she
be
out
she
meet
with
she
and
they
come
in
together
.
they
soon
be
a
good
deal
together
.
they
soon
begin
to
call
on
each
other
.
Mrs.
Hersland
begin
to
know
the
mother
and
the
sister
Pauline
Shilling
.
Pauline
do
not
take
much
interest
in
she
.
mostly
she
and
Sophie
do
not
have
friend
together
.
the
way
in
which
Sophie
be
afraid
of
her
sister
make
any
one
who
know
she
have
an
awe
of
Pauline
Shilling
,
make
they
have
a
kind
of
feeling
about
she
so
that
they
could
never
be
easy
with
she
.
always
in
they
must
be
a
suspicious
feeling
that
there
be
danger
for
they
in
she
and
they
must
not
be
too
free
when
be
with
she
or
talk
to
she
.
it
be
the
fear
in
the
fat
sister
that
give
to
all
who
know
she
a
restraint
when
they
be
with
Pauline
Shilling
.
not
that
Sophie
ever
complain
of
she
,
not
that
Sophie
ever
know
that
she
have
such
a
fear
in
she
.
it
be
always
there
though
and
affect
all
who
know
she
although
from
their
own
knowing
of
she
they
could
see
that
Pauline
Shilling
have
no
mean
way
in
she
.
of
course
there
be
people
who
first
know
the
thin
sister
and
they
never
have
any
such
feeling
about
she
.
but
all
who
first
know
Sophie
Shilling
never
could
come
to
be
easy
with
her
sister
.
Mrs.
Hersland
first
know
Sophie
Shilling
.
it
be
easy
to
see
how
the
know
Sophie
Shilling
and
her
mother
and
the
sister
Pauline
Shilling
would
awaken
in
she
the
always
possible
almost
important
feeling
that
be
quiet
until
then
inside
she
.




Sophie
Shilling
never
mean
very
much
to
she
.
they
be
very
much
together
and
Fanny
Hersland
always
feel
for
she
.
she
have
no
affection
for
she
and
after
she
move
away
from
the
hotel
she
do
not
very
often
see
she
.




the
year
that
they
both
live
in
the
hotel
they
be
a
great
deal
together
but
Sophie
do
not
impress
she
,
she
never
become
really
important
to
she
,
Mrs.
Hersland
have
not
realty
any
affection
for
she
.
Mrs.
Hersland
never
come
to
feel
any
nearer
to
the
mother
,
and
the
sister
Pauline
Shilling
.
know
Sophie
Shilling
and
her
mother
and
her
sister
be
really
very
important
to
she
.
they
be
a
problem
to
she
.




always
she
have
a
feeling
for
Sophie
Shilling
.
Sophie
never
complain
to
she
and
the
sister
Pauline
be
always
a
puzzle
to
she
.
she
never
come
to
really
know
inside
she
that
the
feeling
she
have
about
Pauline
Shilling
be
because
of
the
fear
that
be
always
in
the
fat
sister
,
a
fear
that
she
feel
always
to
be
inside
Sophie
Shilling
.
Sophie
never
complain
of
her
sister
.
she
never
know
she
have
such
a
fear
in
she
.
at
first
Fanny
Hersland
always
feel
for
she
,
then
slowly
she
feel
that
Pauline
have
no
mean
way
in
she
.
Pauline
be
always
very
pleasant
to
she
,
she
be
always
very
decent
to
her
mother
and
her
sister
Sophie
.
perhaps
later
Mrs.
Hersland
would
have
like
it
well
if
she
have
not
first
know
the
sister
Sophie
but
that
never
really
come
to
be
a
feeling
inside
she
,
even
to
the
end
of
she
know
she
she
always
feel
for
she
,
but
,
more
and
more
it
come
to
she
that
she
be
not
sure
of
what
she
feel
about
she
or
about
the
mother
or
the
sister
Pauline
Shilling
and
so
it
come
to
be
that
there
commence
inside
she
,
from
the
not
be
certain
of
the
judgment
which
be
natural
to
she
,
there
come
to
be
inside
she
a
beginning
of
an
almost
individual
feeling
.




the
thin
sister
Pauline
Shilling
have
not
so
many
million
who
be
make
just
like
she
.
there
have
be
always
many
million
make
just
like
the
mother
and
the
fat
sister
Sophie
Shilling
but
there
have
never
be
so
many
million
make
altogether
like
the
thin
sister
Pauline
Shilling
.
there
have
be
always
many
million
make
just
like
the
mother
and
the
fat
sister
Sophie
Shilling
.
that
is
,
there
have
be
always
many
million
make
just
like
they
if
they
really
have
nothing
queer
inside
they
.
perhaps
they
have
something
queer
inside
they
that
make
they
different
from
the
many
million
who
have
be
make
just
like
they
.




there
have
be
many
million
make
just
like
the
mother
and
the
fat
sister
Sophie
Shilling
.
that
be
there
be
many
million
who
have
be
make
just
like
they
all
except
the
something
queer
inside
they
which
perhaps
make
they
different
inside
they
from
the
many
million
who
have
always
be
make
just
like
they
.




perhaps
there
be
nothing
that
be
really
queer
inside
they
.
perhaps
it
be
only
from
the
three
of
they
live
together
and
not
mean
much
to
one
another
and
not
mean
very
much
to
any
other
and
so
make
all
together
a
queer
feeling
when
one
feel
they
together
which
last
over
to
the
knowing
each
one
of
they
.
and
so
one
have
a
feeling
that
there
be
something
really
queer
inside
they
.
this
be
most
likely
all
that
they
have
of
queerness
in
they
.
they
,
do
not
have
much
meaning
and
the
three
of
they
be
together
and
not
have
much
meaning
for
each
other
give
one
a
sense
of
they
that
they
have
something
queer
inside
they
.
very
likely
that
be
all
there
be
of
queerness
in
they
.




the
thin
sister
Pauline
Shilling
seem
perhaps
to
have
more
of
individual
be
in
she
.
perhaps
that
be
only
because
there
be
not
so
many
million
make
just
like
she
as
there
be
many
million
make
like
her
mother
and
her
fatter
sister
.
perhaps
that
be
all
the
individual
being
that
she
have
in
she
.




perhaps
really
the
queerness
of
they
come
from
there
not
be
enough
in
each
one
of
they
to
fill
out
the
inside
in
they
and
so
they
do
not
have
much
meaning
or
any
power
or
any
sense
of
appeal
.




the
thin
one
have
not
really
any
more
meaning
than
the
fat
one
or
than
the
mother
who
have
bear
they
.
she
have
a
more
individual
seeming
because
she
be
a
thin
one
and
she
be
one
of
they
who
have
not
quite
so
many
million
make
just
like
they
.
but
even
as
a
thin
one
she
have
not
enough
inside
she
to
really
fill
she
,
to
really
make
she
important
,
not
inside
she
,
but
to
any
one
who
come
to
be
about
she
,
she
be
not
fill
out
enough
inside
she
to
give
she
any
power
or
make
any
appeal
to
any
one
who
come
near
she
.
the
emptiness
in
she
be
different
from
the
emptiness
that
be
inside
her
fat
sister
or
her
mother
.




Pauline
Shilling
have
not
any
fear
in
she
of
any
one
such
as
her
sister
have
of
she
.
the
fat
sister
have
this
fear
in
she
because
she
be
not
all
fill
up
inside
she
and
that
give
to
she
all
the
unprotected
surface
that
she
always
have
have
on
she
and
that
make
she
have
a
fear
in
she
,
not
from
anything
that
be
ever
do
to
she
,
but
from
all
the
unprotected
surface
there
be
of
she
.
she
never
know
at
any
time
that
she
have
such
a
fear
always
inside
she
and
that
make
it
the
more
deceive
in
she
,
for
one
always
feel
it
with
she
but
one
never
really
know
it
about
she
.




the
thin
sister
have
not
any
such
a
fear
in
she
as
the
fat
sister
have
of
she
and
always
inside
she
.
this
be
perhaps
why
one
have
a
feeling
that
they
be
not
so
many
million
make
just
like
she
.
perhaps
there
be
as
many
million
make
just
like
the
thin
sister
as
there
be
million
make
like
the
fat
sister
or
the
mother
.




the
many
million
make
just
like
the
fat
sister
or
the
mother
,
each
one
fill
up
so
much
more
space
than
a
thinner
that
one
get
the
feeling
that
they
be
commoner
,
that
there
be
many
more
million
of
they
make
fat
than
there
be
million
make
thin
,
and
that
these
the
fat
be
make
more
just
alike
to
one
another
.
it
be
the
unprotected
surface
of
these
who
be
make
like
the
fat
sister
,
that
make
they
seem
more
completely
just
like
one
another
than
when
they
be
thin
.
it
be
the
uncertain
head
on
the
many
million
make
just
like
the
mother
that
make
they
seem
to
be
exactly
like
each
other
,
a
great
deal
more
like
one
another
than
any
of
the
thin
,
alike
as
these
may
be
to
each
other
.




the
vague
fear
the
fat
one
almost
always
have
inside
she
give
a
more
common
quality
to
she
than
any
other
kind
of
fear
she
could
have
in
she
.
the
vague
fear
that
come
from
all
that
unprotected
surface
of
she
make
it
easy
to
see
in
she
that
she
be
just
like
all
the
other
million
who
have
be
make
just
like
she
all
the
other
million
who
have
the
same
kind
of
fear
that
she
have
in
she
.
this
fear
make
it
easy
to
see
a
likeness
to
she
than
any
other
kind
of
fear
that
she
might
have
have
inside
she
.
the
thin
sister
Pauline
Shilling
have
a
fear
in
she
,
she
have
a
fear
in
she
and
all
the
many
million
who
have
be
make
just
like
she
have
the
same
kind
of
fear
as
she
have
in
she
,
but
it
be
not
from
the
unprotected
surface
of
she
,
one
do
not
always
feel
it
when
one
be
with
she
,
it
have
not
then
the
common
feeling
that
can
make
it
so
apparent
that
there
be
so
many
make
just
like
she
as
the
fear
in
her
sister
make
it
to
every
one
that
know
she
.




the
fear
the
thin
sister
have
always
in
she
also
come
from
there
be
not
enough
inside
to
fill
she
,
come
not
from
the
unprotected
surface
of
the
outside
of
she
but
from
she
not
be
fill
out
well
inside
she
and
so
she
have
the
fear
in
she
that
always
try
to
fill
up
a
hole
in
she
without
enough
to
fill
it
from
the
being
in
she
without
make
some
other
hole
inside
she
,
be
certain
to
give
to
she
.
this
make
she
without
any
power
,
or
appeal
to
any
one
who
be
near
she
.




she
be
always
busy
inside
in
she
fill
up
the
hole
in
she
from
the
rest
of
she
and
so
make
another
,
for
there
be
not
enough
inside
she
ever
to
entirely
fill
she
.
always
she
be
fill
up
a
hole
in
she
and
always
she
be
keep
anything
from
touch
she
,
everything
from
come
close
to
she
lest
it
should
push
an
outside
hole
into
she
.
she
could
never
feel
a
power
in
any
other
,
she
could
not
believe
in
any
other
,
she
could
not
concern
herself
with
any
other
,
she
could
never
let
any
other
come
close
to
she
,
she
be
always
there
,
not
fill
up
inside
she
,
and
that
be
the
whole
of
she
,
that
always
give
a
fear
to
she
to
be
inside
she
,
but
a
kind
of
fear
that
do
not
make
a
common
person
of
she
,
as
the
fear
inside
she
do
with
the
fat
sister
Sophie
Shilling
.
it
do
not
make
an
individual
of
she
because
there
be
never
there
a
whole
of
she
.
she
do
not
know
that
there
be
not
a
whole
one
of
she
.
this
incompleteness
of
she
only
make
a
self
-
defensive
instinct
in
she
,
and
that
be
all
there
be
to
she
,
comfort
and
keep
out
of
danger
be
all
there
be
of
live
to
she
,
and
so
she
have
no
power
in
she
for
she
have
no
power
of
attack
in
she
,
for
she
be
not
all
together
,
and
it
give
she
no
appeal
to
any
one
who
come
near
she
because
they
never
could
really
come
close
to
she
,
she
could
not
let
they
touch
she
lest
they
should
push
a
hole
into
she
.
she
could
not
come
near
to
any
other
,
or
believe
in
any
other
,
and
always
she
must
be
concern
with
herself
and
the
defense
of
she
lest
any
one
should
touch
she
and
make
a
hole
into
she
.




that
be
all
there
be
of
queerness
in
she
and
there
be
many
million
who
have
be
make
just
like
she
.




always
one
be
not
certain
in
their
judgement
of
she
because
she
be
a
good
enough
woman
and
always
decent
to
her
mother
and
her
sister
and
pleasant
and
good
enough
to
every
one
who
come
near
she
.
always
there
be
in
she
that
she
would
never
let
any
one
come
very
close
to
she
.
it
be
a
fear
in
she
.
it
never
come
to
any
one
to
know
it
about
she
for
it
be
always
self
defensive
in
she
.
one
feel
that
they
never
come
close
to
she
and
so
she
be
a
puzzle
to
all
who
know
she
,
and
sometimes
they
be
suspicious
of
she
and
sometimes
sorry
for
she
.
so
it
be
with
Fanny
Hersland
and
she
never
come
to
know
any
more
about
she
.




the
mother
of
they
be
too
empty
to
have
any
kind
of
a
fear
inside
she
.
her
head
be
like
a
baby
's
,
wobbly
on
she
.
she
never
could
have
an
abide
fear
inside
she
with
such
a
head
on
top
of
she
.
she
be
without
any
fear
in
she
either
such
a
one
as
her
fat
daughter
have
of
another
or
as
her
thin
daughter
Pauline
Shilling
have
it
,
lest
anything
might
touch
she
,
that
something
might
make
she
feel
anything
inside
she
.




this
be
very
likely
all
of
queerness
that
this
family
of
woman
have
in
they
and
it
come
to
be
about
each
one
of
they
because
they
be
three
together
who
have
in
each
of
they
such
an
emptiness
inside
they
.




it
make
a
queerness
,
there
be
three
of
they
,
that
every
body
feel
who
know
they
.
always
it
be
a
puzzle
to
every
one
,
for
they
be
pleasant
enough
woman
as
one
know
they
together
and
each
one
of
they
,
they
never
quarrel
with
each
other
,
they
live
very
comfortably
there
in
the
hotel
together
.
one
never
learn
anything
about
they
or
against
they
,
nobody
gossip
about
they
,
they
be
plenty
of
people
who
know
they
and
come
to
see
they
.
each
one
of
they
have
their
own
friend
and
they
always
get
along
very
nicely
with
they
,
only
somehow
there
be
always
there
this
emptiness
they
have
in
they
.
it
be
a
hole
that
each
one
have
inside
in
she
.
it
will
never
be
know
about
they
whether
they
have
be
make
so
from
the
beginning
,
whether
something
have
be
leave
out
in
each
one
of
they
in
the
making
of
they
or
whether
they
have
lose
something
out
of
they
that
should
have
be
inside
in
they
,
something
that
have
perhaps
drop
out
of
each
one
of
they
and
they
have
be
indolent
or
fearful
or
stupid
or
stare
then
,
each
one
of
they
,
and
they
have
not
notice
such
a
dropping
out
of
they
.
and
so
one
could
not
come
to
any
certain
judgment
of
they
,
one
could
never
be
sure
about
they
,
that
they
have
something
queer
inside
they
,
or
that
they
be
all
three
of
they
just
like
the
many
million
who
have
be
make
just
like
they
.




it
be
easy
to
see
how
this
puzzle
quality
of
they
would
awaken
in
Mrs.
Hersland
who
be
almost
always
now
with
they
,
the
always
possible
almost
important
feeling
that
be
quiet
until
then
inside
she
.
she
always
have
a
feeling
for
Sophie
Shilling
but
she
have
no
affection
for
she
,
Sophie
be
not
in
any
way
important
to
she
,
Mrs.
Hersland
never
come
to
feel
any
nearer
to
the
mother
and
the
sister
Pauline
Shilling
.
she
never
come
to
feel
certain
about
they
inside
she
and
this
not
be
certain
of
the
kind
of
judgment
which
be
natural
to
she
,
make
a
beginning
inside
she
of
an
almost
individual
feeling
,
different
in
she
,
but
not
different
to
she
,
from
the
family
way
of
be
which
have
always
until
then
be
all
there
be
of
live
to
she
.




the
only
important
feeling
Mrs.
Hersland
have
in
this
time
of
begin
her
new
living
be
with
the
Shillings
as
I
have
be
say
.
after
leave
the
hotel
she
never
see
much
of
they
.
occasionally
she
would
call
on
they
to
show
her
child
.
all
the
Shilling
woman
be
always
good
to
they
but
they
be
never
important
to
they
,
there
come
to
be
soon
very
little
visit
between
they
and
then
very
soon
there
be
none
.
this
be
the
end
of
the
beginning
in
Mrs.
Hersland
of
the
possible
almost
important
feeling
.




always
now
it
keep
on
grow
,
a
little
from
her
husband
and
make
he
do
thing
through
her
compelling
,
but
mostly
from
her
dependent
,
the
governess
seamstresse
servant
and
the
other
,
the
for
her
poor
queer
people
who
soon
come
to
be
always
around
she
.




they
have
live
more
than
a
year
in
the
hotel
.
David
Hersland
who
be
always
strong
in
his
beginning
commence
then
to
find
the
way
to
his
great
fortune
.
soon
he
buy
the
place
that
be
to
be
for
a
long
time
a
home
to
they
,
in
that
part
of
Gossols
where
no
other
rich
people
be
live
.
his
child
be
then
very
little
thing
or
just
begin
,
his
wife
have
just
begin
to
know
some
people
of
the
kind
it
be
natural
for
she
to
have
as
friend
in
her
daily
living
.




because
of
the
living
in
the
part
of
Gossols
where
no
other
rich
people
be
live
she
see
they
soon
only
on
occasional
formal
visit
,
the
child
do
not
then
learn
to
be
accustomed
to
rich
well
to
do
kind
of
people
and
their
living
,
the
mother
lose
the
habit
of
go
to
visit
with
they
,
she
never
at
all
lose
the
sense
of
well
to
do
live
,
she
just
lose
the
habit
of
normal
visit
,
of
be
with
they
the
people
who
be
the
natural
people
to
have
as
friend
in
her
daily
living
.
she
live
with
her
husband
and
her
child
and
her
dependent
and
the
for
her
queer
poor
people
who
live
around
they
in
that
part
of
Gossols
where
no
other
rich
people
be
live
.




big
as
all
the
world
in
his
beginning
how
could
David
Hersland
have
a
weak
place
in
he
then
.
the
way
he
do
the
educating
of
his
three
child
will
make
the
nature
in
he
become
clear
to
they
,
will
make
it
clear
too
to
any
one
who
will
come
to
know
the
nature
of
they
and
the
education
that
he
give
they
.




there
be
three
of
they
and
they
all
three
of
they
come
to
have
inside
they
their
own
kind
of
important
feeling
.
that
come
through
their
being
of
he
and
from
the
education
he
give
to
they
which
make
they
uneven
in
they
,
be
of
he
and
mix
up
with
the
wife
who
bear
they
,
make
they
uneven
as
he
be
always
before
they
,
uneven
like
the
whole
world
together
that
he
have
in
he
and
so
it
come
that
he
be
uneven
as
the
whole
world
inside
he
and
around
he
and
so
it
be
that
there
be
weak
place
in
he
as
there
be
in
the
big
world
which
be
all
he
.
he
be
all
full
up
inside
he
but
it
be
not
all
the
same
all
through
he
.




he
be
all
full
up
inside
in
he
and
he
be
a
big
man
and
so
there
be
very
much
in
he
and
of
he
.
he
be
all
full
up
inside
he
,
there
be
not
much
of
any
way
that
anything
could
enter
into
he
.
there
be
in
he
the
kind
of
love
that
he
have
for
the
wife
he
have
choose
to
content
he
and
the
child
who
awake
in
he
a
different
kind
of
feeling
for
each
one
of
they
and
who
be
to
win
through
he
each
one
of
the
three
of
they
a
different
kind
of
important
feeling
each
one
of
they
to
have
inside
in
they
to
content
they
.




the
love
David
Hersland
have
in
he
for
his
wife
be
that
in
some
way
she
be
a
flower
to
he
,
in
some
way
just
a
woman
to
he
.
he
need
a
woman
to
content
he
.




the
power
she
have
in
she
sometimes
over
he
be
not
important
to
he
,
that
be
only
a
joke
to
he
,
what
be
real
in
she
to
he
be
that
sometimes
she
be
a
flower
to
he
and
mostly
she
be
just
a
woman
to
content
he
.




often
she
be
not
important
to
he
and
this
will
come
out
in
he
,
in
her
live
there
with
he
in
the
ten
acre
place
away
from
the
living
that
be
her
natural
way
of
be
.




David
Hersland
have
his
way
of
need
a
woman
to
content
he
.
each
man
have
in
some
way
his
own
need
in
a
woman
to
content
he
,
there
be
many
kind
of
man
and
woman
and
each
one
of
they
be
himself
inside
he
.
David
Hersland
have
his
way
of
need
a
woman
to
content
he
,
Henry
Dehning
have
his
woman
and
she
fill
up
his
need
in
he
,
and
then
they
will
come
to
be
old
man
and
it
will
be
easy
to
see
in
they
then
how
they
need
a
woman
to
content
they
.




there
be
not
so
very
many
kind
of
man
nor
so
many
kind
of
woman
to
content
they
.
one
can
see
this
clear
in
they
when
the
man
be
young
man
,
or
very
old
one
,
then
it
come
to
be
clear
in
they
that
they
need
a
woman
to
content
they
a
woman
to
be
a
certain
thing
to
they
and
that
there
be
not
so
many
different
kind
of
they
,
neither
of
the
man
,
nor
of
the
woman
who
content
they
.
there
be
though
,
all
the
same
,
a
fair
amount
of
different
kind
of
they
and
here
we
begin
with
one
kind
of
they
,
with
David
Hersland
and
the
kind
of
man
he
be
inside
he
and
the
kind
of
woman
he
could
find
to
be
content
to
he
.




David
Hersland
and
Herman
Dehning
and
the
man
who
be
married
to
David
's
sister
Martha
who

his
marriage
for
he
be
all
three
of
they
strong
man
and
all
three
of
they
need
woman
to
content
they
and
all
three
of
they
be
very
different
each
one
of
they
from
the
other
of
they
.
now
to
begin
again
with
David
Hersland
and
the
nature
he
have
in
he
.
as
I
be
say
David
Hersland
be
a
big
man
and
a
man
who
be
all
full
up
inside
he
and
who
be
very
uneven
inside
he
uneven
as
the
world
that
be
all
he
.
he
be
a
big
man
and
there
be
very
much
in
he
and
of
he
.
he
be
all
full
up
inside
he
.
there
be
not
much
of
any
way
that
anything
could
enter
into
he
.
a
woman
have
to
be
a
part
of
the
inside
in
he
to
content
he
.
she
have
to
have
a
power
in
she
,
to
give
to
he
a
feeling
,
or
she
have
to
be
appeal
and
so
to
be
a
part
of
the
feeling
he
have
inside
he
.
there
be
not
much
of
any
way
that
anything
outside
he
could
enter
into
he
.




a
woman
to
content
he
could
never
be
outside
he
,
she
could
never
be
an
ideal
to
he
,
she
could
never
have
in
she
a
real
power
for
he
with
man
,
outside

,
there
be
for
he
a
need
in
he
to
fight
with
they
.
a
woman
could
never
be
for
he
anything
outside
he
,
unless
as
one
who
could
in
a
practical
way
be
useful
to
he
as
his
sister
Martha
have
always
be
and
now
she
have
be
useful
to
he
and
make
a
marriage
for
he
,
have
find
a
wife
for
he
who
be
pleasing
to
he
,
who
have
come
out
with
he
to
Gossols

.
such
a
woman
as
his
sister
be
for
he
,
be
like
any
other
object
in
the
world
around
he
,
a
thing
useful
to
he
or
not
exist
for
he
,
like
a
chair
in
his
house
to
sit
in
or
the
engine
that
draw
the
train
the
direction
in
which
he
need
just
then
to
be
go
.
such
a
woman
as
his
sister
Martha
,
as
a
woman
could
never
be
interesting
to
he
,
nor
any
other
woman
who
remain
outside
he
,
either
when
she
could
be
to
he
an
ideal
for
he
or
a
power
in
any
way
over
he
,
not
that
some
woman
with
power
in
they
be
not
attractive
to
he
,
but
with
such
a
kind
of
woman
,
and
he
meet
they
often
in
his
living
and
they
have
power
with
he
,
such
a
woman
always
do
it
for
he
by
enter
into
he
by
brilliant
seductive
managing
and
so
she
be
a
part
of
he
,
even
though
she
be
apart
from
he
,
and
so
she
have
power
with
he
.
such
a
one
until
he
would
be
an
old
man
and
the
strength
in
he
be
weaken
and
the
thing
he
have
in
he
do
not
make
inside
he
a
completely
tight
filling
and
so
thing
outside
he
could
a
little
more
enter
into
he
,
until
he
would
come
to
be
an
old
man
and
the
need
in
he
would
come
to
be
more
a
senile
feeling
,
an
old
man
's
need
of
something
to
complete
he
,
such
a
one
could
never
come
to
be
a
wife
to
he
,
could
never
be
a
woman
to
be
his
wife
and
content
he
.
he
need
such
a
woman
as
his
sister
Martha
have
find
for
he
,
a
woman
who
be
to
he
,
inside
he
and
appealing
,
whose
power
over
he
be
never
more
than
a
joke
to
he
,
who
sometimes
when
a
sense
for
beauty
stir
in
he
be
a
flower
to
he
,
whom
he
often
could
forget
that
she
be
exist
,
who
never
in
any
big
way
be
resist
,
and
so
she
never
need
fighting
,
be
always
to
himself
a
part
of
he
and
inside
in
he
,
and
so
in
every
kind
of
way
she
be
content
to
he
.




man
outside
he
awake
in
he
,
a
need
almost
always
in
he
,
to
fight
with
they
.
woman
could
never
give
he
any
such
feeling
to
have
inside
he
.
if
they
have
a
power
in
they
,
he
would
brush
they
away
from
around
he
,
sometimes
with
man
outside
he
he
would
in
the
same
way
brush
they
away
from
before
he
,
but
they
often
then
would
be
stubborn
thing
around
he
,
he
could
not
brush
they
away
from
he
;
but
all
woman
to
he
,
if
he
need
to
brush
they
away
from
around
he
,
he
could
so
always
rid
himself
of
they
.
if
a
woman
hold
her
power
in
he
it
be
because
of
brilliant
seductive
managing
,
and
so
there
would
not
be
arouse
in
he
any
desire
of
fighting
nor
of
brush
she
away
from
he
.
his
wife
be
different
to
he
,
she
be
appeal
there
inside
he
like
a
tender
feeling
he
have
in
he
.
often
she
be
not
important
to
he
,
often
she
be
not
even
exist
to
he
.
sometimes
,
and
this
be
the
rare
thing
in
he
,
she
fill
for
he
a
need
to
have
a
sense
of
beauty
in
he
,
then
she
be
like
a
flower
to
he
,
but
this
do
not
happen
so
very
often
in
he
more
often
she
have
a
kind
of
power
over
he
that
be
only
a
joke
to
he
,
mostly
in
their
daily
live
the
power
she
have
in
she
with
he
do
not
to
himself
touch
he
,
it
be
her
manage
to
have
thing
for
the
child
,
to
have
her
way
in
small
thing
,
sometimes
in
a
big
one
,
but
these
thing
never
be
important
to
he
,
and
he
never
know
she
feel
a
power
in
they
,
the
only
power
he
know
she
feel
over
he
be
only
a
joke
to
he
,
it
could
never
have
any
other
meaning
to
he
,
and
that
be
all
there
be
of
the
effect
she
have
upon
he
.
mostly
she
be
pleasing
to
he
,
she
be
a
wife
who
be
suit
to
he
,
his
sister
Martha
have
be
right
to
choose
she
for
he
to
be
married
to
he
,
to
bear
child
for
he
,
to
go
to
Gossols
with
he
,
to
be
always
,
all
the
year
she
would
be
live
with
he
,
to
be
a
woman
to
content
he
.
he
do
not
need
now
when
he
be
still
a
vigorous
man
and
strong
in
his
living
,
he
do
not
need
to
have
a
woman
to
complete
he
,
he
need
a
woman
only
to
be
pleasing
,
he
need
a
woman
only
to
content
he
.
this
perhaps
would
come
to
be
different
in
he
when
he
would
be
an
old
man
and
weakening
,
then
perhaps
a
woman
who
have
power
in
she
for
he
,
a
power
to
hold
he
by
seductive
managing
,
such
a
woman
could
then
fill
up
in
he
empty
place
make
by
old
age
and
his
weakening
and
his
shrink
away
from
the
outside
of
he
,
and
he
would
feel
it
good
to
he
then
to
be
fill
up
once
more
inside
he
;
to
feel
warm
with
a
full
feeling
;
and
so
such
a
woman
then
could
have
power
with
he
,
he
would
need
such
a
one
then
to
complete
he
.
now
he
be
a
strong
man
and
vigorous
in
his
living
and
such
a
woman
could
arouse
he
but
he
would
not
need
to
have
she
in
he
and
he
would
,
when
she
be
too
much
with
he
,
for
he
meet
she
often
enough
in
his
living
,
he
would
brush
she
away
from
before
he
.
his
wife
Fanny
Hersland
be
the
woman
for
he
,
the
wife
who
be
almost
always
pleasing
to
he
,
the
one
he
want
to
content
he
,
she
be
for
he
mostly
like
a
tender
feeling
in
he
,
she
be
a
good
woman
to
he
,
and
useful
to
do
the
daily
live
with
he
,
with
the
people
around
they
,
and
with
their
three
child
,
she
be
a
good
woman
in
his
daily
living
,
the
little
power
she
have
in
she
for
he
be
a
pleasant
joke
always
to
he
,
the
power

in
manage
to
do
thing
for
the
child

with
he
,
mostly
she
be
always
pleasing
to
he
,
sometimes
,
and
this
be
the
rare
thing
in
he
,
she
fill
for
he
a
need
in
he
for
pure
beauty
and
then
she
would
be
like
a
flower
to
he
but
this
come
to
be
more
and
more
rare
in
he
as
he
grow
old
and
be
more
fill
up
with
his
impatient
feeling
,
then
she
be
hardly
enough
to
content
he
,
always
she
be
like
a
tender
feeling
in
he
but
more
and
more
as
he
be
full
of
impatient
feeling
,
she
would
be
lose
to
he
,
mostly
she
would
not
then
be
exist
for
he
,
the
power
which
be
always
a
pleasant
joke
to
he
then
have
no
more
existence
for
he
,
a
little
yet
sometimes
then
she
might
be
a
flower
to
he
,
always
when
he
feel
she
then
she
would
be
inside
he
like
a
tender
feeling
but
mostly
then
she
have
no
existence
for
he
,
she
be
not
enough
then
to
content
he
,
and
then
she
die
away
and
leave
he
,
and
then
the
tender
feeling
be
a
pain
in
he
,
and
then
she
be
never
any
long
an
exist
thing
inside
he
.
More
and
more
he
be
get
old
then
and
weaken
,
and
shrink
away
from
the
outside
of
he
and
more
and
more
then
he
have
not
enough
even
of
impatient
feeling
to
completely
fill
he
,
and
so
more
and
more
then
be
need
to
be
fill
up
inside
he
and
she
be
not
then
enough
to
fill
he
,
she
have
,
too
,
die
away
and
leave
he
,
and
soon
she
be
not
in
he
any
more
,
not
any
more
as
a
tender
feeling
in
he
,
she
have
soon
then
not
any
more
any
existence
in
he
,
soon
he
need
much
more
than
she
have
ever
be
,
to
fill
he
up
inside
in
he
.

from
the
living
which

do
make
of
she
a
different
creature
and
this
she
be
inside
she
though
she
never
come
to
know
it
in
she
.
visit
with
their

come
to
be
hard
for
all
three
of
they
when
they
be
begin
to
be
self
conscious
and
a
little
old
.
when
they
be
very
little
one
six
year
and
young
there
be
a
little
pleasure
in
visit
with
their
mother
.
then
it
begin
to
be
hard
,
they
would
shrink
behind
the
mother
,
they
get
a
little
pleasure
from
the
smell
of
fur
and
silk
that
they
get
as
they
shrink
close
to
she
,
they
get
a
little
pleasure
from
the
smell
of
beaver
that
they
have
from
the
good
hat
they
wear
when
they
go
with
she
but
that
be
all
there
be
of
pleasure
,
more
and
more
as
they
grow
old
they
almost
hate
the
people
who
live
in
that
part
of
Gossols
where
people
be
rich
,
where
they
be
make
by
they
,
these

by
they
to
have
discomfort
by
their
not
know
how
to
act
when
they
come
together
.
so
more
and
more
they
would
not
go
with
their
mother
.
More
and
more
the
mother
lose
all
interest
that
she
once
have
in
she
with
the
people
who
be
the
natural
people
for
she
to
have
in
her
daily
live
in
the
well
to
do
living
which
be
the
natural
way
of
be
for
she
.
it
never
come
to
be
in
she
that
she
know
it
inside
she
that
she
be
different
from
the
other
who
be
the
natural
people
for
she
to
have
around
she
,
she
stop
go
to
visit
they
for
they
cease
to
have
any
interest
for
she
but
she
never
know
any
of
these
thing
inside
she
.
later
when
once
she
go
back
to
Bridgepoint
it
be
this
that
make
a
kind
of
princess
of
she
,
give
she
a
kind
of
power
with
the
brother
and
the
sister
who
have
never
leave
the
life
that
be
the
natural
way
of
live
for
she
.




the
mother
never
know
it
of
they
that
her
child
be
not
comfortable
with
well
to
do
child
and
the
mother
of
they
because
of
the
living
that
be
not
the
natural
way
of
live
for
they
.
it
never
could
come
to
be
a
real
thing
to
she
that
she
be
cut
off
from
the
right
rich
living
.
this
be
to
she
only
that
her
child
be
shy
in
meet
other
child
,
her
child
be
never
part
of
her
important
feeling
,

in
a
different
way
in

kind
of
way
with

man
who
be
the
people
to
have
around

more
entirely
of

there
be
of
their
mother
's
daily
living
.
slowly
in
the
mother
the
important
feeling
that
later
when
she
go
to
Bridgepoint
where
her
family
have
go
on
with
their
natural
way

this
important
feeling
come
to
be
work
inside
she
and
in
a
way
in
she
it
be
like
the
important
feeling
that
the
governess
and
other
servant
have
who
be
around
she
,
it
be
different
from
the
feeling
the
child
have
from
their
be
part
of
the
being
that
they
have
in
common
with
the
poor
people
with
whom
they
be
live
,
different
from
the
father
and
his
beginning
,
his
big
fortune
,
then
his
impatient
feeling
and
in
his
old
age
his
weakening
and
his
need
thing
to
fill
he
.
the
child

country
town
live
,
they
have
the
feeling
that
be
a
city
feeling
and
only
later
in
their
living
do
they
grow
away
from
be
of
the
people
who
live
there
around
they
.
each
one
of

very
many
of

and
they
be
all
of
they
in
each
one
of
they
then
different
from
all
the
other
of
they
and
this
all
three
of
the
child
know
very
well
inside
they
.
they
be
a
part
of
they
,

be
always
together
with
they

the

and
the
governess
be
to
they
as
the
mother
be
for
they
,
the
father
give
a
different
feeling
in
they
and
this
will
be
clear
for
they
as
slowly
the
character
in
each
one
of
they
come
out
from
inside
he
.




there
be
many
people
live
in
small
house
around
they
.
some
of
they
be
family
of
woman
,
some
of
they
be
make
up
of
some
good
one
and
some
who
be
not
good
to
earn
a
living
,
there
be
family
where
it
be
a
little
hard
to
understand
how
they
be
live
,
nobody
do
any
working
,
nobody
have
money
that
belong
to
they
.
in
some
of
the
family
around
they
there
be
a
father
who
be
really
not
very
existing
,
no
one
be
certain
that
he
be
a
husband
of
the
woman
and
the
father
of
the
child
who
all
earn
the
living
,
such
a
one
would
just
come
and
eat
and
sleep
in
the
house
with
they
,
with
some
there
be
no
mother
and
one
be
not
very
certain
from
anything
the
father
show
in
he
or
that
the
child
remember
about
he
that
there
have
ever
be
one
.
in
one
family
there
be
a
mother
and
she
be
a
hard
work
woman
,
there
be
child
some
at
home
,
some
away
from
they
,
some
about
whom
nothing
be
very
certain
,
the
father
be
not
very
certain
,
he
be
not
dead
to
they
he
be
not
very
certain
only
not
very
certain
in
his
existence
for
they
and
in
all
of
such
family
no
one
ever
ask
about
the
thing
around
they
,
and
no
one
ever
talk
about
the
queer
way
anybody
else
have
in
he
.
all
that
be
exist
for
any
of
they
be
the
thing
that
happen
to
they
.




in
several
of
the
family
around
they
the
father
or
a
son
have
mysterious
thing
he
be
do
every
day
in
his
earning
of
his
living
then
.
mostly
there
be
nothing
bad
in
any
of
they
,
one
of
they
have
an
intelligence
office
where
he
be
work
,
none
of
his
family
ever
like
to
talk
about
he
,
it
be
often
so
with
the
work
man
do
to
earn
a
living
,
there
be
nothing
bad
about
they
,
there
be
nothing
in
the
work
that
be
wrong
that
give
a
reason
why
they
should
not
do
it
then
to
earn
their
living
,
they
do
it
every
day
and
earn
a
living
then
but
somehow
it
be
a
feeling
the
family
have
about
he
that
they
never
talk
as
if
he
be
of
they
.
sometimes
it
be
from
the
work
he
be
do
,
sometimes
from
the
way
he
have
in
he
,
mostly
there
be
nothing
wrong
in
he
,
there
be
nothing
bad
in
his
earning
of
a
living
,
somehow
it
be
not
natural
to
his
family
to
talk
about
he
,
to
act
as
if
he
be
a
part
of
their
daily
living
,
he
eat
with
they
,
he
sleep
there
with
they
,
that
be
all
that
make
he
then
a
part
of
they
.
mostly
in
the
little
house
in
the
part
of
the
town
where
no
rich
people
be
live
the
family
many
of
they
have
such
kind
of
mystery
in
they
.
no
one
ever
talk
about
they
.
no
one
be
ever
certain
with
they
how
many
child
there
be
of
they
,
what
some
of
they
do
to
make
a
living
,
whether
there
be
a
father
to
they
,
whether
there
be
a
mother
to
they
,
how
they
all
come
to
the
money
they
have
for
their
daily
living
.




the
three
Hersland
child
be
of
they
,
they
be
always
of
the
people
with
the
people
who
live
in
the
small
house
near
they
,
they
be
of
they
,
they
live
with
they
,
they
have
the
feeling
of
never
ask
any
question
of
they
,
they
have
it
in
they
to
never
ask

of
they
that
be

in
the
daily

,
no
one
of

.
each
one
in
a
family
then
and
every
family
of
they
together
then
always
live
on
in
their
daily
living
,
there
be
a
husband
or
a
father
to
they

,
no
one
ask
what
they
do
for
their
daily
living
,
sometimes
some
of
they
would
be
go
a
long
time
away
from
all
of
they
,
sometimes
he
would
be
rich
then
,
sometimes
he
would
come
home
then
and
be
a
hero
to
they
,
always
there
be
uncertain
thing
in
any
one
of
they
to
all
of
they

no

any
other
one
any
question
about
they
,
mostly
every
one
have
it
as
right
for
he
that
each
one
of
they
should
have
a
little
house
where
his
family
be
live
,
each
family
of
they
have
a
little
house
where
any
one
of
they
and
all
of
they
do
their
eating
and
sleep
and
washing
,
each
one
of
they
have
his
own
way
of
earn
a
living
,
such
uncertain
thing
as
each
one
of
the
family
of
they
have
in
they
be
always
there
in
all
of
they
who
be
live
then
in
the
part
of
a
city
where
no
rich
people
be
live
,
no
one
of
they
ever
think
about
they
,
there
be
nothing
for
any
of
they
except
the
thing
that
happen
every
day
to
they
,
there
be
nothing
for
they
except
their
daily
living
which
be
all
there
be
then
of
they
.




all
of
they
who
live
near
the
ten
acre
place
where
the
Herslands
be
live
in
that
part
of
Gossols
where
no
rich
people
be
live
all
of
they
then
be
good
enough
people
and
regular
enough
in
their
daily
living
and
mostly
all
of
the
family
of
they
have
live
a
long
enough
time
where
they
be
live
then
.
mostly
all
of
they
be
honest
enough
man
and
woman
,
mostly
among
they
there
be
not
any
bad
man
and
woman
.
mostly
they
be
honest
enough
work
man
and
woman
and
their
child
go
to
school
and
go
on
to
be
decent
enough
man
and
woman
to
go
on
live
as
their
family
always
have
be
live
.
as
I
have
just
be
say
there
be
not
very
many
of
they
that
be
not
good
enough
man
and
woman
.
a
few
of
they
come
to
a
bad
end
before
they
get
through
with
their
living
but
mostly
all
of
they
be
honest
enough
man
and
woman
and
they
have
good
enough
child
and
mostly
they
all
make
enough
by
work
to
keep
on
and
be
honest
enough
in
their
daily
living
.




as
I
be
say
they
be
very
different
each
one
of
they
from
the
other
of
they
,
each
family
of
they
from
all
the
other
family
of
they
.
a
great
many
of
they
have
a
little
of
an
uncertain
side
to
they
,
mostly
in
every
family
of
they
some
of
they
have
an
uncertain
something
in
they
but
perhaps
the
rest
understand
it
about
they
,
none
of
they
ever
speak
about
they
no
one
ever
say
it
of
they
that
they
have
uncertain
thing
in
they
,
perhaps
it
be
all
a
natural
way
of
be
.
each
one
of
they
go
on
with
his
living
and
whatever
come
to
any
one
of
they
be
the
natural
way
of
living
.
it
be
queer
in
they
in
the
family
like
they
,
the
uncertain
way
some
of
they
seem
to
have
always
inside
they
.
perhaps
it
be
all
simple
in
they
,
mostly
in
all
of
these
who
live
around
the
Hersland
family
then
,
there
be
nothing
that
be
wrong
about
they
.
mostly
they
be
all
honest
enough
and
good
enough
man
and
woman
with
decent
enough
child
.




there
be
many
family
of
they
.
there
be
one
family
of
they
that
be
a
family
of
woman
then
,
there
be
a
father
to
they
and
he
be
not
dead
then
or
live
away
from
they
but
mostly
then
it
be
as
far
as
one
could
know
they
a
family
of
woman
,
a
mother
and
there
be
three

he
be
regularly
with

somehow
he
be
not
really

,
he
go
every

to
his
working

that
never

he
any
more
of

many
man
and
sometimes
there
be
a
woman
and
sometimes
there
be
child
of
they
,
have
such
a
way
in
they
,
they
have
such
an
uncertain
feeling
come
out
from
they
,
they
be
not
real
in

.




the
man
then
,
the
father
of
the
three
of
they
the
husband
of
the

not
very
much
of
existence
in
they
,
there
be
a
little
in

strong
inside

come
almost
to
feel
themselves
to
be
inside
in
they
,
there
get
to
be
almost
enough
inside
they
of

to
make
they
then
have
other
man
feel
that
they
really
do

there
be
not
enough
of

in

meet
with
they
that
the
existence
get
to
be
strong
enough
in
they
so
that
any
one
can

they
can
feel
it
in
they
that

anything
of
such
a
feeling
,

have
then
nothing

real
being
,
they
go
every
day
to
their
working
,
they
come
home
to
their
eating
and
their
sleeping
,
there
be
nothing
wrong

never
in

,
these
change
in
the

she
be
like
all
the
object
around

,
like
the
changing
of
the
eating
from
the
green

through
the

this
be
all
to
she
like
the
change
in
Anna
and
Cora
and
Bertha
,
they
never
make
a
history
for
she
,
they
be
not
to
she
a
history
of
she
,
they
be
the
change
around
she
,
and
first
it
be
in
Anna
then
in
Cora
then
in
Bertha
,
each
one
of
they
have
be
once
inside

not
any
more
of
a
history
to
she
,
existence
be
always
just
the
same
inside
she
and
it
would
always
be
so
in
she
until

and
that
would
be
one
more
change
of

it
would
not

there
be

they
be
there
repeat
themselves
around

,
every

be
the

he
have
in

there
be
always
many
million
make
just
like
each

.




there
be
many
way
of
be
a

and
sometime
one
get
to
know
almost
all
of

some
sometime
get
to

all
of

,
there
be
many
million
make
of
each

,
each

of
they
be
different
from
all
the
other
million
make
just
like
he
,
this
make
of
he
an
individual
,
this
in
some
of
they
make
in
he
an
individual
feeling
to
have
inside
in
he
,
in
some
of
some
kind
of
they
there
be
almost
nothing
of
such
an
individual
being
,
perhaps
always
in
every
one
in
some
way
there
be
something
of
such
an
individual
being
,
in
all
man
,
in
woman
,
and
in
the
child
of
they
.
there
be
many
kind
of
man
,
of
every
kind
of
they
there
be
many
million
of
they
many

always
make
to
be

,
of
some

of
they
there
be
more
million
make
like
the

of

kind
of
they
than
there
be
million
make
alike
of
some
other
kind
of
man
.
perhaps
this
be
not
really
true
about
any
kind
of
they
,
perhaps
there
be
not
less
million
of
one
kind
of
man
than
there
be
million
of
other
kind
of
they
,
perhaps
one
think
such
a
thing
about
some
kind
of
man
only
because
in
some
kind
of
man
there
be
more
in
each
one
of
such
a
kind
,
more
in
the
many
million
of
such
a
kind
of
they
,
of
an
individual
feeling
in
every
one
of
such
a
kind
of
they
.
perhaps
in
some
kind
of
man
there
be
many
more
,
in
the
many
million
of
their
kind
of
they
,
there
be
many
more
of
they
that
have
in
they
a
strongly
exist
individual
being
than
in
some
other
kind
of
man
other
kind
of
man
of
which
there
be
not
really
any
more
million
make
alike
than
there
be
of
those
kind
of
man
.
perhaps
it
be
this
strongly
exist
individual
be
in
some
of
the
kind
of
man
that
make
it
seem
that
there
be
less
million
of
they
in
the

of
man
than
there
be
of
other

of
man
other

of
man
who
have
in
most
of
they
less
in
they
of
such
individual
exist
.
perhaps
it
be
this
in
some
of
the
kind
of
man
those
kind
in
which
many
of
the
million
of
they
have
much
in
they
of
individual
being
,
perhaps
it
be
that
which
make
any
one
who
know
any
one
of
such
kind
of
man
think
he
more
different
from
the

of
they
make
just
like
he
the

,
make
those
who
know
any
of
such
a

,
feel
they
to
be
more
different

each
beginning
come

an
impatient
feeling
.
these
never
lose
their
big
feeling
they
just
begin
a
new
thing
and
they
be
strong
in
beginning
,
they
be
as
big
then
as
all

weakening
and
then
they
shrink
away
from

they
lose
this
certain
sense
of

they
for

feel
it
less
in
he
for
they
know
from
their

that
this
be
only
in
he
when
he

,
in
the
way
it
almost
always
be
with

,
his

always
be
outside
he
,
part
of
the

domineer
they
.




his

have
it
in

,
in
the
way
that
almost
all
child
have
it
in
they
,
his
child
have
it
in
they
for
a
long
time
to
be
afraid
of
he
.
almost
all
the
time
of
their
live
together
in
the
house
with
he
they
have
such
a

child
for
the

they
know

carry
out
into
action
any
anger
he
feel
with
they
,
it
would
soon
be

feeling
and
then
there
be
not
any
more
,
for
they
,
anything
to
fear
from
he
.
always
they
more
and
more
have
this
in

and
so
more
and
more
they
do
not
fear
he
.
always
there
remain
a
little
fear
in
they
for
child
never

can
have
in

.
he
may
have
it
in
he
to
be
bad
than
they
have
ever
know
he
,
it
be
this
uncertain
danger
to
they
that
may
be
in

that
make
a

of
they
different
way
of
be
alone
inside
in
they
,
different
way
of
think
feel
suffer
and
play
.
as
I
be
say
,
in
a
way
life
be
regular
enough
for
all
of
they
then
in
the
ten
acre
place
in
that
part
of
Gossols
where
no
other
rich
people
be
live
cut
off
from
all
right
rich
being
.
as
I
be
say
life
be
regular
enough
for
all
of
they
for
the
three
child
and
the
father
and
the
mother
of
they
.
the
child
go
to
public
school
for
their
education
.
their
father
have
idea
about
other
thing
they
should
learn
,
other
way
of
do
besides
the
way
of
the
other
child
around
they
and
it
be
in
such
thing
that
he
be
always
begin
.




then
there
be
their
eating
and
their
doctoring
and
the
father
always
have
new
idea
inside
he
,
new
way
of
begin
in
way
they
should
have
of
eat
and
the
doctoring
that
be
good
for
child
.




they
be
regular
enough
then
in
their
daily
living
.
the
child
be
regular
enough
in
their
living
,
they
be
different
each
one
of
they
from
the
other
two
of
they
,
different
in
every
thing
in
they
for
each
one
of
they
be
of
a
different
kind
of
be
from
the
other
two
of
they
.
the
father
and
the
mother
mix
up
in
they
make
of
each
one
of
they
a
different
kind
of
be
from
the
other
of
they
,
this
will
come
out
more
and
more
in
they
if
they
go
on
live
as
in
old
age
they
go
on
repeat
what
be
inside
they
so
that
any
one
can
know
they
.
in
their
early
living
when
they
be
no
long
child
this
nature
in
they
come
out
less
with
repeat
and
so
any
one
who
know
they
can
know
what
be
inside
they
.
in
child
as
it
always
be
with
young
living
there
be
much
repeat
but
it
be
not
then
so
surely
themselves
they
be
express
,
in
their
old
live
their
repeating
be
then
all
that
there
be
of
they
,
when
they
be
child
their
repeating
do
not
tell
what
be
really
they
,
as
young
grown
man
and
woman
it
be
much
hard
to
know
what
be
real
in
they
but
always
they
be
tell
,
slowly
they
begin
repeat
,
slowly
we
find
it
out
about
they
what
they
have
really
inside
they
.
as
I
be
say
they
be
regular
enough
in
their
daily
living
,
regular
as
live
come
to
be
in
later
living
,
regular
in
repeat
but
,
as
I
be
say
,
in
the
regular
repeating
in
mostly
all
child
there
be
less
that
be
really
from
they
more
that
be
just
part
of
the
regular
living
around
they
.
the
three
child
have
their
regular
school
living
.




there
be
many
way
of
take
teaching
and
each
one
of
the
Hersland
child
have
a
different
way
of
learn
from
the
other
two
of
they
,
a
different
way
of
feeling
about
teacher
and
teaching
,
a
different
way
of
have
pride
in
they
and
this
come
out
very
early
in
their
living
,
in
the
regular
public
school
training
.
there
be
many
way
of
have
pride
inside
in
one
and
always
in
receive
teach
the
different
kind
of
pride
show
in
each
one
.
Martha
,
Alfred
and
David
each
one
have
a
kind
of
pride
in
they
but
it
be
a
very
different
pride
in
each
one
of
they
,
it
make
a
very
different
relation
for
each
one
of
they
to
the
teacher
in
the
public
school
and
to
the
governess
at
home
and
to
the
child
around
they
,
to
the
father
of
they
and
sometimes
,
not
very
often
,
to
the
mother
of
they
.
the
three
of
they
Martha
,
Alfred
and
David
have
different
way
of
have
pride
in
they
in
take
the
teaching
they
have
in
school
with
the
other
child
around
they
,
in
take
their
father
's
idea
of
thing
they
should
learn
from
the
governess
and
other
teacher
he
have
to
teach
they
.
all
three
of
they
have
many
kind
of
education
because
of
he
.
sometimes
they
all
three
would
be
have
just
ordinary
schooling
.
sometimes
all
three
would
be
have
extra
teaching
,
sometimes
one
or
the
other
stop
go
to
school
to
try
some
other
way
of
education
that
their
father
then
think
would
be
good
then
for
that
one
of
they
.
mostly
though
,
in
their
young
living
,
they
have
all
three
of
they
fairly
regular
public
school
training
and
they
have
then
each
one
their
own
feeling
toward
the
life
there
with
the
teacher
and
the
other
child
and
this
will
come
out
in
the
history
of
each
one
.
this
will
come
out
in
the
history
of
each
one
of
they
for
I
be
think
with
each
one
of
the
three
of
they
soon
now
there
must
be
a
beginning
,
I
be
think
in
each
one
of
they
soon
there
will
be
a
beginning
of
a
history
of
they
from
their
beginning
,
and
so
slowly
we
can
know
it
about
they
,
each
one
of
they
,
the
real
nature
in
they
and
the
other
kind
of
nature
mix
up
in
each
one
of
they
with
the
fundamental
nature
in
they
.




mostly
then
in
their
young
living
they
have
regular
public
school
training
.
sometimes
their
father
would
be
strong
in
religion
and
then
this
would
make
for
the
child
complication
in
their
daily
living
.




as
I
be
say
in
their
young
living
there
be
mostly
a
regular
every
day
existence
for
they
,
in
their
young
living
it
be
important
to
they
that
their
father
be
as
big
as
all
the
world
around
he
,
and
it
be
then
in
he
sometimes
a
little
embarrassment
to
they
,
as
I
be
tell
,
but
mostly
they
like
it
well
enough
the
living
with
he
and
the
thing
he
be
begin
and
the
ten
acre
place
which
be
full
of
much
joy
then
for
all
of
they
and
the
people
in
the
small
house
near
they
who
be
important
then
to
all
three
of
they
in
their
daily
living
.




in
their
young
living
,
it
be
not
very
hard
on
they
,
their
father
's
way
of
always
begin
,
they
like
it
too
,
the
beginning
,
and
the
ending
too
,
that
be
not
so
bad
then
for
they
,
the
impatient
feeling
in
he
be
not
then
irritable
inside
he
.




they
have
some
trouble
with
he
then
in
their
early
living
,
sometimes
in
way
of
doctoring
,
sometimes
when
he
think
it
be
good
for
all
of
they
to
have
castor
oil
give
to
they
,
sometimes
when
he
think
a
chinese
doctor
would
be
good
for
they
,
sometimes
when
he
have
a
queer
blind
man
to
examine
some
one
of
they
;
but
all
this
,
and
the
way
of
eat
,
way
of
cooking
,
he
think
good
for
they
,
will
come
out
in
the
history
of
each
one
of
the
three
of
they
,
for
in
each
one
of
they
it
have
a
different
effect
on
they
in
their
later
living
,
these
new
beginning
in
all
their
young
living
,
beginning
and
new
way
in
doctoring
and
in
way
of
eat
.




sometimes
in
little
thing
it
would
be
annoying
to
they
in
their
early
living
,
his
way
of
beginning
and
then
never
know
that
he
be
full
up
with
impatient
feeling
and
so
have
stop
and
want
other
to
keep
on
go
.
sometimes
this
would
be
annoying
of
an
evening
.
he
would
want
to
play
card
and
the
three
of
they
would
begin
with
he
,
to
please
he
.
the
child
feel
it
to
be
hard
on
they
when
they
would
have
begin
play
card
just
to
oblige
he
and
after
a
few
minute
with
they
he
would
have
arise
in
he
his
impatient
feeling
,
and
he
would
say
,
"
here
you
just
finish
it
up
I
have
n't
time
to
go
on
playing
,
"
and
he
would
call
the
governess
to
take
his
hand
from
he
and
all
three
of
the
child
would
have
then
to
play
together
a
game
none
of
they
would
have
think
of
beginning
,
and
they
have
to
keep
on
go
for
often
he
would
stop
in
his
walking
to
find
which
one
be
win
,
and
it
never
come
to
he
to
know
that
he
have
make
the
beginning
and
that
the
child
be
play
just
because
they
have
to
,
for
he
.
it
be
a
small
thing
but
it
happen
very
often
to
they
and
it
be
annoying
for
they
.




in
their
young
live
life
be
pleasant
enough
for
all
of
they
in
the
ten
acre
place
,
though
they
have
a
governess
and
that
be
not
always
pleasant
to
they
,
their
father
be
not
always
pleasant
for
they
,
their
mother
mostly
be
not
very
important
to
they
.
it
be
true
of
all
three
of
they
then
that
they
be
more
entirely
of
they
,
the
poor
people
who
live
around
they
,
than
they
be
of
their

,
than

then
,
though
they
be
all
there
be
of
their
mother
's
daily
living
then
.




later
in
their
living
their
father
be
angry
when
he
see
it
in
they
that
they
be
not
comfortable
with
the
people
who
be
always

she
break
down
a
little
,

,
into
weakness
inside

in

,
all
of

afraid
of
their
father
when

angry
or
even

when
they
be
play
with
he
when
it
might
change
in
he
to
an
outburst
and
then
they
never
know
how
far
this
burst
would
carry
he
and
so
like
most
woman
and
all
child
,
even
when
they
would
stand
up
against
he
,
the
man
near
they
,
they
have
in
their
young
living
,
all
of
they
,
more
or
less
fear
in
they
.
this
be
not
in
all
of
they
then
a
conscious
feeling
.
they
have
each
one
then
more
or
less
of
fear
in
they
always
when
with
he
,
when
he
would
be
connect
to
they
in
their
feeling
,
in
their
actual
doing
.
they
have
not
then
this
about
they
in
they
as
a
conscious
feeling
then
each
one
of
they
,
they
do
not
have
then
in
they
while
they
be
connect
to
he
a
conscious
feeling
of
more
or
less
fear
in
they
until
after
each
time
with
he
,
then
they
would
have
more
or
less
in
they
a
conscious
feeling
in
they
of
the
fear
that
they
have
always
more
or
less
then
in
they
with
he
.
this
be
more
or
less
true
then
of
all
three
of

.
later
in
their
living
when

feeling
,
that
then
there
be
nothing
in
he
that
be
not

,
then
they
have
not

that
the
anger
in
he
never
would
drive
he
to
any
last
act
against

be
all
that
there
be
of
he
,
less
and

then
do
they
have
in
they
any
fear
of
he
,
more
and
more
then
they
could
stand
up
against
he
and
he
would
always
give
way
before
they
.
Martha

always
a
little
left
in

he
,
they
could
stand
up
to
he
and
win
out
against
he
with
not
any
fear
inside
they
of
where
his
anger
might
drive
he
.
this
be
true
of
they
in
his
later
living
,
when
his
wife

then
a
woman
to
fill
he
and
that
be
the
last

as
I
be

the
big
time
in
his

fortune
,
when
his

be
still
in
he
as
a
tender
feeling
,
when
the
important
feeling
she
have
in
she
then
be
a
kind
of
joke
to
he
,
when
she
be
not
important
to
he
but
be
not
yet
a
trouble
to
he
with
let
the
child
be
too
strong
for
she
to

inside
she
to
he
,
when
his
child
be
first
begin
to
have
a
little
in
they
of
an
individual
being
.
at
the
end
of

beginning
in
he
before

come
to
be
full
up
with
impatient
feeling
there
be
begin
in
he
impatient
feeling
,
then
his
child
be
begin
not
any
long
to
be
part
of
their
mother
to
he
,

of
the
world
around
he
that
he
be
domineering
,
fight
,
brush
away
from
before

sometimes
break
away
from

leave
though
he
never
know
this
of
himself
in
he
,
there
be
begin
then
in

blustering
fashion
so
as

.
this
be
at

have
queer
way
in

laugh
pleasantly
for

and
they
have
a
respect
for

be
prompt
in

,
he
be
large
in
buying
,
he
be
apart
from

,
they
know
then
nothing
more
about
he
,
his
child
be
a
little
of
they
then
the
people
around
he
then
,
his
wife
live
among
they
the
people
around
he
then
but
above
they
in
her
country
house
feeling
,
Mr.
Hersland
be
to
they
a
city
man
and
he
have
a
home
near
they
in
that
part
of
Gossols
where
no
other
rich
people
be

,
to
they
then
he
be
not
live
among
they
,
he
be
a
city
man
to
they
.
they
be
as
I
have
say
about
they
,
these
people
in
the
small
house
near
he
,
they
be
in
their
be
half
city
and
half
country
people
.
he
be
to
they
in
the
first
beginning
of
their
know
he
,
a
city
man
for
their
half
country
feeling
.
slowly
they
come
to
know
more
about
he
in
his
country
live
,
they
first
learn
to
know
more
about
he
as
a
man
with
a
country
house
feeling
in
he
,
then
it
come
to
be
for
they
that
they
know
he
as
a
city
man
with
a
little
country
live
in
he
,
later
in
his
later
living
they
come
to
know
in
he
city
be
with
their
half
city
feeling
and
this
be
for
they
the
end
of
his
living
,
the
end
of
his
be
among
they
.
all
man
and
all
woman
,
if
they
keep
on
in
their
living
come
to
the
repeating
that
make
it
clear
to
anyone
who
listen
to
they
then
the
real
nature
of
they
.
in
the
middle
living
of
most
man
and
many
woman
it
be
very
hard
to
know
they
,
with
some
of
they
it
be
much
hard
than
with
other
of
they
.
with
woman
,
mostly
,
it
be
easy
to
know
they
then
,
for
there
be
with
they
in
their
middle
living
less
complete
mixing
of
the
nature
in
they
than
in
most
man
.
they
,
many
woman
,
have
not
in
their
middle
living
so
much
in
their
way
of
be
to
make
it
all
inside
they
mix
into
a
whole
as
most
man
have
it
in
they
in
their
middle
living
,
they
have
less
in
the
condition
of
their
living
to
make
the
nature
in
they
mix
together
with
the
bottom
nature
of
they
to
make
a
whole
of
they
than
most
man
have
it
then
in
they
.
in
their
middle
living
there
be
strong
in
they
the
simple
repeating
that
make
they
clear
to
any
one
who
stay
with
they
,
with
most
of
they
any
one
who
watch
they
then
can
come
to
know
they
.
with
most
man
,
though
many
million
of
the
many
kind
of
they
have
this
less
in
they
,
most
kind
of
man
in
their
middle
living
be
mix
up
then
to
be
a
whole
thing
then
and
so
it
be
hard
then
to
be
sure
with
they
what
be
the
bottom
nature
in
they
,
how
far
this
bottom
nature
of
they
will
drive
they
;
and
so
child
can
not
tell
it
of
they
then
how
far
anger
in
a
father
will
drive
he
,
girl
can
not
tell
it
in
a
man
then
how
far
a
feeling
in
he
will
bring
he
,
business
man
and
man
work
with
he
or
under
he
,
man
he
be
direct
,
man
who
be
fight
he
,
they
be
like
his
child
,
they
be
never
certain
in
his
middle
living
how
far
the
power
in
he
will
carry
he
,
then
it
begin
a
little
more
to
break
down
into
repeat
in
he
,
then
more
and
more
they
see
it
in
he
just
how
far
the
nature
in
he
will
carry
he
,
and
so
more
and
more
then
it
break
down
into
repeat
in
he
and
this
go
on
to
the
last
end
of
he
.
his
wife
,
a
wife
live
with
a
man
,
know
it
early
about
he
in
her
feel
what
be
the
bottom
nature
of
he
,
know
it
soon
about
he
than
his
child
or
the
man
who
be
with
he
in
his
business
live
.
in
the
relation
a
wife
have
with
a
man
,
in
loving
,
in
eat
,
in
drinking
,
in
sleep
,
in
doctoring
,
there
be
more
simple
repeating
,
and
so
the
wife
live
with
he
come
soon
to
feel
it
in
he
in
his
middle
living
what
will
come
to
be
later
his
repeating
than
any
one
else
who
can
then
know
he
.
mostly
she
know
it
about
he
just
at
the
beginning
of
his
middle
living
,
mostly
no
one
else
come
to
be
sure
about
it
in
he
until
toward
the
beginning
of
the
ending
of
his
middle
living
.
this
in
a
wife
,
most
often
,
be
mostly
not
a
conscious
feeling
but
she
have
it
in
she
to
know
about
he
how
far
the
feeling
in
he
will
drive
he
.




one
never
can
know
certainly
in
any
one
the
nature
of
he
when
he
be
a
boy
or
a
young
man
for
then
there
be
many
thing
to
drive
he
that
be
not
the
nature
of
he
,
in
the
middle
living
it
be
only
the
nature
in
he
that
will
drive
he
and
this
will
come
out
then
always
more
and
more
in
he
as
he
begin
then
at
the
beginning
of
the
ending
of
his
middle
living
to
repeat
more
and
more
the
whole
of
he
.




with
Mr.
David
Hersland
then
in
his
middle
living
,
the
man
who
be
work
with
he
,
the
man
who
be
work
under
he
,
they
all
know
it
about
he
that
he
be
as
big
as
all
out
door
in
his
feeling
inside
he
,
they
know
it
about
he
that
he
be
strong
in
beginning
,
they
never
know
it
about
he
then
so
that
they
could
be
certain
then
in
they
how
far
anything
in
he
would
go
to
an
ending
,
how
far
the
nature
in
he
might
drive
he
,
how
far
there
would
be
success
in
he
,
if
there
ever
would
come
to
he
a
breaking
down
inside
he
,
what
it
would
be
that
would
fill
he
in
his
later
living
,
what
would
be
the
repeat
in
his
later
living
that
would
show
the
nature
in
he
.
his
child
have
it
in
they
to
know
it
soon
about
he
than
the
man
in
his
business
living
,
they
know
it
soon
about
he
how
strong
it
be
begin
to
be
in
he
in
his
middle
living
that
his
beginning
would
break
down
into
impatient
feeling
.
they
know
this
about
he
soon
than
the
man
with
he
in
his
business
living
,
they
know
it
soon
about
he
how
far
his
nature
would
take
he
,
they
learn
it
about
he
from
the
anger
in
he
but
this
to
they
too
be
in
the
beginning
of
the
ending
of
his
middle
living
.
they
soon
know
then
that
his
beginning
would
break
down
into
impatient
feeling
,
later
they
learn
it
about
he
that
the
anger
in
he
would
never
carry
he
to
any
last
act
against
they
.




some
of
the
man
who
be
in
business
live
with
Mr.
Hersland
be
always
afraid
of
he
,
afraid
of
the
big
way
in
he
,
afraid
of
his
way
of
strongly
fight
,
afraid
of
the
big
beginning
in
he
,
all
through
their
be
with
he
in
business
living
they
be
afraid
of
he
,
they
be
afraid
when
with
he
when
he
would
be
begin
thing
with
they
.
later
they
would
think
,
if
it
ever
come
that
there
be
an
ending
in
he
in
his
success
in
make
a
great
fortune
,
they
would
perhaps
think
then
that
they
have
always
know
this
about
he
but
in
his
middle
living
they
could
not
know
it
of
he
,
no
one
could
then
know
it
about
he
which
way
the
beginning
in
he
would
work
out
through
he
.
there
be
in
he
then
for
every
one
who
know
he
in
his
business
live
the
be
great
in
beginning
,
there
be
in
he
always
then
strong
fighting
,
there
be
in
he
then
brush
people
away
from
before
he
,
there
be
a
little
in
he
then
a
turning
away
from
some
of
they
in
a
blustering
fashion
as
if
he
be
brush
they
away
from
around
he
though
really
then
he
be
go
away
from
they
so
that
he
could
not
know
it
in
he
that
he
could
not
brush
they
away
from
before
he
,
there
be
in
he
a
hearty
way
of
laugh
,
a
strong
way
of
fighting
,
there
be
in
he
his
business
live
,
then
in
the
middle
of
his
live
very
little
impatient
feeling
such
as
his
child
just
about
then
be
begin
then
to
know
in
he
.
in
his
middle
living
in
his
business
work
what
be
for
his
child
impatient
feeling
in
he
in
their
trouble
with
he
be
for
the
man
around
he
strong
beginning
,
strong
fighting
,
brush
people
away
from
before
he
.
all
of
they
know
it
about
he
that
he
be
as
big
as
all
the
world
in
his
feeling
,
the
man
around
he
in
his
business
living
know
this
in
he
because
of
his
big
way
of
see
,
his
child
feel
it
in
he
in
the
trouble
they
have
in
they
when
they
be
walk
with
he
and
they
be
ashamed
because
of
the
queer
way
he
have
of
do
.




there
be
many
different
kind
of
man
that
know
Mr.
Hersland
in
his
business
Jiving
and
they
have
many
different
way
of
feeling
about
the
way
he
have
in
he
,
about
his
strong
beginning
,
about
his
fighting
everybody
who
be
not
to
his
feeling
in
he
,
about
brush
people
away
from
before
he
when
he
be
go
on
with
his
beginning
and
full
up
with
big
feeling
.
some
as
I
be
say
feel
he
to
be
a
dangerous
man
for
they
,
some
of
these
go
with
he
in
beginning
and
then
they
like
it
well
to
do
their
own
finishing
,
for
they
even
when
he
be
carry
a
beginning
through
perhaps
to
an
end
the
carry
it
on
by
he
have
for
they
too
much
in
it
of
begin
to
ever
be
a
comfort
to
they
,
some
of
these
then
do
not
fight
he
they
begin
with
he
and
then
they
go
on
in
their
own
way
to
an
ending
.
he
would
be
then
full
up
with
beginning
and
with
fighting
,
he
might
be
go
on
too
from
the
same
beginning
that
he
have
begin
together
with
they
,
he
might
be
go
on
too
to
an
ending
but
with
he
go
on
have
always
in
it
something
of
beginning
and
they
leave
it
to
he
to
go
on
alone
with
his
big
feeling
.
they
go
on
to
their
own
ending
.
he
be
strong
in
fighting
but
as
I
be
say
he
have
it
in
he
to
turn
away
in
fighting
into
another
direction
in
a
blustering
fashion
and
he
never
know
it
in
he
that
the
nature
in
he
would
not
carry
he
to
the
last
fighting

mean
a

he
that
to
some
man
mean
a
living
thing
that
they
admire
in

a
feeling

in
they
that
they
could
manage
he
by
ingratiate
diplomatic
domineering
—
mostly
in
his
middle
living
he
brush
these
away
from
around
he
but
they
do
not
lose
then
the
feeling
they
have
in
they
about
him,—that
mean
to
poor
people
near

a
hearty
nature
in

servant
in
the

some
of
they

would
break
down
into
impatient
feeling
,
they
know
it
soon
about
he
than
the
business
man
around
he
that
the
anger
in

would
not
carry

to
any
last
act
against
they
.
his

as
I
be
say
know
it
in
her
feeling
soon
than
the
business
man
around
he
soon
than
his
child
how
far
the
nature
in

would
carry
he
,
know

,
know
it
in
her
feel
how
in
a
way
she
be
not
important
to
he
though
this
last
never
come
to
be
a
conscious
feeling
till
at
the
ending
of
his
middle
living
.
the
governess
and
servant
in
the
house
with
he
,
as
I
be
say
,
like
he
then
in
his
middle
living
for
his
hearty
laughing
and
the
big
way
he
have
of
buy
but
they
never
feel
in
contact
with
he
,
his
wife
and
his
child
be
more
real
to
all
of
they
,
this
be
true
of
all
of
they
the
servant
and
the
governess
as
they
live
in
the
house
with
they
,
there
be
less
of
such
a
feeling
in
the
governess
Madeleine
Wyman
who
be
the
governess
they
have
with
they
in
the
beginning
of
the
ending
of
Mr.
Hersland
's
middle
living
,
in
the
time
when
Mrs.
Hersland
have
inside
she
the
most
important
feeling
of
herself
to
herself
in
her
feeling
.




Mr.
David
Hersland
then
in
his
home
living
have
always
new
idea
about
way
of
eat
,
way
of
doctoring
,
way
of
educate
child
,
sometimes
in
a
stubborn
way
he
would
go
on
a
long
time
with
some
one
way
of
they
but
this
be
mostly
well
at
the
end
of
his
middle
living
,
when
his
wife
be
not
any
long
strong
in
he
,
when
she
be
no
long
a

,
when
she
be
not
any

.
his
wife
have
soon
in
she
than
any
one
that
know
he
a
feeling
of
how
far
the
nature
in
he
would
carry
he
.
she
know
this
in
she
from
live
with
he
as
a
wife
to
he
,
from
the
simple
repeating
that
a

have
in
he
for
the
woman
who
be
a
wife
to
he
.
he
never

in
he
as
a
judgment
of
he
this
feeling
that
make
she
know
about
he
how
far
the
nature
in
he
would
carry
he
,
she
be
to
he
never
a

she
be
always
to
he
inside

in
such
a
part
of
she
be
she
be
either
a

or
she
be
not

the

around
he
in
his
business
live
never
make
he
feel
in
he
how
far

a
little
resistance
of
herself
inside

then
a
joke

little
resistance
of
herself

More
and

that
they
could
have
what
she
feel

have
religion
in

in
they
like
the
bottom
nature
that

kind
of

Mrs.
Hersland
never
have
her
religion
to
be
in
she
like
his
in
her
father
,
a
thing
to
give
to
she
a
feeling
of
herself
inside
she
,
religion
with
she
go
with
what
would
happen
in
her
daily
live
for
she
,
be
in
she
not
anything
of
resistance
inside
she
,
be
simply
a
part
of
the
gentle
feeling
in
she
like
her
child
inside
she
,
like
the
rich
right
living
that
be
the
natural
way
of
live
for
she
.
as
I
be
say
many
woman
have
it
in
they
to
feel
it
inside
they
that
the
last
end
of
a
bad
thing
can
not
come
to
they
,
that
the
last
evil
thing
will
not
destroy
they
;
this
be
a
common
feeling
with
woman
who
have
in
they
resist
or
attack
as
the
natural
thing
in
they
with
a
weakness
at
the
bottom
of
they
,
these
woman
have
not
in
they
a
superior
feeling
,
they
have
it
in
they
that
no
last
bad
thing
can
overwhelm
they
that
be
to
their
resist
and
at
the
same
time
the
weakness
of
they
give
to
they
the
feeling
that
something
some
one
will
take
care
of
they
.
this
be
in
many
of
they
a
religion
in
they
.




Mrs.
Hersland
be
not
such
a
one
a
last
end

she
would
be
hurt
not
angry
when

have
happen
to
they
,
she
could
be
angry
when

have
a
feeling
of
be
herself
inside

so
could
then
have

could
never
be
in

a
fine
sensitive

there
be
then
such
one
of
they

who
need

end
of
a
bad
thing

of
woman
,
the
two
kind
too

mixture
in
they
of
the
independence
and
dependence
in
they
,
many
mixing
and
sometimes
a
mixing
in
the
top
of
they
with
the
other
kind
of
nature
of
some
man
and
woman
the

more
or
less
it
be
in
they
in
all
of
this
one
kind
of
they
it
be
in

end
of
a
bad
thing
can
come
to
they
and
destroy
they
,
and
then
to
have
weakness
as
the
bottom
of
they
;
and
in
many
of
they
this
weakness
be
all
there
be
to
they
,
in
some
of
they
attack
be
all
there
be
of
they
.




the
other
kind
of
woman
and
there
be
many
kind
of
such
of
they
in
the
many
million
always
of
woman
,
this
other
kind
of
they
need
to
own
the
people
around
they
when
this
nature
be
strong
in
they
;
they
have
many
of
they
,
a
dependent
patient
way
of
living
,
but
with
the
dependent
nature
in
they
they
have
never
such
of
they
,
a
feeling
of
themselves
inside
they
,
this
come
out
in
they
only
with
the

in
their
living
,
some
of
such
of
they
never
feel
themselves
inside
they
;
there
be
then
always
many
woman
live
,
there
be
then
these
two
kind
of
they
,
this
be
now
a
history
of
some
of
each
kind
of
they
,
sometime
there
will
be
a
history
of
all
of
each
kind
of
they
and
that
will
then
be
a
history
of
all
woman
who
be
live
,
of
all
the
many
million
who
ever
be
or
will
be
live
and
then
there
will
begin
a
history
of
all
the
man
and
the
two
kind
of
they
for
there
be
in
man
the
same
two
kind
of
they
like
with
woman
and
it
work
out
differently
a
little
in
they
for
they
be
man
and
have
themselves
mostly
more
inside
they
in
their
living
,
there
be
then
these
two
kind
in
woman
and
in
man
and
always
every
one
be
of
one
kind
or
the
other
kind
of
they
.




in
their
middle
living
in
that
part
of
Gossols
where
no
other
rich
people
be
live
the
Hersland
family
have
with
they
only
woman
in
the
house
with
they
.
as
I
be
say
servant
often
have
it
in
they
to
be
a
little
queer
and
child
like
to
tease
they
,
they
have
this
queerness
from
cooking
,
from
cleaning
and
from
their
lonesome
living
,
from
their
sitting
in
the
kitchen
,
from
have
a
mistress
to
direct
they
,
and
child
to
tease
they
;
the
Irishwoman
and
one
of
the
italian
woman
that
be
cook
once
for
the
Hersland
family
in
their
middle
living
have
this
queerness
in
they
.
they
have
have
then
mostly
in
their
live
german
woman
as
servant
in
the
house
with
they
,
sometimes
they
could
not
get
they
,
once
they
have
an
Irishwoman
,
twice
italian
woman
,
once
a
Mexican
.
the
irish
woman
and
one
of
the
italian
woman
have
a
little
queerness
in
they
,
the
queerness
that
come
from
be
a
servant
and
cooking
and
sit
alone
in
a
kitchen
and
have
a
mistress
to
direct
they
and
sometimes
child
to
tease
they
,
these
have
to
be
send
away
all
of
a
sudden
.
mostly
the
german
woman
be
very
steady
woman
,
they
do
not
have
anything
of
such
a
queerness
in
they
,
sometimes
the
german
girl
they
have
with
they
be
very
young
woman
and
then
Mrs.
Hersland
have
to
train
they
,
some
of
such
of
they
have
nature
in
they
that
in
their
later
living
would
come
,
from
much
kitchen
sit
,
from
much
directing
of
the
mistress
of
the
house
to
they
,
from
much
teasing
from
the
child
in
the
house
with
they
,
would
come
to
make
of
they
a
queerness
inside
they
that
would
make
it
come
to
they
in
their
later
living
to
be
always
send
away
all
of
a
sudden
.
in
the
early
living
of
such
one
they
would
not
be
send
away
all
of
a
sudden
but
the
mistress
of
such
one
would
not
then
be
sorry
to
lose
they
.




there
be
then
as
I
be
say
,
when
Mrs.
Hersland
could
get
they
foreign
servant
in
the
house
with
they
,
there
be
always
a
governess
in
the
house
with
they
,
there
be
often
a
seamstress
stay
in
the
house
with
they
.
there
be
always
a
man
work
in
the
garden
but
he
never
live
in
the
house
with
they
.




as
I
be
say
in
most
of
their
living
they
have
german
servant
,
but
sometimes
they
could
not
get
they
,
once
they
have
an
irish
woman
cook
for
they
,
twice
italian
woman
and
once
a
Mexican
.
the
german
servant
who
live
with
they
mostly
stay
a
long
time
with
they
even
those
of
they
that
be
not
altogether
satisfy
because
until
Mrs.
Hersland
have
an
angry
feeling
about
some
one
she
would
never
dismiss
any
one
and
angry
feeling
do
not
come
to
be
in
she
very
often
.
so
mostly
the
servant
stay
a
long
time
with
they
,
not
those
of
they
that
have
servant
queerness
in
they
,
Mrs.
Hersland
never
like
such
a
one
,
she
want
her
servant
so
that
she
be
of
they
and
above
they
,
she
do
not
want
they
to
have
the
kind
of
queerness
in
they
that
make
strange
being
of
they
,
that
always
in
a
way
make
she
afraid
of
they
,
servant
be
to
Mrs.
Hersland
part
of
every
day
live
,
she
never
want
they
to
have
servant
queerness
in
they
,
she
be
more
then
of
they
though
always
she
be
above
they
and
she
could
come
to
have
with
such
of
they
rightly
an
angry
feeling
.
sometimes
she
would
have
young
foreign
girl
or
foreign
american
one
and
she
would
train
they
,
some
of
such
of
they
would
in
their
later
living
have
servant
queerness
in
they
,
mostly
Mrs.
Hersland
do
not
keep
such
one
a
long
time
,
mostly
she
like
to
have
old
woman
she
feel
herself
more
of
they
than
with
the
young
one
who
need
to
have
her
train
they
.
she
like
it
well
to
have
woman
who
only
need
directing
and
once
in
a
while
she
would
tell
such
a
one
how
to
cook
something
and
with
such
of
they
she
could
feel
of
they
and
above
they
,
she
could
with
such
one
have
an
injure
feeling
when
they
do
something
that
be
not
right
to
her
feeling
,
she
could
have
with
such
a
one
rightly
an
angry
feeling
.
she
do
not
then
like
to
have
any
one
with
servant
queerness
in
they
,
she
do
not
know
it
in
herself
that
she
do
not
like
to
have
young
girl
to
train
but
always
these
would
soon
be
leave
,
once
one
stay
on
and
on
and
Mrs.
Hersland
do
not
have
with
she
rightly
an
angry
feeling
.
she
stay
on
a
long
time
until
at
last
some
one
tell
about
she
that
she
be
ask
some
one
else
to
take
she
,
that
give
to
Mrs.
Hersland
the
injury
that
make
it
right
for
she
to
have
an
angry
feeling
in
she
and
so
at
last
she
could
dismiss
she
.
this
be
the
history
of
she
.
she
be
a
blond
little
woman
and
with
no
feeling
of
cooking
,
or
keep
anything

these
be
all
of

of
they
of
the

dependent
have
attack
more

sometime
in

of
dependent
independent
who

resist
in

.




in
all
love
,
in
all
the
many
million
always
love
mostly
there
be
one
of
they
one
of
the
two
of
they
who
be
of
the
kind
of
they
who
have
independent
dependent
nature
in
they
,
this
one
always
in
the
two
of
they
in
love
do
attack
in
love
,
sometimes
it
be
in
the
man
sometimes
in
the
woman
,
and
the
other
one
then
be
of
they
who
have
dependent
independent
nature
in
they
and
these
can
have
sometime
more
or
less
resist
in
they
,
this
make
the
pair
of
they
and
this
be
always
true
in
love
.
this
be
not
always
clear
in
the
beginning
of
a
loving
,
sometimes
it
be
the
resisting
that
be
in
appearance
like
attack
,
sometimes
the
attacking
that
have
stubbornness
or
weakness
in
it
like
resist
but
more
and
more
in
love
more
and
more
in
their
live
this
nature
in
they
come
out
of
they
in
the
repeating
that
be
in
all
real
being
.
it
be
true
then
that
always
every
one
be
of
one
kind
or
the
other
kind
of
they
the
independent
dependent
or
the
dependent
independent
kind
of
they
.
it
be
hard
to
tell
it
about
they
,
to
describe
it
how
each
one
be
of
the
kind
of
they
that
be
in
that
one
.
it
be
hard
to
tell
it
about
they
because
the
same
word
can
describe
all
of
they
the
one
and
the
other
kind
of
they
,
they
be
very
different
the
one
from
the
other
kind
of
they
,
more
and
more
perhaps
it
will
come
out
clearly
about
they
.
it
be
hard
to
describe
it
in
they
the
kind
of
be
each
one
have
in
they
,
it
be
hard
to
describe
it
in
they
it
be
hard
to
know
it
in
they
,
it
be
only
slowly
the
two
kind
of
they
come
to
be
clear
to
every
one
who
listen
to
the
repeating
that
come
out
of
they
,
who
see
the
repeating
that
be
in
they
the
repeating
of
the
bottom
nature
of
they
.
sometimes
resist
come
like
attack
,
sometimes
attack
seem
like
resist
,
slowly
it
come
out
from
each
one
the
kind
of
nature
in
they
.
so
then
this
make
always
a
pair
of
they
and
this
be
always
true
in
successful
loving
and
this
will
soon
then
be
a
history
of
every
kind
of
love
and
how
it
come
from
every
one
the
nature
of
they
.

of
any
one
can
give
to
they
.




this
be
now
a
history
of
a
number
of
man
and
woman
from
their
beginning
to
their

;
these

then
the
last

can
give
to
they
,
sometime
it
will
be
that
any
one
who
ever
be

be
or
will
be
live
,
sometime
then

one
without
any
such
being
then
in
that
one
.
Mrs.
Hersland
have
in
her
living
,
mostly
in
the
beginning
and
in
the
middle
of
her
middle
living
very
much
of
such
feeling
,
not
much
with
her
husband
or
her
child
but
with
the
servant
and
seamstress
and
governess
and
dependent
all
those
that
give
to
she
the
feeling
of
herself
inside
she
.




the
independent
dependent
kind
of
man
and
woman
have
in
they
,
most
of
they
,
mostly
in
their
injure
and
their
angry
feel
a
sense
of
impatient
feeling
or
anxious
feeling
with
a
sense
of
their
own
virtue
their
own
right
inside
they
,
they
have
not
in
they
then
mostly
a
consciousness
of
angry
or
injure
feeling
in
they
,
to
they
then
their
angry
feeling
or
their
injure
feeling
flow
from
the
outraged
virtue
or
goodness
in
they
,
to
themselves
then
they
have
not
any
angry
or
injure
feeling
as
fill
they
but
flow
from
they
because
it
be
natural
to
have
such
a
thing
in
they
when
their
goodness
or
virtue
be
outrage
by
some

be
the

angry
feeling
that
fill
she

Bridgepoint
when

inside
she
that
she
have
in

,
rightly
an
angry
and
an

feeling
,
then
she
would
show
it
by
do
nothing
to
help
the
girl
who
have
no
right
to
ask
it
of
she
or
she
would
pay
all
her
expense
for
she
.
Mrs.
Hersland
have
rightly
in
she
toward
she
an
injured
and
an
angry
feeling
,
to
herself
then
this
be
all
that
be
then
in
she
,
it
be
not
to
she
her
own
virtue
or
her
own
goodness
that
be
then
the
important
thing
inside
she

nothing
for
the

who
have
ask
she
to
help
she
when
she
have
no
right
to
ask
she
,
it
be
not
then
to
herself
in
she
a
sense
of
goodness
and
virtue
in
she
;
this
make
of
her
her
kind
of
they
the
kind
that
have
resist
and
not
attack
as
the
bottom
nature
in

;
she
be
of
this
kind
of
they
then
she
have

of
this
kind
of
they
then
,
she
have
resist
as
her
way
of
be
.
this
be
not
always
clear
in
the
beginning
sometimes
it
be
the
resisting
that
be
in
appearance
like
attack
,
sometimes
the
attacking
that
have
stubbornness
or
weakness
in
it
like
resist
but
more
in
their
live
this
nature
in
they
come
out
of

.




there
be
then
many
thing
every
one
have
in
they
that
come
out
of
they
in
the
repeat
everything
live
have
always
in
they
,
repeat
with
a
little
change
just
enough
to
make
of
each
one
an
individual
being
,
to
make
of
each
repeat
an
individual
thing
that
give
to
such
a
one
a
feeling
of
themselves
inside
they
.
I
say
each
repeat
in
each
one
have
each
time
in
it
a
little
change
,
this
sometimes
come
nearly
not
to
happen
.
some
keep
on
copy
their
repeating
in
their
talk
in
the
moving
of
their
hand
and
shoulder
and
body
in
living
,
some
keep
on
copy
other
around
they
,
some
have
almost
nothing
in
they
of
themselves
inside
they
,
every
one
have
though
always
in
they
their
own
bottom
nature
their
own
kind
of
be
,
that
be
always
in
they
repeat
,
that
be
always
in
they
a
real
being
.




many
go
on
all
their
life
copy
their
own
kind
of
repeat
,
many
go
on
all
their
life
copy
some
one
else
or
some
other
kind
of
man
or
woman
's
kind
of
repeat
,
some
kind
of
be
that
they
have
not
in
they
.
every
one
mostly
have
in
they
their
own
repeat
sometime
in
their
living
,
this
be
real
be
in
they
,
many
million
be
always
all
through
their
living
copy
their
own
repeating
,
some
have
this
in
they
because
they
be
indolent
in
live
,
it
be
easy
for
such
of
they
just
to
go
on
with
an
automatic
copying
of
their
own
repeating
rather
than
really
live
inside
they
their
repeating
.
this
be
now
a
history
of
such
a
one
.




there
be
then
always
the
two
kind
in
all
who
be
or
be
or
ever
will
have
in
they
human
being
,
there
be
then
always
to
my
thinking
in
all
of
they
the
two
kind
of
they
the
dependent
independent
,
the
independent
dependent
;
the
first
have
resist
as
the
fighting
power
in
they
,
the
second
have
attack
as
their
natural
way
of
fighting
.
as
I
be
say
this
be
not
always
easy
to

be
in
any
one
,
it
be
hard
to
know
it
about

it
be
hard
to
describe
what
I
mean
by
the
name
I
give

they
.
there
be
then

have
human
being
in

kind
or
the
other
kind
of
they
.
often
,
as
I
be
say
,
resist
be
like
attack
,
the
attack
like
resist
.
often
the
meekness
of
the
patient
submission
of
the
dependent
side
of
the
dependent
independent
kind
of
they
seem
like
the
sensitive
scared
yielding
of
the
dependent
side
of
the
independent
dependent
kind
of
they
.
each
kind
of
they
have
in
they
their
own
way
of
love
,
their
own
way
of
eat
and
drink
,

always
there
be
these
two

by
always
look
at
they
as
the
repeating
in
each
one
make

be
then
many
as
I
be
say
who
all
their
life
be
repeat
and
each
repeating
have
in
it
as
strong
feeling
as
any
part
of
their
being
,
there
be
many
million
always
be
make
such
of
they
,
sometime
there
will
be
more
understanding
of
the
meaning
in
this
saying
.
there
be
always
many
million
who
only
sometime
in
repeat
have
much
feeling
,
in
many
of
such
of
they
repeat
be
just
go
on
because
they
be
live
and
in
live
one
always
go
on
repeat
,
there
be
some
who
have
not
enough
activity
inside
they
to
go
in
this
way
in
their
repeating
,
these
have
to
copy
themselves
with
a
certain
impulsion
so
as
to
go
on
repeat
,
they
copy
themselves
in
their
way
of
talk
,
sometimes
in
their
loving
,
often
in
their
way
of
walk
,
of
move
their
hand
and
shoulder
,
in
their
way
of
smile
,
there
have
be
some
and
always
will
be
some
who
copy
themselves
so
in
all
their
living
,
in
their
eating
and
drink
,
in
every
moment
of
their
daily
living
.
I
say
some
who
have
not
much
activity
inside
they
have
a
kind
of
indolent
and
lethargic
way
of
repeat
,
something
in
between
just
go
on
repeat
and
copy
themselves
to
start
they
to
keep
go
;
Lillian
Rosenhagen
be
one
of
such
of
they
.




I
say
that
anxious
feeling
come
out
of
each
one
accord
to
the
nature
of
they
,
this
have
in
almost
every
one
every
time
it
come
in
they
out
of
they
more
in
it
of
real
feeling
in
repeat
than
many
thing
in
many
man
and
woman
.
there
be
some
man
and
woman
always
live
who
can
have
in
they
anxious
feeling
repeat
without
much
real
being
in
such
repeating
.
Lillian
Rosenhagen
be
a
little
such
a
one
.




sometimes
then
the
sister
Cecilia
Rosenhagen
would
be
live
with
her
mother
and
her
old
sister
Lillian
.
often
she
would
leave
they
and
live
away
from
they
.
the
Rosenhagen
sister
be
both
bear
American
.
the
father
be
not
live
.
the
mother
be
old
then
and
do
nothing
but
a
little
cleaning
and
cooking
,
the
daughter
Lillian
do
most
of
the
supporting
of
the
mother
.
sometimes
Cecilia
would
be
help
but
she
never
get
as
much
money
for
work
as
Lillian
and
often
she
be
not
live
with
they
.




as
I
be
say
Lillian
Rosenhagen
do
not
have
man
want
to
marry
she
.
she
be
good
look
,
she
be
tall

she
be
steady

working
.
she
have
in
her
anxious

as
I
be

a
little
,
every
time
she
have
to
do
something
.
Cecilia
have
in
her
anxious
feeling
as
excitement
always
in
she
.
she
have
a
very
disagreeable
nature
.
she
have
always
suspicion
in
she
of
every
one

,
anxious
feeling
be
always
an
excitement
to
she
,
she
have
a
great
deal
of
it
in
she
.




every
one
then
have
in
their
living
repeating
,
repeat
of
every
kind
of
thing
in

,
repeat
of
the
kind
of
anxious
feeling
almost
every
one
have
more
or
less
always
in
they
,
repeat
of
the
way
each
one
have
of
be
stupid
in
their
living
.




almost
every
one
,
always
each
one
have
a
way
of
have
a
kind
of
stupidity
inside
they
always
repeat
in
their
living
.
every
one
then
have
in
they
some
kind
of
stupidity
inside
they
.
in
each
one
it
be
of
the
nature
of
that
one
,
of
the
kind
of
stupid
being
that
be
natural
to
their
kind
of
they
.
with
some
their
stupid
being
be
mix
up
with
anxious
feeling
,
with
some
with
their
impatient
feeling
,
in
some
with
other
thing
in
they
,
in
some
it
be
just
there
in
they
it
never
mix
up
inside
they
,
it
be
just
there
,
always
in
they
,
it
be
so
steady
and
stilly
in
they
it
do
not
come
out
of
they
as
repeat
,
it
just
lie
there
quiet
,
as
the
bottom
of
they
.




Lillian
Rosenhagen
be
such
a
one
.
she
be
a
stupid
woman
.
she
have
anxious
feeling
in
she
whenever
any
little
new
thing
be
demand
of
she
,
whenever
she
have
to
finish
arrange
anything
,
whenever
in
any
way
there
be
any
adjustment
inside
she
to
anything
in
her
working
or
to
any
one
around
she
.
this
be
the
anxious
feeling
in
she
,
this
have
nothing
to
do
in
she
with
the
stupid
being
in
she
that
make
she
.




in
many
,
anxious
being
be
impatient
feeling
in
they
,
and
sometimes
in
many
,
it
be
a
suspicious
feeling
always
in
they
,
in
many
it
be
an
excited
feeling
that
keep
they
always
change
and
act
.
in
Cecilia
Rosenhagen
there
be
a
little
of
all
these
three
way
of
have
as
feel
she
anxious
being
.
mostly
it
be
the
last
kind
of
they
the
excited
way
of
be
that
be
strong
in
she
in
her
anxious
feeling
,
she
have
it
in
she
to
have
a
good
deal
of
suspicious
feeling
,
she
have
less
in
her
her
anxious
being
as
impatient
feeling
.
in
some
anxious
being
be
in
they
a
nervous
condition
.




as
I
be
say
mostly
every
one
have
in
they
more
or
less
anxious
being
,
with
some
it
be
part
of
their
stupid
being
,
this
be
not
so
in
the
sister
Lillian
,
it
be
true
of
the
other
one
.
each
one
of
they
have
in
her
her
own
stupid
being
and
now
this
be
a
history
of
it
in
each
of
they
.




Lillian
Rosenhagen
be
four
year
old
than
her
sister
Cecilia
.
Cecilia
have
a
very
unpleasant
nature
,
she
have
nervousness
in
she
,
she
have
suspicion
in
she
,
she
have
anxious
being
as
excitement
always
work
in
she
.
she
be
not
a
good
worker
,
she
be
not
a
bad
worker
,
she
could
find
people
to
employ
she
and
they
would
always
be
ready
to
keep
she
long
than
her
suspicious
temper
would
let
she
.
as
I
be
say
sometimes
she
would
be
live
with
her
sister
and
mother
and
then
anxious
being
would
be
such
an
excitement
inside
she
that
she
would
go
away
and
live
with
any
friend
who
would
let
she
.
she
always
have
a
new
friend
who
would
take
she
,
then
she
would
have
her
anxious
being
as
a
new
excitement
in
she
and
she
would
come
back
to
her
mother
and
sister
.
Lillian
never
begin
again
with
she
from
any
goodness
inside
she
.
she
have
no
use
for
her
sister
,
they
have
no
use
for
each
other
,
they
both
have
stupid
be
in
they
and
they
put
up
with
each
other
when
they
be
together
,
they
do
not
quarrel
with
each
other
,
they
do
not
enough
touch
one
another
to
quarrel
together
.




they
each
one
of
they
have
in
they
their
own
kind
of
stupid
being
.
in
lillian
stupid
being
be
the
vague
bottom
to
she
that
be
always
there
when
you
look
at
she
.
it
make
she
,
it
have
nothing
to
do
in
she
with
the
anxious
feeling
sometimes
in
she
,
not
with
any
trouble
she
have
in
she
with
her
mother
or
her
sister
or
a
customer
or
the
daily
living
and
everything
then
that
happen
to
she
.
she
go
on
repeat
because
in
live
one
go
on
repeat
,
because
that
be
the
way
one
do
in
living
.
Lillian
Rosenhagen
go
on
living
,
sometimes
she
have
a
real
feeling
in
her
living
,
often
she
have
in
she
a
kind
of
anxious
feeling
,
this
she
have
in
she
whenever
she
have
any
adjusting
of
herself
to
she
work
,
her
work
to
a
fitting
of
herself
to
any
one
who
have
then
something
to
do
with
she
.
as
I
say
she
always
then
have
a
kind
of
anxious
feeling
in
she
,
this
never
come
to
be
sorrow
in
she
,
this
never
come
to
be
a
puzzled
or
a
worried
feeling
in
she
,
it
be
just
such
a
kind
of
anxious
feeling
in
she
that
make
a
little
feeling
inside
she
that
be
not
just
go
on
live
in
she
,
not
a
copying
of
herself
in
repeat
in
she
,
not
just
a
drift
in
she
,
it
be
pretty
nearly
a
really
anxious
being
in
she
.
as
I
say
she
have
a
vague
stupid
be
as
a
bottom
to
she
.
mostly
she
go
on
repeat
because
repeat
go
on
always
when
any
one
be
still
live
.
she
have
a
vague
stupid
bottom
being
,
this
be
hardly
repeat
,
this
be
just
there
lie
in
she
as
a
bottom
.
she
have
a
physical
something
that
make
an
impression
,
that
be
some
attraction
.
mostly
man
do
not
want
she
for
marry
,
no
man
ever
want
she
enough
to
have
she
marry
he
.
she
just
go
on
living
and
dress
-
making
.




every
one
have
in
they
their
own
history
inside
they
,
in
each
one
the
history
come
out
of
they
in
the
repeating
that
be
always
in
they
that
sometime
when
all
the
repeating
in
they
have
be
do
by
they
and
they
be
no
long
live
and
so
do
no
more
repeating
,
that
sometime
will
be
a
whole
history
of
each
one
of
they
.




sometime
then
each
one
will
be
dead
and
they
each
one
will
do
no
more
repeating
;
there
will
then
have
be
,
there
will
then
be
a
whole
history
of
each
one
.
in
some
as
I
be
say
repeat
come
almost
without
any
change
any
differing
from
the
other
repeat
in
they
,
in
some
repeat
always
have
some
change
,
in
some
repeating
have
each
time
real
feeling
,
in
some
it
have
so
little
real
feeling
it
be
only
copy
their
own
repeating
.
there
can
be
then
every
kind
of
repeat
with
every
degree
of
change
to
some
which
take
strong
look
to
be
sure
it
be
repeat
.
there
can
then
be
repeat
with
every
degree
of
change
,
with
every
degree
of
feeling
.
there
can
be
strong
feeling
in
each
repeating
and
the
repeating
have
almost
no
change
.
there
be
every
kind
of
mixing
,
there
be
excitement
and
nervous
feeling
in
repeat
that
sometimes
make
it
seem
to
be
change
,
there
be
nervous
or
excited
or
anxious
be
around
repeat
that
make
it
sometimes
seem
like
a
fresh
feeling
.
even
in
anxious
being
there
can
be
repeat
without
fresh
feeling
.
there
can
be
every
kind
of
mixing
,
this
be
a
history
of
some
of
they
.




repeat
then
be
always
come
out
of
every
one
,
almost
always
in
the
repeating
in
every
one
and
come
out
of
they
there
be
a
little
change
.
all
the
repeating
in
each
one
make
a
history
of
each
one
always
come
out
of
they
.
there
be
always
repeat
in
every
one
but
such
repeating
have
almost
always
in
it
a
little
change
,
the
whole
repeat
then
that
be
always
come
the
whole
repeating
that
come
out
of
they
every

who
have
live

Lillian
and
Cecilia
Rosenhagen

in
their
own
way
of
be
have
both
of
they
very
little
change
in
their
repeat
,
very
little
fresh
feeling
in
their
repeating
.
Lillian
Rosenhagen
have
as
I
be
say
always
when
she
have
to
do
finish
or
beginning
or
a
little
adjusting
of
anything
or
of
herself
to
any
one
around
she
,
have
always
then
a
little
anxious
being
that
have
always
in
it
a

friend
to

this
be
a
history

not
a
bad
one
either

she
be
good
enough
so
that
she
would
always
find

,
she
would
always
leave
they
while

they
have
in
they
almost
nothing
of

then
have
very
little
anxious
being
in
they
,
they
have
independent
dependent
nature
in

.
there
be
many

weakness
in
they
or
a
sensitive
being
in

else
use
they
for
live
,
some
one
else
need
they
for
protect
or
else
because
they
be
at
the
last
need
in
they
for
some
other
thing
.
there
be
many
many
million
always
be
make
of
such
of
they
,
they
be
wonderful
instrument
for
other
people
's
living
,
they
never
know
it
in
they
that
it
be
other
people
's
life
they
be
live
.
as
I
be
say
these
have
in
they
always
in
attack
something
that
be
like
anxious
being
in
they
,
but
this
be
mostly
not
true
of
they
,
it
be
mostly
not
true
of
they
that
they
have
anxious
being
in
they
for
most
of
they
and
there
be
many
man
and
many
woman
of
they
most
of
they
have
not
it
in
they
to
have
consciously
and
most
of
they
not
to
have
any
kind
of
fear
in
they
.
one
must
have
some
kind
of
fear
in
one
to
have
in
one
really
anxious
being
,
servant
girl
woman
have
always
such
fear
in
they
,
dependent
independent
man
and
woman
have
almost
always
fear
in
they
,
these
have
bottom
earth
feeling
in
they
,
they
feel
their
pulse
to
see
if
they
be
live
,
any
one
with
bottom
earth
feeling
in
they
can
have
at
some
time
fear
in
they
,
but
this
be
not
what
be
now
be
write
.




independent
dependent
man
and
woman
have
attack
as
a
natural
way
of
fight
in
they
,
all
independent
dependent
man
and
woman
have
attack
as
the
natural
way
of
fighting
,
the
kind
of
independent
dependent
man
and
woman
,
these
of
that
kind
of
they
who
have
very
much
in
they
of
weakness
or
sensitive
being
or
vague
or
vacant
being
as
the
bottom
of
they
such
of
they
have
in
they
when
it
come
to
they
to
have
fight
in
their
living
and
most
of
they
have
a
great
deal
in
they
of
fighting
,
some
of
they
have
it
in
they
then
to
conquer
whatever
it
be
in
the
bottom
of
they
that
do
not
help
they
in
fighting
,
some
of
they
harden
themselves
harden
the
weakness
in
they
so
that
it
do
not
stop
they
,
some
fill
themselves
with
angry
feeling
to
concentrate
in
they
the
vague
being
they
have
inside
they
as
a
bottom
to
they
,
some
just
go
ahead
with
the
vacant
being
lie
there
in
they
they
go
ahead
and
it
give
to
such
of
they
a
be
like
an
anxious
feeling
but
it
be
not
fear
in
such
of
they
it
be
only
the
vacant
being
in
they
,
some
get
so
strongly
in
they
the
fighting
for
some
one
around
they
that
it
take
away
from
they
in
attack
the
sensitive
feeling
that
might
stop
they
.
in
all
of
such
of
they
there
be
to
one
look
at
they
anxious
be
in
they
but
this
be
not
really
in
they
,
it
be
only
the
halting
that
come
to
they
in
attack
from
the
kind
of
bottom
in
they
,
from
the
weakness
or
sensitive
being
or
vague
or
empty
being
that
make
the
bottom
of
each
one
of
such
of
they
.
these
then
have
in
they
halt
in
attack
,
they
have
not
in
they
really
anxious
being
,
they
have
not
in
they
really
fear
in
they
,
they
have
not
in
they
servant
girl
nature
in
they
,
they
have
not
in
they
dependent
independent
nature
in
they
,
they
have
not
really
resist
in
they
,
they
may
help
their
attack
by
a
kind
of
stubbornness
in
they
but
this
be
never
in
such
of
they
real
resist
in
they
and
sometime
every
one
who
live
near
they
learn
to
know
it
in
they
.
the
halting
in
they
then
in
their
beginning
an
attacking
give
to
such
of
they
then
an
appearance
to
they
not
of
timidity
in
they
but
of
anxious
be
in
they
,
sometimes
anxious
nervous
be
in
they
.
they
have
not
then
really
anxious
be
in
they
.
some
time
there
will
be
here
a
history
of
many
of
they
.
the
other

she
be
of

of
woman
from

way
in
she
that
be
always
in
those
who
have
the

side
of
independent
dependence
in
they
,
when
that
weakness
come
to

with
the
injure

.
the
difference
between
she
and
the
other
kind
of
woman
I
have
be
just
describe
,
the
kind
who
have
much
bottom
in
they
of
sensitive
being
or
weakness
or
vague
be
or
empty
being
,
with
much
in
they
of
attack
,
with
very
little
in
they
of
anxious
being
for
they
have
not
in
they
the
kind
of
sense
that
give
fear
inside
they
to
man
and
woman
,
the
woman
then
who
have
halt
in
attack
halting
that
look
like
nervous
anxious
being
in
they
not
like
timid
being
,
the
difference
between
such
one
and
such
a
one
as
the
dress
-
maker
Mary
Maxworthing
will
come
out
later
in
the
history
of
the
Hersland
daughter
Martha
,
in
the
history
of
Julia
Dehning
.
now
there
be
a
history
of
Mary
Maxworthing
and
her
business
of
dress
-
making
.




Mary
Maxworthing
then
live
her
own
life
,
have
her
own
way
of
dressmaking
,
she
be
not
of
they
who
live
other
people
's
life
in
live
there
be
many
of
such
of
they
many
who
have
an
instrument
nature
in
they
,
many
who
have
attack
in
they
as
their
natural
way
of
fighting
but
have
at
the
bottom
of
they
sensitive
being
or
weakness
as
the
bottom
of
they
or
vacant
being
as
the
bottom
of
they
or
vague
be
as
the
bottom
of
they
.
such
of
they
have
it
in
they
often
to
live
other
people
's
life
in
their
living
,
some
have
it
less
some
have
it
more
in
they
,
it
depend
in
they
on
the
proportion
in
they
of
fight
power
in
they
,
in
the
relation
in
they
of
the
attack
instinct
in
they
with
the
other
bottom
in
they
,
it
depend
in
they
on
the
way
stubbornness
be
in
they
,
in
the
way
stupid
being
be
in
they
;
the
more
there
be
in
they
of
stupid
being
or
stubborn
be
in
they
the
more
there
be
in
such
of
they
of
resist
,
of
live
their
own
life
in
their
living
.
there
be
some
of
they
who
have
sensitive
being
or
vacant
being
or
weakness
as
a
bottom
to
they
or
vague
be
in
they
to
so
completely
fill
they
that
it
make
a
personality
in
they
and
then
they
live
their
own
life
in
their
living
.




sometime
there
will
be
some
understanding
of
this
nature
in
man
and
in
woman
,
soon
it
will
show
in
Martha
Hersland
and
in
Julia
Dehning
,
soon
it
will
show
a
little
in
a
sister
of
the
first
governess
the
Herslands
have
ever
live
with
they
.
Mr.

have
a
nature
in
he

have
a
connection
with
the
kind
of

connection
in
one
direction

life
in
her
living
and

have
a
fairly
successful
life

she
marry
very
well
then
,
not
well

comfortable
in

she
have
work
with
her

kind
of
a
partner
.

a
hard
time
keep
together
,
Mabel

be
a
little
flighty
sometimes

have
a
little
impatient
be
in

I
like
to
tell
it
well
in
a
woman
the
kind
of
nature
a
certain
kind
of
man
and
woman
have
in
living
,
I
like
to
tell
about
it
well
in
a
woman
because
it
be
clear
in
she
and
I
know
it
well
,
a
little
,
not
very
much
well
.
one
can
see
it
in
she
soon
,
a
little
,
not
very
much
soon
,
one
can
see
it
as
simple
,
thing
show
more
nicely
separate
in
she
and
it
be
therefore
easy
to
make
it
clear
in
a
description
of
she
.
such
a
nature
as
Mary
Maxworthing
have
in
she
be
of
the
kind
of
nature
that
many
man
and
woman
have
in
they
.
it
be
clear
in
she
than
in
a
man
like
she
and
so
I
will
describe
it
in
she
.
sometime
it
will
be
clear
just
why
and
how
different
her
kind
in
a
man
be
from
she
,
this
will
all
be
clear
later
.

be
a
history
of
Mary
Maxworthing
,
and
her
dress
-
making

which
kind

in
some
with
the
feeling

as
I
be
say
every
one
have
stupid
be
in
they
.
it
be
very
important
to
know
it
in
each
one
the
kind
of
stupid
be
in
they
.
stupid
be
be
not
foolish
being
,
it
be
not
dull
or
senseless
being
,
it
be
sometimes
foolish
being
,
it
be
sometimes
dull
or
senseless
being
,
it
be
not
always
any
very
certain
kind
of
be
,
it
be
always
in
each
one
and
sometime
it
come
in
some
fashion
out
of
every
one
.
stupid
being
then
will
soon
be
certain
in
each
one
.
this
be
now
a
history
of
stupid
be
in
some
.
stupid
be
then
be
somewhere
in
each
one
,
in
every
one
there
be
in
they
the
stupid
being
that
be
natural
to
they
,
that
make
their
kind
of
they
.
there
be
then
in
every
one
their
kind
of
stupid
being
and
it
come
out
in
each
one
accord
to
the
nature
of
that
one
.
in
some
,
stupid
being
be
resist
.
in
many
then
who
have
independent
dependent
nature
in
they
resist
be
the
stupid
be
in
they
.
in
those
who
have
in
they
dependent
independent
nature
,
in
they
stubbornness
be
a
resisting
that
be
natural
in
they
with
their
kind
of
know
,
resist
in
such
of
they
be
not
the
stupid
part
of
they
.
each
one
as
I
be
say
have
in
they
their
kind
of
stupid
being
,
the
kind
of
stupid
being
that
be
natural
to
their
kind
of
they
.




I
say
then
in
many
who
have
independent
dependent
nature
in
they
who
have
attack
as
the
natural
way
of
fight
in
they
,
who
have
weakness
or
vagueness
or
sensitiveness
or
emptiness
as
the
natural
bottom
of
they
,
in
all
of
such
of
they
stubborn
resisting
be
almost
always
a
part
in
they
of
the
stupid
nature
in
they
,
of
the
stupid
nature
every
one
have
in
they
.




this
be
not
so
in
Mary
Maxworthing
.
she
almost
never
have
in
she
any
stubborn
resisting
,
the
stupid
be
in
she
come
with
the
impatient
be
in
she
,
with
angry
feeling
sometimes
in
she
,
with
the
injure
feeling
sometimes
in

.
she
have
really
very
little
stupid
be
in
she
,
she
have
not
any
stupid
kind
of
bottom
to

.
she
do
not
have
really
very
much
bottom
in
she
,
she
have
in
her
gayety
and
sensitive
be
in
she
enough
to
give
she
a
sympathetic
flavor
,
and
a
very
little
attack
in
she
but
enough
to
make
successful
living
in
she
,
and
impatient
be
in
she
enough
to
make
it
sometimes
unpleasant
to
live
with
she
,
and
impatient
and
angry
feeling
in
she
enough
to
give
a
stupid
being
to
she
,
and
injure
feeling
in
she
enough
to
keep
her
sense
of
responsibility
to
herself
alive
inside
she
.
this
be
a
history
of

this
be
now
another

amusing
.
she
like

but
she
want

.
she
begin
to

when
she
be
about

-
one
of
some
other
way
of

,
she
be
very
good
at

she
be

decision
,
when
she
decide
to

as
I

have
good
idea
about
dress
for
woman
,
she
have
a
good
sense
of

.
so
then

Linker
who
live
down
in
the
country
to
come
and

be
soon
very
clever
at
dress
-
making
.
soon
they
be
ready
to
begin
.
then
they
start
an
establishment
for
dress
-
making
in
that
part
of
Gossols
where
rich
people
be
live
.
they
do
not
then
have
success
with
their

Mary

a
certain
gayety
in

,
she
do
not
like
take
care
of

.
she
do
not
like
farming
for
that
be
a
dreary
way
of
living
,
not
that
she
be
a
discontent
person
but
she
like
a
certain
gayety
in
living
.
she
have
no
wildness
in
she
being
,
she
be
not
really
a
thoughtless
person
,
she
be
not
a
very
conscientious
person
but
she
be
conscientious
enough
for
ordinary
living
,
she
be
conscientious
the
way
most
people
be
in
living
,
there
be
nothing
reckless
in
her
being
.
she
have
a
kind
of
responsibility
to
other
and
to
herself
in
her
living
,
she
be
not
at
all
a
wild
or
stupid
being
.




they
be
at
first
not
successful
in
their
business
of
dress
-
making
,
they
have
trouble
with
each
other
and
with

enough
to

the
Maxworthing
way
of
living
,
she
never
like
farming
,
it
be
to
she
a
dreary
way
of
living
,
she
do
not
find
it
very
pleasant
take
care
of
child
because
it
leave
she
no
freedom
for
living
.
she
prefer
dress
-
making
and
it
be
very
disappointing
when
she
be
at
first
not
successful
in
this
undertaking
.




they
have
not
enough
customer
to
pay
they
to
keep
go
,
Mary
Maxworthing
soon
use
up
all
the
money
she
have
save
up
to
begin
this
undertaking
,
soon
then
the
two
of
they
begin
quarrel
,
soon
then
they
have
for
a
while
to
give
up
dress
-
making
;
Mary
have
to
go
back
to
her
place
and
once
more
begin
to
earn
a
living
by
take
care
of
child
.




this
be
the
way
it
come
to
an
end
for
they
the
first
effort
for
freedom
,
for
Mary
from
nursery
governessing
,
for
Mabel
Linker
from
sew
other
people
's
cut
and
fitting
.




Mary
Maxworthing
have
in
she
something
of
a
despairing
feeling
when
her
undertaking
come
to
such
a
helpless
ending
,
when
she
have
to
go
back
to
nursey
governessing
,
when
she
have
not
any
of
the
money
leave
that
she
have
be
save
for
five
year
for
this
undertaking
.
Mary
Maxworthing
always
have
a
certain
stylish
elegance
in
dressing
,
she
have
a
good
sense
for
fashion
and
a
feeling
for
gayety
without
any
wildness
in
her
living
.
there
be
nothing
wild
in
her
being
,
nothing
reckless
ever
in
her
feeling
,
she
have
pride
but
not
too
much
pride
in
her
being
,
she
have
a
reasonable
amount
of
good
sense
and
conscientiousness
in
living
,
she
have
start
her
undertaking
with
too
much
ambition
for
the
money
she
have
be
save
and
the
talent
she
and
Mabel
Linker
have
between
they
.
that
be
to
say
more
money
so
that
they
could
keep
on
long
wait
for
people
to
know
they
or
more
distinction
in
their
working
might
have
keep
they
go
;
but
with
the
money
they
have
for
wait
and
the
talent
there
be
in
the
two
of
they
they
be
too
ambitious
in
their
beginning
.
what
they
have
between
they
be
not
enough
for
such
an
ambitious
beginning
as
they
have
make
of
their
undertaking
.
Mary
Maxworthing
like
distinction
,
she
have
a
certain
ambition
,
she
have
not
much
attack
in
she
for
win
but
she
have
a
certain
kind
of
certainty
of
successful
doing
;
she
have
impatient
being
,
she
have
a
certain
gayety
in
her
being
.
Mabel
Linker
have
not
any
sense
in
she
to
keep
any
one
else
with
she
from
do
anything
foolish
,
not
that
she
would
of
herself
have
make
such
a
beginning
but
she
have
not
the
energy
in
she
for
beginning
,
she
have
not
the
kind
of
sense
in
she
for
judge
,
she
could
never
have
any
judgment
of
any
way
of
beginning
.
then
they
have
trouble
in
their
living
.
as
I
be
say
Mary
Maxworthing
have
gayety
in
be
,
she
have
very
little
almost
not
any
anxious
being
;
she
have
independent
dependent
being
and
attack
be
her
natural
way
of
fighting
but
there
be
very
little
fighting
in
her
being
,
she
have
in
she
as
a
bottom
a
little
but
not
very
much
sensitive
being
;
she
have
in
she
as
a
bottom
almost
not
any
stupid
being
.
she
have
in
she
some
impatient
being
,
she
could
have
in
she
a
little
injured
being
,
she
could
have
in
her
angry
feeling
,
but
mostly
it
be
the
impatient
being
that
sometimes
be
nervous
impatient
being
that
make
she
interfere
,
that
make
she
always
sure
of
know
,
that
be
the
stupid
side
to
her
being
,
that
make
the
trouble
between
she
and
Mabel
Linker
when
they
be
then
work
together
.
Mabel
Linker
have
very
little
common
sense
,
she
have
little
twitter
flighty
way
in
she
but
she
be
a
good
sewer
,
she
be
a
good
cutter
and
fitter
,
she
be
almost
a
brilliant
dress
-
maker
,
but
she
have
very
little
stability
in
her
character
.
Mary
Maxworthing
begin
with
almost
an
idolising
of
she
and
then
there
come
trouble
when
they
begin
live
together
.
then
the
money
be
all
go
and
they
both
have
become
a
little
bitter
.
Mary
have
then
almost
a
despairing
feeling
in
she
.
Mabel
take
it
all
as
a
thing
that
have
happen
to
she
and
now
there
would
be
some
other
thing
to
happen
to
she
.
she
take
it
not
so
much
lightly
as
as
a
thing
that
be
over
and
that
be
all
there
be
about
it
to
she
.




this
be
only
the
beginning
of
trouble
for
she
but
she
always
take
it
as
it
come
to
she
,
not
lightly
but
simply
and
flightily
as
it
happen
to
she
.




Mary
Maxworthing
have
in
she
something
of
a
despairing
feeling
at
the
failure
of
her
undertaking
,
at
her
return
to
nursery
governessing
.
at
first
she
do
not
even
get
a
position
so
she
live
on
with
Mabel
Linker
who
do
enough
work
to
support
she
.
Mary
Maxworthing
have
a
miserable
feeling
then
in
she
,
she
have
not
an
anxious
feeling
in
she
because
a
living
for
she
be
always
around
she
,
she
could
always
find
people
to
employ
she
she
have
this
always
in
she
,
but
she
have
for
the
first
time
in
she
live
in
she
a
discouraged
sense
of
failure
.




Mary
Maxworthing
then
have
,
for
she
,
a
very
helpless
dreary
feeling
at
the
failure
of
her
undertaking
.
as
I
be
say
it
be
not
in
her
anxious
being
for
she
know
very
well
she
never
would
have
any
real
trouble
earn
a
living
but
there
be
then
for
she
no
freedom
in
living
,
no
distinction
for
she
in
the
future
.
so
she
have
in
she
,
for
she
,
really
a
despairing
feeling
.
it
be
not
a
desperately
despairing
feeling
but
it
be
really
,
for
she
,
a
despairing
feeling
.
she
and
Mabel
Linker
still
continue
to
live
together
.
Mabel
Linker
go
to
work
right
away
for
another
dress
-
maker
,
it
be
hard
work
for
she
but
this
do
not
make
really
any
very
great
difference
to
she
.
for
a
little
while
then
Mary
depend
on
Mabel
Linker
to
support
she
,
after
a
little
while
some
one
employ
she
to
help
out
in
a
little
store
near
she
.
she
stay
there
all
of
that
summer
.
later
she
go
to
a
friend
of
the
last
person
who
have
employ
she
as
a
nursery
governess
for
she
,
and
every
one
who
know
she
think
that
the
future
now
be
settle
for
she
.




every
one
who
know
she
have
a
certain
feeling
about
she
.
every
one
who
know
she
have
a
secure
feeling
about
she
.
there
be
many
way
every
one
know
any
one
feel
in
they
the
character
of
that
one
.
there
be
very
many
way
then
for
people
to
feel
other
people
around
they
.
there
be
some
who
make
almost
every
one
who
know
they
have
the
same
kind
of
feeling
about
they
.
in
a
way
Mary
Maxworthing
be
such
a
one
.
Mabel
Linker
be
not
the
least
bit
such
a
one
,
almost
every
one
who
know
she
have
a
different
feeling
.
with
Mary
maxworthe
it
be
a
different
matter
,
some
like
she
and
some
do
not
like
she
,
but
whether
one
like
she
or
do
not
like
she
each
one
have
about
the
same
feeling
about
she
,
about
the
same
estimate
of
she
.
it
be
a
queer
thing
though
with
woman
and
with
man
too
like
she
,
they
can
astonish
every
one
and
Mary
Maxworthing
have
this
in
she
.
there
be
always
many
million
of
woman
and
of
man
be
make
like
she
.
this
be
now
a
history
of
the
feeling
about
she
,
the
estimate
every
one
who
know
she
have
of
she
,
of
the
thing
in
she
that
be
a
surprise
to
every
one
who
know
she
.
the
kind
she
be
will
then
always
come
to
be
clear
.
always
one
must
remember
each
one
have
their
own
way
of
feel
other
people
's
nature
.




there
be
then
some
kind
of
man
and
woman
,
some
man
and
some
woman
of
some
kind
of
nature
who
have
it
in
they
to
have
every
one
who
know
they
have
about
the
same
idea
of
they
.
some
may
like
,
some
may
dislike
they
,
some
may
be
indifferent
to
such
a
one
but
all
of
they
every
one
who
ever
come
to
know
that
one
have
about
the
same
estimate
of
such
a
one
.
this
be
now
a
history
of
such
a
one
.




Mary
Maxworthing
be
then
such
a
one
.
she
have
a
certain
gayety
in
living
but
no
wildness
no
recklessness
in
her
being
and
no
one
would
think
such
a
thing
from
the
certain
pleasant
gayety
she
have
in
living
.
she
have
attack
in
fighting
but
really
very
little
attack
fighting
in
her
living
and
no
one
ever
expect
not
to
have
it
more
strongly
in
she
being
than
it
really
come
to
be
see
as
it
come
out
of
she
.
she
have
no
reserve
of
fight
in
she
,
every
one
who
know
she
know
just
about
how
much
strength
she
have
in
she
.
she
have
a
little
impatient
being
,
a
little
unpleasant
temper
in
she
,
a
little
insistence
on
interfere
in
she
,
a
small
amount
of
pride
in
she
,
enough
of
sensitive
response
to
make
a
reasonable
sweetness
in
she
,
a
little
tendency
to
angry
and
injure
feeling
in
she
but
not
very
much
of
this
in
she
not
more
of
this
in
she
than
any
one
would
expect
from
she
.
she
have
a
reasonable
sense
of
responsibility
in
she
,
a
reasonable
efficiency
in
she
,
she
be
in
short
what
every
one
think
she
.
she
could
still
then
surprise
every
one
who
know
she
.
she
be
still
then
really
what
every
one
have
think
she
.
it
be
what
no
one
who
know
she
ever
think
of
she
that
the
quality
of
be
in
she
could
ever
lead
she
to
have
a
certain
thing
happen
,
it
do
happen
to
she
,
this
be
a
history
of
she
then
and
how
she
really
be
what
every
one
think
she
.
she
really
be
what
every
one
think
she
,
every
one
who
know
she
have
about
the
same
estimate
of
she
,
every
one
who
know
she
be
surprise
by
something
that
happen
to
she
.
this
be
a
history
then
of
what
happen
to
she
and
then
how
later
a
reasonable
success
come
to
she
.




after
she
have
to
give
up
the
dress
-
making
,
after
she
have
use
up
all
the
money
she
have
save
for
that
undertaking
she
have
in
she
almost
a
despairing
feeling
,
not
anything
of
an
anxious
feeling
,
a
little
impatient
feeling
,
nothing
then
of
an
angry
or
injure
feeling
.
she
have
not
then
as
I
be
say
anything
of
an
anxious
feeling
,
she
be
always
certain
of
be
able
to
earn
a
living
,
she
have
no
fear
in
she
in
living
,
she
have
a
despairing
feeling
for
the
loss
of
freedom
and
possible
success
and
distinction
,
she
have
an
impatient
feeling
,
not
altogether
an
irritable
feeling
,
it
be
more
in
the
nature
of
a
purely
impatient
feeling
because
she
have
to
go
back
to
take
care
of
child
.
this
altogether
make
in
she
something
very
nearly
a
despairing
feeling
in
she
.
she
be
then
as
I
be
say
still
live
with
Mabel
Linker
.
she
have
not
yet
find
a
position
but
this
be
not
then
worry
she
,
she
know
she
could
always
earn
a
living
,
she
have
in
she
then
her
kind
of
despairing
feeling
.
Mabel
Linker
be
earn
then
enough
to
support
herself
and
she
.
this
be
now
what
happen
to
both
of
they
.




Mary
Maxworthing
as
I
be
say
be
really
whatever
any
one
who
know
she
think
she
and
yet
she
now
have
something
happen
to
she
that
surprise
every
one
who
know
she
.




she
have
as
I
be
say
in
she
then
a
kind
of
a
despairing
a
little
an
impatient
feeling
,
she
have
no
really
anxious
or
excited
or
fearful
being
then
in
she
,
she
know
she
could
always
get
a
good
place
for
people
always
want
she
.
she
be
then
as
I
be
say
not
a
very
young
woman
.
for
the
rest
of
the
summer
she
finally
begin
work
in
a
store
near
she
,
then
later
she
get
a
good
position
as
nursery
governess
and
everything
be
satisfactory
to
she
.
Mabel
Linker
be
work
then
in
the
beginning
of
winter
around
in
house
sew
but
she
expect
soon

will
show
in

happen
to

it
be
a
surprise
to
every
one
who

who
learn
it
about
she
.
it
be
the
very
last
thing
any
one
would
have
expect
to
happen
to
she
.
one
would
have
think
surely
Mary
Maxworthing
would
make
a
man
marry
she
before
such
a
thing
would
happen
to
she
.
it
be
a
surprise
to
every
one
who
know
she
.
but
she
be
always
then
the
same
that
every
one
think
she
only
,
as
she
say
,
alright
there
be
nothing
to
say
about
it
,
it
have
happen
to
she
.
that
be
the
end
of
the
fact
for
she
,
that
be
not
the
end
of
the
trouble
for
she
,
that
be
the
end
of
the
fact
for
she
.
as
I
be
say
Mary
have
stupid
be
in
she
connect
in
she
with
the
impatient
feeling
she
have
in
she
,
with
the
injure
feeling
she
could
have
sometime
in
she
.
she
have
no
stupid
be
as
a
bottom
to
she
,
by
and
by
this
will
be
clear
.
Mabel
Linker
have
a
hard
time
take
care
of
she
.
gradually
the
people
who
employ
she
know
what
have
happen
to
she
.
they
be
surprised
too
that
it
could
happen
to
she
,
she
say
nothing
to
explain
how
it
have
happen
,
she
say
,
alright

she
like

now
she
would
have
one
.
there
be
no
hardness
in
she
,
there
be
then
no
really
anxious
be
in
she
.
it
have
happen
and
that
be
the
end
of
that
matter
to
she
.
soon
every
one
who
know
she
have
the
same
feeling
about
what
have
happen
to
she
.
every
one
continue
to
have
the
same
opinion
of
she
whether
they
like
she
or
whether
they
do
not
like
she
as
they
have
have
before
this
happen
to
she
,
then
every
one
who
know
she
have
still
the
same
estimate
of
she
.




she
be
then
without
real
anxious
feeling
,
the
people
who
employ
she
be
patient
with
the
impatient
be
then
in
she
.
Mabel
Linker
take
good
care
of
she
and
stand
all
the
impatient
be
then
in
she
,
the
impatient
be
that
be
stupid
be
then
in
she
,
the
impatient
being
that
be
irritate
then
in
she
to
every
one
near
she
,
the
impatient
being
that
make
she
very
interfering
and
rather
nagging
.
this
be
now
a
history
of
what
now
happen
to
she
and
how
Mabel
take
care
of
she
,
and
of
Mabel
Linker
and
how
they
do
and
do
not
get
along
together
,
and
what
each
one
of
they
feel
about
the
other
.




Mary
Maxworthing
and
Mabel
Linker
be
from
the
same
part
of
the
country
.
they
have
always
know
each
other
.
Mary
be
the
elder
.
Mabel
be
about
five
year
young
.
Mabel
Linker
's
cousin
have
marry
Mary
Maxworthing
's
sister
.
Mary
Maxworthing
have
always
know
Mabel
Linker
and
have
always
be
very
fond
of
she
.
when
Mabel
come
to
Gossols
to
learn
dress
-
make
Mary
almost
idolise
she
.
they
be
then
always
together
,
Mabel
then
always
do
what
Mary
tell
she
.
Mabel
be
then
a
stranger
,
Mary
Maxworthing
have
already
be
in
Gossols
many
year
then
and
she
take
care
of
she
.
they
get
along
very
well
together
.
as
I
be
say
Mabel
learn
cutting
and
fitting
and
soon
become
very
clever
almost
brilliant
in
dress
-
making
,
she
have
not
the
sense
for
fashion
,
she
have
not
the
sense
for
manage
,
she
have
very
little
sense
about
anything
,
she
have
to
have
some
one
to
do
directing
and
Mary
Maxworthing
do
this
for
she
in
the
beginning
completely
to
Mabel
's
satisfaction
.
satisfaction
be
not
the
right
word
for
describe
Mabel
's
feeling
.
in
Mabel
satisfaction
be
the
not
be
arouse
to
escape
or
resist
or
in
fact
to
any
conscious
feeling
.
anyway
they
get
on
then
very
well
in
living
and
dress
-
making
.
Mary
then
have
very
little
impatient
being
,
her
impatient
be
have
then
nothing
nervous
in
it
,
not
that
she
ever
come
to
be
a
nervous
person
,
her
impatient
be
be
not
then
too
interfere
and
then
too
at
that
time
she
have
for
Mabel
almost
an
idolising
feeling
.
she
like
to
write
down
when
she
be
sit
idle
,
"
Mabel
be
an
angel
,
angel
Mabel
,
"
and
this
show
her
feeling
.
she
write
this
down
with
a
pencil
whenever
she
be
sit
do
nothing
,
this
be
in
the
beginning
when
Mabel
be
learn
dress
-
making
,
when
they
be
first
live
together
.
it
be
much
hard
to
know
it
about
Mabel
Linker
what
feel
she
have
in
she
about
any
one
around
she
.
it
be
always
very
hard
to
know
this
about
she
.
perhaps
she
do
not
mostly
have
any
very
strong
feeling
in
she
.
it
be
very
hard
to
know
it
about
she
.
when
she
have
a
lover
it
be
then
certain
that
she
be
crazy
to
have
he
marry
she
,
she
only
live
in
have
he
want
she
.
mostly
with
every
one
else
around
her
one
never
could
tell
what
be
the
feeling
in
she
.
they
get
along
then
very
well
as
I
be
say
when
they
first
begin
live
together
.




Mabel
then
have
become
a
good
dress
-
maker
,
Mary
have
put
together
money
enough
and
they
begin
then
their
work
together
.
at
first
thing
go
pretty
well
and
then
they
have
some
trouble
live
together
and
they
have
not
then
enough
money
to
go
on
wait
for
a
future
.
they
keep
on
however
for
some
time
live
together
.




Mary
Maxworthing
do
not
have
in

really
an

unpleasant
nature
in
she
,
they
come
from
the
little
impatient
be
in
she
and
the
fact
that
she
have
not
a
very
large
bottom
in
she
to

Mabel
Linker
do
and
do
not
get
along
together
.
Mabel
have
a
very
different
nature
.




there
be
many
way
then
that
people
have
affection
in
they
,
there
be
many
way
of
have
feel
about
people
near
one
.
each
one
then
have
their
own
way
of
having
affectionate
feeling
in
they
.
every
one
have
their
own
kind
of
affectionate
being
.
Mary
Maxworthing
have
her
way
of
feeling
about
Mabel
Linker
,
Mabel
have
her
own
way
of
have
love
feeling
.
in
every
one
there
be
their
way
of
have
in
they
affectionate
feeling
.
in
every
one
there
be
change
.
mostly
every
one
have
change
in
they
in
their
feeling
about
any
one
.
mostly
every
one
never
think
about
the
change
the
other
one
may
be
have
in
they
.
this
be
another
matter
though
and
now
this
be
a
history
of
the
affectionate
feeling
and
love
feel
Mary
Maxworthing
and
Mabel
Linker
have
in
they
and
how
each
one
affect
the
other
one
of
they
.
as
I
be
say
in
the
begin
Mary
have
for
Mabel
almost
an
idolising
feeling
,
no
one
know
very
much
about
Mabel
Linker
's
feeling
.




Mary
have
for
Mabel
then
at
first
almost
an
idolising
feeling
.
Mabel
have
a
quality
of
brilliant
dressmaking
,
and
sweetness
in
endure
,
and
no
certain
expression
of
her
feeling
,
and
a
certain
freedom
in
do
that
look
like
courage
in
her
living
but
be
only
that
she
never
see
anything
except
the
thing
that
then
fill
she
,
she
never
have
any
reflection
in
she
,
she
have
a
certain
shrink
fear
sometimes
in
she
but
that
be
only
when
somebody
stop
she
,
she
have
a
certain
flighty
freedom
in
she
,
she
be
almost
a
brilliant
dress
-
maker
.
she
never
have
any
idea
in
she
,
she
have
not
much
sense
of
fashion
in
she
,
she
have
not
such
sense
in
she
but
that
be
not
necessary
for
she
,
Mary
Maxworthing
would
run
she
,
when
she
first
live
with
her
Mary
idolise
she
.
as
I
be
say
the
failure
of
the
undertaking
be
to
Mary
maxworthe
a
loss
of
freedom
,
a
loss
of
future
distinction
.
Mabel
have
very
little
of
this
feeling
,
she
have
not
much
more
freedom
work
with
Mary
Maxworthing
than
in
any
other
kind
of
working
,
not
that
she
do
not
like
it
well
,
she
like
it
well
but
the
failure
do
not
make
all
the
difference
to
she
.
later
it
go
well
because
then
she
have
a
husband
to
urge
she
.
but
this
be
all
history
that
will
be
write
later
.
always
later
although
they
stay
together
it
be
not
as
it
have
be
early
,
it
be
not
then
an
idolising
of
she
by
Mary
and
a
yielding
by
she
because
she
have
no
way
to
resist
she
.
freedom
then
in
Mary
Maxworthing
be
have
her
own
choice
in
living
,
have
some
distinction
.
freedom
for
Mabel
Linker
be
love
one
man
and
marry
he
and
work
only
under
drive
.
she
be
brilliant
then
in
working
but
she
need
urge
,
she
need
always
some
one
else
's
start
.
she
have
sensitive
be
in
she
to
the
point
of
creation
,
she
be
not
of
the
kind
of
woman
that
have
instrument
nature
in
they
,
she
never
do
any
one
else
's
living

when
she
work
her

have
very
little

when
she
seize
a
thing
she
need
in
love
or
live
nothing
could
pull
it
away
from

thing
so
much
that
no

who
be
everything
to
she
,
everything

could
slip
away
as

would
from

this
make
an
ingrate
of
she
,
she
have
no
sense
of
any
one
ever
do
anything
for
she
for
she
have
no
need
in
she
,
they
do
it
she
never
feel
anything
about
it
in
she
,
that
make
trouble
for
she
later
,
that
make
it
later
hard
for
Mary
maxworthe
to
forgive
she
,
this
be
a
history
of
the
trouble
it
make
for
she
.
she
have
independent
dependent

Mary
Maxworthing
have
not

have
at
the
failure
of

have
very
little
anxious

,
mostly
it
be
impatient
feeling
that
fill
she
and
injure
feeling
that
so
much
bad
luck
should
have
come
to
she
.
a
great
deal
of
impatient
feeling
,
considerable
injured
feeling
and
a
little
anxious
feeling
be
what
then
mostly
be
in
she
.
she
have
none
of
the
despairing
sense
she
have
have
in
she
after
her

,
this
would
not
effect
the
future
for
she
,
so
much

bad
for
she
that
it
have
happen

so
much
the
bad
that
it

have
come
so
to
she
,
she
still
love
the
man
,
he
love
she
,
sometime
perhaps
he
would
marry
she
.
as
it
happen
he
do
marry
she
,
he
marry
she
when
she
be
thirty
-
five
,
when
she
be
make
her
new
beginning
with
Mabel
Linker
at
dress
-
making
and
be
succeed
.
he
be
a
decent
enough
man
and
always
want
to
marry
she
,
his
family
want
he
to
marry
another
girl
who
be
rich
,
he
have
be
away
on
business
travel
all
the
time
she
have
the
baby
and
later
,
when
he
come
back
finally
and
could
arrange
it
he
marry
she
.
it
be
a
successful
enough
marriage
for
she
.
living
be
always
successful
enough
for
she
.




but
all
this
be
much
later
now
she
be
come
back
from
the
doctor
with
some
impatient
feeling
,
a
little
anxious
feeling
and
some
injure
feeling
in
she
.
Mabel
Linker
then
do
anything
any
one
could
do
for
she
,
the
people
who
employ
she
be
much
surprised
at
such
a
thing
happen
to
she
,
no
one
who
know
ever
would
have
imagine
such
a
thing
would
happen
to
she
,
but
it
do
not
change
their
feeling
for
she
,
it
do
not
change
anybody
's
estimate
of
she
.
it
have
happen
to
she
.
everybody
be
good
to
she
,
everybody
except
the
doctor
who
have
get
angry
with
she
.
he
be
young
then
,
he
think
she
have
deceit
in
she
,
this
be
not
true
of
she
,
she
be
as
honest
as
most
people
be
.
I
do
n't
mean
that
she
have
any
great
honesty
in
she
.
she
do
not
but
she
have
medium
honesty
in
she
.
in
her
interview
with
the
doctor
there
be
no
deceit
in
she
there
be
only
the
stupidity
of
impatient
be
in
she
.




she
be
as
honest
as
most
people
be
in
living
,
she
be
as
conscientious
as
most
people
be
in
beginning
,
to
herself
she
be
a
little
more
conscientious
than
she
really
be
in
be
,
she
could
have
in
herself
an
injure
being
.
she
could
feel
that
Mabel
should
have
in
she
toward
she
a
grateful
feeling
,
she
could
have
in
herself
an
injured
feeling
,
she
be
to
herself
more
sacrifice
,
more
conscientious
,
a
little
perhaps
,
not
much
more
honest
to
she
in
she
being
than
she
really
be
in
be
or
in
living
,
she
could
have
then
injure
feeling
.
mostly
,
in
she
,
she
have
more
impatient
being
,
more
interfering
,
than
she
have
angry
or
injure
feeling
.
she
could
have
angry
and
injure
feeling
.




mostly
one
have
injure
feeling
when
one
be
to
one
inside
in
one
's
feel
more
noble
than
one
ever
be
in
act
than
one
ever
be
really
in
be
,
one
have
then
inside
one
injure
feeling
.
there
be
many
kind
of
way
of
having
injure
feeling
in
one
.
sometime
there
will
be
a
history
of
all
of
the
kind
of
they
.




sometimes
there
be
much
sweetness
inside
one
to
one
's
feeling
and
all
the
time
nasty
word
be
come
out
from
one
,
in
many
of
such
of
they
there
be
much
sweetness
in
they
in
their
feeling
,
many
of
such
of
they
do
not
know
that
then
mean
or
brutal
thing
be
be
say
by
they
,
so
then
they
have
rightly
in
they
injure
feel
inside
they
when
the
other
respond
to
the
nasty
thing
say
by
they
to
they
.
this
be
a
very
common
way
of
having
injure
feeling
in
one
,
sometime
there
will
be
a
history
of
all
the
kind
of
they
.
Mary
Maxworthing
then
have
impatient
being
,
she
never
know
that
this
really
make
she
interfere
,
to
herself
it
only
make
she
want
to
have
every
one
do
what
they
be
do
.
she
have
in
she
a
reasonably
conscientious
,
honest
being
,
to
herself
she
have
a
little
more
of
they
and
of
self
-
sacrifice
being
than
she
really
have
in
living
.
this
could
come
to
make
in
her
injured
and
sometimes
angry
feeling
.
just
the
kind
she
have
in
she
of
conscientious
and
honest
being
will
come
out
more
and
more
in
the
history
of
she
as
in
her
living
it
come
out
of
she
.




she

who
know

change
then
in
their
feeling
about
she
,
this
have
happen
to

always
have
think
she
.
the
doctor
have
be
angry
with
she
,
but
he
be
young
and
think

it
be
impatient

be
the
stupid
be

.




Mabel
Linker
be
work
for
her
living
,
she
have
commence
again
have
work
to
do
in

and
in
a
small
way
have
commence
again
a
business
of
dress
-
making
though
often
she
have
to
go
out
sewing
.
Mary
Maxworthing
,
when
she
would
have
a
bad
feeling
in
she
,
come
to
Mabel
Linker
to
have
her
take
care
of
she
.




as
I
be
say
too
,
no
one
know
it
about
she
what
kind
of
feel
Mabel
Linker
have
in
she
for
Mary
Maxworthing
.
perhaps
it
will
come
to
be
clear
later
.
anyhow
she
then
take
care
of
she
,
and
it
be
not
an
easy
matter
.
Mary
have
not
even
then
anxious
be
in
she
,
she
do
have
very
much
then
impatient
be
in
she
,
it
be
very
hard
sometimes
for
any
one
to
put
up
with
she
.




every
one
have
in
they
their
own
history
inside
they
.
in
each
one
the
history
come
out
of
they
in
the
repeating
that
be
always
in

Mary
Maxworthing
have
always
in
she
some
impatient
being
,
sometimes
it
have
in
she
more
and
sometimes
less
importance
in
her
being
,
sometimes
it
have
in
she
almost
a
different
meaning
from
other
time
in
her
living
.
mostly
it
be
in
she
her
stupid
being
.
this
come
to
be
very
strongly
in

that
make
trouble
for
she
,
this
be
a
history
of
what
happen
to
she
.




repeat
then
be
always
come
out
of
every

,
from
the
kind
of
be
always
in

.
almost
always
in
the
repeating
in
every

there
be
a
little
change
.

,
sometimes
it
be
,
interfere
with
every
one
around

mostly
it
be
not

,
sometimes

stupid
acting
.
impatient
be
be
almost
always
in

in

this
be
mix
up
in

.
as
I
be
say
she
always

.
it
be
not

be
at
this
time
often
enough
active
in
she
.
she
do
not
have
in
she
so
very
much
impatient
feeling
inside
she
.
at
this
time
with
this
trouble
in
she
,
impatient
be
be
more
than
usually
active
in
she
,
it
come
out
in
stupid
way
of
do
and
not
do
,
she
have
sometimes
,
for
she
,
a
good
deal
of
impatient
feeling
inside
she
.
mostly
in
she
,
impatient
be
be
not
impatient
feeling
in
she
.
this
be
now
a
history
of
what
all
this
do
in
she
.
as
I
be
say
Mabel
Linker
take
care
of
she
.
it
be
not
an
easy
matter
.
Mary
go
to
Mabel
every
time
she
feel
badly
inside
she
.
she
never
would
go
to
a
doctor
.
this
be
the
impatient
be
in
she
,
this
be
the
impatient
be
in
she
that
be
the
stupid
being
in
she
,
this
will
be
clear
later
.
Mabel
Linker
take
care
of
she
and
it
be
not
an
easy
matter
.
she
would
not
go
to
see
a
doctor
.
finally
at
six
month
the
baby
pass
out
of
she
.
she
almost
die
when
this
happen
to
she
.
Mabel
Linker
have
send
then
for
a
doctor
.
it
come
very
nearly
be
too
late
then
to
save
she
.
this
do
not
scare
she
until
it
be
all
over
.
she
do
not
really
know
what
be
happen
to
she
.
she
do
not
like
it
when
she
hear
it
later
,
she
have
no
desire
for
die
in
she
.
all
that
happen
to
she
be
from
the
impatient
be
in
she
.
impatient
be
be
the
stupid
be
in
she
.
every
one
have
in
they
their
own
kind
of
stupid
being
,
every
one
have
in
they
a
stupid
part
in
they
,
this
be
a
history
of
stupid
be
in
Mary
Maxworthing
and
Mabel
Linker
.
this
be
a
history
of
what
happen
to
each
of
they
,
of
every
thing
that
be
in
they
,
of
the
kind
of
stupid
be
in
each
one
of
they
.




as
I
be
say
,
at
the
beginning
of
their
live
together
,
at
the
beginning
of
their
dress
-
make
Mary
have
for
Mabel
almost
an
idolising
feeling
.
no
one
ever
think
about
the
feeling
Mabel
Linker
have
about
Mary
Maxworthing
.
that
be
not
important
to
any
one
.
later
every
one
who
know
they
come
to
think
about
it
but
this
be
in
their
later
living
;
in
the
beginning
of
their
live
together
,
in
the
beginning
of
their
dress
-
make
undertaking
,
the
feeling
Mabel
Linker
have
about
Mary
Maxworthing
be
not
important
to
any
one
,
no
one
know
whether
she
have
little
or
much
feeling
,
this
be
not
important
then
to
any
one
,
not
even
to
Mary
Maxworthing
.
this
be
because
of
the
nature
Mabel
Linker
have
in
she
.
feel
in
Mabel
Linker
for
any
one
be
something
no
one
ever
stop
to
consider
,
it
be
enough
that
Mary
Maxworthing
like
live
with
she
,
it
be
enough
for
any
one
who
know
she
to
know
that
when
Mary
need
her
Mabel
take
good
care
of
she
.
later
,
feel
in
Mabel
become
more
important
to
those
that
know
she
.
later
there
be
a
question
in
the
mind
of
every
one
who
know
she
what
kind
of
feeling
she
have
in
she
.
later
every
one
come
to
feel
about
she
that
mostly
she
have
not
any
feeling
in
she
.
Mary
Maxworthing
later
feel
this
in
she
.
later
every
one
who
know
she
accept
this
in
she
.
some
be
never
very
certain
about
she
.
she
be
different
then
from
Mary
Maxworthing
,
she
be
a
very
different
nature
.
every
one
have
the
same
notion
of
Mary
whether
they
like
or
whether
they
do
not
like
she
,
she
could
surprise
they
by
something
happen
to
she
but
every
one
have
and
always
keep
about
the
same
estimate
of
she
.
this
be
now
more
history
of
she
.
there
be
million
always
be
make
of
every
kind
of
man
and
woman
.
some
kind
of
they
have
it
in
they
to
have
a
being
that
make
every
one
who
know
one
of
such
of
they
think
that
one
a
singular
one

More
and
more
in
live
one
find
this
to
be
true
of
people
around
they
.
this
be
now
a
history
of
every
kind
of
they
of
every
kind
of
man
and
every
kind
of
woman
who
ever
be
or

or
will
be
live
,
of
every
kind
of
beginning
of
they
as
they
be
baby
and
child
,
and
now
this
be
a
history
of
these
two
of
they
,
Mabel
Linker
and
Mary
Maxworthing
.




there
be
always
then
repeat
,
always
everything

,
this
be
then
a

from
the
beginning
,
and
in
every
nation
,
be
always
the
same
and
this
be
now
a
history
of
some
of
they
.
there
be
always
then
the
same
kind
of
they
and
million
of
they
,
million
of

all
of
they
have
in
they
their
individual
exist
,
their
own
history
in
they
,
their
own
living
in
they
,
and
this
be
now
a
writing
of
the
history
as
it
come
out
of
some
of
they
.
there
be
then
always
repeat
,
there
be
then
always
individual
exist
.
there
be
then
always
repeat
,
there
be
then
always
repeat
in
each
one
,
in
each
kind
of
they
,
in
pair
of
they
,
in
pair
of
woman
,
in
pair
of
man
,
in
pair
of
man
and
woman
.
always
more
and
more
in
live
it
come
out
how
kind
of
they
in
pairing
be
always
repeat
,
this
be
true
in
loving
,
in
friendly
being
between
man
and
woman
.
sometimes
in
live
one
see
so
many
repeat
,
so
many
who
seem
when
one
know
they
to
be
so
individual
there
can
never
be
any
one
anything
like
they
,
a
pair
of
they
with
so
individual
a
relation
make
up
of
two
who
be
so
singular
in
their
being
that
it
never
seem
that
there
can
be
other
just
like
they
.
always
then
one
see
another
pair
of
they
and
sometimes
it
be
almost
dizzying
,
it
give
to
each
one
of
the
pair
of
they
an
unreal
being
,
and
then
it
come
again
that
one
understand
then
that
repeat
be
the
whole
of
living
.
repeat
be
the
whole
of
living
and
by
repeat
come
understanding
,
and
understanding
be
to
some
the
most
important
part
of
living
.
repeat
be
the
whole
of
living
,
and
it
make
of
live
a
thing
always
more
familiar
to
each
one
and
so
we
have
old
man
's
and
woman
's
wisdom
,
and
repeat
,
simple
repeating
be
the
whole
of
they
.




as
I
be
say
pair
of
friend
and
pair
in
love
be
always
a
repeating
of
the
come
together
of
the
kind
of
they
and
this
be
not
just
general
repeating
but
very
detailed
repeating
,
wonderfully
alike
the
pair
be
then
in
character
and
look
and
love
and
live
.




as
I
be
say
Mary
Maxworthing
and
Mabel
Linker
be
not
altogether
successful
friend
in
their
living
.
later
they
both
be
married
and
then
thing
go
a
little
well
for
they
,
also
they
be
succeed
then
in
their
business
of
dress
-
making
.
this
be
when
Mrs.
Hersland
know
they
,
when
they
be
again
live
and
dress
-
making
in
that
part
of
Gossols
where
rich
people
be
live
.
as
I
be
say
Mary
Maxworthing
when
she
be
have
the
baby
take
,
do
not
know
how
near
she
be
to
die
.
all
of
it
come
from
the
impatient
being
which
be
her
kind
of
stupid
being
.
she
do
not
know
when
the
baby
be
pass
how
near
she
be
to
die
,
afterwards
she
have
about
it
almost
an
anxious
feeling
.




as
I
be
say
it
be
hard
on
Mabel
Linker
then
to
take
care
of
she
.
not
when
the
baby
be
pass
out
of
she
for
then
she
have
a
doctor
and
be
in
a
hospital
with
a
nurse
take
care
of
she
,
but
before
,
when
she
would
not
see
a
doctor
.
she
would
not
let
a
doctor
see
she
,
this
be
impatient
be
in
she
,
she
would
not
listen
to
Mabel
Linker
or
to
any
one
else
who
try
to
advise
she
,
she
be
full
up
with
impatient
feeling
.
yes
,
of
course
sometimes
she
be
bleed
,
but
she
do
not
want
to
pay
any
attention
;
she
be
full
up
then
with
impatient
feeling
.
later
after
it
be
over
and
she
know
how
near
she
have
be
to
die
she
have
for
a
little
while
less
impatient
feeling
,
she
have
then
in
she
,
some
anxious
feeling
.
this
be
the
end
of
that
thing
for
she
.
she
stay
then
a
year
or
two
long
with
the
same
employer
.
during
this
time
Mary
Maxworthing
and
Mabel
Linker
see
very
little
of
each
other
.
they
have
have
serious
trouble
with
each
other
.




as
I
be
say
when
Mary
Maxworthing
first
have
Mabel
Linker
live
with
she
she
have
for
she
almost
an
idolising
feeling
.
as
I
be
say
man
and
woman
,
woman
and
woman
,
man
and
man
do
so
much
repeat
,
it
be
almost
startling
as
more
and
more
one
come
to
know
it
of
they
.
the
repeat
be
not
only
of
the
general
kind
of
combine
as
to
their
be
man
and
woman
,
as
to
their
be
big
and
little
,
alike
or
contrast
,
independent
dependent
and
dependent
independent
,
it
be
likeness
of
the
type
of
character
combine
with
another
and
these
two
be
very
individual
in
their
being
and
their
relation
and
sometimes
they
have
in
they
a
kind
of
be
that
make
every
one
who
know
they
think
there
can
never
have
be
any
one
like
one
or
the
other
of
they
,
surely
never
any
two
like
the
pair
of
they
and
then
one
go
on
in
one
's
living
and
then
there
be
repeat
of
the
pair
and
then
another
repeating
of
they
and
then
another
repeating
of
they
and
always
one
have
about
each
pair
of
they
the
strong
feeling
of
their
have
each
one
of
they
strongly
individual
being
and
sometimes
it
make
of
everything
a
strange
world
for
live
and
sometimes
it
make
to
one
's
feel
the
world
a
pleasant
and
familiar
place
for
living
.
strangeness
have
no
place
then
in
living
,
to
one
's
feeling
,
it
be
a
familiar
thing
,
living
,
and
to
some
,
such
a
feeling
be
the
pleasantest
kind
of
feeling
they
can
have
in
their
living
.




Mary
Maxworthing
then
be
very
clear
now
in
her
being
.
she
be
very
clear
now
to
every
one
.
there
be
many
million
always
live
with
her
kind
of
be
.
there
be
in
every
country
in
every
kind
of
living
,
they
exist
with
every
kind
of
training
.
sometime
there
will
be
a
history
of
five
of
they
,
sometime
there
will
be
a
history
of
all
of
they
.
now
this
be
a
history
of
one
of
they
.
Mary
Maxworthing
be
what
every
one
who
know
she
,
whether
they
like
she
or
do
not
like
she
,
think
she
.
she
have
not
any
recklessness
or
wildness
in
she
.
she
have
very
little
weakness
in
she
.
she
have
independent
dependent
nature
in
she
but
she
have
very
little
fighting
in
she
,
what
seem
like
fighting
be
mostly
impatient
be
in
she
,
she
have
very
little
attack
in
she
.
she
have
a
certain
gayety
in
she
,
she
have
not
good
nature
really
in
she
,
she
have
no
heartlessness
in
she
,
she
have
enough
sensitive
be
to
make
a
pleasant
sympathetic
sweetness
in
she
,
that
with
the
little
gayety
in
she
give
to
she
the
charm
she
have
in
she
.
the
very
little
attack
,
the
gayety
in
she
,
the
impatient
be
in
she
,
the
certain
practical
feeling
for
fashion
and
for
be
a
success
,
that
be
in
she
,
give
to
her
her
desire
for
freedom
and
a
little
distinction
in
the
future
.
she
have
no
sordidness
in
she
,
she
have
not
much
memory
in
she
.
More
and
more
she
will
be
clear
,
in
the
history
of
her
relation
to
Mabel
Linker
,
in
her
relation
to
the
man
who
later
marry
she
,
in
the
way
she
come
to
the
undertaking
again
of
the
business
of
dress
-
making
.




as
I
be
say
,
during
the
trouble
she
have
in
her
Mabel
Linker
take
care
of
she
.
later
they
have
serious
trouble
with
each
other
.
finally
later
when
Mabel
have
a
husband
to
urge
she
and
Mary
Maxworthing
have
a
little
money
leave
to
she
they
begin
again
to
be
together
,
they
more
or
less
stuck
together
though
they
never
really
get
along
together
.
they
have
a
reasonable
success
together
.
this
be
now
a
history
of
Mabel
Linker
and
the
nature
in
she
.




Mabel
Linker
have
a
different
nature
.
she
have
her
own
be
in
she
.
every
one
have
their
own
being
in
they
.
every
one
have
their
own
repeat
in
they
.
every
one
be
of
a
kind
of
man
and
woman
.
every
kind
of
man
and
woman
be
a
kind
of
a
kind
of
they
.
all
the
kind
of
they
be
kind
of
the
two
kind
of
they
.
sometime
there
will
be
a
history
of
all
of
they
.




there
be
then
the
two
kind
of
they
,
independent
dependent
and
dependent
independent
.
Mary
Maxworthing
be
of
the
independent
dependent
,
Mabel
Linker
be
of
the
same
kind
of
they
but
as
one
might
say
of
extreme
one
end
of
that
kind
of
they
,
while
Mary
Maxworthing
be
of
toward
the
other
end
of
they
.
this
difference
make
an
attraction
between
they
,
their
being
of
the
same
kind
of
they
make
it
that
in
the
end
they
do
not
succeed
in
continue
friendly
living
.
it
be
very
interesting
to
know
the
range
in
one
kind
of
man
and
woman
.
this
be
now
a
little
about
one
kind
of
they
with
Mary
Maxworthing
and
Mabel
Linker
both
of
they
of
that
one
kind
of
they
but
at
the
two
end
of
that
kind
of
they
.




man
have
in
they
and
woman
have
in
they
,
some
of
they
,
independent
dependent
nature
in
they
.
many
million
of
man
and
many
million
of
woman
be
always
be
make
of
this
kind
,
always
about
half
of
everybody
live
be
of
this
kind
of
man
and
woman
.
this
be
now
a
description
of
one
part
of
they
which
make
one
kind
of
this
kind
of
man
and
woman
.
this
be
a
description
of
that
part
of
they
,
that
kind
of
they
as
woman
;
later
there
will
be
a
description
of
they
as
man
.
always
it
be
easy
to
know
it
in
they
,
the
detail
of
a
kind
of
they
,
in
woman
,
later
this
will
be
clear
in
they
.
now
this
be
a
history
of
the
kind
of
they
who
have
of
they
Mabel
Linker
and
Mary
Maxworthing
.
as
I
be
say
the
two
of
they
have
difficulty
,
later
in
their
living
,
have
difficulty
in
remain
friend
,
in
begin
again
with
dress
-
making
.
as
I
be
say
they
have
both
in
they
the
same
kind
of
be
,
that
be
to
say
one
be
one
extreme
kind
of
such
being
,
the
other
be
almost
the
other
extreme
kind
of
such
being
and
now
there
be
a
description
of
they
in
the
kind
of
be
there
be
in
they
,
later
there
be
a
history
of
their
living
as
it
come
out
of
they
,
always
there
be
a
description
of
their
character
as
in
repeat
it
come
out
of
each
one
of
they
.
so
then
.




there
be
as
I
be
say
the
two
kind
of
be
in
woman
and
in
man
,
independent
dependent
,
dependent
independent
.
the
first
of
these
have
attack
as
their
natural
way
of
fighting
,
resist
in
such
of
they
be
sometimes
impatient
or
dull
or
scared
or
stubborn
or
pig
-
head
stupid
or
vacant
being
,
be
sometimes
a
continuing
of
attack
;
resist
to
the
dependent
independent
be
the
natural
way
of
fighting
.
those
then
who
have
in
they
independent
dependent
being
as
the
bottom
of
they
have
attack
in
they
as
their
natural
way
of
fighting
.
many
of
they
have
very
little
fighting
in
their
living
.
this
be
true
of
both
of
these
two
who
have
independent
dependent
nature
in
they
,
Mabel
Linker
and
Mary
Maxworthing
.




those
who
have
independent
dependent
nature
in
they
may
have
practical
and
sordid
nature
in
they
but
mostly
they
have
not
much
earthy
simple
natural
sense
in
they
.
this
will
be
clear
as
more
of
they
come
to
be
see
in
the
history
there
will
be
of
such
of
they
.
as
I
be
say
Mabel
Linker
and
Mary
Maxworthing
have
both
of
they
independent
dependent
nature
in
they
.




Mabel
Linker
have
not
an
instrument
nature
in
she
,
the
sensitiveness
in
she
make
a
kind
of
real
creation
in
she
,
make
she
live
her
own
living
,
do
her
own
loving
.
to
many
there
may
be
a
confusion
between
the
sensitive
instrument
nature
that
live
so
strongly
the
life
of
other
that
they
seem
to
be
their
own
creation
and
one
like
Mabel
Linker
.
to
any
one
that
know
they
well
,
soon
or
later
this
come
to
be
clear
.




as
I
be
say
then
the
instrument
nature
be
one
have
sensitive
being
or
power
of
idealising
or
power
for
seize
without
know
it
other
people
's
suggestion
.
if
the
seizing
be
their
own
volition
that
make
another
being
,
that
be
not
live
other
people
's
life
in
live
.
so
then
there
be
a
kind
of
man
and
woman
who
have
in
they
independent
dependent
nature
in
they
and
this
be
now
to
be
a
description
of
many
variation
in
they
and
Mary
Maxworthing
and
Mabel
Linker
,
both
of
they
,
be
of
this
part
of
the
general
independent
dependent
kind
of
man
and
woman
.




soon
or
later
there
will
be
history
of
many
man
and
woman
with
independent
dependent
nature
in
they
.
as
I
be
say
there
be
to
be
Martha
Hersland
and
Julia
Dehning
,
there
be
to
be
a
sister
of
one
governess
,
and
one
governess
with
such
a
nature
.
now
there
be
Mary
Maxworthing
and
Mabel
Linker
.




perhaps
,
always
it
will
become
clear
,
the
independent
dependent
nature
and
later
every
one
will
see
it
in
each
one
who
have
in
they
some
form
of
such
nature
.
later
dependent
independent
nature
will
be
clear
and
every
one
who
see
any
one
will
know
it
soon
or
later
in
that
one
their
kind
of
nature
and
the
kind
of
the
kind
of
nature
they
have
in
they
and
that
in
repeat
come
out
of
they
.
now
then
to
begin
again
with
independent
dependent
being
,
now
to
begin
with
Mabel
Linker
and
Mary
Maxworthing
.




to
begin
again
then
with
the
instrument
nature
,
with
attack
being
,
with
sensitive
being
,
with
weakness
or
vacant
being
,
with
little
,
with
much
bottom
being
,
with
little
or
much
attack
in
living
,
with
unified
or
with
separated
nature
inside
each
one
,
as
in
live
it
come
out
of
each
one
.
there
be
then
many
man
and
many
woman
,
more
or
less
half
of
all
that
ever
be
or
be
or
will
be
live
,
who
have
independent
dependent
nature
in
they
.
I
will
tell
about
it
now
in
woman
because
it
come
easy
to
tell
about
it
in
they
;
more
and
more
,
then
,
I
will
tell
about
it
in
man
.
it
be
the
same
in
man
as
in
woman
but
it
separate
a
little
clear
in
woman
and
so
it
will
make
a
kind
of
diagram
for
a
beginning
.
as
I
be
say
I
like
to
tell
in
the
beginning
,
I
like
well
to
tell
it
about
woman
the
nature
in
they
because
it
be
clear
and
I
know
it
well
,
a
little
not
very
much
well
.
one
can
see
it
in
she
soon
,
a
little
,
not
very
much
soon
,
but
on
the
whole
it
be
clear
,
thing
be
more
separate
generally
in
she
,
perhaps
it
be
a
little
clear
in
she
,
perhaps
I
know
it
a
little
well
in
she
.
as
I
be
say
then
,
every
one
have
in
they
their
own
way
of
be
and
this
come
out
of
they
in
the
repeating
that
be
always
in
every
one
,
in
some
it
do
not
come
to
be
very
clear
in
they
until
their
middle
living
,
in
some
not
until
their
later
living
,
but
sometime
in
every
one
the
nature
in
they
come
to
be
clear
to
any
one
who
look
well
at
they
,
sometimes
in
their
young
living
,
sometimes
in
their
middle
living
,
sometimes
in
their
later
living
.
as
I
be
say
every
one
have
in
they
their
own
way
of
eat
,
their
own
way
of
drinking
,
their
own
way
of
sleep
,
their
own
way
of
rest
,
of
loving
,
of
talk
,
or
keep
still
,
of
waking
,
their
own
way
of
work
,
of
have
stupid
be
in
they
and
come
out
of
they
,
their
own
way
of
have
nasty
feeling
in
they
and
come
out
of
they
,
in
short
then
,
every
one
have
in
they
their
own
being
and
in
repeat
it
be
all
through
their
living
always
come
out
of
they
.




as
I
be
say
more
or
less
half
of
all
who
ever
be
or
be
or
will
be
live
have
independent
dependent
nature
in
they
,
that
be
to
say
attack
be
their
natural
way
of
fight
,
resist
be
stubbornness
and
in
many
of
they
the
stupid
be
in
they
,
many
of
they
have
as
a
bottom
to
they
sensitive
or
weak
or
stupid
being
,
some
have
attack
that
be
fight
as
almost
the
whole
of
they
.
as
I
be
say
this
be
all
clear
in
the
woman
,
as
they
have
less
in
they
a
unification
of
these
thing
in
they
,
they
have
simple
reaction
in
they
.
everybody
know
this
now
in
woman
and
now
this
be
a
history
of
all
of
they
.




as
I
be
say
then
there
be
a
kind
of
man
and
woman
who
have
in
they
independent
dependent
being
and
some
of
these
have
instrument
nature
,
other
be
of
the
kind
of
Mary
Maxworthing
,
other
of
the
kind
of
Mabel
Linker
.
there
be
many
kind
of
they
who
have
independent
dependent
nature
in
they
and
there
be
many
kind
connect
with
these
kind
of
they
and
their
history
will
come
later
;
Martha
Hersland
and
Julia
Dehning
and
Mr.
Hersland
and
many
other
who
come
to
know
the
Hersland
child
in
some
part
of
their
living
be
connect
then
be
of
such
a
kind
of
nature
.
it
be
clear
then
,
independent
dependent
being
be
be
when
the
natural
way
of
fighting
be
attack
,
dependent
independent
being
be
when
the
natural
way
of
fighting
be
resist
.
there
be
some
who
have
independent
dependent
nature
in
they
and
have
no
attacking
,
no
fighting
be
in
they
,
Mabel
Linker
be
such
a
one
;
there
be
some
who
have
in
they
very
little
fighting
in
their
living
but
all
fight
in
they
be
attack
and
this
be
true
of
Mary
Maxworthing
.




there
be
then
some
who
have
in
they
sensitive
be
to
the
point
of
create
even
to
the
point
of
fighting
,
there
be
some
who
have
this
in
they
;
there
be
some
who
have
in
they
sensitive
being
and
this
make
they
live
other
people
's
life
in
living
,
these
may
have
fight
from
attack
be
in
they
,
these
may
have
fight
in
they
from
the
sensitive
being
in
they
that
make
they
live
other
people
's
life
all
through
their
living
.
later
there
will
be
write
the
history
of
such
a
one
.
these
have
instrument
nature
in
they
,
they
need
other
people
's
life
for
life
enhance
.
later
there
will
be
more
history
of
such
of
they
.
there
be
some
who
have
instrument
nature
in
they
without
the
sensitive
bottom
to
they
,
with
stupid
or
vacant
or
weak
or
vague
bottom
to
they
and
an
idealising
sense
in
they
and
a
stupid
stubborn
way
of
resist
to
everything
except
the
one
thing
they
have
make
their
living
and
this
be
always
in
such
of
they
some
one
else
's
thinking
,
feeling
or
be
.
there
be
many
million
always
of
such
of
they
,
sometime
perhaps
in
Julia
this
will
be
interesting
.
so
then
there
be
many
way
of
have
instrument
nature
in
one
.
the
dependent
independent
have
it
also
in
they
,
some
of
they
,
but
with
they
,
such
of
they
as
have
it
in
they
,
it
show
in
different
fashion
from
the
independent
dependent
kind
of
they
,
such
one
have
earthy
being
,
they
have
fear
in
they
,
that
make
their
way
of
be
in
they
;
later
in
the
living
of
Mrs.
Hersland
and
Madeleine
Wyman
and
Alfred
Hersland
and
young
David
Hersland
dependent
independent
being
will
come
to
be
clear
.
now
then
there
be
only
independent
dependent
being
we
be
consider
.
later
there
will
be
more
write
of
instrument
being
of
this
kind
of
they
.
neither
Mary
Maxworthing
nor
Mabel
Linker
have
this
nature
in
they
.
so
then
to
go
on
with
they
.




as
I
be
say
Mary
Maxworthing
have
gayety
in
living
.
she
have
very
little
fighting
in
her
living
but
fight
in
she
be
as
attack
.
she
have
very
little
fear
in
she
.
she
have
very
little
bottom
to
she
,
she
have
a
little
sensitive
bottom
to
she
enough
to
give
a
pleasant
sweetness
to
she
.
she
have
a
little
weakness
in
she
enough
to
make
she
a
little
yield
to
attack
.
she
have
very
little
stupid
bottom
in
she
,
most
of
the
stupid
being
in
she
be
of
the
impatient
be
always
in
she
.
this
be
the
disagreeable
part
in
she
,
the
little
attack
in
she
be
not
enough
in
she
to
be
an
unpleasant
being
in
she
,
injure
and
angry
feeling
in
she
be
part
of
such
attacking
living
as
she
have
in
she
but
these
be
not
much
in
she
.
they
be
sometimes
in
she
;
they
be
in
she
when
she
have
the
baby
,
that
such
bad
luck
should
come
to
she
.
they
be
in
she
about
Mabel
Linker
,
when
to
her
think
Mabel
be
ungrateful
toward
she
.
this
be
now
a
history
of
Mabel
Linker
,
and
of
she
and
Mary
Maxworthing
live
together
and
their
have
trouble
with
one
another
and
of
Mabel
's
loving
and
then
their
begin
again
dress
-
making
together
.




Mabel
Linker
have
a
very
different
nature
from
the
other
.
she
have
no
impatient
be
in
she
,
she
have
sensitive
be
in
she
to
the
point
of
creation
.
she
have
in
her
independent
dependent
nature
.
she
have
no
attacking
in
she
.
this
be
now
a
history
of
she
.




every
one
have
in
they
always
their
own
repeating
,
always
more
and
more
then
repeat

feeling
about
they
,
a
more
secure
feeling
in
living
.
repeat
be
more
and
more
in
every

the
whole
of
that

of
every

be
always
more
and
more
complete
in
each
one
as
the
repeating
in

then
there
be
excitement
for
every

in
the
certainty
of
repeat
in
every

.
always
the

repeat
in

whole
of

be
a

feeling
in
rest
in
this
realisation
sometime
one
can
have
of
every
one
.
repeat
then
be
always
in
every
one
,
sometime
then
there
will
be
a
description
of
all
repeat
and
then
there
will
be
contentment
in
contemplation
.
anyhow
repeat
be
always
in
every
one
.
anyhow
repeat
be
always
in
the
pairing
of
two
of
they
.
this
be
now
a
history
of
two
of
they
.
as
I
be
say
Mary
Maxworthing
and
Mabel
Linker
both
of
they
be
of
the
kind
of
they
have
in
they
independent
dependent
being
.
mostly
for
successful
living
two
live
together
,
man
and
woman
or
two
woman
or
two
man
,
there
should
be
in
they
the
two
kind
of
they
,
one
independent
dependent
the
other
dependent
independent
,
one
with
attack
as
the
natural
way
of
fighting
,
the
other
resist
as
the
way
of
be
;
but
in
love
and
in
friendly
living
this
be
mix
up
in
different
way
to
make
a
pair
of
friend
for
reasonably
successful
living
.
for
love
to
marry
to
successful
married
living
,
there
be
always
this
combination
,
the
independent
dependent
in
one
and
in
the
other
the
dependent
independent
being
.
for
love
then
there
be
almost
always
this
combination
,
in
long
successful
friendly
living
there
may
be
another
mixing
,
a
pairing
of
the
same
kind
of
they
.
this
will
now
be
a
description
of
some
way
this
be
true
in
man
and
woman
,
with
every
kind
of
nature
in
they
.




Mary
Maxworthing
and
Mabel
Linker
have
then
both
of
they
independent
dependent
nature
in
they
.
slowly
it
come
out
in
they
.
slowly
they
have
trouble
with
each
other
.
later
they
begin
again
together
but
that
be
then
a
business
matter
.
Mabel
have
then
her
husband
to
urge
she
.
Mabel
's
marrying
make
at
first
great
trouble
between
she
and
Mary
Maxworthing
.




as
I
be
say
,
until
Mabel
Linker
be
full
up
with
love
for
the
man
who
later
marry
she
no
one
ever
have
know
what
feeling
she
have
in
she
about
any
one
near
she
,
about
anything
that
happen
to
she
.
perhaps
nothing
be
important
to
she
until
love
fill
she
.
anyway
no
one
ever
know
what
she
have
as
feel
in
she
.
she
have
as
I
be
say
almost
brilliant
quality
as
a
dress
-
maker
.
she
have
not
much
sense
of
fashion
in
she
.
she
need
some
one
to
urge
she
and
start
she
.
when
a
thing
be
suggest
to
she
and
she
be
push
to
begin
she
be
almost
a
brilliant
dress
-
maker
.
as
I
be
say
no
one
know
very
much
what
feel
she
have
in
she
.
People
who
know
she
have
very
different
opinion
of
she
.
when
Mary
Maxworthing
first
know
she
,
first
have
her
live
with
she
,
she
almost
idolise
she
.
this
feeling
last
in
Mary
through
the
beginning
of
their
undertaking
of
dress
-
making
.
it
die
down
in
she
when
she
have
her
trouble
in
she
,
her
impatient
feeling
when
they
be
not
succeed
,
her
despairing
feeling
at
the
failure
of
her
undertaking
,
her
impatient
troubled
nervous
feeling
when
she
have
her
baby
in
she
,
her
anxious
feeling
when
she
know
what
have
almost
happen
to
she
that
her
baby
be
dead
and
that
she
have
almost
die
with
she
.
and
then
Mabel
Linker
have
her
lover
,
Mary
find
ingratitude
then
in
she
,
thing
get
so
that
they
could
no
long
live
together
.
then
Mabel
got
marry
and
much
later
when
Mary
have
a
little
money
leave
to
she
from
some
relative
down
in
the
country
and
Mabel
have
her
husband
to
urge
she
,
they
begin
with
their
undertaking
in
that
part
of
Gossols
where
rich
people
be
live
.
now
they
be
more
successful
and
thing
be
different
between
they
.
Mary
have
now
mostly
the
business
manage
and
the
excuse
and
the
matching
and
the
buying
to
do
for
the
two
of
they
and
Mabel
do
the
dress
-
making
and
she
have
in
she
with
her
husband
's
urge
enough
decision
so
Mary
be
stop
from
do
too
much
interfere
.
they
always
do
a
fair
amount
of
quarrelling
but
on
the
whole
this
time
they
succeed
fairly
well
with
their
undertaking
.
then
Mary
marry
the
man
as
I
be
say
,
he
have
always
want
she
to
marry
he
and
now
his
family
would
let
he
.
his
mother
have
not
any
long
any
objection
.
Mary
Maxworthing
be
succeed
well
enough
with
dress
-
making
,
besides
she
see
that
he
would
do
it
and
it
be
not
any
long
any
use
object
and
resist
.
this
be
about
the
time
when
Mrs.
Hersland
have
they
to
make
for
she
all
her
good
dress
,
all
those
she
use
for
visit
.




as
I
be
say
Mary
Maxworthing
when
she
have
her
baby
in
she
have
not
then
in
she
any
despairing
feeling
but
she
have
in
she
a
troubled
impatient
nervous
being
.
as
I
be
say
,
in
their
first
live
together
she
have
for
Mabel
Linker
almost
an
idolising
feeling
.
she
would
write
when
she
sit
idle
,
"
angel
Mabel
,
Mabel
be
an
angel
,
"
and
this
show
her
feeling
.
she
never
think
anything
about
Mabel
's
feeling
.
Mabel
be
everything
she
want
and
that
be
enough
for
her
feeling
,
besides
it
be
almost
impossible
to
know
what
Mabel
have
inside
she
.
as
I
be
say
Mary
Maxworthing
have
gayety
but
never
any
wildness
or
recklessness
in
living
.
she
have
gayety
in
living
,
she
have
in
she
very
little
anxious
being
,
she
have
in
she
always
impatient
be
,
she
have
some
sensitive
bottom
enough
to
give
with
her
gayety
some
attractive
sweetness
to
she
.
her
gayety
and
her
impatient
being
and
what
there
be
in
she
of
attraction
give
she
some
quality
of
domination
,
not
so
much
as
there
be
in
her
impatient
being
and
interfere
.
she
be
then
a
pleasant
enough
person
all
through
her
living
,
she
be
a
pleasant
enough
person
with
some
quality
of
attraction
.
she
be
reasonably
honest
and
conscientious
in
her
living
.
in
the
beginning
then
she
have
for
Mabel
Linker
an
idolising
feeling
.
when
she
be
sit
idle
she
would
often
be
write
,
"
Mabel
be
an
angel
,
angel
Mabel
.
"
she
have
for
she
this
feeling
,
all
through
the
beginning
of
their
first
undertaking
.
then
they
have
trouble
live
together
,
Mary
be
very
interfering
,
she
have
a
sense
for
fashion
and
she
have
give
all
the
money
they
have
for
their
beginning
and
Mabel
never
have
in
she
any
impatient
being
and
she
could
endure
a
good
deal
of
direct
,
but
when
they
be
not
succeed
they
begin
to
have
trouble
between
they
.
not
that
Mabel
say
much
or
do
much
to
show
any
change
in
feeling
but
Mary
feel
that
Mabel
have
not
enough
grateful
feeling
.
Mabel
never
do
have
grateful
feeling
,
after
all
she
do
the
dress
-
making
,
after
all
she
never
think
much
about
Mary
and
her
feeling
,
after
all
she
be
always
willing
,
after
all
she
never
really
hear
very
much
of
what
Mary
be
always
say
.




Mary
Maxworthing
have
a
certain
gayety
in
living
,
she
have
ambition
,
she
have
impatient
feeling
.
she
have
a
certain
power
of
domination
,
but
not
as
much
as
she
have
impatient
feeling
which
make
she
interfere
and
in
a
certain
degree
nag
.
she
have
just
enough
domination
to
keep
she
from
be
too
irritating
.




Mary
Maxworthing
never
have
in
she
any
grateful
feeling
to
Mabel
Linker
for
take
care
of
she
,
for
do
all
any
one
could
do
for
she
,
while
she
be
have
her
trouble
with
a
baby
.
Mary
be
not
like
Mabel
,
she
know
people
should
be
grateful
,
she
could
have
injure
feeling
in
she
.
it
be
a
little
queer
that
she
never
feel
that
Mabel
Linker
have
be
good
to
she
,
that
she
should
have
any
grateful
feeling
toward
she
;
perhaps
it
be
because
then
she
have
so
much
impatient
be
in
she
and
impatient
be
be
the
stupid
being
of
she
,
perhaps
it
be
because
Mabel
Linker
have
never
any
feeling
in
she
of
do
anything
for
she
.
Mary
tell
she
to
do
something
and
Mabel
do
it
for
she
,
there
be
no
anxious
feeling
in
Mabel
Linker
ever
;
there
be
never
any
tenderness
in
she
,
Mary
Maxworthing
then
have
never
any
grateful
feeling
to
she
in
she
.




the
idolising
feeling
in
Mary
maxworthe
for
Mabel
Linker
do
not
change
into
something
else
in
she
.
it
just
die
out
of
she
.
later
when
Mabel
have
go
away
from
she
and
be
marry
Mary
want
to
begin
again
with
she
but
always
again
,
when
she
got
use
to
she
,
she
have
no
strong
feeling
about
she
,
she
never
have
for
she
at
any
time
,
later
,
an
idolising
feeling
,
but
she
always
want
she
more
than
Mabel
want
she
.
but
Mabel
really
only
need
the
man
who
marry
she
,
Mabel
never
want
anything
else
to
come
to
she
.
later
with
her
husband
to
urge
she
she
get
to
have
more
feeling
for
a
future
,
she
want
then
for
he
and
for
herself
too
then
success
in
dress
-
making
.
she
and
Mary
come
together
then
.
Mary
have
some
money
then
and
they
begin
again
in
that
part
of
Gossols
where
rich
people
be
live
.




Mary
Maxworthing
have
then
,
when
she
have
the
baby
in
her
,
nervous
impatient
being
,
she
have
no
feeling
in
she
about
Mabel
Linker
or
any
other
person
near
she
,
the
idolising
feeling
she
have
have
for
Mabel
die
out
of
she
when
freedom
and
distinction
do
not
come
to
she
,
not
that
she
have
like
Mabel
because
Mabel
could
possibly
help
she
to
a
future
,
not
at
all
,
but
when
Mabel
be
always
with
she
,
when
Mary
be
not
stir
up
with
plan
for
the
future
,
when
gayety
be
a
little
dead
in
she
,
when
impatient
feeling
be
in
she
,
she
have
not
any
stimulation
to
have
idolise
feeling
for
Mabel
Linker
.
Mary
Maxworthing
then
have
for
Mabel
,
as
for
every
one
around
she
then
,
no
feeling
,
she
be
full
up
with
impatient
being
.
later
then
,
when
the
baby
be
still
-
bear
and
Mary
know
she
have
be
very
near
to
die
,
she
have
in
she
then
anxious
impatient
,
a
little
of
nervous
being
,
Mabel
then
have
for
she
very
little
meaning
,
then
later
when
Mary
begin
to
be
herself
again
inside
her
Mabel
have
begin
love
and
Mary
be
disapprove
.
so
there
be
never
again
a
beginning
in
Mary
of
idolising
feeling
.
Mary
Maxworthing
and
Mabel
Linker
be
not
altogether
successful
friend
in
their
living
.
later
they
both
be
married
and
then
thing
go
a
little
well
between
they
.
Mabel
Linker
have
a
husband
then
to
make
she
important
and
to
urge
she
inside
she
.
Mary
Maxworthing
do
not
have
a
husband
until
some
time
after
Mabel
have
one
,
until
after
she
have
begin
again
with
Mabel
the
undertaking
of
dress
-
making
.




every
one
have
then
in
they
their
own
way
of
have
injure
feeling
,
Mabel
Linker
have
never
in
she
much
of
this
inside
she
.
later
with
a
husband
to
urge
she
to
be
inside
she
her
important
being
,
she
could
have
such
a
feeling
.
luckily
then
Mary
Maxworthing
have
not
yet
her
husband
and
so
they
get
along
together
.




as
I
be
say
when
Mary
Maxworthing
be
have
she
despairing
feeling
she
lose
all
feel
about
Mabel
Linker
.
Mary
Maxworthing
have
this
in
she
,
many
woman
be
like
she
,
many
man
have
this
too
in
they
,
they
have
in
they
negative
egotism
in
they
.
later
there
will
be
history
of
many
of
such
of
they
.




Mary
be
not
a
complete
one
of
such
a
kind
of
they
.
this
be
the
kind
they
be
then
.
Mabel
Linker
be
not
at
all
such
a
kind
of
one
.
this
be
now
a
description
of
they
.




many
woman
then
be
always
of
they
,
many
man
have
it
in
they
,
mostly
it
be
a
kind
of
they
that
be
make
more
as
woman
perhaps
than
as
man
.
every
one
then
have
their
own
way
of
having
injure
feeling
in
they
.
as
I
be
say
many
have
it
in
they
when
they
have
more
self
-
sacrifice
,
more
noble
being
in
they
than
ever
come
out
of
they
in
live
,
when
they
have
a
noble
sweetness
in
they
to
they
and
they
be
unpleasant
or
lazy
even
in
living
.
many
of
they
who
have
negative
egotism
in
they
have
lazy
be
as
the
bottom
of
they
,
lazy
or
vague
or
empty
bottom
to
they
.
some
of
they
be
dependent
independent
,
some
be
independent
dependent
,
all
of
they
mostly
have
lazy
or
vague
or
empty
or
very
little
bottom
to
they
.
some
have
much
bottom
in
they
and
never
get
it
into
motion
.
negative
egotism
then
be
when
one
have
enough
egotism
never
to
follow
any
other
lead
,
never
to
live
anybody
else
's
life
in
living
,
always
to
have
the
good
reason
why
every
condition
in
living
be
the
wrong
place
for
they
and
not
to
have
enough
egotism
to
live
their
own
life
,
to
do
their
own
choosing
,
to
really
be
resist
.
these
then
never
have
any
real
choice
in
they
,
they
have
not
resist
in
they
,
they
have
very
good
reason
why
there
be
no
place
for
they
,
why
condition
be
always
wrong
to
they
.
often
it
take
year
to
know
they
,
they
be
mostly
nice
woman
with
tender
heart
and
pleasant
nature
in
they
,
they
be
many
of
they
so
stir
in
their
living
that
it
be
hard
to
know
it
of
they
that
they
have
lazy
be
as
a
bottom
to
they
,
they
worry
so
much
inside
they
that
it
be
hard
to
believe
it
of
they
that
they
have
not
it
in
they
to
be
active
in
take
trouble
enough
to
be
really
live
,
they
be
very
many
then
of
all
of
such
of
they
,
they
have
such
very
good
reason
for
not
find
any
place
for
living
,
it
take
a
long
time
when
one
be
live
with
any
one
of
they
not
to
be
take
in
by
the
good
reason
they
have
for
not
choose
.
even
when
one
know
they
well
their
reason
be
convincing
,
there
be
such
good
reason
always
in
they
and
they
be
mostly
pleasant
people
with
tender
heart
or
active
worrying
in
they
and
lazy
be
in
they
.
Laziness
be
in
many
of
they
not
easy
to
know
of
they
.
many
of
they
seem
actively
in
motion
many
of
such
of
they
who
have
really
lazy
be
in
they
.
there
be
then
many
many
million
always
be
make
of
woman
and
of
man
who
have
negative
egotism
in
they
.
some
then
be
always
exist
who
come
near
real
egotism
,
these
have
not
enough
egotism
for
choose
,
for
living
,
some
by
attack
some
by
resist
make
for
themselves
a
protection
,
they
do
not
do
their
own
living
but
they
keep
other
people
off
of
they
or
clog
they
.
there
be
many
way
then
of
be
in
all
these
way
of
egotism
,
sometime
then
there
will
be
a
history
of
all
of
they
,
a
history
of
all
of
they
,
a
history
of
every
one
,
of
every
man
and
every
woman
who
ever
be
or
be
or
will
be
live
,
who
have
ever
in
they
egotism
,
active
,
passive
or
negative
.




alright
then
,
there
be
a
negative
egotism
in
many
man
and
in
woman
,
in
very
many
of
they
.
sometime
then
there
will
be
a
history
of
every
kind
of
they
.




as
I
be
say
every
one
mostly
have
sometime
in
they
some
injure
feeling
.
Mabel
Linker
almost
never
have
any
of
it
in
she
.
Mary
Maxworthing
could
have
it
sometimes
in
she
.
Mabel
Linker
have
not
in
she
any
of
the
thing
we
have
be
just
describe
.
she
have
in
her
individual
being
,
she
have
in
her
sensitive
be
to
the
point
of
create
.
she
live
her
own
life
in
living
.
mostly
she
be
not
do
much
living
,
that
be
she
need
urge
to
be
work
,
she
have
flightiness
in
being
,
in
love
she
have
her
complete
being
,
then
she
do
real
creating
,
she
be
alive
then
to
her
own
feeling
.
Mary
Maxworthing
be
more
nearly
of
they
who
have
in
they
negative
egotism
.
she
have
a
little
gayety
in
living
,
she
have
a
little
sensitive
bottom
,
but
when
she
have
impatient
be
as
fill
she
have
almost
negative
egotism
.
when
she
have
impatient
be
then
,
she
have
not
in
she
any
sense
of
living
,
then
all
feel
for
any
one
die
out
of
she
.
impatient
be
be
not
nervous
be
in
she
,
it
be
not
a
bottom
to
she
,
it
be
sometimes
the
whole
of
she
,
it
be
stupid
be
in
she
.
Mabel
Linker
have
a
very
different
nature
.




as
I
be
say
when
Mary
Maxworthing
be
look
to
a
future
with
freedom
and
a
dressmaking
undertaking
and
a
little
distinction
,
she
have
in
she
a
sense
of
herself
to
herself
inside
she
,
she
have
in
she
a
sense
of
live
in
she
,
she
have
something
of
individual
be
in
she
.
she
have
then
for
Mabel
Linker
almost
an
idolising
feeling
,
this
be
important
feeling
in
she
.
when
she
have
despairing
be
in
she
she
have
only
stupid
be
in
she
,
she
have
not
negative
egotism
then
in
she
,
she
be
just
go
on
live
because
life
be
in
she
.
all
that
then
be
in
she
be
the
impatient
being
that
be
in
her
stupid
being
and
despairing
feeling
,
not
really
despair
feeling
,
but
dull
be
in
she
.
later
when
she
have
a
very
little
anxious
being
in
she
and
a
good
deal
of
impatient
be
in
she
,
when
Mabel
Linker
be
take
care
of
she
,
she
be
near
to
negative
egotism
,
she
have
excellent
reason
for
all
injure
feeling
in
she
,
she
have
excellent
reason
why
everyone
should
take
care
of
she
,
she
have
excellent
reason
for
it
to
be
right
to
she
that
Mabel
Linker
should
take
care
of
she
,
all
she
have
do
for
she
and
all
the
trouble
she
herself
now
have
in
she
,
and
so
it
be
right
that
she
should
have
Mabel
Linker
take
care
of
she
,
and
that
be
the
end
of
that
matter
to
she
.
Mabel
Linker
have
no
injure
feeling
in
she
,
Mabel
never
have
in
she
any
sense
of
any
one
do
any
thing
for
she
,
mostly
Mabel
do
what
come
to
she
,
she
do
well
anything
she
start
to
do
because
it
come
to
she
,
she
do
brilliant
dressmaking
,
it
come
natural
to
she
,
in
love
she
have
her
own
living
inside
she
.
later
she
have
her
husband
to
urge
she
,
that
give
to
she
a
little
more
,
always
in
she
,
a
sense
of
herself
to
herself
inside
she
.
Mary
Maxworthing
then
have
good
reason
not
to
have
toward
Mabel
Linker
any
grateful
feeling
.
Mabel
take
care
of
she
.
she
have
come
near
die
,
now
she
be
through
with
that
trouble
,
slowly
impatient
be
come
to
be
more
nearly
a
reasonably
small
part
of
she
,
and
this
be
now
to
she
an
end
of
that
matter
.




this
be
then
the
end
in
she
of
anxious
nervous
being
,
she
go
back
then
to
her
old
work
and
be
not
hope
and
she
have
then
negative
egotism
as
the
way
of
living
,
she
have
a
kind
of
negative
optimism
as
a
way
of
thinking
.
it
be
then
that
Mabel
Linker
begin
love
,
it
be
then
that
she
and
Mary
maxworthe
almost
come
to
the
end
of
friendly
relation
.
this
be
now
the
history
of
the
two
of
they
.




as
I
be
say
Mary
Maxworthing
then
have
for
a
little
time
no
hope
for
future
freedom
,
she
have
just
then
no
prospect
for
marry
,
she
be
commence
to
have
again
a
little
gayety
in
living
,
she
have
in
she
then
still
impatient
be
.
Mabel
Linker
have
commence
to
have
work
enough
at
home
to
keep
go
.
Mary
just
then
have
no
hope
of
commence
dressmaking
with
she
again
.
Mabel
be
flighty
then
and
have
no
sense
in
manage
.
Mary
be
not
take
much
interest
in
what
Mabel
be
do
,
she
have
in
she
some
impatient
feeling
,
she
have
in
she
then
very
little
important
being
of
herself
inside
she
to
her
feeling
.
she
have
in
she
then
not
much
real
living
,
she
have
in
her
then
negative
egotism
.




it
be
alright
for
Mary
Maxworthing
to
have
the
feeling
she
have
in
she
about
Mabel
Linker
.
she
have
good
reason
then
for
the
feeling
in
she
.
it
be
the
end
of
interest
for
she
,
it
be
the
end
of
freedom
for
she
,
Mabel
have
no
meaning
for
she
when
she
have
no
connection
with
she
,
this
come
to
she
when
she
have
her
baby
in
she
from
the
trouble
in
she
that
leave
she
no
feeling
for
any
other
because
she
have
no
live
be
in
she
;
later
when
Mabel
be
full
up
with
love
for
the
man
who
later
marry
she
there
be
nothing
of
she
for
Mary
to
feel
in
she
,
there
have
never
be
anything
there
really
,
for
she
,
but
when
there
be
nothing
else
in
Mabel
Linker
it
have
not
make
any
difference
to
any
one
who
know
she
.
Mary
Maxworthing
have
then
good
reason
for
the
feeling
she
have
in
she
about
Mabel
Linker
,
Mary
have
have
almost
an
idolising
feeling
about
Mabel
when
they
first
live
together
when
they
begin
their
undertaking
of
dress
-
making
together
,
when
she
would
sit
idle
,
wait
,
dream
,
she
would
be
write
,
"
Mabel
be
an
angel
,
angel
Mabel
,
"
this
show
the
feeling
she
have
then
in
she
about
she
.
then
come
the
time
when
she
be
no
long
hope
for
the
future
,
then
there
be
some
bitterness
in
she
,
then
she
feel
Mabel
should
have
more
grateful
feeling
in
she
than
she
show
toward
she
,
then
come
the
despairing
being
in
she
and
then
the
thing
happen
to
she
that
surprise
every
one
who
know
she
when
her
weakness
and
desire
be
more
active
in
she
because
gayety
and
impatient
being
and
ambition
be
then
dead
in
she
.
then
she
have
not
feel
about
any
one
around
she
.
then
there
come
to
be
in
she
,
troubled
impatient
feeling
,
and
Mabel
take
care
of
she
.
Mary
be
then
full
up
with
impatient
being
and
Mabel
take
care
of
she
like
any
other
,
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
then
feel
anything
about
the
other
.
then
when
that
be
over
Mary
know
how
near
she
have
come
to
be
die
,
then
she
have
a
little
anxious
impatient
irritable
being
in
she
and
then
she
and
Mabel
still
live
together
and
then
they
quarrel
more
and
more
with
each
other
for
Mabel
be
begin
then
with
her
lover
and
so
she
have
then
the
beginning
of
want
to
escape
,
a
little
,
in
she
.
then
Mary
be
begin
to
have
her
former
being
,
she
have
begin
again
take
care
of
child
.
Mabel
then
be
begin
to
succeed
well
enough
with
dress
-
making
to
work
at
home
and
keep
go
.
she
be
flighty
then
and
uncertain
in
her
working
and
Mary
be
always
scold
,
not
for
her
own
sake
for
there
be
nothing
in
it
for
she
,
but
for
Mabel
's
sake
so
Mabel
could
get
along
and
not
have
people
leave
she
disgusted
with
she
.
Mabel
be
very
flighty
then
with
no
one
to
hold
she
,
she
be
get
then
full
and
full
of
love
for
the
man
who
later
marry
she
.
Mary
do
not
want
this
marriage
for
she
,
he
be
a
young
fellow
,
Mabel
's
lover
,
young
than
she
be
and
a
poor
money
getter
.
Mary
do
not
then
have
for
Mabel
any
idolising
feeling
,
she
do
not
take
much
interest
in
she
,
she
always
scold
she
,
she
have
in
she
an
injured
feeling
because
Mabel
have
no
gratitude
in
she
,
no
feeling
for
any
one
around
she
.
this
be
true
enough
about
she
,
Mary
always
have
good
reason
for
the
feeling
in
she
,
it
be
true
enough
Mabel
be
flighty
and
have
no
gratitude
in
she
and
have
no
feeling
for
any
one
ever
except
the
man
who
later
marry
she
.
and
so
they
do
not
get
along
at
all
together
,
Mabel
always
have
more
and
more
escaping
in
she
,
she
have
not
come
yet
to
have
any
feeling
of
herself
inside
she
,
this
come
to
she
later
with
a
husband
to
urge
she
to
make
she
herself
inside
she
,
but
she
have
more
and
more
of
escape
be
in
she
,
she
be
always
get
more
and
more
full
of
love
and
she
never
have
have
in
she
any
feeling
for
any
one
around
she
.
before
,
it
have
not
be
important
to
any
one
the
feeling
in
she
for
then
there
be
not
in
she
,
love
or

to
make
any

feel
any
lack
in
she
.
now
it
be
different
and
Mary
Maxworthing

then
about

.
it
be
alright
for

to
have
then
such
a
feeling
about
Mabel
Linker
,
Mabel
have
flightiness
then
in
she
,
Mabel
have
escape
then
in
she
,
Mabel
be
full
up
with
love
for
a
man
who
be
young
and
would
never
earn
a
living
for
she
.
Mabel
Linker
have
then
her
own
live
in

.
she
be
full
up
with
love

be
always
get
more

more
unpleasant
between

.
Mary
Maxworthing
have
injure

such
flightiness
in

,
she
want
to
keep
she
from
marry
.
Mabel
then
have
escape
be
in
she
and
she
would
then
sometimes
answer
and
it
be
then
a
continued
bite
chatter
whenever
they
be
together
and
they
be
always
together
,
they
could
not
keep
away
from
one
another
.
finally
thing
get
so
bitter
between
they
that
Mary
would
have
nothing
far
to
do
with
she
.
Mabel
could
marry
and
then
when
sickness
and
trouble
would
come
to
she
she
would

Mary
Maxworthing
would
have
nothing
more

pauper
lover
.
Mary
have
a
hard
feeling

have
then
impatient
being

injure
being
and
angry
feeling

hard
sense
of

that
bad
thing
would
come
to
Mabel
Linker
to
punish
she
.
Mabel
do
not
pay
much
attention
then
to
she
,
she
be
have
a
little
trouble
then
with
the
mother
of

Mabel
have
no

anything
and
she
do
not
want
to
say
it
to
she
go
to
be
husband
's
family
.
Mary
Maxworthing
have
then
always
more
and
more
of
angry
feeling
in
she
about
Mabel
Linker
.
she
tell

she
need

and
Mabel
could
go

that
be
for
some
time
the
end
of

to
be
a
history
of

these
then
make
Mrs.

,
sometimes
for

there
be
,
as
I

,
three
governess
,
a
foreign

,
and
a
tall
blond
foreign
American
who
later
marry
a
baker
,
and
then
Madeleine
Wyman
who
be
with
they
when
Mrs.
Hersland
have
in
living
,
her
most
important
feeling
.
this
be
now
a
history
of
the
three
of
they
and
then
there
will
be
a
little
more
history
of
Mrs.
Hersland
and
Mr.
Hersland
and
of
they
with
they
,
and
then
there
will
begin
a
history
of
the
three
child
,
a
long
history
of
each
one
of
they
.




the
first
governess
then
be
a
foreign
woman
.
she
be
a
good
musician
.




it
be
very
interesting
that
every
one
have
in
they
their
kind
of
stupid
being
.
it
be
very
important
to
know
it
in
each
one
which
part
in
they
,
which
kind
of
feeling
in
they
be
connect
with
stupid
be
in
they
.
there
be
then
stupid
be
in
every
one
.
it
be
hard
to
know
it
in
the
foreign
woman
who
be
such
a
good
musician
and
the
first
governess
the
Hersland
family
have
live
with
they
,
it
be
hard
to
know
the
stupid
being
that
be
surely
somewhere
in
she
.
it
be
hard
to
know
she
enough
to
know
where
to
find
it
in
she
.
she
have
a
sister
,
in
that
way
perhaps
one
could
find
it
in
she
.
this
be
now
a
history
of
she
,
and
the
sister
and
the
Hersland
family
with
she
.




the
sister
be
much
young
.
she
be
then
in
Gossols
,
then
study
to
be
a
teacher
.
she
be
always
a
little
afraid
of
her
sister
.
she
always
address
she
as
sister
Martha
.
it
be
very
hard
to
find
the
stupid
being
in
the
governess
even
when
she
be
with
her
sister
.
it
be
very
hard
to
find
stupid
be
in
she
then
even
when
her
sister
be
with
she
.
she
be
then
a
woman
nearly
forty
.
she
have
be
a
governess
ever
since
she
be
twenty
.
she
have
be
,
the
last
ten
year
,
in
America
.
she
have
bring
her
young
sister
with
she
,
she
want
she
to
be
educate
to
be
a
teacher
,
she
want
she
to
live
in
America
where
life
would
be
easy
.
she
herself
do
not
like
it
in
America
,
she
want
to
go
back
to
her
old
living
where
people
speak
french
and
german
and
where
it
be
natural
for
she
to
be
a
musician
.
it
be
not
to
she
,
natural
to
be
musical
in
Gossols
.
she
do
not
stay
very
long
with
the
Herslands
,
her
sister
soon
get
a
position
as
teacher
and
then
the
eld
sister
leave
she
,
she
want
then
to
leave
America
,
this
do
not
come
to
she
,
she
get
as
far
as
Cincinnati
and
then
somehow
she
never
get
far
.
she
stay
there
and
she
give
music
lesson
and
she
never
get
any
far
and
she
stay
there
always
until
she
die
there
,
and
she
never
have
leave
America
.
as
I
be
say
it
be
not
easy
to
know
it
in
she
the
stupid
be
in
she
.
as
I
be
say
every
one
have
in
they
their
kind
of
stupid
being
.
in
almost
every
one
sometime
to
every
one
it
be
clear
in
they
which
kind
of
feeling
in
they
be
connect
with
stupid
be
in
they
.
there
be
stupid
be
in
every
one
.
it
be
not
easy
to
know
the
stupid
be
in
this
first
governess
of
the
Herslands
as
I
be
say
she
be
a
good
musician
.
as
I
be
say
she
have
be
then
almost
twenty
year
in
the
occupation
of
governessing
.
she
have
be
ten
year
in
America
,
she
have
not
much
gayety
in
living
,
she
have
not
in
she
anything
of
dreary
being
.
it
be
then
very
interesting
always
to
know
the
stupid
be
in
each
one
.
it
be
hard
to
see
it
in
this
one
.
it
be
hard
even
to
see
it
in
she
live
with
her
sister
and
in
this
way
it
often
come
out
in
woman
.
it
be
hard
to
know
the
stupid
be
in
she
for
no
one
come
close
to
she
not
even
her
sister
.
no
one
come
close
enough
to
she
to
know
easily
the
stupid
be
in
she
.
with
some
,
you
have
to
come
close
to
they
to
know
the
stupid
be
in
they
.
this
first
governess
of
the
Hersland
family
be
such
a
one
.
she
have
come
to
have
some
queerness
in
she
.
be
it
queerness
of
herself
inside
she
or
be
it
governess
queerness
in
she
.
it
be
hard
to
tell
it
in
one
when
no
one
come
close
to
that
one
whether
it
be
queerness
in
that
one
from
the
character
,
or
from
the
life
that
one
be
lead
,
from
condition
or
to
earn
a
living
.
there
be
many
then
who
have
queerness
in
they
.
this
first
governess
of
the
Herslands
be
such
a
one
,
no
one
,
not
even
her
sister
Olga
even
dimly
inside
she
,
ever
be
very
certain
what
be
stupid
be
in
she
.
she
have
queerness
in
she
but
not
enough
to
make
a
strange
creature
of
she
,
just
enough
to
keep
herself
together
.
no
one
be
ever
very
certain
whether
keep
herself
together
be
the
queerness
in
she
,
whether
it
be
governess
queerness
she
have
in
she
,
no
one
be
ever
very
certain
of
this
in
she
not
even
her
sister
.
to
be
sure
her
sister
be
a
young
girl
when
they
be
together
.
later
Olga
the
sister
stay
in
Gossols
and
her
sister
leave
she
after
having
establish
she
.
there
be
almost
twenty
year
between
they
,
Olga
be
afraid
of
her
sister
,
and
then
she
be
separate
from
she
,
and
they
never
afterwards
see
each
other
.
and
so
Olga
never
come
to
be
sure
about
her
sister
as
to
what
be
the
stupid
be
in
she
.
perhaps
it
be
the
have
to
keep
herself
together
.
perhaps
it
be
the
queerness
in
she
.
perhaps
it
be
the
not
have
real
queerness
in
she
,
just
enough
to
keep
herself
together
.




the
first
governess
,
then
,
do
not
stay
a
long
time
with
the
Herslands
.
it
be
not
that
any
one
of
they
want
she
should
leave
they
.
she
do
not
make
much
of
any
impression
on
any
of
they
.
it
make
no
difference
to
any
of
they
her
leave
or
stay
.
she
know
some
funny
foreign
song
and
the
child
like
to
hear
they
and
she
be
a
good
musician
and
that
be
all
the
meaning
she
have
for
they
.
as
I
be
say
she
have
a
little
queerness
in
she
but
not
enough
to
make
she
important
to
those
near
she
.
she
have
queerness
enough
to
keep
she
together
.
as
I
be
say
her
sister
be
always
a
little
afraid
of
she
but
she
be
twenty
year
young
and
they
do
not
live
a
long
time
together
,
her
sister
never
come
to
know
the
meaning
of
queerness
in
she
.
she
be
to
she
,
sister
Martha
,
who
give
the
money
to
make
she
a
teacher
,
who
have
give
money
so
she
have
be
keep
at
school
after
the
father
and
mother
have
die
and
leave
she
with
no
one
to
support
she
.
later
when
she
have
get
a
position
and
be
earn
her
own
living
,
she
,
sister
Martha
leave
Gossols
and
go
to
Cincinnati
.
they
never
again
come
together
.




as
I
be
say
the
first
governess
of
the
Herslands
have
queerness
in
she
,
not
enough
to
make
any
impression
on
any
of
the
Hersland
family
in
the
time
they
have
she
,
enough
to
keep
herself
together
,
enough
to
keep
her
sister
from
ever
know
any
stupid
be
in
she
,
enough
as
I
say
to
keep
she
together
,
to
make
she
.
she
have
queerness
in
she
.
she
have
stupid
be
in
she
.
some
have
more
and
some
have
less
character
.
this
be
the
amount
she
have
in
she
.
later
there
will
be
a
history
of
her
sister
.
there
be
then
many
be
make
,
many
always
exist
of
every

in
all
the

have
more
successful
living
in
more
of

there
be
all
degree
of
success
in

of
that
kind
of

.
the
first
governess
the
Herslands
have
with
they
be
of
a
kind
of
man
and
woman
who
most
of
they
be
successful
enough
in
living
and
many
of
they
come
pretty
close
to
complete
fail
but
few
of
they
completely
fail
in
living
,
not
many
of
they
be
really
successful
in
living
.
mostly
they
keep
themselves
from
fail
,
this
be
mostly
the
successful
being
in

all
of
this
kind
of
they
have
some
concentration
in
they
even
if
like
in
this
one
it
be
only
as
queerness
,
enough
queerness
to
hold
together
the
whole
of
they
.
this
first
governess
of
the
Herslands
,
who
do
not
stay
a
long
time
with
they
,
have
in
she
,
dependent
independent
being
.
the
two
,
dependent
and
independent
being
be
so
balanced
in
she
that
resisting
be
almost
attack
in
she
,
that
dependence
be
almost
independence
in
she
.
it
never
really
come
to
be
a
force
in
she
,
she
have
enough
concentration
of
it
all
in
she
to
make
it
in
a
sense
seem
like
successful
be
in
she
,
it
be
just
enough
in
she
,
the
concentration
in
she
,
to
keep
she
from
failure
,
it
be
as
queerness
in
she
and
that
give
she
for
some
who
see
she
,
more
concentration
than
be
in
she
.
there
be
just
enough
queerness
in
she
to
hold
she
together
.

.
there
be
not

to
make
success
or
failure
,
there
be
enough
in
she
to
keep
she
from
failure
,
to
keep
people
from
come
close
to
she
,
to
make
her
young
sister
afraid
of
she
,
to
give
enough
dignity
to
she
to
keep
she
always
from
give
way
or
failure
.
there
be
not
enough
in
she
to
make
any
impression
on
any
one
around
she
,
though
when
any
one
think
about
she
they
remember
she
as
one
have
character
,
more
character
than
they
feel
when
they
be
with
she
.
she
have
dependent
independent
being
in
she
.
these
be
so
balanced
in
she
,
that
dependent
being
be
like
independent
being
,
independent
like
dependent
be
in
she
.
she
be
keep
together
.
she
have
queerness
enough
in
she
to
keep
she
together
,
to
keep
she
from
failure
.
this
be
a
history
of
she
.
there
be
always
many
million
make
like
she
,
some
have
more
some
have
less
concentration
in
they
,
some
have
more
some
have
less
success
in
living
.
she
always
keep
from
fail
to
she
die
.
she
never
really
have
any
success
in
living
.




as
I
be
say
she
be
a
good
musician
.
they
like
she
well
enough
,
the
Herslands
,
when
she
be
governess
to
they
but
she
make
no
impression
on
any
of
they
.
she
do
not
give
to
Mrs.
Hersland
any
important
feeling
of
herself
to
herself
inside
she
,
to
her
feeling
.
Mr.
Hersland
have
a
theory
of
she
in
the
beginning
,
he
want
to
have
a
real
foreign
woman
,
a
real
governess
with
concentrated
being
,
with
german
and
french
and
who
be
really
a
musician
.
she
be
what
he
want
then
for
his
child
and
he
employ
she
.
when
he
remember
about
she
,
when
he
see
she
,
or
his
wife
or
child
mention
she
he
know
she
be
what
he
feel
they
need
to
have
as
governess
in
the
house
for
the
child
.
theoretically
,
she
be
important
to
he
,
really
she
have
no
existence
for
he
.
what
she
be
be
just
what
he
want
for
his
child
,
a
foreign
woman
who
know
german
and
french
well
and
be
a
good
musician
.
then
he
forget
about
she
for
she
have
never
when
with
they
any
existence
for
he
.
then
when
she
leave
they
after
a
little
while
with
they
because
her
sister
have
become
a
teacher
and
so
she
could
leave
she
and
she
want
to
leave
America
,
when
she
leave
they
Mr.
Hersland
think
it
be
well
that
the
child
should
have
american
training
.
they
be
american
,
they
do
not
need
french
and
german
,
they
do
not
need
to
bother
about
music
then
,
they
could
do
that
later
,
now
they
need
strength
and
gymnastic
and
out
of
door
live
,
and
swimming
and
shooting
.
and
that
be
the
end
of
the
first
governess
for
all
of
they
.




they
sometimes
see
the
sister
Olga
who
be
a
teacher
in
Gossols
but
she
never
talk
much
about
her
sister
Martha
.
the
child
like
Olga
,
they
like
she
,
they
like
to
tease
she
.
Mr.
Hersland
give
her
good
advice
,
when
Mr.
Hersland
notice
she
he
be
attract
by
she
.
Olga
be
very
different
from
her
sister
Martha
.




she
have
as
I
be
say
independent
dependent
be
in
she
.
she
have
very
much
vague
be
as
a
bottom
to
she
.
she
have
all
sort
of
attack
to
make
attraction
in
she
.
later
the
child
make
fun
of
she
.
later
the
vague
bottom
in
she
be
stupid
being
and
nervous
being
and
sometimes
silly
be
in
she
.




no
one
who
know
she
would
think
of
she
as
a
woman
of
a
spinster
nature
.
she
be
round
and
pleasant
and
man
like
she
and
she
have
constant
attacking
way
in
she
to
give
to
her
more
attraction
and
man
could
be
in
love
with
she
and
she
want
to
have
attention
from
they
and
she
make
they
when
they
be
anywhere
near
she
give
it
to
she
,
make
they
sure
of
she
from
her
action
toward
they
and
she
have
as
a
bottom
a
vague
being
and
later
this
be
in
she
as
nervous
be
in
she
,
never
as
impatient
be
in
she
.




no
one
would
ever
think
of
she
as
a
woman
with
a
spinster
nature
but
this
be
true
of
she
.
she
be
as
I
be
say
a
pleasant
person
,
more
,
even
an
attractive
person
.
she
be
round
and
kind
and
pretty
in
a
fashion
.
she
have
plenty
of
attraction
and
she
be
full
up
with
attack
to
give
to
herself
more
attraction
.




as
I
be
say
no
one
would
ever
naturally
think
of
she
as
a
spinster
but
this
be
true
of
she
and
more
and
more
later
it
come
to
be
clear
in
she
.
always
she
have
attack
in
all
kind
of
way
to
give
to
herself
more
attraction
and
always
she
have
as
a
bottom
a
vague
be
so
that
she
be
a
way
be
baffle
,
always
make
for
herself
a
stupid
escaping
,
sometimes
not
an
easy
escaping
,
sometimes
she
have
to
escape
by
accusation
.




she
have
in
her
independent
dependent
nature
.
attacking
be
to
she
a
natural
way
of
fighting
,
she
be
full
up
with
vague
bottom
and
all
the
rest
with
constant
pleasing
attack
,
she
have
never
in
she
any
real
fighting
.
there
be
no
connect
she
attack
with
her
large
vague
bottom
,
with
the
large
vague
bottom
in
she
that
make
her
baffling
,
that
later
turn
into
nervous
being
in
she
.
she
have
a
spinster
nature
.
no
one
who
know
she
ever
think
about
it
in
she
.
they
never
know
this
in
she
.
every
one
just
think
it
be
stupid
be
in
she
.
later
the
Hersland
boy
make
fun
of
she
.
later
there
will
be
more
history
of
she
as
Alfred
Hersland
come
to
make
fun
of
she
,
as
Martha
Hersland
come
to
know
she
.
Mrs.
Hersland
always
keep
track
of
she
and
be
good
to
she
.
Mr.
Hersland
know
she
in
his
later
living
when
he
have
trouble
.
all
this
will
be
a
history
of
she
.
all
this
will
be
write
later
.
everybody
call
she
Olga
.
it
be
natural
to
be
familiar
to
she
.




there
be
then
in
the
Hersland
middle
live
this
first
governess
who
do
not
stay
long
with
they
.
as
I
be
say
when
Mr.
Hersland
employ
she
,
he
be
the
one
who
interview
she
,
she
be
the
ideal
for
he
.
he
want
a
real
governess
,
a
foreign
woman
with
governess
training
,
one
who
be
a
good
musician
,
one
who
would
talk
french
and
german
with
the
child
.
after
she
be
with
they
whenever
he
notice
she
he
be
certain
that
she
be
what
he
want
to
have
for
the
child
.
when
she
leave
he
have
already
in
he
a
new
beginning
.




now
he
want
the
child
not
to
have
their
English
spoil
by
french
and
german
.
now
he
be
certain
that
music
be
a
thing
no
one
could
learn
when
they
be
child
.
this
be
something
every
one
should
have
in
their
later
living
,
child
should
have
freedom
,
should
have
an
out
of
door
gymnasium
,
should
have
swimming
and
public
school
living
,
should
have
a
governess
who
would
live
with
they
such
a
life
and
not
teach
they
french
or
german
,
not
teach
they
anything
,
just
be
a
healthy
person
with
they
.
and
so
this
next
governess
be
very
different
from
the
last
one
.
she
be
a
tall
blond
woman
.
she
have
no
queerness
in
she
.
later
she
marry
a
baker
.
she
be
a
healthy
person
.
there
be
no
trouble
for
any
one
to
know
her
stupid
being

Mr.

as
big
as

.
he
have
his
idea
of
educate
child
.
he
be
always
full
up
with
beginning
.
he
be
as
big
as
all
the
world
around
he
.
he
never
think
about
it
in
himself
then
,
it
be
natural
to
he
.
each
beginning
be
in
he
such
a
feeling
.




he
have
first
see
the
first
governess
they
have
and
he
have
have
a
feeling
in
he
that
be
the
ideal
governess
for
his
child
.
she
be
a
good
musician
,
it
be
necessary
then
to
he
that
they
should
have
much
music
in
their
education
.
she
be
a
good
scholar
in
french
and
german
,
he
talk
to
she
about
the
way
he
would
insist
always
that
his
child
should
talk
french
and
german
.
she
be
an
ideal
to
he
,
she
be
begin
to
he
,
he
would
see
to
it
that
the
child
learn
all
this
governess
could
teach
they
.
he
talk
to
she
in
the
beginning
often
about
they
and
his
rule
and
wish
for
they
.
then
she
make
no
impression
on
he
,
she
be
not
evident
enough
in
the
family
live
to
attract
his
attention
.
she
soon
die
out
of
he
.
soon
he
forget
about
the
child
and
their
education
.
then
she
leave
they
.
then
he
be
angry
with
the
child
that
they
know
so
little
french
and
german
.
then
there
be
in
he
a
new
beginning
,
he
think
it
well
for
their
English
that
they
should
forget
all
the
french
and
german
the
first
governess
have
teach
they
.
they
should
not
spend
time
learn
music
when
they
need
physical
training
,
he
would
have
a
good
healthy
woman
,
not
a
too
well
educate
one
,
to
help
they
with
their
lesson
and
to
see
that
they
do
gymnastic
and
swimming
.
this
time
he
want
a
big
healthy
woman
.
he
do
not
want
a
small
one
that
have
no
color
in
her
face
and
be
careful
in
every
motion
.
he
want
a
strong
healthy
woman
,
one
who
know
something
about
farming
,
one
who
do
not
spend
her
time
in
reading
or
piano
practicing
.
he
have
in
he
then
a
new
beginning
.
he
want
a
big
healthy
woman
who
know
all
about
farming
.
the
second
governess
then
be
such
a
one
.
her
father
and
mother
have
a
dairy
farm
and
she
be
a
big
blond
woman
and
she
have
red
cheek
and
she
be
not
a
musician
and
she
do
not
know
any
french
and
german
and
she
have
have
only
an
ordinary
education
and
she
know
nothing
about
spend
her
time
in
reading
.
there
be
no
question
that
she
be
the
ideal
Mr.
Hersland
have
then
in
he
for
a
governess
for
his
child
.
he
never
forget
about
she
altogether
as
he
do
about
the
first
one
.
she
be
always
some
one
to
he
,
he
like
big
healthy
woman
,
she
do
not
know
much
about
farming
but
she
listen
while
he
talk
to
she
about
farming
and
about
the
child
.
later
he
do
not
talk
to
she
about
the
child
,
a
little
still
about
farming
,
but
when
he
notice
she
she
make
a
certain
impression
on
he
.
later
when
she
be
married
to
the
baker
he
would
drop
in
to
see
she
and
eat
a
cake
while
he
talk
to
she
.
he
do
not
mind
much
that
she
be
large
then
and
paler
and
a
little
dirty
in
she
dress
a
little
sordider
,
grimier

important
enough
to
he
to
hold

will
come
out
later
in

at
this
time
then
in

of
have
some
feeling
about
people

.
this
be
different
in

.




there
be
many
way
then
that
one
have
feel
for
people
near

.
this
be
now
a
history
of
feeling
in
Mr.
Hersland
in
the
beginning
of
his
middle
living
.




as
I
be
say
he
select
the
two
first
governess
for
his
child
,
the
first
be
his
ideal
of
a
governess
for
they
then
,
a
woman
with
governess
training
,
a
good
musician
and
have
a
thorough
understanding
of
french
and
german
.
she
be
his
ideal
then
.
when
he
tell
she
what
his
ideal
be
for
his
child
,
she
make
an
impression
on
he
.
mostly
,
later
,
he
never
notice
she
,
she
make
no
impression
on
he
,
sometimes
later
when
she
listen
while
he
tell
she
what
he
know
about
education
she
make
some
impression
but
it
be
always
a
reflection
,
it
be
only
when
she
be
listen
that
she
make
an
impression
and
that
be
only
by
virtue
of
her
training
,
the
listening
of
somebody
so
welltraine
in
education
make
an
impression
on
he
,
it
be
her
training
it
be
never
herself
that
make
an
impression
on
he
.
when
she
leave
the
Herslands
he
have
not
any
long
much
interest
in
talk
to
her
training
,
he
be
already
then
full
up
then
with
a
new
beginning
.




he
have
then
a
feeling
that
he
want
a
big
strong
healthy
woman
to
be
with
his
child
.
they
could
get
enough
education
from
public
school
and
reading
,
he
have
have
that
kind
of
education
,
it
would
be
the
good
thing
for
they
.
he
tell
the
governess
what
he
want
she
should
do
for
the
child
,
what
his
idea
be
about
they
.
she
listen
to
he
but
her
listening
be
not
stimulate
,
but
she
make
an
impression
,
he
like
well
enough
to
notice
she
then
and
later
when
she
be
married
to
the
baker
,
when
she
be
large
then
and
a
little
grimy
he
still
like
to
see
she
,
he
would
stop
by
at
her
shop
where
she
be
sit
attend
to
the
custom
and
he
would
eat
a
cake
there
and
ask
she
how
she
be
get
on
and
he
like
that
much
contact
with
she
.
later
there
be
a
third
governess
Madeleine
Wyman
.




Mr.
Hersland
then
in
the
beginning
of
his
middle
living
want
mildly
a
little
attraction
in
woman
but
mostly
then
it
be
not
a
need
in
he
,
his
wife
then
be
existent
to
he
,
he
like
well
enough
a
little
look
at
woman
who
make
on
he
then
some
impression
.
so
he
like
a
little
to
be
with
the
second
governess
when
she
be

thing
and
later
to
eat
a
cake
while
she
sit
there

.
this
be
the
beginning
of
his

very
little
real
fighting
in

,
real
fighting
in
she
would
be

.
she
have
very

of
this
in
she
in
her
living
.
she
have
a
little
of
it
in
she
with
her
husband
in
the
beginning
and
always
a
little
all
through
her
living
.
she
have
a
little
of
it
in
she
with
her
child
when
they
be
first
begin
,
and
then
she
be
of
they
but
soon
they
be
not
of
she
then
and
she
have
no
win
fighting
be
for
they
or
with
they
.
sometimes
about
a
servant
she
have
attack
being
,
later
about
Madeleine
Wyman
and
that
be
in
her
stupid
being
.
Madeleine
Wyman
have
in
her
stupid
be
in
want
to
be
subdue
.
not
with
Mr.
or
Mrs.
Hersland
,
there
she
be
yield
to
be
subdue
and
that
be
not
in
her
stupid
being
,
yield
be
never
in
her
stupid
being
,
attack
be
in
her
stupid
being
.
with
Mrs.
Hersland
and
with
Mr.
Hersland
too
she
have
in
her
yielding
and
so
she
come
to
own
they
.
she
yield
herself
to
they
and
so
she
come
to
live
in
they
and
in
their
early
living
and
then
she
come
to
own
they
.
this
be
not
in
her
stupid
being
.
stupid
be
with
she
be
in
she
fail
,
in
she
attack
,
in
she
sometimes
when
resist
.
mostly
in
she
as
attack
for
subduing
and
this
be
in
her
stupid
being
.
this
be
true
of
she
with
the
Hersland
child
,
this
be
true
of
she
in
her
later
living
.
this
will
sometime
be
clear
in
she
as
there
come
to
be
completely
a
history
of
she
,
a
history
of
all
the
living
in
she
from
she
begin
to
her
ending
.




there
be
then
stupid
be
in
every
one
.
in
many
,
one
have
to
have
a
whole
history
of
all
their
living
from
their
beginning
to
their
ending
to
know
it
in
they
.
Mrs.
Hersland
be
such
a
one
.
Mrs.
Hersland
as
I
be
say
be
never
important
for
her
child
except
to
begin
they
.
she
never
have
a
feeling
of
herself
to
herself
from
they
.
she
be
of
they
until
they
be
so
big
that
she
be
lose
among
they
,
she
be
lose
then
between
they
and
the
father
of
they
.




so
then
to
begin
again
with
the
Hersland
family
's
live
with
the
third
governess
Madeleine
Wyman
with
they
and
with
a
history
of
she
and
every
one
who
come
to
know
she
and
of
the
Hersland
family
with
she
.
to
begin
again
then
with
Mr.
Hersland
and
his
idea
about
education
.
to
begin
again
with
Mr.
Hersland
and
his
choosing
of
the
governess
for
the
education
of
his
child
.
to
begin
again
with
Mr.
Hersland
and
his
theory
of
education
.




as
I
say
the
first
governess
be
a
real
governess
and
know
french
and
german
and
be
a
good
musician
.
she
be
theoretically
satisfying
to
he
in
the
beginning
but
personally
after
she
begin
live
in
the
house
with
they
she
make
no
impression
on
he
.
then
his
theory
change
in
he
and
he
want
a
woman
who
be
strong
and
use
to
farming
and
he
get
one
and
she
be
pleasanter
for
he
for
she
have
a
physical
meaning
for
he
and
then
she
marry
the
baker
and
they
all
sometimes
see
she
after
but
that
be
the
end
of
her
governessing
and
for
some
time
then
they
have
no
one
.
then
they
hear
of
Madeleine
Wyman
who
be
everything
.
they
need
a
governess
then
so
the
father
think
because
the
child
have
forget
all
their
french
and
german
and
the
daughter
Martha
that
year
have
miss
annual
promotion
.
besides
in
their
half
country
live
they
need
some
one
to
keep
the
family
live
apart
from
the
living
around
they
.
anyway
in
Madeleine
Wyman
they
have
everything
,
she
know
french
and
german
,
she
be
an

,

and
could
talk

as
listen
to
Mr.
Hersland
about

,
she
want
to
listen
always
to
Mrs.

's
Bridgepoint

there
be
a

with
Madeleine
Wyman
it
be
a
different
matter
.
she
be
not
a

have
health
in

,
and
a
fine
figure
.

.
she
have
a
trim
figure
,

not
pretty
,
nor
ugly
either
,
she
be
pleasant
and
bright
and
have
some
energy
.
with
her
Mr.
Hersland
could
always
talk
about
education
in
a
different
way
from
that
in
which
he
talk
with
the
second
governess
who
have
marry
the
baker
.
Madeleine
Wyman
be
young
and
have
understanding
in
she
,
she
be
young
and
ready
to
try
to
carry
out
his
theory
in
the
way
he
want
from
she
.
she
want
to
educate
the
three
child
in
music
,
french
and
german
,
gymnastic
,
swimming
,
and
with
at
the
same
time
good
american
public
school
training
.
with
the
first
governess
it
have
be
different
.
she
always
have
listen
to
Mr.
Hersland
but
she
have
a
real
governess
be
in
she
and
she
do
what
this
governess
be
in
she
demand
from
she
.
she
be
polite
and
intelligent
but
she
have
real
governess
be
in
she
.
after
Mr.
Hersland
have
get
through
tell
she
all
the
advantage
of
european
education
over
American
and
she
have
politely
agree
with
he
,
there
be
nothing
for
he
to
say
to
she
.
he
become
indifferent
later
about
tell
this
to
she
and
so
she
have
no
existence
for
he
although
whenever
he
be
conscious
of
she
he
have
respect
for
the
genuine
governess
be
in
she
,
for
she
be
a
thorough
musician
,
for
she
really
know
french
and
german
.




Madeleine
Wyman
then
be
a
good
person
to
listen
to
he
.
well
than
the
other
two
to
he
.
personally
she
be
pleasant
to
he
,
she
be
not
so
large
as
an
impression
personally
on
he
of
agreeable
healthy
feeling
as
the
second
governess
have
be
.
she
be
more
satisfying
as
a
listener
to
he
.
not
so
satisfy
for
advise
,
really
she
be
more
important
to
Mrs.
Hersland
than
she
be
to
he
.
she
really
have
more
advice
from
Mrs.
Hersland
than
from
he
.
he
like
to
talk
to
she
but
it
be
not
a
personal
feeling
.
she
have
understanding
in
she
,
she
be
young
and
ready
to
carry
out
his
feeling
about
education
but
really
she
be
not
very
personal
for
he
,
she
be
very
personal
for
Mrs.
Hersland
,
she
be
to
Mrs.
Hersland
a
part
of
Mrs.
Hersland
's
most
important
living
.
they
have
then
for
each
other
these
two
woman
very
important
being
.
this
be
now
a
history
of
they
.




with
Madeleine
Wyman
live
in
the
same
house
with
they
,
Mrs.
Hersland
have
in
her
her
feeling
of
be
to
herself
inside
she
strong
in
her
whole
living
,
strong
than
later
when
she
go
to
Bridgepoint
to
visit
her
family
and
be
like
a
princess
to
they
,
a
very
rich
woman
from
the
far
country
and
in
her
feeling
for
they
a
part
of
they
but
to
they
and
really
to
herself
then
not
a
part
of
rich
right
living
;
more
important
than
early
when
she
meet
Mr.
Hersland
and
her
marrying
be
then
her
important
being
.
she
have
never
then
at
any
time
in
her
living
so
completely
to
herself
then
a
realization
,
a
feeling
of
herself
to
herself
,
a
being
in
herself
to
her
own
feeling
important
in
her
being
,
not
from
do
,
not
from
feeling
,
not
from
be
,
not
from
have
,
not
from
anything
in
her
living
or
her
being
but
from
be
to
herself
in
herself
then
an
important
person
as
she
have
then
in
her
middle
living
with
the
third
governess
in
the
house
with
they
.
some
one
need
she
,
not
for
their
living
or
their
feeling
,
but
need
she
for
their
self
-
creation
.
and
so
,
it
be
in
her
middle
living
with
Madeleine
Wyman
in
the
house
with
they
that
she
have
in
her
really
individual
being
.
as
I
be
say
the
child
later
have
a
sore
feeling
that
Madeleine
Wyman
own
their
mother
's
early
living
.
they
have
a
sore
feeling
because
they
be
so
,
cut
off
from
part
of
their
own
being
.
Madeleine
Wyman
make
Mrs.
Hersland
really
an
attack
being
and
this
be
the
most
stupid
be
she
have
in
she
in
her
living
.
Mrs.
Hersland
then
,
be
important
to
Madeleine
Wyman
to
give
to
her
individual
being
,
with
her
feeling
and
live
in
she
be
to
make
for
herself
a
being
.
Mrs.
Hersland
then
have
from
Madeleine
Wyman
individual
being
,
from
Madeleine
Wyman
's
live
her
early
being
.
this
be
now
again
a
history
of
they
.




the
Wyman
family
be
foreign
American
.
the
mother
be
always
pretty
foreign
.
no
one
of
their
child
except
perhaps
the
second
one
Louise
ever
know
very
much
what
their
father
have
in
he
.
their
child
do
not
really
know
much
about
what
be
in
either
of
they
,
the
father
or
the
mother
in
the
house
with
they
.
the
old
people
be
too
foreign
to
they
for
they
ever
to
really
know
anything
about
they
.
the
second
one
Louise
,
Madeleine
be
the
eld
of
the
child
,
the
second
one
Louise
be
not
foreign
in
she
being
but
she
be
in
some
way
near
in
understanding
to
the
old
folk
who
be
very
foreign
perhaps
not
understand
to
her
feeling
,
but
understanding
to
anyone
to
every
one
who
see
she
with
they
.
there
seem
more
connection
between
she
and
her
father
and
her
mother
,
there
be
not
any
connection
to
anybody
's
feeling
between
the
foreign
old
woman
and
the
old
man
,
and
anything
in
their
living
,
there
be
not
much
connection
to
anybody
's
feeling
between
the
old
man
and
the
old
woman
,
perhaps
they
be
not
so
very
old
then
,
they
live
a
long
time
after
and
so
they
could
not
have
be
so
very
old
then
,
there
be
then
to
everybody
who
see
they
not
much
connection
between
the
foreign
woman
and
the
foreign
man
who
be
a
little
vague
to
every
one
,
there
be
only
the
connection
between
that
neither
of
they
seem
to
be
connect
with
any
other
one
.
later
when
one
know
the
child
well
and
still
later
when
no
one
any
long
see
any
of
they
and
only
remember
they
,
one
then
could
reconstruct
the
foreign
father
and
mother
out
of
the
child
and
so
could
come
to
an
understanding
of
they
,
a
realisation
that
they
have
be
alive
then
and
human
.
later
then
there
will
be
a
reconstruction
of
they
,
not
from
any
impression
from
they
but
from
what
their
child
have
in
they
as
nature
in
they
and
so
the
parent
will
come
to
be
make
soon
to
we
out
of
the
memory
of
the
child
as
later
one
remember
they
,
the
child
when
one
no
long
see
they
.
the
mother
and
the
father
then
be
to
every
one
then
disconnect
from
every
one
,
a
little
less
from
the
second
daughter
Louise
,
she
have
some
connection
with
they
then
to
every
one
who
know
they
.
later
there
will
be
more
description
of
this
connection
of
hers
with
they
.
the
Herslands
have
never
then
very
much
impression
of
they
,
not
indeed
then
or
even
later
in
their
living
,
of
any
of
the
Wyman
family
except
Madeleine
,
although
they
later
,
especially
the
three
child
and
Mr.
Hersland
some
too
then
,
Mrs.
Hersland
be
weaken
then
and
less
then
in
everybody
's
living
,
come
to
know
the
other
of
they
the
two
sister
Louise
and
Helen
and
the
brother
Frank
very
well
in
their
later
living
.
they
never
however
any
one
of
they
,
the
three
Hersland
child
come
to
any
realisation
of
they
until
later
they
remember
they
and
reconstruct
they
and
realise
they
and
then
reconstruct
and
realise
the
foreign
parent
from
a
reconstruction
from
their
reconstructed
child
.
every
one
have
then
when
they
know
they
an
impression
that
the
daughter
Louise
know
then
what
kind
of
woman
her
mother
the
old
foreign
woman
be
and
what
a
kind
of
a
man
she
have
as
a
husband
but
no
one
ever
know
how
they
come
to
have
this
feeling
that
this
Louise
have
such
a
knowledge
of
they
,
that
she
have
such
understanding
.
this
be
now
a
history
of
the
Wyman
family
and
the
living
and
the

each
one
of

the
mother
and
the
father
,
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Wyman
be
not
so
old
then
as
they
seem
to
be
to
every
one
who
know
they
then
.
they
be
very
foreign
,
that
make
they
then
with
grow
up
child
a
very
old
man
and
a
very
old
woman
.
they
be
not
so
very
old
then
for
they
live
a
long
time
after
,
long
than
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Hersland
who
be
young
then
to
they
.
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Wyman
be
old
then
to
every
one
and
mostly
no
one
know
much
about
they
.
they
be
foreign
now
in
one
's
later
live
by
remember
their
child
one
can
reconstruct
they
and
know
what
they
be
then
.
Mr.
Wyman
then
have
a
nature
in
he
a
dependent
independent
earthy
instrument
nature
in
he
and
all
be
be
vague
in
he
,
Mrs.
Wyman
have
independent
dependent
being
and
it
be
concentrated
being
but
not
very
efficient
being
,
it
be
enough
to
make
some
attack
in
her
being
,
it
be
enough
to
make
such
attack
pretty
persistent
and
sometimes
insinuate
,
rarely
win
but
very
often
annoying
.
she
be
not
efficient
in
her
being
but
she
be
fairly
insistent
in
attack
,
sometimes
insinuate
almost
hypocritical
in
her
kind
of
attack
but
on
the
whole
not
very
efficient
in
her
living
,
on
the
whole
not
very
often
win
.
she
could
be
persistent
,
insinuate
,
and
annoying
.
she
have
some
winning
in
persist
with
Mrs.
Hersland
,
her
daughter
for
six
month
have
double
wage
give
to
she
and
a
new
dress
make
by
Mabel
Linker
and
Mary
Maxworthing
and
then
after
all
she
get
her
daughter
to
leave
the
Herslands
so
that
later
she
would
marry
John
Summer
.
but
all
this
be
not
really
win
,
for
Madeleine
always
intend
to
marry
John
Summer
and
Summer
always
intend
to
marry
she
,
so
really
all
that
Mrs.
Wyman
have
as
win
in
she
be
to
be
annoying
to
Mrs.
Hersland
and
to
give
to
she
a
sense
of
struggle
,
and
to
have
have
her
daughter
Madeleine
get
for
six
month
more
money
then
she
be
earn
and
a
dress
make
by
Mabel
Linker
and
Mary
Maxworthing
.
as
I
be
say
Mr.
Wyman
have
earthy
dependent
independent
instrument
nature
.
he
be
very
vague
in
his
nature
.
his
son
Frank
be
like
he
.
Madeleine
in
efficiency
be
like
her
mother
,
in
her
kind
of
nature
like
her
father
.
Louise
be
like
her
mother
altogether
except
that
there
be
less
to
her
nature
,
less
insinuate
attack
in
her
being
.
later
there
will
be
a
history
of
she
.
she
have
some
connection
,
to
those
who
know
she
,
with
her
father
and
her
mother
.
the
son
Frank
be
vague
like
his
father
and
like
he
in
his
nature
,
only
he
be
young
and
have
more
beginning
in
he
and
more
chance
of
later
keeping
go
than
his
father
have
have
who
be
foreign
.
Helen
be
even
more
spread
and
vague
than
her
father
ever
have
be
,
with
her
mother
's
nature
in
she
.
later
in
her
live
queer
thing
happen
to
she
.
there
be
always
then
repeat
,
there
be
always
then
in
every
one
begin
and
end
,
there
be
always
then
in
every
one
stupid
being
,
there
be
always
then
sometime
some
one
to
every
one
who
ever
be
or
be
or
will
be
live
who
know
the
being
in
that
one
.
there
be
then
once
a
whole
family
of
they
the
Wyman
family
,
the
six
of
they
,
Mrs.
Wyman
and
Mr.
Wyman
and
Madeleine
and
Louise
and
Frank
and
Helen
Wyman
.
there
be
always
then
sometime
some
one
who
have
it
in
they
to
envisage
the
whole
life
and
being
of
every
one
.
this
be
now
then
one
who
remembering
can
reconstruct
the
being
in
Madeleine
and
Louise
and
Frank
and
Helen
and
from
they
can
reconstruct
the
being
in
Mrs.
Wyman
and
Mr.
Wyman
and
so
now
there
be
a
history
of
they
.
there
be
always
then
as
I
be
say
some
one
to
know
the
being
in
every
one
.
mostly
every
one
know
the
being
in
some
one
,
some
in
many
other
around
they
,
some
not
in
any
one
.
there
be
then
many
way
of
know
be
in
other
people
and
this
reconstruction
be
one
of
they
.
there
will
be
now
then
a
history
of
the
Wyman
family
,
of
all
six
of
they
.




as
I
be
say
Mrs.
Hersland
never
have
any
real
connection
with
they
,
any
real
feeling
about
any
one
of
they
except
Madeleine
.
Mr.
Hersland
have
less
understanding
,
less
connection
with
her
being
,
the
Hersland
child
have
their
connection
with
she
mostly
from
remembering
,
from
their
sore
feeling
that
their
parent
's
early
living
have
be
cut
away
from
they
,
not
that
any
one
of
the
three
of
they
have
a
tender
feeling
for
their
parent
's
early
living
,
it
be
only
that
it
be
part
of
their
exist
and
not
something
for
a
stranger
to
be
own
.
Mrs.
Hersland
then
of
all
the
Hersland
family
have
the
most
personal
relation
to
Madeleine
Wyman
,
Mr.
Hersland
as
I
be
say
like
to
talk
to
she
like
her
intelligence
and
her
trim
neat
figure
,
like
the
way
she
listen
when
he
talk
,
and
the
way
she
be
ready
to
carry
out
idea
he
explain
to
she
,
to
the
three
child
then
she
be
mostly
then
a
governess
to
be
in
the
house
with
they
.
each
of
they
have
a
different
feeling
about
she
then
and
that
will
be
clear
in
the
history
of
each
one
of
they
.
they
be
all
three
then
as
I
be
say
more
of
they
then
the
poor
people
live
in
small
house
near
they
than
they
be
of
their
mother
's
or
their
father
's
living
then
,
than
they
be
of
rich
country
house
live
with
a
governess
in
the
house
with
they
.
what
each
one
of
they
feel
in
their
be
then
about
this
governess
live
with
they
will
come
out
later
in
the
history
of
each
one
of
they
.
in
their
later
early
living
they
come
to
know
more
of
the
three
other
Louise
and
Frank
and
Helen
.
Madeleine
have
be
marry
then
to
John
Summer
,
the
three
Hersland
child
never
know
very
certainly
what
then
to
call
he
or
she
.
they
then
call
Louise
and
Frank
and
Helen
by
their
first
name
but
they
never
be
at
ease
then
about
what
they
should
call
John
Summer
or
Madeleine
.
they
never
to
the
end
feel
very
certain
what
be
the
right
thing
to
call
they
.
but
this
be
all
later
history
,
the
being
in
Louise
and
Frank
and
Helen
be
all
later
history
,
no
one
then
in
the
Hersland
family
know
they
,
later
the
three
Hersland
child
know
they
,
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Hersland
never
know
much
of
the
brother

,
her
marry
John
Summer
be
to
Mrs.

there
be
some
connection
between

sometimes
and
then

when

go
to
live
with
her
sister
and
her
brother
,
and
mother
who
be
not
dead
yet
then
.
sometime
there
will
be
a
complete
history
of
Madeleine
Wyman
's
married
living
,
it
will
be
very
interesting
.
sometime
there
will
be
then
a
complete
history
of
her
being
and
her
living
and
the
living
and
being
of
all
six
of
they
,
the
Wyman
family
.
this
will
be
such
a
history
in
the
long
history
of
each
one
of
the
three
Hersland
child
.
now
there
be
to
be
only
a
little
suggesting
of
the
being
in
each
one
.
now
Madeleine
have
just
come
to
be
a
governess
to
the
Hersland
family
to
live
with
they
in
that
part
of
Gossols
where
no
rich
people
be
live
.




Madeleine
Wyman
have
have
a
pretty
good
education
.
she
know
french
and
german
,
not
as
the
first
governess
the
Herslands
have
had
know
they
,
but
well
enough
to
teach
they
.
she
be
not
a
musician
but
she
know
enough
music
to
oversee
the
Hersland
child
's
practising
,
she
know
enough
music
to
teach
music
when
there
be
music
lesson
to
be
give
.
she
have
a
good
enough
english
education
,
she
have
a
good
enough
american
governess
training
.
she
and
her
young
sister
Helen
be
the
only
one
of
her
family
who
have
have
much
education
.
Helen
be
more
modern
than
Madeleine
in
her
feeling
.
she
be
more
modern
in
use
her
education
in
her
living
and
in
her
feeling
,
later
when
Helen
Wyman
come
to
know
the
Hersland
young
people
she
be
more
of
they
than
any
of
her
family
have
be
for
she
be
more
modern
,
not
more
american
perhaps
but
really
more
modern
,
anyway
more
of
they
,
the
Hersland
child
then
at
the
ending
of
their
first
beginning
live
,
than
Madeleine
or
Louise
or
Frank
even
ever
be
of
their
generation
.
they
have
not
many
friend
then
the
Wyman
family
.
Frank
and
Helen
Wyman
be
the
first
of
their
family
to
have
friend
of
people
around
they
.
the
other
of
the
Wyman
family
have
never
be
of
any
generation
and
so
they
have
not
friend
of
any
of
they
who
be
of
their
generation
.




there
be
then
in
the
Wyman
family
,
six
of
they
;
the
mother
and
father
and
Madeleine
and
Louise
and
Frank
and
Helen
.
the
mother
Mrs.
Wyman
have
her
nature
in
she
.
the
second
daughter
Louise
and
the
young
daughter
Helen
be
of
she
.
the
father
Mr.
Wyman
have
his
nature
,
the
son
Frank
and
the
eld
daughter
Madeleine
be
of
this
nature
.




the
young
daughter
Helen
be
all
spread
and
all
vague
in
her
nature
.
she
have
a
good
education
for
she
be
interested
in
study
,
she
be
almost
interested
in
writing
.
she
be
not
so
much
interested
in
teaching
but
teaching
be
to
be
her
occupation
.
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
never
do
much
teaching
.
she
do
a
little
teaching
but
somehow
the
Wyman
family
always
manage
to
have
enough
money
to
go
on
living
,
the
father
with
his
book
-
keeping
,
the
daughter
Madeleine
first
with
governessing
and
then
with
marry
a
rich
man
always
could
help
they
,
later
,
much
later
,
after
try
many
thing
Frank
Wyman
become
a
nurseryman
and
with
Louise
to
help
he
and
much
later
with
Madeleine
to
help
he
he
always
keep
go
,
he
even
take
to
marry
and
have
child
and
with
plenty
of
help
around
he
he
always
manage
to
keep
go
.
so
as
I
be
say
Helen
really
never
do
much
teaching
although
this
be
intend
to
be
her
occupation
.
there
be
no
opening
then
for
a
girl
like
Helen
except
teach
,
as
I
be
say
she
be
almost
interested
in
writing
but
this
be
never
active
enough
inside
she
to
start
she
go
,
just
active
enough
inside
she
to
make
she
more
modern
than
her
sister
Madeleine
who
be
the
other
one
in
the
family
who
have
have
education
.
so
then
Helen
be
all
spread
and
all
vague
in
her
independent
dependent
nature
,
but
people
who
know
she
have
a
friendly
feeling
for
she
.
she
be
more
of
they
the
people
who
come
to
know
they
the
Wyman
family
,
than
any
other
one
of
they
.
the
son
Frank
be
in
that
respect
a
little
like
she
.
the
two
young
then
Frank
and
Helen
be
more
of
their
generation
than
Louise
and
Madeleine
ever
have
be
of
the
generation
around
they
.
so
then
Helen
have
vagueness
in
she
like
her
father
,
she
be
spread
out
more
inside
she
than
any
other
of
the
Wyman
family
,
she
have
independent
dependent
be
in
she
,
it
be
mostly
as
dependent
be
in
she
,
it
be
all
spread
and
all
vague
in
she
this
be
in
she
.
as
I
be
say
she
never
do
much
teaching
though
this
be
to
be
the
end
of
her
education
.
as
I
be
say
she
come
almost
to
the
point
of
be
interested
in
write
but
it
remain
as
vague
and
spread
out
as
her
being
,
it
never
come
to
any
thing
.
later
there
be
marry
in
her
living
and
that
be
a
very
strange
proceeding
.
later
in
the
history
of
the
Hersland
child
there
will
be
a
history
of
the
marrying
of
Helen
which
as
I
be
say
be
a
very
strange
proceeding
.




Mrs.
Wyman
then
have
her
nature
in
she
.
the
second
daughter
Louise
and
the
young
daughter
Helen
be
of
she
.
the
father
Mr.
Wyman
have
his
nature
,
the
son
Frank
and
the
eld
daughter
Madeleine
be
of
this
nature
.




the
young
daughter
Helen
be
all
spread
and
all
vague
in
her
nature
.




the
second
daughter
Louise
be
almost
as
concentrated
as
her
mother
but
there
be
less
to
her
nature
.
there
be
about
as
much
efficient
live
in
she
but
there
be
not
any
insinuate
attack
,
her
attack
be
more
a
steady
pushing
.
it
come
to
about
the
same
thing
as
efficient
being
,
it
make
she
less
interesting
,
less
menacing
,
more
agreeable
to
be
know
.
it
come
to
about
the
same
amount
of
efficiency
in
her
nature
as
her
mother
have
in
she
and
more
than
that
in
any
of
the
rest
of
the
Wyman
family
.




the
important
thing
in
her
living
be
the
marrying
,
first
of
Madeleine
,
later
the
strange
marrying
of
Helen
and
then
the
taking
charge
of
she
,
later
the
help
her
brother
in
his
business
of
nurseryman
;
the
keep
everything
go
in
the
later
Wyman
live
when
old
Mrs.
Wyman
's
method
have
no
more
efficiency
for
their
living
.
and
so
she
succeed
to
her
mother
's
living
,
she
never
be
marry
,
she
never
bear
child
,
as
I
be
say
she
be
of
her
mother
's
being
but
there
be
less
to
her
nature
,
there
be
less
variety
in
she
when
she
be
young
,
when
she
be
in
her
middle
living
,
when
she
be
old
.
there
be
less
variety
to
she
,
there
be
no
insinuating
attack
to
she
,
there
be
steady
shoving
in
she
that
make
up
in
she
for
any
less
active
attack
there
be
in
she
than
there
be
in
her
mother
.
she
be
a
dry
person
than
her
mother
.
there
be
very
little
change
in
she
,
she
always
have
much
the
same
being
in
she
.
her
be
part
of
the
mother
and
father
's
being
,
that
which
every
one
who
know
she
feel
in
she
be
never
important
to
she
.
to
herself
inside
she
she
be
not
more
part
of
her
mother
and
father
than
be
her
sister
and
her
brother
.
to
herself
she
be
part
of
the
living
of
her
sister
and
her
brother
,
that
be
important
be
in
she
,
be
part
of
the
being
of
her
mother
and
father
be
not
important
be
to
she
.
she
do
not
know
it
in
she
that
she
be
nearer
they
than
be
her
sister
and
her
brother
.
if
she
have
know
it
she
would
not
have
like
it
inside
she
.
important
be
in
she
to
herself
inside
she
be
be
part
of
the
living
and
the
being
of
her
sister
and
her
brother
.
it
be
the
marrying
of
her
sister
and
the
business
of
her
brother
that
be
important
to
she
not
the
being
and
the
living
in
her
father
and
her
mother
.
she
be
to
herself
then
strongly
of
the
being
of
her
sister
and
her
brother
.
her
father
and
her
mother
be
not
to
she
very
important
inside
she
.
later
then
in
the
history
of
her
sister
and
her
brother
,
in
the
description
of
her
mother
and
her
father
there
will
be
more
history
of
she
.




the
son
Frank
be
almost
as
vague
in
his
nature
as
his
father
.




he
be
tall
then
and
have
a
long
head
and
thick
hair
and
at
that
time
he
have
mild
humor
in
he
.
he
could
make
joke
at
child
,
give
he
time
he
could
make
joke
at
girl
and
at
woman
.
he
be
not
slow
but
he
be
not
very
decide
inside
he
.
he
be
vague
inside
he
as
his
father
be
inside
he
but
he
be
young
then
and
pleasanter
,
he
be
blonder
,
and
milder
in
manner
than
his
father
,
but
his
father
be
much
old
and
have
dry
down
and
he
be
not
really
quick
it
be
only
that
there
be
a
tender
youthful
being
in
the
son
that
throw
over
he
a
glamor
of
be
slow
and
pleasanter
than
his
father
.
the
father
be
dark
and
dry
and
seem
to
be
quick
.
really
they
have
about
the
same
nature
,
the
two
of
they
,
neither
of
they
have
an
efficient
nature
.
the
son
have
an
easy
life
because
he
have
his
sister
,
and
his
wife
,
later
.
when
he
marry
she
she
be
not
strong
in
her
nature
than
he
be
in
his
nature
,
but
he
have
the
start
of
she
by
have
his
sister
around
she
.
he
always
all
through
his
living
be
tall
and
slow
and
pleasant
and
mildly
joke
and
not
lazy
and
not
active
either
and
there
be
always
the
appearance
as
if
his
woman
,
Louise
and
Madeleine
and
his
wife
and
Helen
be
hold
he
up
so
that
he
would
keep
on
stand
.
his
mother
have
never
do
this
for
he
.
while
she
be
direct
the
family
he
have
be
drift
.
he
have
try
one
way
of
earn
a
living
and
then
another
way
and
then
nothing
.
it
be
not
till
later
that
he
become
a
nurseryman
with
woman
around
he
to
support
he
.
so
Frank
have
a
pleasant
enough
life
all
his
living
and
successful
enough
life
in
his
living
.
he
and
his
father
,
as
I
be
say
,
be
both
of
they
alike
in
this
nature
.
they
both
have
resistance
enough
to
keep
go
,
the
father
in
his
book
-
keeping
,
with
a
wife
and
family
around
he
that
he
feel
only
enough
to
awaken
in
he
some
resist
;
the
son
with
enough
resistance
in
he
to
have
his
woman
keep
on
hold
he
up
while
he
pleasantly
and
vaguely
keep
on
live
.
this
then
be
a
history
of
the
two
of
they
.
sometime
perhaps
there
will
be
more
understanding
of
the
nature
in
the
two
of
they
.




the
mother
Mrs.
Wyman
have
her
nature
in
she
.
the
second
daughter
Louise
and
the
young
daughter
Helen
be
of
she
.
the
father
Mr.
Wyman
have
his
nature
.
the
son
Frank
and
the
eld
daughter
Madeleine
be
of
this
nature
.
in
the
eld
daughter
the
nature
of
the
father
be
more
concentrated
to
make
she
.
it
do
not
make
she
really
an
efficient
nature
.
she
really
have
resistance
in
she
.




Madeleine
Wyman
have
have
a
pretty
good
education
.
she
know
french
and
german
well
enough
to
teach
they
.
she
know
enough
music
to
teach
music
when
there
be
music
lesson
to
be
give
.
she
have
have
a
good
enough
education
.
she
have
intelligence
to
listen
with
understanding
to
Mr.
Hersland
's
talk
.
she
have
a
kind
of
interest
in
his
theory
of
education
.
she
try
to
put
they
into
execution
.
this
be
now
a
little
description
of
they
.




she
be
then
different
from
the
first
governess
who
be
a
real
european
governess
and
a
musician
,
she
be
different
from
the
second
governess
who
have
know
nothing
.
she
come
to
the
Herslands
in
answer
to
an
advertisement
and
Mr.
Hersland
have
be
pleased
with
she
.
the
three
Hersland
child
then
be
have
their
regular
public
school
living
,
they
have
then
all
the
feeling
of
country
child
.
they
have
too
then
every
kind
of
fancy
education
anything
that
their
father
could
think
would
be
good
for
they
.




the
third
governess
be
really
then
only
to
keep
they
up
in
music
practise
and
a
little
in
french
and
german
,
mostly
then
just
to
be
in
the
house
with
they
.
Mr.
Hersland
be
just
then
decide
that
what
the
child
need
be
to
be
keep
go
and
Madeleine
Wyman
have
enough
education
in
every
direction
to
keep
they
go
.
then
too
,
they
all
of
they
have
the
feeling
of
need
a
governess
in
the
house
with
they
.
Mrs.
Hersland
like
she
,
Mr.
Hersland
take
less
interest
in
engage
she
than
he
have
with
the
first
or
second
one
.
she
come
then
to
be
a
governess
to
they
because
they
still
have
a
feeling
that
the
child
ought
to
have
some
one
and
Mrs.
Hersland
like
she
and
Mr.
Hersland
have
not
much
interest
just
then
in
education
.
soon
though
he
begin
to
talk
to
she
about
what
he
want
she
to
do
for
each
one
of
the
three
of
they
and
what
he
think
be
the
right
kind
of
education
for
child
and
the
difference
between
european
and
american
education
.




as
I
be
say
Madeleine
be
like
her
father
in
her
nature
but
this
be
much
more
concentrated
in
she
than
it
be
in
her
father
or
her
brother
,
it
be
almost
as
concentrated
as
their
kind
of
nature
be
in
her
mother
and
her
sister
Louise
.
it
do
not
make
she
a
really
efficient
nature
but
it
give
real
resistance
inside
she
and
it
give
she
a
certain
power
with
those
whose
idea
she
try
to
realise
for
they
.
this
be
the
case
with
Mr.
Hersland
.
it
give
her
power
when
she
be
part
of
some
one
's
live
as
with
Mrs.
Hersland
.
it
do
not
give
her
power
in
teaching
because
in
educate
she
try
attack
and
with
this
,
for
she
,
there
be
no
succeed
so
she
have
never
any
real
power
with
any
one
of
the
three
child
.




later
she
be
married
to
John
Summer
.
later
they
have
for
a
little
while
an
adopted
daughter
.
Madeleine
have
not
want
she
,
it
be
Summer
who
very
much
want
child
and
do
not
seem
to
be
able
to
have
any
of
his
own
who
insist
upon
choose
and
adopt
one
.
they
do
not
keep
she
long
for
soon
they
take
to
travelling
and
Madeleine
have
not
want
to
have
she
and
so
they
send
she
back
to
the
home
from
where
they
have
get
she
.
Madeleine
as
I
be
say
have
not
really
an
efficient
nature
,
she
have
not
much
influence
on
any
one
near
she
.
she
have
none
on
the
adopt
child
although
she
nag
she
as
her
mother
have
do
when
she
have
bring
up
her
child
,
but
it
be
as
attack
in
Madeleine
for
she
have
not
want
the
child
with
she
.
and
so
what
strength
be
in
she
be
in
live
in
other
people
's
life
,
not
in
attack
or
even
really
in
resist
.
with
her
husband
she
have
no
influence
,
for
she
have
not
a
feeling
of
live
in
he
as
she
have
with
Mrs.
Hersland
and
with
Mr.
David
Hersland
,
and
Mrs.
Hersland
's
early
living
,
with
her
husband
she
be
a
good
enough
woman
,
a
wife
to
travel
with
he
,
to
induce
he
to
give
up
business
and
to
take
to
travel
,
but
she
have
no
influence
with
he
in
the
thing
that
be
his
living
,
his
idea
of
eat
,
of
doctoring
,
of
wear
warm
clothing
.
he
be
a
man
who
have
these
thing
in
he
as
a
sad
religion
.
later
he
die
for
they
.
later
there
will
be
much
history
of
he
,
and
his
doctoring
,
and
later
his
dying
,
and
always
his
strong
feeling
for
way
of
eat
,
for
way
of
doctoring
,
for
way
of
digesting
.
Madeleine
then
could
keep
he
travel
,
she
could
induce
he
to
quit
business
living
,
she
could
make
it
that
the
adopt
child
no
long
live
with
they
,
she
have
really
have
no
power
in
he
,
she
have
really
no
efficient
being
.
she
have
it
in
she
later
to
give
a
sore
feeling
to
the
Hersland
child
by
to
they
own
the
father
and
the
mother
.
early
when
she
be
a
governess
to
they
Martha
sometimes
have
have
a
little
feeling
against
she
when
Madeleine
try
to
carry
out
Mr.
Hersland
's
theory
of
education
.
the
Hersland
child
be
not
accustomed
to
have
any
one
really
try
to
be
systematic
in
such
realisation
,
they
be
accustomed
to
have
only
the
pleasant
new
beginning
of
new
way
of
learning
and
of
out
of
door
live
.
as
I
say
Martha
and
sometimes
a
little
David
do
not
like
her
way
of
interfere
with
they
,
Alfred
have
not
any
such
reason
for
a
feeling
for
he
be
old
than
David
,
and
a
boy
,
not
a
girl
like
Martha
,
and
so
Madeleine
have
nothing
really
to
do
with
he
,
Martha
then
,
and
a
little
David
then
,
do
not
like
her
way
of
interfere
with
they
,
then
they
have
no
feeling
about
she
be
with
their
father
and
their
mother
,
they
really
never
care
very
much
then
about
anything
go
on
in
the
house
with
they
.
they
be
then
all
three
of
they
,
the
Hersland
child
,
more
of
they
,
the
poor
people
who
live
in
the
small
house
near
they
than
they
be
of
their
father
's
or
their
mother
's
living
then
.
Mr.
Hersland
's
living
just
then
be
the
beginning
of
the
middle
living
in
his
great
fortune
,
the
beginning
of
a
struggling
to
resist
a
beginning
of
an
ending
to
his
fortune
.
the
beginning
of
resist
be
just
then
dimly
begin
in
he
,
he
have
not
just
then
such
a
keen
feeling
about
education
.
he
talk
to
Madeleine
Wyman
then
about
his
theory
of
education
but
they
be
not
then
so
live
in
he
as
they
have
be
.
she
try
to
realise
they
for
he
,
that
to
the
child
be
interfere
,
that
,
to
he
,
be
not
really
interesting
.
he
take
less
and
less
interest
in
the
child
just
then
except
when
they
come
up
against
he
.
that
be
then
their
only
exist
,
for
he
.
Madeleine
be
conscientious
in
try
to
realise
the
idea
she
know
he
have
in
he
.
this
as
I
be
say
be
to
Martha
and
a
little
to
young
David
,
interfere
.
later
Madeleine
have
her
own
trouble
in
she
and
the
child
then
go
on
with
their
living
as
be
natural
to
they
,
have
their
regular
public
school
living
,
have
all
the
feeling
of
country
child
,
have
various
kind
of
fancy
education
and
outdoor
living
,
be
of
they
the
poor
people
near
they
.




Mrs.
Hersland
then
have
in
she
her
time
of
be
most
herself
to
herself
in
her
feeling
.
her
important
being
be
then
exist
from
Madeleine
Wyman
's
living
in
her
being
,
be
in
her
early
living
,
later
need
protection
against
her
parent
'
nagging
,
need
to
be
hold
against
they
by
extra
wage
which
Mrs.
Hersland
induce
Mr.
Hersland
to
give
she
and
a
dress
make
by
Mary
Maxworthing
and
Mabel
Linker
.




later
then
there
will
be
more
description
of
Mr.
Hersland
and
his
idea
on
education
,
later
then
in
the
history
of
each
one
of
the
Hersland
child
there
will
be
a
description
of
Madeleine
Wyman
's
effort
to
realise
Mr.
Hersland
's
idea
of
education
.
now
there

.
be
part
of
they
be
her
be
with

.
she
be
of
they
as
if
they
be
still
a
physical
part
of
she
.
later
they
be
big
around
she
and
she
be
lose
among
they
and
she
have
weaken
inside
she
.
now
they
be
really
not
of
she
,
they
be
more
of
they
the
poor
people
around
they
than
they
be
of
their
mother
's
living
then
,
though
they
be
to
she
all
there
ever
be
of
be
in
she
.
now
her
living
be
Madeleine
Wyman
's
living
in
she
and
later
,
she
and
Madeleine
resist
to
the
old
Wyman
's
,
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Wyman
's
trying
,
by
attack
.
as
I
be
say
attack
be
in
Mrs.
Hersland
stupid
be
.
as
I
be
say
this
be
in
she
in
her
resist
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Wyman
.
this
be
in
she
sometimes
with
servant
girl
and
their
leaving
,
as
I
be
say
early
.
it
be
in
she
most
in
her
defend
Madeleine
Wyman
against
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Wyman
be
try
to
make
Madeleine
leave
she
.




Madeleine
Wyman
then
as
I
be
say
have
come
to
be
governess
to
the
Herslands
because
a
governess
in
the
house
with
they
have
come
to
be
a
habit
in
the
family
live
.
they
have
have
two
of
they
,
the
first
have
leave
they
to
leave
America
,
the
second
have
marry
,
and
now
it
be
natural
to
have
a
third
one
.
this
third
one
be
the
first
one
who
be
really
important
to
Mrs.
Hersland
.
Mr.
Hersland
find
some
important
being
in
all
three
of
they
,
they
be
like
everything
around
he
,
part
of
he
,
part
of
the
world
around
he
,
part
of
the
beginning
always
in
he
.
the
second
one
have
make
more
impression
on
he
,
she
be
a
healthy
woman
,
he
like
to
have
a
feeling
of
have
she
in
the
house
with
they
.
the
first
one
have
be
mostly
an
ideal
to
he
.
the
last
one
Madeleine
,
be
pleasant
to
have
listen
to
he
,
she
have
a
neat
figure
,
she
be
intelligent
in
listen
,
he
have
less
active
impression
from
she
than
he
have
from
the
one
before
she
.
none
of
they
then
,
the
first
or
second
or
third
governess
be
really
important
then
to
the
three
Hersland
child
,
they
have
existence
for
they
,
sometimes
they
interfere
with
they
,
sometimes
they
be
pleasant
to
have
in
the
house
with
they
,
but
mostly
they
be
not
then
any
one
of
the
three
of
they
very
important
to
the
three
child
.
later
this
will
come
clear
,
later
in
the
long
history
of
each
one
of
the
three
Hersland
child
which
will
now
soon
be
commence
.
first
there
will
be
a
long
history
of
Martha
,
then
of
Alfred
,
and
then
of
young
David
,
and
of
all
of
they
together
and
of
every
one
who
ever
come
to
know
they
.
before
then
there
must
be
some
more
history
of
Mrs.
Hersland
and
the
important
feeling
in
she
that
come
to
she
from
have
Madeleine
Wyman
as
governess
in
the
house
with
she
.




Mrs.
Hersland
as
I
be
say
have
in
she
then
completely
in
she
be
the
feeling
of
rich
country
house
live
,
with
servant
and
a
governess
and
a
seamstress
in
the
house
with
they
and
not
cut
off
from
right
rich
living
,
although
really
do
very
little
visit
.
to
herself
then
,
she
and
her
husband
and
her
child
be
part
of
right
rich
being
,
not
do
much
visit
,
not
need
to
see
much
of
rich
people
but
always
of
they
.
to
herself
she
be
cut
off
from
her
family
being
and
from
accustomed
living
,
to

the
other

be
to

lead
rich
country
house
live
,
it
be
a
natural
living
to
her

be
all
of
her
middle
living
,
it
be
all
her
important
living
and
her
child
's
being
,
it
be
the
natural
living
to
she
,
to
herself
then
she
be
lead
rich
right
living
,
to
herself
then
she
be
cut
off
from
her

,
from
eastern
travelling
.
Madeleine
Wyman
then
live
in
Mrs.
Hersland
's
feeling
.




in
Mr.
Hersland
,
his
early
living
be
not
,
then
in
his
middle
living
,
in
he
,
in
his
feeling
.
it
be
in
he
as
part
of
he
,
it
come
out
of
he
sometimes
in
talk
,
it
be
not
in
he
then
in
his
middle
living
nor
in
his
later
living
,
it
be
not
in
he
then
in
his
feeling
.
it
be
not
important
to
he
except
as
so
much
talk
come
out
of
he
.
that
be
all
the
meaning
his
early
living
have
in
he
to
he
and
to
every
one
who
know
he
.
even
to
Madeleine
Wyman
who
live
in
the
early
living
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Hersland
it
be
not
as
Mr.
Hersland
's
early
living
that
it
be
important
to
her
being
,
it
be
as
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Hersland
's
early
living
that
it
make
its
impression
.
as
I
be
say
it
be
a
different
matter
to
Mrs.
Hersland
who
be
to
herself
cut
off
from
her
family
live
.
to
Mr.
Hersland
eastern
living
be
a
past
part
of
he
,
it
be
in
he
as
be
little
as
a
baby
or
a
child
be
in
he
,
it
be
not
something
still
exist
cut
off
from
he
,
it
be
part
of
he
and
not
in
his
feeling
.
he
have
in
he
in
his
feeling
,
his
beginning
,
his
have
it
in
he
to
be
as
big
as
all
the
world
around
he
.
in
Mrs.
Hersland
then
it
be
a
different
thing
,
her
early
living
be
a
continuous
living
that
be
go
on
then
and
she
be
cutoff
from
it
,
to
her
feeling
.
when
she
later
go
to
visit
they
her
family
who
be
still
live
in
Bridgepoint
in
their
natural
way
of
living
,
she
be
still
then
cut
off
from
they
,
she
be
of
they
but
a
princess
to
they
,
she
be
of
they
but
a
stranger
to
they
with
a
husband
and
child
who
have
not
in
any
way
any
connection
with
they
,
she
be
of
they
but
cut
off
from
they
by
her
Gossols
live
which
be
a
different
way
of
be
though
it
be
not
a
living
that
to
herself
be
cut
off
from
rich
right
being
.




Madeleine
Wyman
then
have
in
she
the
feeling
of
the
early
living
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Hersland
and
this
all
her
later
life
be
an
important
part
of
her
being
and
her
feeling
.
she
have
this
in
she
always
as
a
possession
,
she
have
it
in
she
more
than
Mr.
or
Mrs.
Hersland
have
it
in
they
,
she
have
it
in
she
as
much
as
Mrs.
Hersland
have
it
in
she
talk
,
she
have
it
in
she
more
than
Mrs.
Hersland
have
it
as
a
feeling
,
she
have
it
in
she
give
to
Mrs.
Hersland
her
important
feeling
of
herself
inside
she
.
Mrs.
Hersland
could
never
have
have
this
in
she
from
her
own
feeling
,
from
her
own
talking
of
her
early
living
,
she
would
only
have
it
in
she
from
Madeleine
Wyman
have
this
as
a
possession
.




it
be
clear
then
,
Mr.
Hersland
have
not
in
he
any
feeling
of
his
early
living
,
it
be
part
of
he
because
it
have
happen
to
he
,
it
come
out
of
he
sometimes
as
brag
,
sometimes
as
illustration
,
sometimes
as
moralise
,
but
it
be
not
really
ever
then
in
he
in
his
middle
or
in
his
later
living
as
feeling
.
it
be
in
he
only
as
having
happen
to
he
.




it
be
clear
then
that
Mrs.
Hersland
have
in
her
early
living
in
she
as
something
that
be
in
she
,
in
her
middle

,
as
part
of
her
feeling

.
to
herself
in
her
feeling
she
be
never
cut
off
from
right
rich
living
,
really
she
be
then
not
at
all
of
such
living
,
later
when
she
meet
any
of
such
of
they
she
be
cut
off
from
they
,
to
herself
then
it
be
not
that
she
be
cut
off
from
right
rich
living
,
to
herself
then
it
be
a
little
then
that
she
be
cut
off
from
her
family
living
and
eastern

and
visit
.
this
be
strong
in
she
from
Madeleine

.

,
her
country
house
living

be
important
be
in

.
Mrs.

's
early
living
and
her
early
live
with
her
husband
sometimes
come
out
of
she
as
talk
,
very
often
,
to
Madeleine
Wyman
in
the
house
with
she
.
it
be
very
different
in
the
two
of
they
,
in
Mr.

in
Mrs.
Hersland
.




as

out
of
he
,
sometimes
as
brag
,
sometimes
as
illustration
,
sometimes
as
moralise
,
sometimes
as
just
talk
,
but
it
be
not
in
he
as
feel
,
it
be
not
to
he
really
then
in
his
middle
live
an
important
part
of
his
being
.
it
be
as
I
be
say
early
live
to
he
,
it
have
no
more
meaning
than
that
in
he
.




in
Mrs.
Hersland
it
be
in
she
as
feeling
,
not
really
as
very
important
feeling
,
but
it
have
really
mean
in
she
as
feeling
.
it
come
out
of
she
in
talk
,
it
have
then
to
her
real
meaning
,
more
even
than
it
have
to
her
feeling
.




she
have
always
talk
some
about
her
early
living
,
when
she
be
live
at
the
hotel
sometimes
with
Sophie
Shilling
,
sometimes
when
she
be
visit
she
would
speak
of
eastern
living
to
other
one
in
right
rich
living
who
have
back
of
they
too
early
eastern
living
,
sometimes
she
tell
story
of
it
to
her
child
,
it
be
in
she
a
little
then
as
feeling
,
in
the
beginning
in
the
hotel
live
it
be
in
she
fairly
strongly
as
a
feeling
,
not
really
a
lonesome
feeling
,
her
child
,
her
husband
,
Sophie
Shilling
,
and
Sophie
's
sister
,
Sophie
's
mother
be
then
all
the
feeling
really
in
she
but
she
have
then
still
a
little
in
she
a
feeling
of
her
early
living
and
eastern
travelling
.
as
I
be
say
she
would
speak
then
of
it
but
it
do
not
then
make
she
even
a
little
important
to
herself
inside
she
.
this
come
to
she
later
,
this
come
to
she
when
she
tell
it
over
and
over
to
Madeleine
Wyman
who
be
live
then
the
complete
being
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Hersland
in
their
early
living
.
it
come
then
to
be
in
Mrs.
Hersland
her
feeling
of
herself
to
herself
in
her
feeling
.
this
be
not
in
she
resist
or
yield
,
it
be
not
like
she
be
with
her
husband
or
her
have
anger
in
she
or
be
a
part
of
the
child
around
she
,
it
be
in
she
like
she
be
with
the
servant
and
seamstress
and
poor
people
near
she
,
be
of
they
and
above
they
,
it
be
be
herself
inside
she
to
she
.
it
be
the
important
being
of
herself
to
herself
inside
she
it
be
not
really
the
important
being
in
she
,
important
being
in
she
really
be
herself
as
part
of
her
family
,
as
resist
to
her
husband
or
yield
in
he
,
as
be
part
of
her
child
,
as
be
part
of
rich
right
living
.




as
I
be
say
those
have
in
they
dependent
independent
being
have
in
they
resist
as
their
way
of
win
fighting
.
resist
though
be
not
their
only
way
of
fight
they
can
have
yield
win
in
they
.
resist
and
yield
then
be
not
in
they
stupid
being
.
Mrs.
Hersland
have
in
her
dependent
independent
being
.
Madeleine
Wyman
have
in
her
dependent
independent
being
.
Mrs.
Hersland
then
have
in
she
resist
and
yield
to
give
she
winning
.
Madeleine
Wyman
then
have
in
she
resist
and
yield
to
give
she
winning
.
resist
and
yield
then
in
both
of
they
be
not
stupid
be
in
they
.
attack
then
for
both
of
they
be
stupid
be
.
this
be
now
a
description
of
the
different
way
these
thing
come
out
in
they
.




there
be
as
I
be
say
two
kind
of
be
,
independent
dependent
,
dependent
independent
.
resisting
be
to
the
dependent
independent
the
natural
way
of
fighting
.
those
then
who
have
in
they
dependent
independent
being
as
the
bottom
of
they
have
resist
in
they
as
their
natural
way
of
fighting
.
many
of
they
have
very
little
fighting
in
their
living
.
this
be
true
of
both
of
they
,
Mrs.
Hersland
and
Madeleine
who
both
have
dependent
independent
nature
in
they
.




resist
fighting
be
for
these
then
who
have
dependent
independent
being
in
they
not
their
only
way
of
win
.
they
can
have
yield
and
sensitive
being
and
instrument
be
in
they
,
sometimes
for
win
just
to
keep
go
,
sometimes
for
win
to
subdue
some
one
near
they
.
Mrs.
Hersland
and
Madeleine
Wyman
be
then
for
a
while
then
closely
in
each
other
live
,
Madeleine
always
then
all
the
rest
of
her
living
be
in
she
be
in
Mrs.
Hersland
's
living
.
in
Mrs.
Hersland
later
there
be
weaken
,
she
have
never
have
Madeleine
Wyman
in
she
as
real
being
.
in
Mrs.
Hersland
,
real
being
be
rich
right
living
,
her
Bridgepoint
family
living
and
her
marrying
,
and
her
country
house
living
and
her
child
.
later
in
her
living
she
be
weaken
inside
she
,
she
be
scared
then
,
her
child
be
big
around
she
and
outside
she
,
trouble
be
come
then
,
the
country
house
living
be
end
and
often
then
Mr.
Hersland
forget
she
as
be
and
later
then
she
die
away
from
among
they
and
they
soon
,
all
of
they
then
,
lose
remember
she
among
they
.
so
then
this
be
real
be
in
she
this
be
really
be
herself
inside
she
.
this
be
a
real
history
in
she
.
her
early
living
,
later
when
she
talk
so
much
about
it
to
Madeleine
Wyman
it
be
real
in
she
but
it
be
important
to
she
then
more
than
it
really
be
as
be
in
she
.
it
be
sentimental
feeling
and
romantic
feeling
in
she
,
it
be
not
real
be
in
she
.
to
Madeleine
Wyman
,
this
early
living
of
Mrs.
Hersland
be
be
,
it
be
real
be
inside
she
,
inside
in
Madeleine
Wyman
,
it
be
not
sentimental
and
romantic
in
she
,
it
be
real
be
in
she
.
it
be
a
little
too
then
real
being
in
Mrs.
Hersland
but
in
talk
it
come
to
be
to
her
feel
more
important
than
it
be
then
in
her
being
.
this
be
the
difference
then
between
they
.
Mrs.
Hersland
then
have
a
real
being
from
her
early
living
but
it
be
not
,
later
then
,
so
important
to
her
being
or
her
feeling
as
in
her
talk
of
it
to
Madeleine
Wyman
she
make
it
come
to
be
in
her
Mrs.
Hersland
's
feeling
.
later
more
and
more
when
she
be
weaken
,
it
be
all
fainter
and
fainter
in
she
.
in
Madeleine
Wyman
,
Mrs.
Hersland
and
Mrs.
Hersland
's
early
living
be
real
being
.
it
come
to
be
always
strong
in
Madeleine
Wyman
always
more
and
more
a
part
of
her
being
,
Mrs.
Hersland
and
Mr.
Hersland
and
their
early
living
.
later
the
Hersland
child
have
a
sore
feeling
at
she
have
such
possession
.




to
begin
again
then
with
dependent
independent
nature
,
with
resist
being
,
with
sensitive
being
.
to
begin
again
then
with
dependent
independent
nature
,
with
earthy
instrument
being
,
with
little
or
much
resisting
,
with
little
or
much
yielding
,
with
little
or
much
win
.




to
begin
again
then
with
dependent
independent
nature
,
with
resist
being
,
with
sensitive

resisting
,
with
little

much
yielding
,
with
little
or
much
win
.




neither
Madeleine
Wyman
nor
Mrs.
Hersland
have
in
they
really
efficient
being
.
they
both
have
in
they
some
resist
fighting
,
some
yield
win
.
it
show
in
the
two
of
they
in
very
different
fashion
.
Madeleine
have
in
her
really
more
instrument
be
than
Mrs.
Hersland
have
in
she
.
Mrs.
Hersland
have
in
she
more
sensitive
earthy
being
than
Madeleine
Wyman
.
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
have
really
an
efficient
nature
.
they
be
very
different
from
each
other
.
Madeleine
be
dry
and
have
more
energy
in
she
,
not
enough
to
carry
she
,
to
make
for
herself
a
living
in
she
,
but
enough
to
make
she
want
to
listen
and
answer
,
and
to
carry
into
action
Mr.
Hersland
's
talk
about
education
,
enough
to
make
she
have
later
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Hersland
as
a
possession
,
enough
to
make
she
then
have
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Hersland
's
early
live
a
part
then
of
her
being
.
Mrs.
Hersland
have
enough
energy
in
she
to
be
a
mother
,
to
be
a
little
resist
to
her
husband
in
their
beginning
,
to
have
the
dignity
in
she
of
country
house
living
and
Bridgepoint
Hissen
family
being
,
she
have
her
own
be
in
she
,
her
child
be
a
part
of
she
,
she
have
a
sensitive
and
later
a
scared
weakening
be
in
she
,
she
could
have
anger
in
she
and
a
sharp
indignant
injure
feeling
,
she
have
not
instrument
be
in
she
.
later
this
will
be
clear
.
More
and
more
then
it
will
be
clear
the
difference
between
the
being
in
Madeleine
Wyman
and
in
she
.
they
both
have
in
they
dependent
independent
being
,
it
be
in
they
in
different
fashion
,
Madeleine
have
in
her
instrument
being
,
Mrs.
Hersland
have
not
in
she
such
being
,
she
have
yield
in
she
but
that
be
to
love
in
marry
,
yield
in
she
to
the
being
that
be
part
of
she
as
in
her
child
and
her
sister
and
her
brother
and
her
mother
and
her
father
.
she
have
not
instrument
nature
,
she
have
not
any
living
in
any
being
that
be
not
in
she
a
part
of
she
.
she
be
different
then
from
Madeleine
Wyman
.




neither
the
one
nor
the
other
of
they
have
in
they
really
efficient
being
.
this
come
out
more
and
more
in
they
in
their
later
living
.
this
come
out
in
they
in
their
resisting
to
the
trying
of
the
Wyman
family
when
these
want
Madeleine
to
marry
John
Summer
.




as
I
be
say
attack
in
Mrs.
Hersland
be
stupid
be
.
it
be
in
she
when
she
have
inside
her
her
feeling
of
herself
to
herself
in
she
,
when
she
be
resist
the
Wyman
family
about
Madeleine
.
in
Madeleine
,
attack
be
stupid
be
but
she
be
then
not
show
such
being
,
she
have
no
attacking
with
which
to
resist
her
family
's
try
.
stupid
be
then
be
in
she
as
attack
but
it
show
then
only
in
her
handling
of
child
.
later
she
show
it
with
her
husband
,
later
when
she
have
really
no
power
over
John
Summer
.
she
could
sometimes
stop
he
in
business
or
in
adopt
a
daughter
,
she
could
never
really
have
any
effect
inside
he
.
now
,
then
,
stupid
be
as
I
be
say
be
in
Mrs.
Hersland
's
attack
to
stop
the
Wyman
try
,
the
give
Madeleine
double
wage
and
a
dress
make
by
Mabel
Linker
and
Mary
Maxworthing
.
then
Madeleine
be
not
attack
,
be
not
have
stupid
be
except
with
the
child
in
try
to
carry
out
Mr.
Hersland
's
idea
for
they
.
mostly
then
she
have
strongly
in
her
instrument
being
.
she
be
live
in
Mrs.
Hersland
's
and
in
Mr.
Hersland
's
being
.
the
Wyman
family
then
the
mother
and
the
father
with
their
child
as
a
background
to
make
a
more
solid
seeming
,
win
out
then
with
try
,
Madeleine
go

.
she
really
have
no
objection
to

John
Summer
,

the
Hersland
family
,
she
be

to
marry
John
Summer
later
.




in
all
of
they

dependent
independent

in
they
,
there
be
resist
and
yield
and
stupid
be
as
attack
.
sometime
there
will
have
be
write
a
history
of
many
of
they
as
by
repeat
it
come
out
of
they
.
sometime
some
one
will
know
the
amount
of
resist
,
yield
and
stupid
act
there
be
in
every
one
who
ever
have
or
have
have
or
will
have
dependent
independent
being
in
they
.
some
have
less
,
some
have
more
of
one
or
the
other
of
these
thing
in
they
,
in
some
it
change
in
they
in
the
different
part
of
their
living
,
in
the
way
they
have
in
they
excitement
or
nervous
or
quiet
or
melancholy
or
happy
or
content
or
diseased
or
healthful
or
hungry
or
thirsty
or
tired
or
satisfied
be
in
they
.
Mrs.
Hersland
then
have
stupid
attack
be
mostly
in
she
when
she
be
have
important
feeling
of
herself
inside
she
with
a
servant
or
a
governess
or
a
seamstress
or
,
for
she
,
poor
people
to
arouse
it
in
she
and
to
give
to
her
indignant
and
injure
feeling
inside
she
.
this
then
be
strong
in
she
when
Madeleine
Wyman
be
with
she
,
when
she
be
make
to
herself
a
being
by
always
tell
of
her
early
living
,
when
she
be
resist
for
Madeleine
the
Wyman
family
's
trying
,
when
she
be
make
Mr.
Hersland
pay
money
for
her
attack
fighting
.
this
then
now
be
always
get
clear
.




to
begin
again
then
with
the
dependent
independent
being
in
Mrs.
Hersland
.




it
be
interesting
in
each
one
,
the
success
and
failure
,
that
one
have
in
living
.
every
one
have
their
own
nature
in
they
.
this
come
out
of
they
as
repeat
.
this
come
out
of
they
as
make
success
or
failure
in
their
living
.
Mrs.
Hersland
and
Madeleine
Wyman
have
not
in
they
either
of
they
very
efficient
being
,
they
have
not
success
or
failure
in
living
,
they
go
on
well
enough
both
of
they
from
their
beginning
to
their
ending
.
this
be
now
to
be
a
history
of
each
one
of
they
.




Mrs.
Hersland
then
have
in
her
dependent
independent
being
.
she
do
not
have
in
her
much
stupid
being
.
that
be
in
she
only
as
attack
and
that
be
in
she
sometimes
when
a
servant
or
a
seamstress
or
a
governess
or
some
one
,
live
in
a
small
house
near
they
,
do
something
that
be
to
she
not
right
for
they
to
be
do
,
when
such
a
one
be
ungrateful
or
unpleasant
to
she
.
then
she
could
have
a
sharp
angry
feeling
in
she
,
then
she
could
have
a
hurt
or
injure
,
or
hurt
and
injure
feeling
in
she
,
then
she
would
do
something
for
such
a
one
to
show
such
a
one
that
if
they
demand
something
from
she
that
it
be
not
right
that
they
should
demand
from
she
she
would
give
they
more
than
they
have
ask
of
she
.
this
be
angry
and
injure
feeling
in
she
.
as
I
be
say
this
could
be
in
she
from
a
servant
or
governess
or
seamstress
or
people
live
in
small
house
near
she
.
in
her
early
live
this
could
be
in
she
from
people
she
know
as
friend
to
she
or
of
her
family
,
she
could
then
in
her
early
living
sometimes
have
it
in
she
from
a
sister
or
a
brother
,
but
in
her
later
live
in
that
part
of
Gossols
where
no
other
rich
people
be
live
this
feeling
in
she
come
to
she
only
from
servant
or
governess
or
seamstress
or
store
-
keeper
or
dependent
in
the
small
house
near
she
.
she
could
have
then
a
feeling
of
herself
inside
she
.
this
be
in
she
as
a
gentle
dignity
in
she
,
as
have
as
a
part
of
she
her
early
living
,
her
country
house
being
,
her
husband
and
her
child
.
she
could
have
then
a
feeling
of
herself
inside
she
from
angry
or
injure
feeling
in
she
,
she
could
have
a
feeling
of
herself
inside
she
from
Madeleine
Wyman
's
have
her
Mrs.
Hersland
's
be
as
part
of
she
.
so
then
Mrs.
Hersland
have
in
she
in
live
a
sense
of
herself
inside
she
.
this
be
most
active
in
she
when
Madeleine
Wyman
be
live
in
the
house
with
she
.




slowly
there
be
build
up
a
solid
structure
of
the
two
different
kind
of
nature
.
later
any
one
who
look
at
any
one
will
see
the
nature
in
they
.
sometime
then
there
will
be
a
history
of
every
one
.
as
I
be
say
Mrs.
Hersland
and
Madeleine
Wyman
have
neither
of
they
a
very
efficient
nature
.
they
go
on
well
enough
both
of
they
from
their
beginning
to
their
ending
.
it
must
be
clear
soon
the
nature
in
the
two
of
they
and
the
difference
between
they
.
they
have
both
of
they
dependent
independent
nature
in
they
.
Madeleine
have
an
instrument
nature
and
stupid
be
as
attack
in
she
.
this
be
now
a
history
of
she
.




Mrs.
Wyman
the
mother
of
Madeleine
be
a
foreign
American
and
always
remain
very
foreign
,
not
to
herself
but
to
every
one
who
come
to
know
they
the
Wyman
family
in
their
american
living
,
Mrs.
Wyman
have
independent
dependent
nature
in
she
.
she
have
in
she
not
very
efficient
being
,
about
as
efficient
being
as
Madeleine
,
enough
to
bring
Madeleine
away
from
Mrs.
Hersland
by
she
try
,
enough
to
have
Madeleine
later
married
to
John
Summer
,
enough
to
keep
her
family
go
,
but
none
of
these
be
very
hard
thing
to
be
do
,
she
have
not
in
she
a
very
efficient
nature
.
she
have
in
she
about
the
same
efficiency
as
Madeleine
have
in
she
and
that
will
later
come
to
be
clear
.
she
have
in
she
about
the
same
efficiency
that
her
second
daughter
Louise
have
in
she
,
Mrs.

have
more
variety
to

,
as

.
the
second

and
the

in
she
as

,
she
have
less
variety
to
her
nature
,
she
have
no
liveliness
of
cringe
in
she
as
have
her
mother
,
independence
and
dependence
in
the
daughter
be
solid
substance
inside
she
,
in
the
mother
be
more
lively
and
more
cringing
and
more
attack
and
more
lively
in
their
changing
.
in
the

there
be
independent
dependent
nature
but
this

be
in
she
as
his

be
in
her
father
,
vague
and
uncertain
and
wide
,
and
without
ever
any
accentuation
.
Mrs.
Wyman
then
have
independent
dependent
nature
in

.
the
second
daughter
Louise
and
the
young

have

child
,
they
have
freedom
in
come

go
,
they
be
then
as
I
be
say
more
of
they
the
people
around
they
than
they
be
of
the
family

every

of
fancy
education

shooting
and
horse
back

have
not
any
need
then
in
live
for
a
governess
in
the
house
with
they
.
More
and
more
then
this
last
governess
become
important
in
their
mother
's
living
,
more
and
more
then
in
the
child
's
living
she
have
no
meaning
,
sometimes
she
would
be
interfere
but
mostly
she
have
not
even
so
much
importance
for
they
,
this
will
be
clear
in
the
long
history
of
each
one
of
they
.




More
and
more
then
this
last
governess
be
really
then
only
in
Mrs.
Hersland
's
living

at
moment
in
Mr.

,
but
she
be
prominent
only
in
Mrs.
Hersland
's

.
Mrs.
Hersland
and
Mr.

never
think
about
she
not
be
important
in
their

be
in

to
he
.
the
child
then
have
completely
drift
away
from
governess
training
,
they
have
then
perfect
freedom
in
living
,

they
.
this
be
the
last

in
his
later

he
be
strong
in
sensible
advice
to

so
that
there
should
not
be
any
force
from

.
then
too
she
want

be
a
history
of
every
one
.
this
be
a
sure
thing
.




now
again
to
begin
.
the
relation
of
learn
and
think
to
be
,
of
feel
to
realise
be
a
complicated
question
.
there
will
now
be
very
little
talking
of
such
way
of
be
.
as
I
be
say
some
have
it
in
they
to
have
slowly
resist
as
their
natural
way
of
be
can
have
learn
and
think
come
quickly
enough
in
they
.
this
be
then
not
bottom
be
in
they
.
it
be
bottom
be
in
some
of
such
of
they
.
this
be
very
clear
now
in
my
knowing
.
now
to
begin
again
with
it
as
tell
.




some
then
who
be
of
that
kind
of
be
who
have
slow
resist
being
as
their
way
to
wisdom
have
it
in
they
to
be
quick
in
learning
and
in
thinking
and
in
acting
.
as
I
be
say
in
some
this
be
not
of
the
bottom
nature
in
they
,
in
some
it
be
bottom
nature
in
they
for
the
slow
resist
win
bottom
to
they
be
not
put
in
in
the
making
of
they
,
in
some
it
be
in
they
but
dull
and
not
mix
in
their
living
,
in
some
it
be
not
sensitive
to
action
in
their
living
,
it
be
there
in
they
go
on
inside
they
not
connect
on
with
the
rest
of
they
.
this
be
not
just
talk
,
this
all
have
real
meaning
.
these
be
all
then
of
a
kind
of
man
and
woman
who
have
resist
be
as
the
real
wisdom
in
they
.
in
some
of
such
of
they
they
seem
to
be
win
by
act
by
attack
they
live
so
very
successfully
in
living
but
nevertheless
they
be
of
the
kind
of
they
that
have
resist
win
as
their
real
way
of
fighting
although
never
in
their
living
do
this
act
in
they
.
careful
listening
to
the
whole
of
they
always
repeat
show
this
in
they
,
what
kind
they
be
of
man
and
woman
.




to
begin
again
.
this
be
now
some
description
of
one
have
love
repeat
as
a
way
to
wisdom
,
having
slowly
resist
win
as
the
bottom
being
.
as
I
be
say
learn
in
such
a
one
and
think
about
everything
can
be
quick
enough
in
the
beginning
.




the
important
thing
then
in
know
the
bottom
nature
in
any
one
be
the
way
their
real
being
slowly
come
to
be
they
,
the
whole
of
they
come
to
be
repeat
in
they
.




as
I
be
say
some
can
have
quick
learning
and
nervous
attacking
or
one
or
the
other
in
they
with
slow
resist
be
in
they
as
their
natural
way
of
win
.
there
be
every
kind
of
mixing
.
there
be
every
degree
of
intensification
.
there
be
every
degree
of
hasten
the
resisting
into
more
rapid
realisation
.
there
be
every
degree
of
hurrying
.
in
short
there
be
all
degree
of
intensification
and
rapidity
in
motion
and
mixing
and
disguising
and
yet
the
kind
he
be
each
one
,
the
kind
she
be
each
one
,
come
to
be
clear
in
the
repeating
that
more
and
more
steadily
make
they
clear
to
any
one
look
hard
at
they
.
these
kind
then
be
exist
,
the
independent
dependent
,
the
dependent
independent
,
the
one
with
attack
as
the
way
of
win
,
the
other
with
resist
as
the
way
of
wisdom
for
they
.
I
know
then
this
be
true
of
every
one
that
each
one
be
of
one
or
the
other
kind
of
these
two
kind
of
they
.
I
know
it
be
in
they
,
I
know
many
more
thing
about
these
two
kind
of
they
.
slowly
they
come
to
be
clear
in
every
one
,
sometime
perhaps
it
will
be
clear
to
every
one
.
sometime
perhaps
some
one
will
have
completely
in
they
the
history
of
every
one
of
everything
in
every
one
and
the
degree
and
kind
and
way
of
be
of
everything
in
each
one
in
they
from
their
beginning
to
their
ending
and
come
out
of
they
.




this
be
then
a
beginning
of
the
way
of
know
everything
in
every
one
,
of
know
the
complete
history
of
each
one
who
ever
be
or
be
or
will
be
live
.
this
be
then
a
little
description
of
the
winning
of
so
much
wisdom
.




as
I
be
say
the
important
thing
be
have
love
repeat
being
,
that
be
the
beginning
of
learn
the
complete
history
of
every
one
.
that
being
must
always
be
in
such
a
one
,
one
who
have
it
in
they
sometime
to
have
in
they
the
complete
history
of
every
one
they
ever
can
hear
of
as
having
be
.




there
be
so
many
way
of
begin
this
description
,
and
now
once
more
to
make
a
beginning
.




always
repeat
be
all
of
living
,
everything
that
be
be

,
more
and
more
listen
to
repeat
give
to
I

slowly
come
to
be
a
whole
one
to
I
,
each
one
slowly
come
to
be
a
whole
one
in
I
,
slowly

louder
and
louder
and
louder
inside
I
through
my
ear
and
eye
and
feeling
and
the
talk

that
be
the
whole
of
each
one
I
come
to
know
around
,
and
each
one
of
they

come
to
be
a
whole

to
be
a
whole
one
in
I
.
love
repeating
be
one
way
of
be
.
this
be
now
a
description
of
such
being
.




always
from
the
beginning
there
be
to
I
all
live
as
repeat
.
this
be
not
in
I
then
a
conscious
being
.
always
more
and
more
this
be
in
I
develop
to
a
complete
being
.
this
be
now
again
a
beginning
of
a
little
description
of
such
being
.




in
their
beginning
as
child
every
one
have
in
they
love
repeat
be
.
this
be
for
they
then
their

later
in
conscious
being
some
have
much
in
they
of
love
repeat
being
,
some
have
in
they
almost
nothing
of
such
feeling
.
there
be
then
these
two
kind
of
they
.
this
be
then
one
way
of
thinking
of
they
.




there
be
two
kind
of
man
and
woman
,
those
who
have
in
they
resist
as
their
way
of
win
those
who
have
in
they
attack
as
their
way
of
win
fighting
,
there
be
many
kind
,
many
very
many
kind
of
each
of
these
two
kind
of
man
and
woman
,
sometime
there
will
be
write
a
description
of
all
the
kind
of
they
.
now
this
division
be
accept
by
I
and
I
will
now
give
a
little
more
description
of
love
repeat
being
and
then
go
on
to
describe
how
it
come
to
slowly
give
to
I
complete
understanding
,
love
repeat
be
always
in
I
act
,
of
this
one
and
that
one
,
and
then
there
will
be
some
description
of
resemble
come
to
be
clear
by
look
at
the
repeating
in
man
and
woman
and
then
there
will
be
more
history
of
Martha
Hersland
and
the
be
come
out
of
she
all
her
living
and
the
being
in
every
one
she
come
to
know
in
living
.




always
then
from
the
beginning
there
be
in
I
always
increase
as
a
conscious
feeling
love
repeat
being

whole
being
of
any
one
always
repeat
in
that
one
every
minute
of
their

be
then
always
in
I
as
a
bottom
nature
to
I
an
earthy
,
resist
slow
understanding
,
love
repeat
being
.
as
I
be
say
this
have
nothing
to
do
with
ordinary
learning
,
in
a
way
with
ordinary
living
.
this
will
be
clear
later
in
this
description
.




many
have
love
repeat
be
in
they
,
many
never
come
to
know
it
of
they
,

have
in
it
always
more
and
more
under
standing
,

clear
to
I
and
to
my
feeling
,
it
be
very
slow
in
develop
,
it
be
very
important
to
make
it
clear
how
in
writing
,
it
must
be
do
now
with
a
slow
description
.
to
begin
again
then
with
it
in
my
feeling

begin
again
then
to
tell
of

of
such
of
they
sometimes
then
make
melodrama
of
themselves
to
themselves
to
hold
themselves
together
to
they
.
some
of
such
of
they
make
of
themselves
to
themselves
and
sometimes
to
other
one
that
know
they
a
melodrama
of
themselves
to
make
to
themselves
each
one
of
themselves
a
whole
one
to
themselves
and
sometimes
to
make
of
themselves
a
whole
one
to
other
around
they
.
this
be
a
very
interesting
thing
,
this
be
sometimes
the
explanation
of
melodrama
in
some
one
.




some
then
some
man
and
some
woman
be
not
whole
one
inside
I
for
long
time
together
.
sometime
one
of
such
a
one
be
a
whole
one
in
I
and
then
it
be
clear
to
I
why
such
a
kind
of
one
be
not
for
long
time
continually
a
whole
one
in
I
.




in
first
beginning
to
know
such
a
one
if
they
make
of
themselves
melodrama
to
make
to
themselves
a
whole
one
of
themselves
to
themselves
then
such
melodrama
be
very
confusing
,
it
be
not
natural
melodrama
to
they
,
melodrama
in
such
of
they
be
mostly
not
a
natural
way
of
be
,
mostly
such
of
they
have
pride
to
hide
themselves
to
themselves
from
know
that
there
be
not
a
whole
to
they
,
pride
to
hide
this
from
themselves
and
from
every
one
.
so
then
melodrama
in
such
a
one
be
confusing
.
when
melodrama
be
take
from
such
a
one
then
they
remain
confusing
,
there
be
nothing
then
to
guide
any
one
to
know
they
as
a
whole
then
such
a
one
.




such
a
one
,
now
with
no
melodrama
,
just
there
as
many
piece
to
some
one
,
remain
confusing
,
not
because
they
be
not
act
,
not
because
they
be
not
repeat
,
they
may
be
act
,
every
one
always
be
repeat
,
it
be
that
nothing
in
they
be
dominate
,
they
be
in
piece
to
themselves
then
and
to
everyone
.
they
have
not
weakness
,
nor
laziness
,
nor
dullness
to
make
they
confusing
.
they
be
in
piece
,
there
be
not
in
they
anything
dominate
,
not
the
bottom
nature
in
they
,
not
other
nature
or
nature
in
they
,
not
confusion
in
they
,
not
struggle
or
contradiction
,
or
weakness
or
indifference
in
they
.
so
then
such
a
one
be
puzzle
.




sometime
then
as
I
be
say
each
one
come
to
be
a
whole
one
to
I
,
sometime
then
each
one
come
to
be
clear
inside
I
,
sometimes
as
I
be
say
it
be
slow
grow
this
come
to
complete
understanding
inside
I
,
sometimes
it
be
a
quick
illumination
,
sometimes
it
be
a
mixture
of
these
two
way
of
learn
know
,
sometimes
it
be
other
way
of
learn
know
in
I
.
as
I
be
say
every
one
be
surely
sometime
puzzle
to
I
.




as
I
be
say
such
a
one
,
one
be
in
piece
be
a
long
time
puzzle
to
I
.
always
this
one
be
in
piece
though
always
love
be
be
a
loud
piece
than
other
piece
in
that
one
.




so
then
such
a
one
by
not
go
on
be
a
whole
one
after
be
illuminate
by
seem
a
whole
one
by
that
one
's
way
of
love
be
not
any
long
puzzle
.
this
give
to
I
then
an
understanding
of
the
being
in
such
one
,
such
a
one
then
be
not
together
for
long
time
as
a
whole
one
to
I
but
to
my
understanding
then
from
that
time
on
always
be
a
whole
one
to
I
.




every
one
then
sometime
be
a
whole
one
to
I
,
every
one
then
always
sometime
come
to
be
clear
to
I
,
come
to
be
really
a
whole
one
inside
I
.




this
be
clear
then
that
there
be
many
way
of
hearing
,
feeling
,
see
repeat
come
out
of
every
one
.
always
then
I
be

of
every
one
.
always
then
sometime
every
one
I
be
ever
know

to
be
a
whole
one
to
I
.

there
be
in
I
then
no
puzzling
,
there
be
nothing
of
a
whole
be
in
all
of
they
to
I
,
but
I
be
not
think
of
the
whole
be
in
they
,
they
be
interesting
thing
to
know
about
some
one
,
everything
be
interesting
to
know
about
any
one
,
everything
be
important
to
know
about
every
one
,
but
I
be
never
puzzle
about
this
one
.
all
the
thing
I
know
be
interesting
I
be
not
feel
any
need
of
a
whole
being
in
this
one
,
and
then
once
I
look
hard
at
this
one
and
then
there
be
a
whole
being
always
afterwards
repeat
to
every
one
from
this
one
after
my
tell
all
the
being
in
this
one
,
the
whole
be
in
this
one
,
and
this
be
very
interesting
.




always
then
I
listen
and
come
back
again
and
again
to
listen
to
every
one
.
always
then
I
be
think
and
feel
the
repeating
in
every
one
.
sometimes
it
happen
that
I
have
a
complete
history
of
some
one
,
of
the
meaning
of
all
the
repeating
in
they
the
first
time
I
look
hard
at
they
,
mostly
this
be
in
I
a
slow
thing
,
learn
understanding
,
mostly
I
come
back
again
and
again
to
listen
to
the
repeating
in
every
one
before
they
be
a
whole
one
,
before
there
be
to
I
a
whole
history
of
the
being
in
they
.
always
I
come
back
again
and
again
,
it
have
happen
that
sometimes
I
have
have
the
whole
history
of
some
one
the
first
time
I
look
long
at
they
,
mostly
this
be
a
slow
thing
,
always
even
when
understanding
happen
like
with
this
one
the
first
time
of
hard
looking
,
always
,
then
I
go
back
again
and
again
to
listen
,
to
fill
in
,
to
be
certain
.
this
then
be
what
happen
to
this
one
in
my
learning
,
this
be
now
a
little
a
description
.




the
nature
in
this
one
be
not
like
any
of
those
I
have
be
just
describe
.
everybody
who
know
this
one
know
everything
,
there
be
no
deceiving
of
any
one
by
this
one
,
everything
in
this
one
always
be
repeat
to
every
one
who
ever
listen
to
this
one
,
and
this
one
be
not
make
up
of
piece
and
none
of
the
piece
dominate
,
this
one
have
a
very
real
bottom
,
a
very
real
domination
inside
that
one
of
that
one
's
own
being
,
the
thing
with
this
one
be
to
understand
the
meaning
of
the
repeat
all
the
repeat
this
one
be
always
do
.
what
be
important
be
to
have
apply
to
this
one
complete
understanding
.
this
one
be
not
puzzle
really
to
any
one
,
this
one
have
nothing
of
the
nature
of
the
being
that
be
always
come
out
as
repeat
hide
,
it
be
all
there
,
all
always
repeat
,
all
always
be
dominate
by
the
bottom
being
and
all
that
then
be
need
be
to
understand
the
meaning
,
that
be
very
interesting
,
that
be
what
I
do
by
one
hard
look
.
this
be
now
a
little
more
description
of
this
one
.




this
one
then
as
I
be
say
have
it
to
have
as
be
really
the
nature
as
dominate
and
every
one
that
look
at
or
listen
to
or
feel
this
one
know
all
of
the
repeat
always
tell
over
and
over
again
all
of
the
history
of
this
one
.
this
time
then
it
be
a
question
of
understand
the
meaning
of
the
being
in
one
.




this
now
be
very
interesting
in
relation
to
the
being
in
this
one
,
whose
learn
,
in
I
,
I
be
soon
now
to
be
describe
.




there
be
then
in
the
first
one
I
be
describe
,
all
of
the
be
always
repeat
but
all
the
repeat
any
one
know
this
one
ever
be
hear
,
feel
,
seeing
could
be
understand
as
mean
that
this
one
be
always
give
all
she
love
to
every
one
and
always
there
be
no
place
for
she
in
living
,
always
there
be
no
place
for
she
in
living
.
always
every
one
feel
this
in
she
and
always
every
one
be
explain
there
be
no
place
for
such
a
one
in
living
by
specific
good
reasoning
,
always
dimly
every
one
have
a
little
a
puzzled
feeling
,
always
every
one
,
really
every
one
who
ever
know
this
one
be
really
sympathising
,
really
believe
because
all
of
it
be
really
there
always
repeat
.




slowly
then
this
one
come
to
be
a
whole
one
in
I
.
as
I
have
say
in
writing
,
often
,
for
many
year
some
one
be
baffle
,
the
repeat
hearing
of
they
do
not
make
the
complete
be
they
have
in
they
to
any
one
.
sometimes
many
year
pass
in
listen
to
repeat
in
such
a
one
and
the
being
of
they
be
not
a
complete
history
to
any
one
then
listen
to
they
,
sometime
then
it
come
out
of
they
a
louder
repeating
of
that
which
before
be
not
clear
to
anybody
's
hearing
and
then
such
a
one
be
a
complete
be
to
some
one
listen
to
the
repeat
come
out
of
such
a
one
,
there
be
then
to
some
one
a
complete
history
of
such
a
one
,
this
mostly
come
slowly
to
the
one
who
be
learn
the
being
of
such
a
one
,
this
be
the
history
of
learn
the
first
one
that
I
have
be
describe
.




the
third
one
then
of
whose
learn
I
be
begin
now
a
description
,
this
third
one
then
I
have
be
a
little
describe
be
very
different
from
this
first
one
,
every
one
who
ever
know
or
see
or
hear
of
this
one
always
know
all
the
repeat
always
come
out
of
this
one
,
all
the
complete
history
of
this
one
.
no
one
ever
know
this
one
do
not
know
all
the
repeating
in
this
one
but
always
there
be
in
no
one
a
complete
understanding
of
the
meaning
of
the
being
in
this
one
,
and
this
be
now
to
be
some
description
,
description
of
the
being
in
this
one
,
description
of
the
learning
of
the
meaning
of
the
being
in
this
one
,
description
of
the
telling
of
the
knowing
of
the
meaning
in
this
one
.




as
I
be
say
the
first
one
I
be
describe
always
have
then
to
every
one
the
very
good
reason
for
there
be
no
place
for
this
one
ever
for
living
,
no
place
ever
for
this
one
in
living
.
this
last
one
,
the
one
I
be
now
describe
have
with
this
first
one
some
connection
,
always
then
this
last
one
always
have
the
good
reason
for
not
realise
the
living
being
in
living
and
every
one
always
be
always
help
and
no
one
ever
be
understanding
for
every
one
always
be
convince
of
the
good
reason
this
one
have
for
not
be
able
to
realise
real
being
in
living
and
always
this
one
be
try
and
always
every
one
who
see
this
one
be
help
and
this
now
be
very
interesting
.




as
I
be
say
always
every
one
know
the
whole
repeating
of
this
last
one
,
every
one
who
ever
know
this
one
really
know
all
the
repeat
come
out
of
this
one
,
always
then
it
be
a
question
of
meaning
to
make
of
this
one
a
whole
one
inside
one
.




every
one
always
be
repeat
the
whole
of
they
,
some
to
every
one
who
know
any
one
of
such
of
they
,
some
one
repeat
the
whole
of
they
so
that
every
one
who
know
they
hear
the
whole
repeat
in
they
.
the
important
thing
then
with
such
a
one
for
every
one
as
I
be
say
know
with
such
a
one
that
they
be
hear
all
the
repeat
come
out
of
such
a
one
,
the
important
thing
then
with
such
a
one
so
as
to
get
such
a
one
to
be
a
whole
one
to
any
one
seeing
,
feed
,
hear
such
a
one
,
the
important
thing
then
be
hear
,
feel
,
see
all
the
repeat
come
out
from
such
a
one
be
to
realise
the
meaning
of
the
being
,
it
be
not
enough
to
realise
all
the
repeating
in
such
a
one
.




this
one
that
I
have
commence
describe
have
in
be
go
at
the
same
time
ask
and
refuse
,
infinite
tenacity
in
hold
on
to
anything
that
be
there
to
this
one
's
seize
,
always
not
really
want
what
be
be
hold
so
grimly
by
this
one
.
always
then
there
be
deny
in
this
one
,
mostly
one
think
of
fundamental

lead
to
deny
,
always
to
negation
,
that
grasp

ask
,
opening

closing
could
not
be
the

the
spirit
of
deny

be
the
whole
of
such
a
one
,
there
can
be
in
such
a

no

a
hand
can
not

,
the
resembling
that
make
the
two

of
they
,
independent
dependent
kind
of
they
who
have
attack
as
their

fighting
and
the
dependent
independent
kind
of
they
who
have
resist
in
they
as
their
natural
way
of
win
and
then
there
be
so
many
complicated
kind
of
these
two
kind
of
they
so
many
way
of
mixing
,
disguise
,
complicated
using
of
their
nature
in
many
of
they
,
so
complicated
that
mostly
it
be
confusing
to
I
who

of
they
that
there
be
these
kind
of
they
and
always
more

mostly
all
attack
and
just
at
the
bottom
there
be
a
contradiction
of
the
whole
nature
of
they
,
there
be
so
many
complication
then
in
all
this
that
I
be
know
,
it
be
all
a
very
difficult
thing
to
be
really
understand
.
I
know
very
much
about
these
way
of
be
in
man
and
woman
,
I
know
it
and
I
can
say
it
,
I
know
it
and
I
can
write
it
,
it
be
a
very
complex
mix
the
being
in
all
man
and
in
all
woman
,
I
do
not
know
yet
the
whole
of
it
,
I
do
know
now
very
much
of
it
,
I
can
not
yet
say
all
I
know
of
it
.




mostly
everybody
now
be
like
some
one
else
to
I
,
like
many
other
to
I
,
in
some
way
like
some
in
other
way
like
other
and
now
more
and
more
there
be
to
I
some
of
each
kind
of
they
that
be
mostly
only
of
that
kind
of
they
,
and
so
more
and
more
there
come
to
be
to
I
clearly
a
certain
number
of
kind
of
man
and
woman
.




kind
in
man
and
woman
then
be
to
many
always
in
man
and
woman
and
in
many
different
way
of
feeling
and
thinking
.
mostly
to
every
one
there
be
kind
in
man
,
kind
in
woman
,
kind
in
man
and
woman
.




there
be
then
as
I
be
say
many
way
of
feel
kind
in
man
and
woman
,
every
way
of
feel
kind
in
man
and
woman
must
be
in
such
a
one
that
sometime
have
in
that
one
all
the
history
of
all
man
,
of
all
woman
.




kind
in
man
and
woman
then
be
exist
to
mostly
every
one
.
to
many
feel
kind
in
man
and
woman
be
a
part
of
learn
man
and
woman
,
to
some
kind
in
man
and
woman
be
part
of
learn
man
and
woman
,
to
some
feel
kind
in
man
and
woman
be
to
have
sometime
each
one
such
a
one
be
ever
know
a
complete
whole
one
to
that
one
.
to
such
a
one
always
there
be
continually
more
variation
and
more
resembling
and
sometimes
it
be
so
confusing
that
such
a
one
must
stop
look
.
then
when
some
one
be
a
whole
one
and
a
complete
one
of
a
kind
of
one
or
the
kind
in
one
be
complete
to
one
know
that
one
,
then
it
be
very
satisfying
.




everybody
then
be
mostly
a
real
one
to
I
,
everybody
be
now
like
some
one
and
like
some
other
one
and
then
again
like
some
other
one
and
each
one
sometimes
be
a
whole
one
to
I
.




this
be
resemble
,
this
see
resemblance
between
those
one
be
know
be
interesting
,
define
,
confusing
,
uncertain
and
certain
.
you
see
one
,
the
way
of
look
at
any
one
in
that
one
that
be
like
some
one
,
the
way
of
listen
,
a
sudden
expression
,
a
way
of
walk
,
a
sound
in
laugh
,
a
number
of
expression
that
be
pass
over
the
face
of
that
one
,
it
be
confusing
,
too
many
people
have
piece
in
they
like
piece
in
this
one
,
it
begin
as
a
clear
resemblance
to
some
one
,
it
go
on
to
be
a
confusing
number
of
resemblance
to
many
then
,
some
resemblance
that
be
very
clear
one
be
not
remember
then
it
be
baffle
,
more
and
more
resemblance
come
out
in
that
one
,
perhaps
that
one
be
not
independent
dependent
and
yet
that
be
so
clear
in
the
beginning
,
more
and
more
then
with
know
resemblance
be
multiply
and
be
baffle
and
confusing
and
always
each
one
of
all
these
resemblance
one
who
sometime
want
to
have
this
one
as
a
whole
one
,
want
to
really
know
kind
in
man
and
woman
must
completely
feel
,
admit
,
remember
and
consider
and
realise
as
have
meaning
.
this
be
then
a
beginning
of
learn
to
make
kind
of
man
and
woman
.
slowly
then
all
the
resemblance
between
one
and
all
the
other
that
have
something
,
different
thing
in
common
with
that
one
,
all
these
fall
into
an
order
system
sometime
then
that
one
be
a
whole
one
,
sometimes
that
one
be
very
different
to
what
be
in
the
beginning
the
important
resemblance
in
that
one
but
always
everything
,
all
resemblance
in
that
one
must
be
count
in
,
nothing
must
ever
be
throw
out
,
everything
in
each
one
must
be
include
to
know
that
one
and
then
sometime
that
one
be
to
some
one
a
whole
one
and
that
be
then
very
satisfying
.




sometimes
as
I
be
just
say
everything
in
any
one
,
all
the
resemblance
in
that
one
point
to
that
one
be
one
kind
of
man
and
woman
and
then
,
say
an
independent
dependent
kind
of
one
,
and
then
when
one
look
more
and
more
closely
at
that
one
the
bottom
nature
in
that
one
be
a
contradiction
to
all
the
rest
in
that
one
,
be
so
to
say
dependent
independent
being
and
everything
one
ever
be
know
of
that
one
have
to
be
always
still
remember
but
now
it
all
have
a
new
direction
.
know
completely
then
any
one
give
a
solid
basis
for
see
the
meaning
of
any
being
that
have
in
it
resemblance
to
that
one
.
always
then
it
be
important
with
each
one
that
sometime
that
one
be
to
the
one
learn
kind
in
man
and
woman
a
whole
one
,
a
complete
one
so
that
there
can
then
be
a
solid
basis
of
comparison
of
understand
the
meaning
of
the
being
in
some
one
who
be
resemble
in
any
way
to
that
one
who
be
to
the
one
learning
,
then
a
whole
one
.
sometime
as
I
be
say
there
be
so
many
way
of
see
,
feel
resemblance
in
some
one
,
some
one
resemble
so
many
man
and
woman
that
it
be
confusing
,
baffling
,
then
the
one
learn
kind
in
man
and
woman
be
despairing
,
nothing
then
to
that
one
have
any
meaning
,
it
be
then
to
that
one
all
of
it
only
an
arbitrary
choosing
and
then
that
one
must
stop
look
,
that
one
then
must
begin
again
then
and
always
never
forget
anything
that
one
ever
have
see
as
a
resemblance
in
the
one
that
one
be
then
learn
.
sometime
really
each
one
will
then
be
a
complete
one
to
that
one
.
sometime
really
each
one
will
be
a
complete
,
understand
person
,
understand
in
kind
of
man
and
woman
.
this
be
a
real
way
of
learning
,
sometime
then
there
will
be
a
complete
history
of
every
one
,
everything
then
they
do
in
living
,
each
one
,
will
be
clear
then
to
the
one
that
have
really
learn
all
the
kind
there
be
of
man
and
woman
,
all
will
be
understand
then
in
they
,
their
living
,
love

eat
,
work
,
rest
,
pleasing
,
smoking
,
scolding
,
drinking
,
dancing
,
walk
,
talk
,
sleep
,
begin
,
end
,
attack
,
resist
,
win
,
lose
,
everything
.
there
be
whole
being
always
,
they
be
themselves
inside
they
,
they
will
be
whole
one
then
to
the
other
who
have
learn
to
know
they
,
they
will
be
each
understand
by
be
know
as
their
kind
of
they
.




I
do
know
very
much
of
the
being
in
man
and
woman
.
I
do
know
very
many
of
they
.
I
do
know
the
resemblance
in
they
and
the
kind
of
they
,
the
division
into
kind
of
they
that
be
important
for
the
understanding
of
they
.
I
do
know
many
of
they
,
I
know
they
,
I
understand
,
I
explain
they
,
they
be
themselves
then
to
I
,
they
be
whole
one
to
I
,
I
know
it
and
I
tell
it
,
I
know
it
more
and
more
and
more
and
more
I
tell
it
.
always
I
be
think
about
it
,
always
I
feel
the
be
the
whole
be
sometime
in
each
one
,
I
know
it
sometime
and
I
tell
it
sometime
.
I
learn
it
as
I
see
it
and
feel
it
and
hear
it
as
they
repeat
it
,
I
understand
it
and
then
I
understand
in
another
one
that
be
like
the
one
that
have
then
become
a
whole
one
to
I
,
I
learn
new
variation
in
it
then
from
this
now
one
and
then
sometime
this
one
be
a
whole
one
to
I
and
I
begin
again
then
with
this
one
to
know
kind
in
man
and
woman
and
so
on
and
always
there
be
more
to
learn
about
it
,
there
be
more
to
know
about
it
,
there
be
more
to
tell
about
it
.




this
will
be
clear
now
in
a
description
of
how
several
man
and
woman
each
one
come
to
be
a
whole
one
to
I
,
a
kind
of
man
and
woman
to
I
and
then
by
resemblance
between
they
and
other
of
they
there
come
to
be
more
understanding
of
each
kind
in
man
and
woman
in
I
and
then
other
kind
in
they
to
I
.
later
there
will
be
more
description
of
the
knowing
of
all
the
kind
there
be
of
man
and
woman
,
of
the
resembling
that
make
kind
of
they
around
one
.
now
there
will
be
a
little
description
of
some
,
of
the
kind
they
be
,
of
learn
by
resemblance
between
man
and
woman
the
be
in
they
.




the
way
I
think
of
every
one
be
like
this
.
this
be
the
way
they
come
to
be
in
group
to
I
,
in
group
that
have
in
they
to
be
that
those
in
they
be
resemble
each
one
to
the
other
one
.
the
way
I
know
they
as
resemble
,
that
I
have
be
just
explain
,
in
every
way
that
any
one
can
see
any
one
of
they
.
the
way
I
think
of
each
one
be
like
this
that
I
will
now
begin
describe
.




in
recognize
they
as
be
of
one
group
or
of
another
group
of
they
,
that
be
one
kind
or
another
kind
of
man
and
woman
,
everything
in
they
,
anything
in
they
,
their
look
,
their
feeling
,
their
expression
,
their
way
of
do
anything
,
their
way
of
do
everything
,
everything
,
anything
in
they
be
to
be
notice
in
its
resemblance
to
something
in
another
one
.
so
then
there
come
to
be
group
of
kind
of
man
and
woman
.
so
then
as
I
be
say
I
come
to
know
they
,
sometime
all
of
they
I
be
ever
know
,
as
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
sometimes
it
be
very
confusing
,
sometimes
very
simple
,
sometimes
very
certain
,
sometimes
very
uncertain
,
sometimes
for
a
long
time
baffling
.
there
be
then
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
sometime
there
will
he
a
description
of
all
the
kind
of
they
.




the
way
I
think
of
each
one
be
like
this
.
I
think
of
they
as
have
a
bottom
nature
in
they
,
as
having
sometimes
mix
up
in
they
other
nature
or
nature
with
the
bottom
nature
in
they
.
this
be
now
to
be
a
little
description
of
the
way
I
always
think
of
each
one
of
they
to
lead
later
to
a
description
of
some
of
the
kind
of
man
and
woman
.




I
think
of
each
one
I
be
ever
know
.
each
one
sometime
be
a
whole
one
to
I
.
each
one
have
a
bottom
nature
in
they
of
one
kind
of
man
and
woman
.
each
one
may
have
in
they
other
nature
or
nature
in
they
mix
with
each
other
or
separate
together
in
they
.
this
be
the
way
I
think
of
man
and
woman
.




this
be
now
a
description
of
the
way
I
feel
and
think
the
nature
in
they
.




as
I
be
say
each
one
have
a
bottom
nature
in
they
.
each
one
be
one
of
a
kind
of
man
and
woman
.




each
one
have
a
bottom
nature
in
they
,
each
one
have
or
have
not
another
nature
or
other
nature
in
they
besides
the
bottom
nature
in
they
.
these
may
be
of
the
same
kind
as
the
bottom
nature
,
they
may
not
.
this
be
now
then
a
description
of
the
way
I
feel
and
think
the
nature
and
nature
in
man
and
woman
.




this
be
then
the
way
I
feel
the
nature
,
the
bottom
nature
,
the
other
nature
or
nature
,
in
man
and
woman
,
this
be
then
the
way
I
feel
each
nature
in
each
one
of
they
.
each
nature
then
be
of
a
kind
in
man
and
woman
.




this
be
then
the
way
I
feel
each
nature
in
man
and
woman
,
this
be
the
way
I
feel
the
nature
and
make
grouping
of
they
,
grouping
of
kind
of
they
.




the
way
I
feel
nature
in
man
and
woman
be
this
way
then
.
to
begin
then
with
one
general
kind
of
they
,
this
be
a
resisting
earthy
slow
kind
of
they
,
anything
enter
into
they
as
a
sensation
must
emerge
again
from
through
the
slow
resist
bottom
of
they
to
be
an
emotion
in
they
.
this
be
a
kind
of
they
.
this
bottom
in
they
then
in
some
can
be
solid
,
in
some
frozen
,
in
some
dry
and
crack
,
in
some
muddy
and
engulf
,
in
some
thick
,
in
some
thin
,
slimier
,
dry
,
very
dry
and
not
so
dry
and
in
some
a
stimulation
enter
into
the
surface
of
the
mass
that
be
they
to
make
an
emotion
do
not
get
into
it
,
the
mass
then
that
be
they
,
to
be
swallow
up
in
it
to
be
emerge
,
in
some
it
be
swallow
up
and
never
then
be
emerge
.
now
all
these
kind
of
way
of
be
be
exist
and
sometime
there
will
be
example
of
all
these
way
of
be
,
now
all
these
way
of
be
have
it
in
common
that
there
be
not
in
they
a
quick
and
poignant
reaction
,
it
must
be
an
entering
and
then
an
emerge
mostly
take
some
time
in
the
doing
,
the
quick
of
these
then
be
such
of
they
where
the
mud
be
dry
and
almost
wooden
,
where
the
mud
have
become
dry
and
almost
wooden
,
or
metallic
in
they
and
it
be
a
surface
dent
a
stimulation
give
to
they
or
else
there
be
a
surface
that
be
not
dry
and
the
rest
be
dry
and
it
be
only
the
surface
of
the
whole
mass
that
be
that
one
of
which
there
have
be
any
penetrating
,
and
in
some
in
whom
the
whole
mass
of
the
being
be
take
part
in
the
reaction
in
some
of
such
of
they
habit
,
mind
strongly
act
can
make
it
go
quick
and
quicker
the
deep
sinking
and
emerge
.
this
be
then
a
kind
of
they
,
the
resist
kind
of
they
,
and
there
be
many
kind
of
that
kind
of
they
.
this
be
a
very
sure
way
of
group
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
I
know
it
and
I
see
man
and
woman
by
it
.
mostly
to
any
one
now
it
mean
nothing
.
I
will
begin
again
then
this
explain
.
this
group
I
have
be
describe
be
those
that
have
resist
win
as
their
natural
way
of
be
.
I
will
begin
again
explain
.
there
be
a
kind
of
man
and
woman
who
have
resist
as
their
way
of
win
fighting
.
there
be
another
kind
of
man
and
woman
that
have
attack
as
their
way
of
win
fighting
,
these
have
poignant
and
quick
reaction
,
emotion
in
such
of
they
have
the
quickness
and
intensity
of
a
sensation
,
that
be
one
kind
of
man
and
woman
.
later
I
will
tell
more
of
they
.
now
I
must
begin
again
with
the
resist
,
the
dependent
independent
the
kind
I
have
be
begin
describe
in
a
way
that
may
mean
nothing
to
any
other
one
,
in
the
way
I
feel
bottom
be
in
man
and
woman
,
in
the
way
I
make
kind
in
they
,
in
the
way
each
one
come
to
be
a
whole
one
to
I
see
that
one
.




resist
be
be
one
way
of
be
.
this
be
now
a
description
.
as
I
be
say
there
be
kind
of
they
kind
in
man
and
woman
and
there
be
kind
of
kind
of
they
kind
in
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
first
then
there
be
large
grouping
of
they
,
the
grouping
into
two
kind
of
they
those
have
resist
,
those
having
attack
as
their
natural
way
of
win
fighting
,
dependent
independent
,
independent
dependent
,
these
two
kind
of
they
.
each
group
then
have
in
a
way
the
same
way
of
handwriting
,
the
same
way
of
succeed
,
the
same
way
of
beginning
,
the
same
way
of
loving
.
many
of
they
be
very
baffle
,
many
in
each
group
of
they
,
for
there
be
in
many
of
they
other
nature
or
nature
in
they
,
sometimes
then
they
be
very
baffle
,
sometime
to
some
one
the
bottom
nature
in
they
be
certain
,
the
kind
the
bottom
nature
in
they
be
,
and
then
,
though
it
may
take
a
long
time
to
know
the
complete
be
in
they
,
they
be
not
any
long
baffle
.
soon
a
few
short
history
will
be
give
of
learn
the
bottom
be
in
some
and
so
clear
up
the
problem
of
they
which
for
a
long
time
be
confusing
,
which
always
be
confusing
to
any
one
not
know
the
bottom
be
in
that
one
.




this
be
clear
then
,
bottom
being
be
the
natural
way
of
win
,
love
,
fighting
,
working
,
think
,
write
in
each
one
.
this
be
not
anything
about
,
good
or
bad
in
they
,
in
each
one
,
about
more
or
less
brain
in
they
but
the
kind
of
brain
,
the
kind
of
good
,
the
kind
of
bad
,
the
kind
of
loving
,
the
kind
of
fighting
,
the
way
of
working
,
be
in
they
at
the
bottom
of
they
.




this
be
a
very
certain
way
of
know
,
group
man
and
woman
,
understanding
,
see
the
kind
of
nature
in
they
,
make
certain
of
the
resemblance
between
they
.
this
be
then
a
universal
grouping
,
always
everywhere
with
every
education
there
be
these
same
kind
of
they
,
some
be
a
complete
thing
of
one
kind
of
they
,
some
be
very
little
just
at
the
bottom
one
kind
of
they
and
all
the
rest
of
they
be
other
kind
of
they
,
there
be
in
they
every
degree
of
mixing
,
every
degree
of
emphasising
,
some
be
the
whole
of
their
kind
of
they
,
some
be
only
part
of
their
kind
of
they
;
to
commence
again
then
with
my
way
of
see
they
and
then
the
way
of
know
the
resemblance
between
they
and
so
the
make
group
of
they
.
to
begin
again
then
with
my
feeling
of
bottom
nature
in
each
one
.




there
be
then
the
two
general
kind
of
they
,
the
attacking
kind
the
independent
dependent
kind
of
they
,
the
resist
kind
the
dependent
independent
kind
of
they
.
there
be
all
extreme
of
these
two
kind
of
they
,
resist
kind
that
be
almost
always
feverishly
attack
,
attack
kind
that
be
almost
always
stubbornly
resist
,
the
independent
dependent
that
be
almost
all
independent
,
almost
all
dependent
,
the
dependent
independent
that
be
almost
all
dependent
,
that
be
almost
all
independent
,
it
be
often
very
confusing
but
the
distinction
have
meaning
,
mostly
to
every
one
read
there
be
not
any
understanding
,
that
be
very
certain
,
sometime
to
some
one
it
can
have
meaning
,
always
then
there
be
go
on
explain
of
the
meaning
of
this
dividing
of
man
and
woman
into
these
kind
of
they
.




there
must
now
then
be
more
description
of
the
way
each
one
be
make
of
a
substance
common
to
their
kind
of
they
,
thick
,
thin
,
hard
,
soft
,
all
of
one
consistency
,
all
of
one
lump
,
or
little
lump
stick
together
to
make
a
whole
one
cement
together
sometimes
by
the
same
kind
of
be
sometimes
by
other
kind
of
be
in
they
,
some
with
a
lump
hard
at
the
centre
liquid
at
the
surface
,
some
with
the
lump
vegetablish
or
wooden
or
metallic
in
they
.
always
then
the
kind
of
substance
,
the
kind
of
way
when
it
be
a
mediumly
fluid
solid
fructifying
react
substance
,
the
way
it
act
then
make
one
kind
of
they
the
resist
kind
of
they
,
the
way
another
substance
act
make
another
kind
of
they
the
attack
kind
of
they
.
it
and
the
state
it
be
in
each
kind
of
they
,
the
mixing
of
it
with
the
other
way
of
be
that
make
many
kind
of
these
two
kind
of
they
,
sometime
all
this
will
have
meaning
.
now
there
will
be
a
little
more
description
give
of
these
two
kind
of
substance
and
their
way
of
acting
and
the
kind
in
each
kind
of
they
and
then
there
will
be
give
short
history
show
learn
kind
,
learn
individual
one
by
know
this
way
of
see
,
feel
bottom
nature
in
man
and
woman
.




I
know
it
and
I
want
to
tell
it
.
I
see
it
the
bottom
nature
in
each
one
I
be
ever
know
,
sometimes
,
in
each
one
.
I
see
it
,
I
see
it
and
know
it
,
its
likeness
and
unlikeness
to
bottom
nature
in
another
one
,
I
know
and
I
want
to
tell
it
.
I
know
it
and
I
want
to
tell
it
and
sometime
some
one
else
too
will
know
it
.
I
know
it
and
I
want
to
tell
it
and
sometimes
some
one
,
some
will
know
it
.
this
be
then
the
way
I
see
it
.




as
I
be
say
there
be
two
general
kind
of
they
,
the
resisting
,
the
attack
kind
of
they
.
there
be
two
general
kind
of
they
,
there
be
many
very
many
kind
of
these
two
kind
of
they
,
there
be
many
very
very
many
mixing
in
every
one
of
some
of
all
the
kind
of
they
,
in
some
of
some
of
both
the
general
kind
of
they
I
know
this
now
and
now
I
will
describe
more
of
it
.
I
will
now
describe
nature
in
all
man
and
woman
.
in
each
one
,
some
nature
be
the
bottom
nature
of
they
.
all
nature
be
kind
,
they
be
like
nature
in
other
man
and
woman
.
this
be
now
a
little
a
beginning
of
the
grouping
of
they
.




first
then
to
consider
the
general
resist
group
of
man
and
woman
,
consider
they
now
only
the
bottom
nature
,
which
be
resist
,
in
this
group
of
they
,
leave
out
now
any
considering
of
mix
in
they
of
other
nature
or
nature
in
they
,
of
other
form
of
resist
nature
in
they
besides
the
kind
of
resist
being
that
be
bottom
nature
in
each
one
,
of
any
attack
nature
or
nature
in
they
that
be
mix
up
in
they
.
it
be
clear
then
that
it
be
now
the
general
group
of
resist
being
that
be
to
have
now
a
describing
,
there
will
be
a
little
explaining
of
the
attacking
be
in
resist
being
.
there
be
now
to
be
here
a
short
description
.




as
I
be
say
this
be
one
way
of
see
being
,
bottom
nature
as
a
substance
that
have
a
way
of
acting
that
make
one
general
kind
of
be
,
that
make
all
of
that
kind
of
they
have
it
in
common
to
have
a
certain
way
of
fighting
,
think
,
love
,
succeed
,
beginning
and
end
,
this
be
of
course
in
each
one
affect
by
the
quantity
of
bottom
be
in
each
one
of
their
kind
of
being
and
of
the
other
nature
or
nature
in
each
one
and
so
often
it
be
all
very
confusing
.
often
in
very
much
of
any
one
's
living
it
be
very
hard
to
know
which
nature
in
they
be
bottom
nature
in
they
,
sometime
this
come
to
be
clear
in
each
one
,
it
be
always
there
and
repeat
in
each
one
,
sometimes
it
be
loudly
sound
and
after
any
one
have
hear
it
clearly
in
some
one
it
be
always
there
to
that
one
,
always
repeat
.
the
bottom
nature
then
be
clear
in
that
one
.
in
some
it
be
clear
when
they
be
very
young
,
in
some
when
they
be
young
,
in
some
when
they
be
not
so
young
,
in
some
when
they
be
old
one
.
always
in
each
one
it
be
there
repeat
,
sometime
some
one
know
it
in
each
one
,
sometime
some
one
will
know
it
in
every
one
that
one
be
ever
know
.




to
begin
then
.
the
resist
kind
of
they
.
many
be
of
this
kind
of
they
and
I
know
it
in
they
.
they
be
it
,
they
live
it
and
I
know
it
.
sometime
then
I
understand
it
,
they
be
it
,
they
live
it
and
they
repeat
it
,
sometime
then
I
know
it
when
I
see
it
,
hear
it
,
feel
it
in
they
,
sometime
then
when
they
be
of
this
kind
of
they
I
know
it
of
they
,
sometimes
for
a
long
time
it
be
baffle
in
some
one
for
it
be
not
clear
in
they
,
sometime
it
be
clear
in
each
one
the
bottom
nature
in
they
,
when
it
be
resist
be
in
they
it
make
certain
kind
of
way
of
be
,
love
,
think
,
fight
in
such
of
they
.
they
be
it
,
they
live
it
and
sometime
I
know
it
.
they
be
it
,
they
live
it
,
sometime
they
show
it
,
sometime
I
understand
it
and
now
I
will
tell
it
the
way
I
see
it
.
I
will
tell
the
way
I
see
and
feel
and
hear
and
know
resist
be
in
those
that
have
it
,
then
I
will
tell
the
way
I
see
and
feel
and
hear
and
know
attack
be
in
those
that
have
it
,
I
will
tell
of
the
kind
there
be
in
it
and
how
by
resemblance
between
those
of
that
kind
of
it
I
know
it
,
I
will
give
then
more
example
of
know
it
.




the
resist
kind
in
man
and
woman
and
how
I
feel
it
.
they
be
it
,
they
live
it
,
sometimes
I
know
it
.
always
sometime
in
each
one
sometime
.
I
know
it
.
I
understand
and
I
can
tell
it
.
I
will
wait
a
little
long
before
I
tell
very
much
about
it
.
now
there
will
be
only
a
little
description
of
it
.
slowly
there
will
be
a
complete
description
of
it
,
come
out
of
I
,
and
sometime
there
will
be
write
all
any
one
know
of
it
.
I
know
it
and
now
I
will
tell
a
little
of
it
.




the
resist
kind
of
be
in
man
and
woman
and
how
I
feel
it
,
how
I
know
it
in
they
.
they
be
it
,
they
live
it
,
they
repeat
it
,
sometime
I
know
it
in
they
,
this
be
now
some
description
of
the
way
I
realise
it
.




the
bottom
nature
in
many
then
be
of
the
dependent
independent
kind
of
be
there
can
be
in
man
and
woman
,
these
have
resist
fighting
as
their
natural
way
of
win
.
in
such
of
they
reaction
be
not
quick
and
poignant
in
they
,
in
such
of
they
emotion
have
not
the
poignancy
of
a
sensation
.
I
know
it
in
they
,
always
sometime
I
know
it
in
they
,
often
it
be
hard
to
know
it
in
they
from
the
mixing
of
the
other
kind
of
nature
in
they
.
perhaps
now
I
will
give
just
a
little
description
of
it
,
later
I
will
give
more
description
of
it
.
I
understand
it
and
I
can
tell
it
.
I
will
wait
a
little
long
before
I
tell
very
much
about
it
.
now
there
will
be
only
a
little
description
of
it
.
slowly
there
will
be
a
complete
description
of
it
come
out
of
I
and
sometime
there
will
be
write
all
any
one
know
of
it
.
I
know
it
and
now
I
will
tell
a
little
of
it
.




resist
be
in
man
and
woman
.
this
be
now
then
a
little
a
description
of
my
realise
resist
be
in
man
and
woman
.
this
be
then
now
a
little
description
of
my
realise
resist
be
in
some
.
there
be
many
that
have
resist
be
in
they
as
a
bottom
nature
to
they
,
sometimes
I
know
it
in
they
.
there
be
many
then
that
have
it
,
I
know
it
and
sometime
I
tell
it
,
they
be
all
of
they
show
it
in
the
repeating
they
be
all
of
they
do
all
their
living
,
sometime
I
know
it
in
each
one
of
they
,
sometime
I
know
it
and
sometime
I
tell
it
.
there
be
many
that
have
it
,
that
make
all
of
they
one
kind
of
man
and
woman
.
I
know
it
in
they
in
each
one
of
they
of
man
and
woman
I
be
ever
know
who
have
it
and
sometimes
I
understand
it
,
I
know
it
and
understand
the
action
of
it
in
each
one
of
they
that
have
it
,
in
each
one
of
they
that
I
come
to
know
of
that
kind
of
man
and
woman
.
there
be
many
then
that
have
it
,
about
half
of
all
man
and
woman
be
of
the
kind
of
man
and
woman
have
resist
be
as
a
bottom
nature
in
they
,
the
rest
of
they
mostly
have
attack
be
in
they
.
this
be
a
general
division
.
I
understand
a
good
deal
of
it
,
I
can
tell
more
and
less
than
I
understand
of
it
.
I
be
now
go
to
tell
less
and
more
than
I
understand
of
resist
be
as
a
bottom
nature
in
many
man
and
woman
who
have
it
.




resist
be
then
as
I
be
say
be
to
I
a
kind
of
be
,
one
kind
of
man
and
woman
have
it
as
be
that
emotion
be
not
as
poignant
in
they
as
sensation
.
this
be
my
meaning
,
this
be
resist
be
.
generally
speak
then
resist
being
be
a
kind
of
be
where
,
take
bottom
nature
to
be
a
substance
like
earth
to
some
one
's
feeling
,
this
need
time
for
penetrate
to
get
reaction
.
those
have
attack
be
their
substance
be
more
vibrant
in
they
,
these
can
have
reaction
as
emotion
as
quick
and
poignant
and
complete
as
a
sensation
.
generally
speak
,
those
having
resist
be
in
they
have
a
slow
way
of
respond
,
they
may
be
nervous
and
quick
and
all
that
but
it
be
in
they
,
nervousness
be
in
they
as
the
effect
of
slow
-
move
go
too
fast
and
so
have
nervous
being
,
nervous
be
in
they
be
not
the
natural
mean
of
expression
to
such
of
they
,
some
have
quick
response
in
they
by
the
steadily
training
of
themselves
to
quicker
and
quick
reaction
and
some
of
they
in
the
end
come
to
seem
to
have
quick
reaction
as
their
natural
way
of
be
,
mostly
in
such
of
they
this
be
a
late
development
in
they
and
that
be
natural
from
the
kind
of
be
in
they
.
attack
be
often
have
nervousness
as
energy
as
a
natural
way
of
active
be
in
they
,
often
these
then
lose
the
power
of
attack
with
the
loss
of
nervousness
in
they
.
there
be
so
very
many
way
of
know
these
two
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
I
know
so
very
many
of
they
,
I
will
not
now
tell
of
very
many
of
they
.
mostly
the
resist
being
when
they
have
conservative
be
in
they
have
it
from
not
have
the
activity
of
change
,
the
attack
kind
of
be
have
conservative
sense
in
they
from
conviction
,
tradition
,
they
be
attackingly
defend
.
mostly
those
have
in
they
resist
be
have
more
feeling
of
object
as
real
thing
to
they
,
object
have
to
they
more
earthy
meaning
than
to
those
who
have
attack
as
their
natural
way
of
be
.
mostly
then
object
to
those
have
attack
be
as
their
natural
way
of
be
have
for
they
mean
as
emotion
,
as
practically
to
be
use
,
as
beauty
,
as
symbolism
,
that
be
to
many
of
they
their
natural
way
of
see
anything
they
be
know
,
to
those
who
have
resist
be
as
their
natural
way
of
be
an
object
be
it
itself
to
they
,
the
meaning
,
the
use
,
the
emotion
about
it
,
the
beauty
,
the
symbolising
of
it
be
to
such
of
they
a
secondary
reaction
,
not
altogether
at
once
as
in
those
have
in
they
attack
as
their
natural
way
of
be
.
so
then
those
having
resist
being
have
also
in
they
passive
adaptability
strongly
in
they
when
they
be
not
really
resist
while
those
who
have
attack
being
be
generally
more
active
in
adapt
,
they
may
have
yield
in
they
or
stubbornness
or
sensitive
responsiveness
in
they
when
not
attack
they
have
not
generally
speak
passive
adaptability
in
they
.
they
be
very
different
then
the
attacking
and
the
resist
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
this
division
have
real
meaning
.
sometime
when
I
be
all
through
all
my
writing
,
when
all
my
meaning
,
all
my
understanding
,
all
my
knowing
,
all
my
learning
have
be
write
,
sometime
then
some
will
understand
the
being
in
all
man
and
woman
.




I
be
all
unhappy
in
this
writing
.
I
know
very
much
of
the
meaning
of
the
being
in
man
and
woman
.
I
know
it
and
feel
it
and
I
be
always
learn
more
of
it
and
now
I
be
tell
it
and
I
be
nervous
and
drive
and
unhappy
in
it
.
sometimes
I
will
be
all
happy
in
it
.




I
know
it
and
now
I
begin
again
with
tell
it
,
the
way
I
feel
resist
be
in
man
and
woman
.
it
be
like
a
substance
and
in
some
it
be
as
I
be
say
solid
and
sensitive
all
through
it
to
stimulation
,
in
some
almost
wooden
,
in
some
muddy
and
engulf
,
in
some
thin
almost
like
gruel
,
in
some
solid
in
some
part
and
in
other
part
all
liquid
,
in
some
with
hole
like
air
-
hole
in
it
,
in
some
a
thin
layer
of
it
,
in
some
harden
and
crack
all
through
it
,
in
some
double
layer
of
it
with
no
connection
between
the
layer
of
it
.
this
and
many
many
other
way
there
be
of
feel
it
as
the
bottom
being
in
different
one
of
they
;
different
man
and
woman
have
resist
be
as
their
natural
way
of
be
,
always
I
be
look
hard
at
each
one
,
feel
,
see
,
hear
the
repeat
come
out
of
each
one
and
so
slowly
I
know
of
each
one
the
way
the
bottom
in
they
be
exist
and
so
then
that
be
the
foundation
of
the
history
of
each
one
of
they
and
always
it
be
come
out
of
each
one
of
they
.




this
then
this
bottom
nature
in
they
,
the
way
it
be
make
in
they
make
the
bottom
history
of
they
,
make
their
way
of
be
stupid
,
wise
,
active
,
lazy
,
continuous
,
disjointed
,
be
always
there
in
they
,
in
some
their
kind
of
they
be
more
,
be
less
,
be
the
same
all
through
their
living
,
be
more
or
less
affect
by
the
other
nature
or
nature
in
they
if
they
have
other
nature
or
nature
in
they
,
can
be
stimulate
or
hurry
or
slow
hut
never
really
change
in
they
,
can
come
very
nearly
to
be
change
in
they
,
can
never
really
be
change
in
they
,
really
not
ever
to
my
knowing
,
really
not
ever
really
change
in
they
.
this
then
be
very
certain
and
now
to
speak
again
of
attack
being
.
attack
be
as
I
be
say
have
it
to
be
that
emotion
can
be
as
quick
,
as
poignant
,
as
profound
in
meaning
as
a
sensation
.
this
be
my
meaning
.
I
be
think
of
attack
be
not
as
an
earthy
kind
of
substance
but
as
a
pulpy
not
dust
not
dirt
but
a
more
mixed
up
substance
,
it
can
be
slimy
,
gelatinous
,
gluey
,
white
opaquy
kind
of
thing
and
it
can
be
white
and
vibrant
,
and
clear
and
heated
and
this
be
all
not
very
clear
to
I
and
I
will
now
tell
more
about
it
.




this
be
the
way
I
be
think
of
it
.
in
the
one
in
which
I
first
learn
to
know
it
it
be
like
this
to
I
.
it
be
like
this
to
I
in
the
first
one
I
come
to
know
it
,
the
substance
attack
being
be
,
in
its
various
shaping
.
in
this
one
it
be
so
dull
,
so
thick
,
so
gluey
that
it
be
so
slow
in
action
one
almost
could
think
of
it
as
resist
but
it
be
not
resist
earthy
dependent
independent
being
,
it
be
attack
,
stupid
,
slow
-
move
,
it
be
independent
dependent
being
,
it
be
a
different
substance
in
its
way
of
acting
,
react
,
of
be
penetrate
,
of
feeling
,
of
thinking
than
any
slow
resist
dependent
independent
being
and
now
there
be
to
be
here
a
very
little
explaining
of
how
I
know
this
as
a
kind
of
be
.




in
this
one
then
,
as
I
be
say
it
be
attack
being
but
very
slowly
get
into
motion
but
not
because
it
the
stimulation
be
lose
into
it
and
have
to
be
remade
out
of
it
but
because
it
be
shake
it
be
a
slow
mass
get
into
action
.
I
know
this
distinction
,
it
have
real
meaning
,
I
be
say
it
again
and
again
and
now
I
begin
again
with
a
description
.




this
then
the
attacking
being
be
first
clear
to
I
in
one
have
it
as
a
slow
,
stupid
,
gelatinous
being
that
when
it
got
move
go
on
repeat
action
,
never
could
get
go
any
fast
,
have
a
nervous
anaemic
feeling
that
be
part
of
its
getting
move
and
keep
go
.
the
resist
medium
have
a
different
kind
of
action
as
I
be
explain
.
now
this
attack
be
when
it
be
vibrant
can
be
nervous
and
poignant
and
quick
than
chain
-
lightning
,
there
can
be
to
it
a
profound
complete
reaction
have
the
intensity
of
a
sensation
.
its
sensitiveness
be
different
in
kind
from
that
of
the
resist
kind
of
be
,
its
sensitiveness
be
quiver
into
action
not
a
sensitiveness
just
exist
,
but
this
be
all
too
much
to
be
now
explain
,
wait
and
I
can
tell
it
,
clear
,
always
it
have
to
be
tell
as
it
have
be
learn
by
I
very
slowly
,
each
one
only
slowly
can
know
it
,
each
one
must
wait
for
little
piece
of
it
,
always
there
will
be
come
more
and
more
of
it
,
always
there
will
he
a
telling
of
every
way
the
two
kind
of
be
be
different
in
everything
and
always
it
be
hard
to
say
it
the
difference
between
they
,
always
more
and
more
I
know
it
,
always
more
and
more
I
know
it
,
always
more
I
come
back
to
begin
again
the
knowing
of
it
,
always
I
will
tell
it
as
I
learn
it
,
sometime
I
will
have
tell
all
of
it
,
always
I
be
tell
piece
of
it
,
more
and
more
I
will
know
it
,
more
and
more
I
will
tell
it
,
sometime
it
will
be
clear
to
some
one
and
I
will
be
then
glad
of
it
.




this
then
be
attack
be
to
I
,
this
then
be
the
way
it
come
first
to
be
clear
in
I
,
in
one
in
whom
it
be
slow
move
,
and
in
other
then
I
know
it
when
it
be
quick
and
poignant
and
complete
and
I
see
it
,
and
I
know
it
as
the
same
substance
as
this
slow
move
mass
and
in
all
its
form
of
act
more
and
more
then
I
know
it
.
in
some
as
I
be
say
it
be
as
emotion
,
in
some
it
be
as
passion
,
in
some
it
be
as
sensitive
responding
;
it
have
a
way
of
thinking
,
love
,
act
,
different
in
kind
from
that
of
resist
being
and
some
time
,
and
it
be
a
very
long
time
too
I
know
it
now
I
be
begin
tell
all
I
know
all
I
be
always
learn
,
sometime
there
will
have
be
a
complete
description
of
these
two
kind
of
be
.




in
some
then
this
quick
and
poignant
and
profound
reaction
have
to
break
through
a
resist
be
lie
on
it
and
then
it
be
very
interesting
in
the
change
in
the
action
it
take
to
get
through
the
covering
,
sometimes
it
be
in
some
more
quivering
vibrant
at
the
bottom
than
through
the
rest
of
it
and
then
it
be
light
and
set
in
motion
the
rest
that
of
itself
never
have
more
activity
than
quiver
by
the
more
vibrant
part
at
the
bottom
,
sometimes
all
of
it
be
not
more
active
ever
than
quiver
,
this
be
true
in
some
,
in
some
it
be
all
vibrant
and
completely
poignantly
passionately
act
,
in
some
its
nervousness
its
most
vigorous
action
,
in
some
it
be
a
big
mass
always
slowly
move
but
would
like
to
stop
act
and
a
resolute
will
,
a
mind
,
a
conviction
,
education
in
such
a
one
keep
it
move
,
sometimes
it
stop
move
,
there
be
so
many
way
,
there
be
such
a
various
kind
of
mixing
that
can
be
in
any
one
,
sometime
there
will
be
a
history
of
each
one
,
sometime
there
will
be
a
description
of
all
the
way
resist
being
can
be
in
any
one
,
all
the
way
attack
be
can
be
in
any
one
.




this
then
be
then
one
way
I
have
be
see
kind
in
man
and
woman
,
the
way
I
see
the
bottom
nature
and
other
nature
in
they
.
always
I
see
they
as
kind
,
always
as
kind
of
substance
and
way
of
that
substance
be
in
they
as
bottom
nature
.
sometime
all
this
will
be
clear
.
this
be
then
the
way
I
see
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
this
then
make
every
one
sometime
a
clear
one
,
a
whole
one
to
I
,
this
be
now
soon
to
be
more
description
of
such
learning
by
I
,
of
such
understanding
of
the
being
in
man
and
woman
.




as
I
be
say
often
for
many
year
some
one
be
baffle
;
the
repeat
seeing
,
hearing
,
feeling
of
the
being
in
they
do
not
make
clear
the
nature
of
the
bottom
be
in
they
.
sometimes
for
many
year
some
one
be
baffle
and
then
it
be
clear
in
that
one
and
then
by
resemblance
between
that
one
and
other
one
many
be
clear
then
.
this
be
now
some
description
of
such
learning
.
this
will
be
now
little
short
description
of
learn
six
of
they
and
how
know
other
before
help
with
these
and
how
know
these
help
with
other
later
.
this
be
now
then
a
little
more
of
preliminary
studying
.




there
be
many
that
I
know
and
always
more
and
more
I
know
it
,
they
be
all
of
they
repeat
,
they
be
all
of
they
in
some
way
resemble
one
to
other
of
they
,
more
and
more
I
understand
it
,
sometimes
in
each
one
I
know
the
bottom
nature
in
they
,
sometimes
in
each
one
I
know
all
the
nature
in
they
,
sometimes
each
one
be
a
whole
one
to
I
,
sometime
of
each
one
there
be
a
complete
history
to
I
.




there
be
one
then
,
this
one
be
not
baffle
for
such
a
long
time
,
this
one
be
of
the
resist
kind
of
they
.




sometime
each
one
come
to
be
a
whole
one
to
I
.
sometime
the
bottom
nature
in
each
one
,
the
other
nature
or
nature
in
each
one
,
the
mixing
or
not
mix
in
they
of
the
nature
in
they
come
to
be
clear
in
each
one
,
each
one
then
be
a
complete
one
,
each
one
then
keep
repeat
the
whole
history
of
they
.




some
be
puzzle
a
long
time
,
every
one
be
more
or
less
puzzling
sometime
,
mostly
every
one
be
puzzle
to
I
sometime
,
sometime
mostly
every
one
come
to
be
a
whole
one
to
I
.




as
I
have
be
say
there
be
a
bottom
nature
in
every
one
,
the
other
nature
or
nature
in
they
may
be
of
their
kind
of
they
the
same
kind
as
the
bottom
nature
in
they
,
if
they
be
resist
,
the
other
nature
or
nature
in
they
may
be
of
a
kind
of
resist
,
they
may
be
of
a
kind
of
attack
be
.
all
this
make
some
one
sometimes
for
a
long
time
very
baffling
.
all
this
make
each
one
always
sometime
puzzling
.
always
more
and
more
I
know
it
of
each
one
the
being
in
they
the
mixture
in
they
,
always
more
and
more
I
will
come
to
have
a
complete
understanding
of
every
one
I
be
ever
know
.
this
be
now
a
description
of
my
understanding
of
one
.




this
one
then
be
not
baffle
for
such
a
very
long
time
,
this
one
have
time
of
be
puzzle
to
I
,
mostly
after
a
real
beginning
of
understand
it
come
to
I
very
steadily
,
not
quickly
not
slowly
,
this
one
be
of
a
resist
kind
of
they
with
the
attack
kind
of
resist
be
almost
to
the
point
of
succeed
as
part
of
the
being
in
this
one
.




this
be
now
to
be
some
description
of
this
one
.
the
first
one
of
those
that
far
back
I
be
describe
as
show
my
way
of
learn
to
have
each
one
come
to
be
a
whole
one
in
I
,
that
first
one
be
to
every
one
as
the
natural
way
of
be
be
one
have
every
one
always
want
to
have
she
be
with
they
every
one
who
know
she
then
,
and
always
every
one
be
flatter
she
to
make
it
up
to
she
that
there
be
not
ever
any
place
for
she
in
living
,
for
always
to
herself
and
to
every
one
there
be
always
a
good
reason
why
not
any
condition
be
the
right
condition
for
her
living
,
for
always
to
herself
and
to
every
one
there
be
always
a
good
reason
why
not
any
condition
be
the
right
condition
for
her
living
.
but
always
a
little
somewhere
there
be
a
feeling
that
this
be
not
all
the
meaning
in
the
being
in
this
one
,
slowly
then
some
feel
in
this
one
the
muggy
resist
bottom
that
keep
she
from
ever
give
herself
to
any
one
unless
some
one
need
she
engulf
she
by
a
need
of
she
,
they
engulf
she
then
some
when
they
have
to
have
some
one
.
slowly
then
some
come
to
know
in
this
one
the
resist
bottom
in
this
one
,
slowly
then
some
come
to
see
it
in
this
one
that
she
be
of
they
need
to
be
own
those
they
need
for
loving
,
this
be
part
of
this
kind
of
resist
be
as
I
be
say
about
Mrs.
Hersland
but
in
this
one
it
never
come
to
any
realisation
for
this
one
never
really
own
any
one
,
resist
to
keep
from
yield
to
the
need
of
have
other
people
be
have
love
feeling
,
resist
accept
just
an
ordinary
quantity
of
love
feeling
from
any
one
,
this
keep
this
one
from
yield
herself
enough
to
any
one
so
as
to
own
any
one
,
want
give
love
and
have
resist
be
keep
this
one
from
be
engulf
by
other
one
except
when
some
one
drown
this
one
,
keep
this
one
mostly
from
ever
yield
enough
to
own
any
one
.
as
I
be
say
sometimes
some
one
engulf
this
one
,
always
this
wear
out
this
one
,
it
be
never
freely
yield
herself
to
engulf
then
,
it
be
want
to
keep
ahead
of
be
engulf
by
give
and
this
be
very
wear
to
this
one
.




some
then
know
this
be
in
this
one
,
slowly
then
hear
,
feeling
,
see
all
the
repeating
in
this
one
,
slowly
then
hear
,
feeling
,
see
every
one
who
know
this
one
's
feeling
about
this
one
make
it
clear
to
I
the
whole
be
in
this
one
,
I
come
then
to
hear
repeat
the
muggy
resist
bottom
that
keep
she
ever
from
give
herself
to
any
one
unless
one
engulf
she
by
completely
use
she
,
by
a
need
of
she
to
comfort
they
in
some
sorrow
when
they
have
to
have
some
one
,
by
use
she
and
give
nothing
to
she
.
this
one
then
have
this
resist
be
that
with
all
the
need
in
she
of
have
love
give
to
she
keep
she
from
ever
give
herself
to
any
one
even
for
a
little
loving
of
such
a
one
,
keep
she
from
ever
have
a
place
for
really
live
.




but
this
be
not
all
the
meaning
in
this
one
,
she
have
in
she
to
be
muggily
resist
except
when
some
one
be
engulf
she
,
but
also
if
she
could
have
give
herself
to
some
one
it
would
be
to
own
they
.
she
be
of
the
kind
of
woman
that
have
to
own
the
one
they
need
for
loving
.
this
one
then
never
own
any
one
,
and
this
be
that
she
could
not
give
herself
enough
to
any
one
to
own
they
,
sometimes
some
one
own
this
one
but
this
one
then
be
so
drown
by
this
one
be
own
that
she
could
not
loose
herself
enough
to
own
they
,
she
could
only
cling
to
want
to
give
to
they
just
enough
to
keep
herself
from
be
completely
drown
by
that
one
's
owning
of
she
if
she
could
once
be
drown
by
some
one
completely
to
not
want
to
give
to
such
a
one
she
might
have
own
some
one
for
love
but
this
never
could
come
to
be
in
she
,
she
be
too
busy
be
drown
when
she
be
drown
,
she
have
not
then
any
strength
for
own
.
so
then
this
one
never
own
any
one
,
sometimes
she
be
almost
drown
by
engulf
by
some
one
need
she
then
.
this
be
interesting
and
now
this
one
I
be
now
to
be
describe
be
of
the
same
family
as
this
one
but
it
be
in
this
one
a
very
different
thing
this
one
can
engulf
those
this
one
need
for
living
.
this
will
be
very
interesting
.




this
be
a
little
of
the
way
I
feel
the
resist
being
in
this
one
and
this
be
the
way
it
act
in
this
one
.
later
then
,
and
I
have
already
be
begin
,
I
will
then
compare
it
with
the
resist
being
in
one
.
these
two
then
be
of
the
same
kind
of
they
but
this
be
in
they
be
very
different
in
its
action
.
to
begin
then
.




the
first
one
the
one
when
it
be
lightish
brown
and
gritty
a
little
and
sometimes
very
fluid
and
thin
and
sometimes
almost
dry
hard
and
not
really
smooth
then
,
in
this
one
then
it
have
a
very
different
action
this
bottom
nature
from
that
in
the
one
where
it
be
dark
and
smooth
and
murky
and
always
about
the
same
state
of
be
a
thickish
fluid
state
there
in
she
.
these
then
be
two
kind
of
a
kind
of
man
and
woman
.
this
be
now
some
description
of
the
difference
in
be
and
act
,
resist
and
attack
,
love
,
own
,
yield
,
have
vanity
and
stupid
be
in
they
,
practical
and
ideal
be
in
they
.




the
first
one
then
as
I
be
say
have
as
bottom
nature
in
her
being
,
resist
,
this
be
then
the
action
of
this
bottom
nature
in
she
that
she
never
really
give
herself
to
any
one
to
own
they
,
though
always
she
want
to
be
give
herself
to
some
one
,
always
she
want
to
be
own
every
one
,
sometimes
some
one
would
be
engulf
this
one
,
but
she
be
resist
then
,
and
once
when
she
be
not
resist
some
one
engulf
she
so
completely
that
what
she
be
,
the
bottom
be
in
she
,
be
water
so
thin
that
it
be
not
of
strength
enough
to
cling
to
any
one
as
dirt
to
hold
they
,
to
stick
on
they
as
it
would
if
it
be
thick
enough
to
own
to
inclose
they
by
encase
they
.
this
be
true
then
that
this
one
have
it
to
be
that
the
resist
substance
be
sometimes
very
thin
and
never
thick
but
sometimes
almost
dry
up
into
a
grey
brown
,
it
look
browner
thin
,
a
little
more
grey
when
it
be
not
wet
,
very
thin
,
stuff
in
she
.
this
be
in
she
then
make
it
that
this
one
never
give
herself
to
any
one
and
never
own
any
one
,
sometimes
be
drown
by
some
one
,
always
be
a
little
gritty
to
the
feeling
of
every
one
.
another
one
then
one
I
be
now
begin
to
describe
as
know
,
this
one
then
be
dark
,
smooth
,
thick
always
a
thick
fluid
in
the
being
in
she
,
in
the
bottom
nature
of
she
.
there
be
many
man
and
many
woman
of
both
these
two
kind
of
the
one
kind
of
they
,
the
resist
engulfing
kind
of
they
,
of
man
and
woman
.




this
second
one
then
have
as
I
be
say
a
thick
dark
smoother
,
always
as
a
thick
fluid
,
the
bottom
nature
in
she
.
this
one
then
have
a
power
of
engulf
some
she
need
for
live
,
this
one
then
could
own
some
but
mostly
this
one
do
not
need
any
one
,
this
be
in
she
be
enough
to
give
to
she
a
sense
of
superiority
inside
she
,
she
have
in
she
the
sense
of
completely
engulf
anything
she
need
for
living
and
so
she
have
in
she
a
complete
vanity
a
complete
sense
of
superiority
to
every
one
.
the
other
one
have
a
sense
of
be
aggrieve
at
never
really
own
any
one
.
this
one
in
her
thick
,
dark
,
murky
smooth
bottom
being
have
not
any
such
feeling
,
mostly
this
one
be
not
engulf
any
one
but
the
sensation
of
the
feeling
of
potential
engulfing
give
to
this
one
a
complete
sense
of
superior
be
to
every
one
,
there
be
no
need
then
in
this
one
for
action
.
the
other
one
,
the
first
one
,
from
she
never
own
any
one
and
have
the
feeling
of
not
engulf
any
one
need
that
every
one
should
be
flattering
to
keep
this
one
from
feel
too
much
the
fact
I
hat
there
be
no
place
for
live
for
this
one
,
the
other
one
do
not
need
such
consolation
,
there
be
not
any
place
for
live
for
the
other
one
but
this
be
not
a
need
to
she
,
the
vanity
in
she
from
the
bottom
substance
of
she
make
she
completely
then
impervious
to
the
need
of
any
place
for
living
,
this
one
then
when
she
be
not
engulf
any
one
and
mostly
this
one
be
not
engulf
any
one
this
one
be
then
engulf
her
own
self
in
the
bottom
nature
in
she
and
this
give
to
she
a
complete
vanity
of
be
in
she
,
always
there
be
there
in
she
herself
to
be
completely
engulf
in
the
bottom
nature
of
she
and
this
give
to
herself
a
sense
of
power
and
this
be
complete
vanity
in
she
and
there
be
then
no
need
in
she
of
a
place
for
live
for
she
.




sometimes
the
being
in
she
lead
to
reckless
outbreak
from
she
.
as
I
be
say
resist
be
as
its
way
of
attack
,
attack
mostly
in
such
man
and
woman
have
not
in
it
the
strength
for
win
fighting
,
mostly
it
be
weak
than
the
personal
quality
of
resist
in
such
of
they
.
in
some
who
have
resist
being
,
attack
be
their
way
of
living
and
mostly
such
of
they
be
not
very
strong
in
win
in
living
or
in
fight
although
they
be
,
some
of
such
a
kind
of
they
,
fairly
successful
in
practical
living
.
win
in
love
or
in
fighting
be
the
test
in
such
of
they
.
some
time
this
will
be
clear
in
they
,
the
man
and
woman
have
resist
being
,
sometime
there
will
be
very
much
description
of
the
way
of
attack
in
these
man
and
woman
having
resist
be
as
their
natural
way
of
be
,
as
their
way
of
loving
,
as
their
way
of
win
fighting
.




the
first
one
,
the
one
I
be
before
describe
,
this
one
have
attack
in
living
but
mostly
it
be
in
she
as
the
finding
of
their
be
no
place
to
she
for
live
,
this
be
mostly
all
there
be
of
attack
be
in
she
,
always
know
,
always
find
the
good
reason
why
not
any
place
be
a
place
for
live
to
she
.
the
other
one
have
it
as
make
she
sometimes
have
reckless
be
in
she
,
attack
be
at
moment
be
in
she
,
she
be
then
not
to
herself
engulf
any
one
but
the
sense
of
superiority
always
in
she
the
vanity
that
be
completely
inside
she
there
could
let
she
be
reckless
in
attack
and
mostly
she
be
then
not
succeed
,
but
this
do
not
then
lead
to
any
thing
for
always
there
be
in
she
complete
the
vanity
and
superiority
inside
she
that
the
power
of
completely
engulf
herself
always
make
in
she
.
these
two
be
different
then
,
the
difference
be
interesting
.
they
be
then
two
kind
of
one
kind
of
a
general
kind
of
be
in
man
and
woman
,
they
have
each
of
they
then
as
a
bottom
nature
in
they
one
kind
of
one
kind
of
a
general
resist
kind
of
be
.




there
be
another
thing
in
the
two
of
they
,
efficiency
in
do
anything
.
always
in
the
first
one
there
be
a
desire
to
run
thing
and
this
one
do
not
do
these
thing
very
well
nor
very
badly
either
but
to
herself
efficiency
be
strong
in
she
and
this
be
part
of
the
wanting
to
own
other
one
for
her
living
and
mostly
they
do
not
really
have
she
own
they
and
this
always
be
part
to
she
of
there
not
be
any
place
for
live
for
she
.
own
other
be
a
right
to
she
,
do
it
be
not
ever
very
successful
in
she
,
always
then
this
one
have
this
desire
and
always
then
this
one
do
not
ever
give
herself
to
do
it
for
any
one
for
really
this
one
must
own
another
one
to
really
contentedly
to
herself
to
do
the
thing
for
that
other
one
.
sometimes
as
I
be
say
some
one
engulfs
this
one
and
then
this
one
can
do
thing
for
the
other
one
,
it
be
the
near
to
own
any
one
this
one
ever
come
to
do
in
living
.
always
then
not
own
any
one
be
the
tragedy
in
this
one
,
always
every
one
flatter
this
one
to
make
this
one
feel
a
little
moment
that
this
one
own
they
or
some
other
one
.
the
second
one
,
engulf
herself
give
power
to
this
one
,
superiority
in
herself
to
every
one
,
and
complete
vanity
then
be
in
she
,
this
one
do
not
need
do
anything
for
any
one
to
give
to
she
a
sense
of
own
they
.
this
one
be
efficient
enough
in
act
.
mostly
to
this
one
this
be
not
interesting
.
these
then
have
in
they
two
kind
of
engulf
resist
be
as
bottom
nature
in
they
.




every
one
have
their
own
being
in
they
.
every
one
be
of
a
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
each
one
have
a
bottom
nature
in
they
,
this
nature
be
of
a
kind
of
nature
that
make
a
kind
in
man
and
woman
.




everybody
be
a
real
one
to
I
,
everybody
be
like
some
one
else
too
to
I
.
there
will
be
now
more
description
of
kind
in
man
and
woman
,
of
the
likeness
and
unlikeness
between
they
,
of
see
kind

they
may
be
all
resist
,
some
kind
of
resist
and
some
attack
,
all
of
the
other
nature
in
they
may
be
of
kind
of
attack
,
if
the
bottom
nature
in
they
be
a
kind
of
attack
be
the
other
nature
or
nature
in
they
may
be
of
kind
of
resist
,
of
kind
of
attack
,
some
of
kind
of
resist
,
some
of
kind
of
attack
,
some
may
have
only
a
bottom
nature
to
they
,
some
may
have
almost
,
nothing
of
bottom
nature
to
they
,
there
be
every
kind
of
mixing
,
mostly
in
each
one
it
be
very
confusing
,
often
each
one
one
be
ever
know
be
for
a
long
time
baffling
.




some
be
puzzle
a
long
time
,
almost
every
one
be
more
or
less
puzzling
to
every
one
,
mostly
every
one
be
puzzle
to
I
,
sometime
mostly
every
one
come
to
be
a
whole
one
to
I
.




always
then
I
be
learn
some
one
.
mostly
every
one
come
very
slowly
to
be
a
whole
one
to
I
.
mostly
everyone
be
sometimes
and
mostly
for
a
very
long
time
a
puzzle
to
I
,
sometimes
some
one
only
after
a
long
time
of
learn
that
one
come
to
be
a
conscious
puzzle
to
I
.




some
can
have
a
bottom
with
other
nature
or
nature
in
they
not
mix
up
with
the
bottom
nature
in
they
.
such
of
they
be
very
puzzling
and
when
sometimes
such
a
one
be
a
whole
to
one
such
one
always
be
in
part
to
one
but
all
the
part
be
there
in
that
one
to
one
and
all
always
repeat
in
that
one
and
all
repeat
come
out
of
such
a
one
have
meaning
as
part
in
one
.
when
some
one
be
not
a
whole
one
to
one
repeat
come
out
of
they
have
not
this
clear
relation
.
such
a
one
as
I
be
now
describe
be
not
in
piece
,
be
a
whole
one
.
all
of
such
a
one
be
almost
completely
one
and
then
the
bottom
of
that
one
be
of
a
different
kind
from
the
rest
of
the
whole
one
and
that
make
this
one
not
confusing
but
baffling
and
sometimes
a
clear
whole
one
,
and
then
at
last
a
completer
whole
one
.
when
some
one
be
not
a
whole
one
to
one
repeat
come
out
of
they
have
not
clear
relation
but
sometimes
repeat
come
out
of
one
have
the
clear
relation
of
a
whole
one
and
it
be
not
the
whole
of
that
one
that
the
one
feel
the
clear
relation
in
all
the
repeating
be
really
know
,
there
be
a
bottom
nature
that
be
different
from
all
the
rest
of
that
one
.
soon
or
later
some
one
know
this
will
know
it
of
this
one
,
in
the
beginning
of
not
be
certain
that
the
whole
one
one
be
know
be
the
whole
of
that
one
be
a
strange
feeling
,
not
doubt
,
not
puzzle
,
not
baffle
,
just
incompletion
.
then
such
a
one
be
a
little
puzzling
until
that
one
come
to
be
a
whole
whole
one
.
then
the
repeat
come
out
of
such
a
one
have
clear
meaning
.




this
be
one
,
that
I
be
now
describe
,
be
to
this
one
and
to
every
one
,
of
the
resist
kind
of
they
,
slow
,
earthy
,
dependent
independent
kind
of
they
and
as
such
a
one
be
to
this
one
and
to
every
one
that
know
this
one
a
whole
one
.
the
bottom
be
in
this
one
be
not
resist
be
,
it
be
attack
being
,
reaction
in
this
one
be
poignant
and
quick
in
this
one
but
it
be
to
this
one
and
to
every
one
who
know
this
one
slow
in
this
one
because
it
pass
through
the
whole
rest
of
this
one
that
be
resist
,
slow
,
earthy
kind
of
be
and
so
this
one
be
not
slow
-
minded
but
long
-
wind
,
this
one
have
complete
quick
poignant
decision
and
reaction
and
then
pass
through
the
rest
of
be
in
this
one
it
make
it
to
be
to
this
one
that
it
be
slow
-
decide
,
germinate
in
this
one
and
it
be
no
such
thing
.
this
be
interesting
to
know
for
this
one
have
be
a
whole
one
to
the
other
way
of
feel
this
one
,
but
it
be
not
the
whole
of
this
one
,
and
this
understanding
of
this
one
give
a
completely
new
meaning
to
the
being
,
to
the
history
of
this
one
.




to
explain
again
.
this
one
be
mostly
smooth
,
resist
self
-
sustain
,
dependent
independent
being
,
this
be
the
being
in
this
one
to
this
one
and
mostly
to
every
one
,
only
the
history
of
the
living
of
this
one
be
not
completely
what
the
history
of
such
being
be
in
those
have
such
be
as
the
whole
of
they
.
mostly
this
be
not
puzzle
as
it
might
be
some
other
thing
in
this
one
,
some
incompletion
of
condition
in
this
one
,
and
this
one
be
as
this
be
so
completely
a
whole
one
.
then
it
come
to
be
clear
in
this
one
that
this
be
not
the
whole
of
this
one
.
the
bottom
nature
,
and
the
bottom
nature
in
this
one
always
be
act
but
never
to
this
one
in
the
talking
this
one
do
of
the
being
in
this
one
to
any
one
be
it
exist
,
nor
to
any
one
not
pay
much
attention
to
the
history
of
the
living
in
this
one
but
just
to
the
way
of
do
thing
in
this
one
be
it
exist
,
the
bottom
be
in
this
one
as
I
be
say
always
be
there
act
and
sometime
it
be
clear
to
some
one
that
this
one
be
not
at
the
bottom
slow
,
resist
,
self
-
sustain
,
dependent
independent
being
,
at
the
bottom
this
one
be
quick
feeling
,
attack
,
sensitive
,
independent
dependent
being
and
that
give
to
the
history
of
this
one
a
new
meaning
.




there
be
one
thing
very
interesting
.
those
who
have
this
kind
of
mixing
,
all
of
they
one
thing
except
just
the
bottom
and
that
not
mix
with
the
rest
of
they
but
always
act
,
be
always
romantic
in
their
notion
of
themselves
in
live
.
this
be
a
natural
thing
,
everything
in
they
be
one
thing
,
resist
or
attack
be
as
it
may
happen
,
everything
they
or
any
one
can
see
in
they
be
this
thing
then
a
complete
one
and
yet
the
bottom
of
they
always
act
be
another
thing
.
this
be
bind
to
make
they
,
such
of
they
,
have
a
complete
creation
of
their
own
be
a
complete
conception
of
their
own
being
and
always
it
be
not
the
whole
be
in
they
,
indeed
it
be
never
the
true
meaning
of
their
being
and
so
they
have
many
of
they
a
very
romantic
feeling
in
be
.
this
be
very
interesting
.
there
be
many
way
of
have
romantic
feeling
of
one
's
own
being
,
this
be
one
of
they
,
sometime
there
will
be
description
of
many
of
they
.
it
be
very
interesting
to
know
all
the
way
of
have
romantic
feeling
of
one
's
self
in
living
.
these
then
that
I
have
be
just
describe
be
not
romantic
in
living
,
the
bottom
be
in
they
be
too
actually
act
in
they
and
that
determine
the
history
of
they
,
they
be
romantic
in
the
contemplation
of
their
personality
,
not
know
the
determine
thing
in
they
the
bottom
being
and
so
they
romantically
conceive
themselves
as
a
whole
of
what
be
all
they
but
the
bottom
be
in
they
that
really
determine
the
being
,
way
of
do
,
the
history
of
they
.




now
there
will
be
a
description
of
another
kind
of
contradiction
between
bottom
nature
and
the
other
nature
in
man
and
woman
.
to
begin
again
then
.




this
one
then
too
be
of
the
kind
of
they
that
have
it
to
be
a
romantic
temperament
,
a
feeling
of
themselves
as
be
guide
by
a
destiny
always
from
the
beginning
and
unchanging
.
all
of
these
then
,
this
last
one
and
this
one
,
have
it
to
be
to
themselves
that
they
be
as
they
be
and
nothing
can
change
they
,
not
from
firmness
of
will
in
they
,
not
from
intention
or
resolution
in
they
,
but
from
the
destiny
of
they
always
in
they
from
the
beginning
.
these
be
then
this
kind
of
man
and
woman
,
all
of
this
kind
of
romantic
temperament
with
to
they
a
fix
destiny
in
they
,
all
of
these
then
be
an
almost
complete
one
thing
with
another
bottom
,
this
keep
they
such
of
they
from
be
a
complete
unification
of
be
,
the
bottom
of
they
that
be
the
opposite
kind
of
be
,
if
they
be
all
resist
then
the
bottom
always
active
in
they
be
attack
be
with
all
the
quality
of
that
kind
of
attack
being
,
if
all
the
rest
of
they
be
attack
be
the
bottom
being
in
such
of
they
and
always
active
in
they
be
resist
be
with
all
the
quality
of
that
kind
of
resist
being
,
this
make
in
such
of
they
romantic
feeling
of
themselves
as
be
unchanging
.
they
,
this
kind
of
man
and
woman
only
know
in
themselves
all
except
the
bottom
be
in
they
and
that
make
they
to
themselves
unchanging
,
have
a
destiny
from
the
beginning
,
these
then
do
not
know
in
themselves
the
bottom
being
that
interfere
and
act
and
sometimes
to
they
spoil
their
history
for
they
,
these
then
only
know
in
themselves
all
the
rest
of
themselves
except
the
bottom
be
in
they
.
this
be
very
interesting
.
perhaps
Napoleon
be
one
of
this
kind
of
man
and
woman
.




this
one
that
I
be
now
describe
have
it
to
be
all
of
the
being
except
the
bottom
be
overwhelmingly
powerful
attack
being
,
and
as
a
bottom
be
there
be
in
this
one
the
earthy
type
that
be
of
the
kind
of
resist
being
that
be
earthy
,
indolent
,
slowly
engulf
.
this
one
then
have
it
to
have
as
a
bottom
be
indolent
earthy
being
,
practical
and
easy
and
slowly
engulf
in
its
natural
way
of
win
,
with
not
much
energy
in
acting
,
with
almost
not
anything
of
attack
being
of
the
resist
being
and
this
be
just
there
as
a
bottom
,
all
the
rest
of
the
being
in
this
one
which
be
destiny
and
live
to
this
one
be
keen
and
synthetic
and
poignant
and
complete
attack
being
.




all
through
the
early
living
of
this
one
the
bottom
being
be
just
there
alive
in
this
one
and
always
act
but
so
to
speak
not
interfere
to
domination
,
to
be
the
real
being
in
this
one
as
control
being
.
More
and
more
as
this
one
grow
old
and
the
fire
of
youth
and
the
energy
in
this
one
do
not
hold
the
whole
of
this
one
together
,
the
nature
in
this
one
separate
into
the
top
and
bottom
both
active
but
not
act
together
.
this
make
this
one
then
stupidly
obstinate
with
the
attack
top
in
this
one
,
lethargic
with
the
resist
indolent
bottom
in
this
one
,
vain
-
glorious
with
the
sense
of
destiny
and
success
of
the
top
being
in
this
one
and
nervously
irritable
with
the
disturbed
bottom
be
in
this
one
.
this
be
then
one
kind
of
be
in
man
and
woman
,
these
then
have
be
two
example
of
this
kind
of
be
,
sometime
every
one
will
understand
all
be
in
man
and
woman
.




these
then
be
one
kind
of
way
of
be
one
with
the
bottom
attacking
,
one
with
the
bottom
the
resist
kind
of
they
,
these
,
two
I
have
be
just
describe
.
then
these
be
one
kind
of
way
of
be
these
two
that
I
have
be
just
describe
where
there
be
the
contradiction
I
have
be
just
explain
.
now
this
be
to
be
a
description
of
a
kind
of
be
where
all
the
nature
be
of
one
kind
of
be
and
yet
where
there
be
a
contradiction
in
the
being
.

begin
then
.




mostly
every
one
be
sometime
and
sometimes
for
a
very
long
time
puzzle
.
this
one

this
now
,
now
when
I
be
still
a
little
puzzling
at
it
.
sometime
I
will
understand
it
,
then
I
will
tell
more
of
it
.
now
I
tell
it
when
now
I
be
still
puzzle
at
it
.




each
one
then
be
of
a
kind
of
man

go
to
describe
a
little
be
each
one
of
they
of
one
kind
of
be
completely
.
each
one
of
they
be
puzzle
,
one
,
the
first
one
be
a
very
long
time
to
I
baffle
,
this
be
a
very
curious
thing
and
I
will
now
begin
to
tell
about
it
,
to
explain
it
,
the
being
in
this
one
,
the
learning
in
I
of
the
being
in
this
one
.
I
tell
it
now
when
now
it
be
still
a
little
puzzling
.
I
know
it
a
little
and
I
begin
now
to
tell
all
I
know
yet
of
it
.




every
one
have
their
own
being
in
they
.
every
one
be
of
a
kind
of
man
and
woman
.
each
one
be
a
separate
one
and
yet
always
repeat
.




there
be
then
many
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
there
be
two
kind
of
they
,
there
be
many
kind
of
these
kind
of
they
,
there
be
many
kind
in
each
one
of
the
many
kind
of
each
kind
of
they
.




suppose
there
be
one
kind
of
they
,
that
some
one
know
say
ten
of
that
kind
of
they
among
those
that
one
have
come
to
know
in
living
.
now
in
these
ten
of
that
kind
of
they
some
have
this
kind
of
be
that
make
this
kind
of
they
as
bottom
being
,
some
have
other
kind
of
be
mix
up
in
they
with
this
bottom
be
in
they
.
some
of
these
ten
of
they
have
not
this
kind
of
be
as
bottom
be
in
they
,
they
have
some
other
kind
of
be
in
they
and
have
this
kind
of
be
,
that
of
the
ten
of
they
,
mix
with
the
bottom
be
in
they
.
there
be
some
of
these
ten
of
they
that
have
in
they
only
this
be
in
they
,
the
being
that
make
alike
these
ten
of
they
in
their
way
of
be
,
do
everything
,
feeling
,
love
.




as
I
be
say
each
kind
of
they
have
its
own
way
of
be
stupid
,
be
love
,
be
good
,
be
bad
,
win
fighting
,
believe
in
themselves
as
be
good
,
believe
in
themselves
as
be
bad
.




each
one
have
in
he
,
have
in
her
their
own
kind
of
be
,
each
one
have
in
he
,
have
in
she
that
kind
of
be
strong
in
some
part
than
in
other
part
of
they
,
some
have
it
in
they
drier
,
wetter
,
strong
,
weak
,
the
kind
of
be
that
be
their
kind
of
be
in
they
.




More
and
more
I
would
like
to
make
it
clear
to
some
one
how
I
see
man
and
woman
,
how
I
see
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
I
know
a
good
deal
of
it
now
though
always
I
be
puzzle
,
begin
again
and
again
and
again
,
feel
it
all
be
fabrication
and
always
I
be
know
that
really
I
see
a
very
certain
thing
in
my
way
of
see
kind
in
man
and
woman
,
that
I
be
really
understand
the
meaning
of
the
being
in
they
.
I
know
a
great
deal
then
and
I
tell
it
now
when
I
be
still
puzzle
.




this
be
a
hard
thing
I
be
now
begin
explain
,
it
be
a
fairly
clear
thing
now
to
I
,
it
be
not
all
clear
yet
to
I
,
I
tell
it
now
when
now
I
be
still
have
a
good
deal
of
puzzle
thinking
in
my
learning
understanding
.




there
be
one
then
and
he
be
very
puzzling
.
this
one
be
to
I
a
very
long
time
very
baffling
.
this
one
seem
all
of
one
kind
of
be
,
this
one
seem
a
whole
be
to
I
always
and
always
I
be
not
understand
.
this
one
have
be
and
be
really
something
in
living
,
this
one
have
do
important
working
,
this
one
be
a
whole
one
and
yet
this
one
be
not
a
whole
one
and
yet
surely
there
be
in
this
one
only
one
kind
of
be
,
it
be
very
puzzling
.




say
these
ten
then
,
they
each
one
have
in
they
some
way
,
somehow
,
in
some
part
of
they
a
be
common
to
all
of
they
.
each
one
of
they
have
his
or
her
own
being
,
each
one
of
they
be
separate
and
resemble
.
each
one
of
they
have
a
kind
of
be
in
they
,
some
of
they
have
several
kind
of
be
mix
up
in
they
,
all
of
they
have
one
certain
kind
of
be
in
they
,
some
of
they
have
only
that
one
kind
of
be
in
they
.
the
one
I
be
now
think
of
describe
be
one
of
such
of
they
,
this
one
then
have
one
kind
of
be
and
this
be
clear
and
yet
this
one
be
a
contradiction
inside
he
,
this
one
be
for
a
long
time
very
baffling
.
this
one
be
now
fairly
clear
to
my
understanding
,
I
be
describe
this
one
now
when
I
be
still
a
little
puzzling
over
this
one
.




I
know
for
fairly
certain
now
something
of
the
meaning
of
the
being
in
this
one
and
I
be
now
begin
the
telling
of
the
meaning
of
the
being
in
this
one
though
now
still
I
be
a
little
puzzle
over
understand
this
one
.




as
I
be
say
,
take
one
kind
of
being
,
say
ten
man
and
woman
have
this
kind
of
be
,
some
of
these
ten
have
other
kind
of
be
mix
up
in
they
but
that
be
not
what
I
be
now
discuss
.




as
I
be
say
,
take
ten
man
and
woman
have
in
they
a
kind
of
be
in
they
,
not
a
general
kind
of
resemblance
between
they
but
a
pretty
close
resemblance
between
they
,
this
be
now
a
pretty
small
subdivision
of
man
and
woman
,
of
course
there
be
many
million
always
live
of
this
kind
of
they
but
say
I
have
in
all
my
living
know
ten
of
they
,
that
be
now
a
subdivision
,
a
particular
kind
of
they
that
have
each
one
of
they
a
kind
of
be
in
they
that
be
very
definite
in
its
character
in
each
one
of
they
give
to
each
one
of
they
a
very
definite
way
of
learning
,
love
,
fighting
,
escape
,
have
stupid
be
in
they
,
have
moral
or
unmoral
or
immoral
meaning
in
they
.




this
then
now
be
clear
,
this
be
a
definite
kind
of
be
,
this
be
in
some
way
in
all
of
these
ten
man
and
woman
.
this
kind
of
they
be
one
subdivision
of
attack
be
.
this
kind
of
they
have
it
in
they
to
mostly
succeed
fairly
well
in
living
,
some
of
course
be
fail
,
some
of
every
kind
of
be
be
succeed
and
some
be
fail
but
some
of
kind
of
man
and
woman
have
it
to
have
more
of
they
succeed
than
fail
,
some
kind
of
they
have
more
of
they
fail
than
succeed
,
some
kind
of
they
have
it
to
be
divide
about
even
in
succeed
and
fail
in
living
.




this
kind
of
be
then
that
all
these
ten
have
in
they
be
a
kind
of
attack
being
.
in
these
attacking
be
mostly
not
very
active
in
they
,
love
in
they
be
attack
being
and
most
of
they
have
it
to
have
love
strongly
in
they
but
in
most
of
they
love
be
in
they
be
overflow
into
nervous
being
in
they
,
this
nervous
be
in
they
be
not
energy
in
they
as
it
be
in
some
where
loving
be
nervous
being
,
in
these
of
they
nervous
being
be
an
excess
in
they
,
they
have
much
passion
in
they
,
it
be
active
in
they
,
it
be
nervous
be
in
they
,
nervous
be
in
they
be
not
active
love
or
attack
be
in
they
.
this
be
very
clear
in
they
to
any
one
know
they
,
every
one
mostly
who
know
a
fair
number
of
man
and
woman
know
certainly
some
of
they
,
sometime
some
one
perhaps
will
know
the
kind
of
man
and
woman
I
be
now
try
describe
.
it
be
very
discouraging
,
I
begin
again
.




this
kind
of
they
then
have
not
attack
as
very
active
in
they
,
mostly
they
have
in
they
much
love
but
there
be
in
it
so
much
nervous
be
drain
they
,
not
enter
into
the
active
being
in
they
that
many
of
they
be
not
really
active
in
love
.
this
kind
of
they
,
the
kind
of
be
these
ten
have
in
common
be
very
clear
to
I
from
know
these
ten
of
they
,
I
will
now
begin
again
to
try
to
describe
they
.




these
then
as
I
be
say
,
those
have
this
be
in
they
be
of
the
attack
kind
in
man
and
woman
,
they
most
of
they
succeed
very
well
in
living
,
most
of
they
have
very
considerable
love
be
in
they
,
most
of
they
have
much
nervous
be
in
they
.
the
nervous
be
not
be
energy
in
they
give
to
many
of
they
the
appearance
of
there
be
much
repression
in
they
,
this
be
not
as
true
of
they
as
it
seem
from
the
nervous
being
always
show
.
the
repression
be
an
interpretation
other
have
of
they
for
this
kind
of
nervous
being
that
these
have
in
they
that
be
not
energy
in
they
be
something
like
the
nervous
being
that
be
generate
in
some
man
and
woman
whose
nervous
being
be
energy
in
they
,
from
repression
.




all
of
they
have
this
same
kind
of
nervous
be
in
they
then
,
all
of
they
of
whom
I
have
be
speak
,
these
ten
of
they
.
some
have
it
more
,
some
have
it
less
in
they
,
all
of
they
have
it
in
they
and
it
be
not
energy
in
they
,
it
be
not
from
repression
in
they
,
it
be
part
of
their
kind
of
be
,
those
who
have
attack
being
but
not
much
attack
action
in
they
,
a
considerable
capacity
for
succeed
,
a
considerable
capacity
for
loving
.
it
be
very
important
to
know
then
that
in
this
kind
of
they
nervous
being
be
not
energy
of
action
,
not
a
result
of
suppress
themselves
in
their
loving
or
their
living
.




mostly
this
kind
of
man
and
woman
have
it
in
they
to
have
more
loving
,
nervous
being
,
intelligence
,
success
in
living
,
than
activity
in
attack
,
emotion
and
feeling
and
enthusiasm
.
these
then
have
mostly
much
common
sense
but
these
have
not
much
practical
sense
in
living
.
all
this
be
very
interesting
and
so
now
I
must
begin
again
.




these
ten
of
they
have
in
they
the
same
kind
of
be
.
there
will
be
now
some
more
description
of
the
being
in
they
.
this
last
that
I
have
be
say
about
the
practical
sense
in
they
be
not
very
well
express
yet
and
so
now
I
will
try
again
.




this
kind
of
be
be
as
I
be
say
an
attacking
be
with
not
very
much
attack
fighting
in
they
,
these
have
in
they
mostly
the
quality
of
succeed
well
enough
in
living
,
they
be
opportunist
in
living
and
they
have
moral
conviction
.
let
I
begin
again
then
,
I
will
begin
again
to
explain
the
being
in
they
.




as
I
be
say
early
those
have
attack
being
have
it
in
they
to
have
in
they
a
strong
sense
of
the
meaning
,
the
emotion
,
the
use
of
the
fact
every
one
know
in
living
.
those
have
in
they
resist
be
have
strong
in
they
a
realisation
of
the
thing
itself
that
make
the
fact
rather
than
the
sense
of
the
meaning
of
the
thing
,
the
use
of
it
.
the
resist
kind
can
love
money
and
live
not
for
the
use
,
emotion
,
meaning
,
but
for
the
thing
itself
as
a
thing
exist
.
sometime
I
will
make
this
clear
but
this
must
do
now
as
a
beginning
.




this
kind
then
that
I
be
now
describe
have
as
I
be
say
attack
being
but
not
much
activity
in
attack
,
they
have
sense
for
fact
as
attack
be
have
they
but
they
have
not
much
instinctive
emotion
about
they
or
sense
of
the
use
of
they
,
they
have
in
short
no
dramatic
sense
for
fact
in
living
but
being
of
the
attack
kind
of
be
these
have
a
sense
for
the
meaning
of
fact
in
being
and
so
it
come
that
this
kind
of
they
be
opportunistic
,
highly
rationalising
,
unimaginative
,
have
no
instinct
for
meaning
in
anything
but
regard
only
the
meaning
and
the
use
in
thing
,
have
no
instinct
for
quality
in
people
but
want
completely
to
understand
and
use
they
.




I
will
take
for
more
understanding
of
they
the
moral
sense
in
they
.
say
one
of
such
of
they
be
as
be
true
of
most
of
they
strongly
want
success
in
living
,
such
a
one
know
then
that
honesty
be
the
good
policy
for
he
.
this
one
then
will
completely
realise
the
meaning
in
this
saying
,
to
he
it
be
wisdom
,
as
the
way
necessary
for
he
to
be
act
to
be
succeed
.
so
far
it
be
opportunism
in
he
,
the
embracing
of
this
conviction
that
honesty
be
the
test
policy
for
he
.
this
then
be
the
meaning
to
he
in
honest
living
,
and
then
such
a
one
embrace
this
as
a
moral
principle
,
such
a
one
then
hold
to
this
if
it
mean
ruin
to
he
,
such
a
one
have
rationally
and
opportunistically
embrace
this
way
of
be
,
this
one
then
make
of
this
an
absolute
conviction
,
a
complete
moral
principle
for
live
,
this
one
then
have
no
sense
for
opportunistically
adapt
himself
in
detail
in
living
,
such
a
one
have
no
practical
dramatic
sense
for
living
,
such
a
one
have
attack
being
but
no
activity
in
attack
,
such
a
one
have
embrace
a
creed
from
the
sense
of
succeed
,
of
rational
opportunism
,
it
be
then
a
moral
conviction
in
this
one
,
this
one
then
have
no
imagination
for
fact
or
people
but
this
one
can
build
a
complete
system
for
living
and
if
such
a
one
have
a
good
head
on
he
,
such
a
one
be
mostly
successful
enough
in
living
.
Herbert
Spencer
be
such
a
kind
of
one
.




these
then
,
these
ten
of
they
have
it
to
have
in
common
a
kind
of
be
that
be
of
the
attack
kind
of
be
but
these
have
not
much
activity
of
attack
in
they
,
many
of
these
be
successful
enough
in
living
,
mostly
these
have
pretty
strongly
love
be
in
they
,
these
have
mostly
strongly
nervousness
in
they
and
this
nervousness
be
not
part
of
energy
in
they
,
it
be
not
energy
in
they
and
that
be
the
reason
there
be
very
little
attack
be
in
they
,
it
be
something
like
that
kind
of
nervousness
that
come
from
repression
in
some
man
and
woman
but
mostly
repression
be
not
in
this
kind
of
they
,
mostly
these
be
opportunist
at
the
bottom
of
they
though
they
all
of
they
mostly
at
some
time
make
of
some
principle
a
rationally
construct
system
and
then
make
of
that
system
a
moral
conviction
,
and
so
these
of
they
be
a
curious
spectacle
of
opportunism
,
rationalise
passion
,
moral
conviction
,
nervousness
,
much
love
,
emotion
.




mind
then
in
all
of
this
land
in
man
and
woman
be
highly
rationalising
,
mostly
these
have
not
much
instinct
for
be
in
thing
and
in
man
and
woman
.
what
these
realise
as
be
in
thing
and
in
man
and
woman
be
mostly
true
and
alright
for
a
beginning
for
living
but
these
then
do
not
react
to
it
in
live
,
these
rationalise
it
and
from
that
they
come
to
a
principle
in
live
that
from
then
on
all
their
life
guide
they
.
these
have
not
then
a
capacity
for
grow
from
experience
for
they
have
make
their
conviction
from
their
early
realising
and
then
it
be
in
they
a
principle
of
living
,
mostly
in
all
of
they
this
original
realisation
in
they
be
a
fairly
intelligent
rationalise
opportunism
.
perhaps
this
be
clear
now
to
some
one
.
it
be
certainly
a
clear
thing
for
some
one
to
be
understanding
,
this
be
certainly
a
clear
thing
in
this
kind
of
man
and
woman
.




these
have
then
mostly
quick
clear
mind
but
the
result
of
their
thinking
be
not
quick
in
come
as
they
be
all
of
they
complicatedly
rationalise
,
some
of
they
think
they
have
slow
mind
but
this
be
not
true
of
they
,
they
have
the
quick
mind
and
quick
impression
of
the
attack
kind
of
be
,
but
their
mind
be
so
rationalise
it
take
they
some
time
to
complete
the
whole
thing
,
their
mind
begin
with
each
thing
and
they
think
they
be
slow
in
take
impression
because
mostly
they
be
close
to
impression
from
anything
as
their
mind
when
it
be
formulate
be
occupy
the
whole
of
they
and
until
their
mind
open
they
again
they
be
close
to
impression
and
so
as
I
be
say
these
mostly
have
little
power
of
experience
.




now
all
this
lead
to
very
complicated
thing
in
each
one
have
in
they
such
a
being
,
those
have
good
mind
,
well
mind
than
capacity
for
experience
,
such
can
have
some
principle
of
growth
in
they
,
for
their
mind
can
keep
they
open
to
all
impression
they
be
capable
of
receive
and
can
make
the
most
use
of
those
impression
that
they
have
receive
inside
they
.
those
have
mind
only
about
as
strong
as
the
power
of
receive
impression
in
they
,
such
of
they
just
keep
go
,
they
be
fairly
successful
in
live
some
of
they
,
there
be
not
much
growth
in
they
.
there
be
some
of
they
who
have
fine
power
of
receive
impression
than
quality
of
mind
to
direct
they
and
these
then
more
and
more
be
stultify
in
their
living
by
run
themselves
by
their
mind
as
all
of
those
have
this
kind
of
be
always
do
run
themselves
.
this
be
now
a
description
of
learn
the
last
kind
of
one
as
a
whole
one
.
this
then
be
now
a
description
of
one
of
they
,
one
of
these
ten
of
they
.




this
one
for
many
year
be
baffle
to
I
.
it
be
evident
that
all
the
being
in
this
one
always
be
repeat
to
every
one
's
hearing
,
it
be
evident
that
in
this
one
there
be
not
a
mixture
of
many
kind
of
being
and
yet
this
one
be
baffle
,
this
one
have
strange
contradiction
in
he
.
this
one
say
of
himself
that
he
have
a
slow
-
work
mind
,
this
one
have
to
himself
and
to
every
one
a
moral
passion
for
goodness
in
he
,
this
one
be
to
every
one
generous
and
disintereste
in
thinking
and
in
be
,
this
one
be
an
opportunist
in
living
,
this
one
have
very
fine
sensibility
to
beauty
and
to
luxury
in
living
,
this
one
very
often
be
not
open
to
any
such
impression
,
this
one
have
a
passion
for
be
love
,
this
one
have
not
any
really
passionate
love
in
he
,
this
one
have
a
fix
scheme
of
live
for
grace
and
beauty
and
have
no
grace
in
he
and
no
power
of
create
beauty
in
the
condition
of
live
around
he
,
this
one
have
much
ambition
and
be
very
successful
in
live
,
this
one
then
be
baffle
and
for
a
long
long
time
I
be
puzzle
and
puzzle
and
now
this
one
be
a
clear
one
to
I
.
each
one
,
as
I
be
say
,
have
a
kind
of
be
in
they
have
that
be
in
they
in
different
intensity
,
proportion
,
they
have
in
they
too
most
of
they
different
kind
of
being
mix
up
in
they
but
that
be
not
what
I
be
now
consider
.
each
one
then
of
these
ten
of
they
of
this
kind
of
they
that
I
have
be
describe
,
all
of
these
ten
of
they
then
that
I
have
know
in
living
have
it
in
they
to
have
this
nature
in
they
the
kind
of
nature
that
be
common
to
all
these
ten
,
in
different
proportion
,
different
intensity
,
different
relation
of
one
part
to
the
other
part
of
the
nature
and
so
each
one
of
they
have
their
own
being
in
they
,
each
one
be
separate
,
each
one
be
resemble
to
the
other
of
they
.
some
of
they
have
other
nature
too
in
they
that
make
the
thing
I
have
be
describe
,
act
differently
in
they
,
some
of
they
have
this
being
that
I
have
be
describe
as
a
bottom
nature
to
they
,
other
have
it
as
a
nature
mix
up
with
another
kind
of
nature
in
they
,
one
of
they
have
it
as
the
whole
be
in
he
,
and
this
one
I
be
now
begin
to
describe
my
learning
as
a
whole
one
.
each
one
sometime
be
a
whole
one
to
I
,
each
one
sometime
be
a
whole
one
in
I
,
this
one
for
a
long
time
be
baffle
,
this
one
now
be
a
whole
one
to
I
,
this
one
now
I
be
again
begin
describe
learning
.




each
one
have
the
kind
of
be
in
they
that
I
have
be
just
describe
have
in
she
or
in
he
more
or
less
of
all
the
thing
,
all
the
thing
in
he
or
in
she
,
I
have
be
describe
.
each
one
of
these
then
have
more
or
less
opportunism
in
their
feeling
about
live
,
each
one
of
they
have
love
be
that
be
of
the
attack
kind
but
not
active
in
attack
,
often
very
desiring
,
sometimes
appear
engulfing
,
sometimes
never
come
into
the
relation
of
loving
.
each
one
of
this
kind
of
they
have
a
mind
that
be
slow
only
because
it
take
much
time
in
go
through
many
logical
process
to
a
conclusion
,
not
slow
in
actual
action
,
not
slow
in
develop
,
mostly
all
of
this
kind
of
man
and
woman
be
quite
the
same
in
way
of
thinking
,
learning
,
understanding
,
quite
from
their
beginning
,
there
be
then
in
the
mind
of
this
kind
of
man
not
much
develop
.
each
one
of
they
or
this
kind
in
man
and
woman
have
more
or
less
in
they
the
way
of
making
of
whatever
be
the
beginning
of
their
living
and
the
conclusion
from
this
begin
a
principle
that
in
some
be
like
a
firm
moral
resolution
.
in
all
of
this
kind
of
they
this
acting
of
the
mind
in
they
cut
they
off
from
experience
,
they
be
of
the
attack
kind
in
man
and
woman
,
thing
be
important
to
they
as
use
,
emotion
,
passion
give
they
meaning
but
these
have
not
any
of
they
activity
in
attack
being
and
so
they
have
not
imagination
or
dramatic
sense
of
meaning
in
they
,
they
have
not
a
spontaneous
relation
to
thing
in
living
,
in
some
way
in
each
one
of
they
it
,
the
experience
,
must
go
through
their
more
or
less
rationalise
mind
before
reaction
act
to
the
fact
be
in
they
and
so
then
they
be
not
often
get
into
trouble
but
most
of
their
living
they
be
not
experience
.
this
be
strange
in
they
when
they
have
strongly
in
they
a
love
of
beauty
and
luxury
in
they
and
this
will
be
soon
the
history
of
one
of
such
of
they
.
in
all
of
they
then
all
these
ten
who
have
it
to
have
this
be
in
common
in
they
,
in
all
of
they
there
be
more
or
less
actively
in
they
all
these
thing
I
have
be
describe
,
mostly
in
each
one
there
be
enough
more
of
one
part
than
another
part
of
this
be
in
they
to
make
the
meaning
of
their
be
a
fairly
clear
thing
in
they
,
to
make
their
living
and
their
being
have
a
fairly
clear
meaning
,
in
some
of
these
ten
there
be
other
nature
in
they
,
in
some
other
nature
as
bottom
be
in
they
but
that
we
be
not
just
now
consider
.
as
I
be
say
many
have
a
being
in
they
have
the
balance
of
that
be
in
they
so
keep
that
one
kind
of
living
,
one
kind
of
exist
be
natural
to
they
and
have
meaning
,
this
be
true
then
of
most
of
these
ten
of
whom
I
have
be
talk
,
it
be
not
true
of
all
of
they
.




in
one
the
one
I
be
now
begin
describe
,
the
one
who
be
a
long
time
baffle
to
I
,
all
these
thing
I
have
be
describe
as
the
being
of
this
one
kind
of
be
be
equally
strongly
in
he
,
all
these
thing
then
,
all
of
they
be
equally
strongly
repeat
in
he
all
through
his
living
and
so
this
one
be
baffle
,
for
mostly
in
every
one
all
the
quality
in
a
kind
of
be
be
not
equally
active
in
they
.
this
make
this
one
baffling
.
this
make
this
one
puzzle
for
this
one
have
profound
impression
by
beauty
and
this
be
complete
and
poignant
and
quick
in
he
and
he
have
the
rationalise
mind
act
on
each
piece
of
impression
and
shut
he
off
from
get
deep
and
poignant
and
complete
impression
from
thing
before
he
and
so
he
be
puzzle
,
he
have
opportunism
so
strongly
in
he
that
each
time
he
be
open
to
a
new
relation
with
anything
in
life
or
a
man
or
a
woman
he
act
in
this
way
toward
they
and
also
he
have
create
for
himself
a
whole
rationalise
scheme
of
living
of
beauty
and
goodness
and
fairness
to
every
one
because
that
be
the
way
to
make
the
living
that
would
be
successful
and
beautiful
,
to
he
.
always
to
himself
he
be
always
open
to
feel
beauty
and
goodness
and
nobility
in
living
,
always
to
himself
he
have
make
a
scheme
of
complete
living
in
luxury
and
success
and
win
admiration
,
always
to
himself
he
could
completely
understand
everything
with
his
mind
which
be
to
himself
a
great
thing
in
he
,
never
be
he
ever
know
that
his
run
himself
by
his
mind
which
be
make
always
for
he
his
theory
of
beauty
and
goodness
and
luxury
be
close
he
to
impression
of
beauty
and
luxury
and
learning
.
this
he
never
know
in
he
.
he
do
not
know
his
kind
of
a
mind
have
never
any
relation
to
experience
except
as
a
beginning
,
when
his
mind
be
work
he
be
shut
off
from
experience
,
such
be
the
way
a
mind
work
in
this
kind
of
being
,
and
so
this
one
be
baffle
,
no
one
would
ever
expect
one
person
,
one
man
or
one
woman
,
would
have
in
the
complete
form
all
the
part
of
a
kind
of
being
and
so
this
one
be
baffle
,
there
be
complete
contradiction
in
he
and
yet
he
be
all
of
one
kind
of
be
,
this
one
then
be
baffle
and
for
a
long
time
this
one
be
not
a
whole
one
to
I
and
then
I
understand
the
meaning
in
he
,
he
have
it
in
he
all
the
quality
of
this
kind
of
be
that
be
in
any
of
these
ten
that
I
have
say
all
have
in
they
this
kind
of
be
.




this
be
very
clear
to
I
now
.
now
I
be
not
any
long
puzzle
about
this
one
.
this
be
not
very
clear
yet
in
my
telling
.
this
will
be
clear
when
I
have
tell
of
the
love
be
in
this
one
.
there
be
many
way
of
have
love
feeling
,
this
one
that
I
be
now
describe
have
love
feeling
in
every
kind
of
way
any
one
have
the
kind
of
be
common
to
these
ten
could
have
it
in
she
or
in
he
.




each
kind
of
be
have
then
its
own
way
of
loving
,
of
have
love
feeling
,
of
have
it
and
have
it
to
themselves
as
themselves
act
in
it
.
this
one
,
the
one
I
be
now
describe
have
it
in
every
way
this
one
's
kind
of
be
can
have
it
.




those
have
this
kind
of
be
have
as
I
be
say
much
nervous
being
that
be
not
energy
in
they
as
attack
being
,
as
love
,
though
it
be
very
much
like
repress
active
being
or
repress
love
being
,
but
it
be
not
that
in
they
.
this
so
far
be
clear
to
I
.
I
be
tell
all
this
now
,
now
when
it
be
still
a
little
a
puzzle
to
I
.




so
then
this
one
have
all
the
way
of
have
love
be
this
kind
of
they
can
have
it
in
they
.
mostly
this
kind
in
man
and
woman
have
a
good
deal
of
love
be
in
they
,
though
in
many
of
they
it
do
not
in
they
come
to
love
any
man
or
any
woman
for
as
I
be
say
attack
be
be
not
active
in
they
,
and
in
many
of
they
love
being
be
just
there
in
they
,
be
there
in
they
as
nervous
being
be
in
they
which
be
not
attack
energy
in
they
.
generally
then
in
this
kind
of
they
although
there
be
much
love
be
in
they
it
do
not
express
itself
in
love
any
particular
one
until
some
particular
one
having
very
strongly
be
in
they
enormously
stimulate
these
make
the
love
be
in
they
active
to
love
that
one
.
it
be
not
,
and
this
be
very
important
to
know
in
they
and
to
remember
of
they
to
understand
this
kind
of
they
,
it
be
not
that
love
being
be
not
awaken
in
they
,
it
be
very
lively
in
most
of
this
kind
of
they
in
every
moment
of
the
living
of
this
kind
of
they
,
there
be
not
restraint
in
this
kind
of
they
,
it
be
that
this
kind
of
they
be
of
the
attack
kind
in
man
and
woman
and
attack
activity
be
not
active
in
they
.
this
be
now
clear
in
they
in
the
loving
in
they
,
in
the
thinking
in
they
,
in
the
practical
living
in
they
.
it
be
clear
to
I
now
of
they
.
I
be
not
now
any
long
in
a
puzzle
about
they
.
perhaps
sometime
it
will
be
clear
to
some
other
one
from
the
description
I
have
be
give
of
they
.




so
then
that
be
love
woman
in
they
,
love
man
in
they
,
but
this
be
not
the
only
love
feeling
in
they
.
these
have
in
they
another
kind
of
love
feeling
in
they
,
affection
for
goodness
and
beauty
and
nobility
in
everything
and
in
man
and
in
woman
and
an
affection
for
the
feeling
of
be
able
to
feel
inside
they
love
for
luxury
and
extravagance
and
sinning
.
I
be
now
describe
this
in
they
now
when
it
be
still
a
little
a
puzzle
to
I
.
perhaps
it
will
be
clear
to
I
.
now
I
will
tell
it
as
clearly
as
I
know
it
.
I
will
tell
it
,
a
little
confusing
it
as
I
tell
it
,
for
it
be
so
that
I
now
know
it
.
sometime
I
will
know
more
of
it
.
then
I
will
certainly
tell
more
of
it
.




they
have
then
this
kind
of
they
,
they
have
much
affectionate
be
in
they
,
not
emotional
affection
in
they
but
affection
like
the
kind
of
thinking
be
there
be
in
they
,
to
make
of
something
they
be
experience
as
important
to
they
a
principle
in
they
to
be
always
in
they
.
sometimes
this
be
affection
for
some
one
,
some
kind
of
thing
,
for
goodness
,
nobility
and
virtue
and
beauty
and
luxury
and
sin
and
succeed
in
live
by
do
anything
.
in
such
a
one
then
one
of
this
kind
of
they
affection
that
be
like
a
moral
principle
in
they
can
be
for
any
or
some
or
all
of
these
thing
that
I
have
be
name
,
and
then
it
be
with
these
then
as
in
their
living
as
I
have
describe
it
in
they
,
affection
for
any
of
these
thing
be
a
constant
thing
in
they
as
constant
as
the
rule
principle
they
embrace
with
their
mind
for
live
after
having
rationalise
it
from
some
experiencing
.
so
then
these
ten
of
this
kind
of
they
all
have
in
they
the
kind
of
love
be
this
kind
of
they
have
as
their
natural
way
of
be
.
they
have
,
most
of
they
,
very
much
love
being
,
but
they
have
not
attack
as
active
in
they
though
they
be
of
the
attack
kind
of
be
and
so
all
of
they
to
get
it
as
attack
in
they
the
love
be
in
they
have
to
have
strongly
stimulation
.
mostly
all
of
they
have
much
love
be
always
in
they
and
mostly
always
every
one
who
ever
know
any
one
of
they
know
this
in
they
but
mostly
always
as
I
be
say
they
need
very
strong
stimulation
in
the
being
in
the
other
one
to
make
it
an
attack
thing
in
they
.
it
be
not
repress
in
they
,
it
be
not
dormant
in
they
,
it
be
there
as
evident
in
they
to
every
one
who
know
any
one
of
they
as
be
the
nervous
being
in
they
that
be
not
attack
energy
in
they
.
they
have
then
all
of
they
,
some
more
some
less
in
they
,
but
mostly
all
of
this
kind
of
they
a
good
deal
of
such
kind
of
love
be
in
they
.
they
have
in
they
much
affection
in
they
mostly
all
of
they
and
this
be
in
they
like
the
thinking
be
in
they
like
the
rationalise
some
experience
they
have
choose
and
then
make
into
a
conviction
like
a
moral
principle
.
these
then
do
this
with
a
feeling
for
any
one
,
with
a
feeling
for
anything
,
any
feeling
that
have
convince
they
,
they
make
this
then
,
this
kind
of
they
into
a
conviction
and
they
be
not
often
get
for
this
new
experiencing
,
just
as
they
be
not
in
work
and
think
in
relation
to
experience
,
as
a
continuous
thing
in
living
.
this
be
clear
then
to
some
one
,
it
be
clear
now
to
I
and
now
I
tell
it
,
know
it
now
to
clearly
understand
it
.




the
one
of
the
ten
of
they
that
I
have
be
describe
have
all
these
kind
of
way
of
have
love
feel
strongly
in
he
in
his
living
and
so
this
one
be
perplex
.




now
I
will
finish
up
this
one
.
now
I
will
tell
of
my
learn
this
one
of
this
one
come
to
be
a
whole
one
to
I
.




this
one
be
for
a
long
time
baffle
to
I
.
I
be
tell
every
one
of
this
one
when
this
one
be
still
a
very
baffling
one
to
I
.
now
this
one
be
mostly
all
clear
to
I
inside
I
.
this
one
be
now
a
whole
one
to
I
.
this
be
the
way
I
learn
this
one
so
that
this
one
be
a
whole
one
to
I
.
as
I
be
say
every
one
always
be
repeat
the
whole
of
they
.
as
I
be
say
sometimes
it
take
many
year
of
hear
the
repeating
in
one
before
the
whole
being
be
clear
to
the
understanding
of
one
who
have
it
as
be
to
love
repeat
,
to
know
that
always
every
one
be
repeat
the
whole
of
they
,
to
have
it
that
sometime
each
one
be
a
whole
one
to
that
one
.
this
then
the
way
I
be
now
describe
learn
this
one
,
this
then
be
one
of
the
way
then
that
such
a
one
,
one
who
have
it
as
be
to
love
repeat
,
to
know
that
always
every
one
be
repeat
the
whole
of
they
,
come
to
a
complete
understanding
of
every
one
.




this
then
be
now
a
little
a
description
of
the
way
I
learn
this
one
so
that
this
one
be
a
whole
one
to
I
.




now
I
will
finish
up
this
one
.
now
I
will
tell
of
my
learn
this
one
,
of
this
one
come
to
be
a
whole
one
inside
I
.




this
one
be
a
long
time
perplex
to
I
because
this
one
be
very
evidently
make
up
of
only
one
kind
of
be
and
yet
always
there
be
absolute
contradiction
in
his
being
.
there
be
a
kind
of
be
say
in
ten
man
,
each
one
of
these
ten
have
the
kind
of
be
that
be
common
to
all
the
ten
of
they
in
he
as
be
more
emphasize
in
one
direction
than
in
the
other
direction
.
for
instance
in
this
kind
of
be
that
I
have
be
just
describe
one
of
these
ten
will
have
the
being
in
he
so
that
there
be
in
he
much
more
strongly
affection
for
succeed
in
living
than
for
other
thing
in
he
,
another
will
have
the
being
in
he
so
that
the
love
woman
be
most
strongly
in
he
,
some
one
will
have
the
being
in
he
so
that
rationalise
,
logical
thinking
will
be
the
strong
thing
in
he
,
some
of
they
will
have
the
being
in
they
so
that
in
each
one
of
they
the
have
the
thing
they
have
make
a
moral
conviction
as
moral
conviction
to
perhaps
almost
fanaticism
as
the
strong
thing
in
she
or
in
he
,
this
may
be
in
one
of
these
as
a
conviction
of
deny
,
of
skepticism
,
of
opportunism
,
of
socialism
,
of
monarchism
,
of
irreligion
,
of
anything
.
there
be
some
then
of
this
kind
of
they
that
have
the
power
of
experience
strong
affection
for
beauty
or
luxury
or
truth
as
strong
in
they
.
in
each
one
of
these
all
the
other
thing
in
this
kind
of
be
be
in
they
but
mostly
in
all
of
they
there
be
one
part
of
this
kind
of
be
that
be
strong
in
they
.
this
one
that
I
have
be
just
describe
be
different
in
this
from
these
other
that
I
have
be
just
mention
.
this
one
have
mostly
everything
of
this
kind
of
be
as
equal
in
strength
in
he
.




this
one
say
of
himself
that
he
have
a
slow
mind
,
this
one
have
a
good
mind
and
run
himself
with
this
mind
.
this
one
have
a
capacity
for
profound
,
poignant
,
affectionate
,
intuitive
experiencing
of
beauty
,
in
he
.
this
one
be
run
himself
by
his
mind
and
so
,
often
,
be
shut
himself
off
from
experience
,
his
mind
not
let
he
feel
beauty
in
anything
that
his
mind
be
not
already
rationally
admit
as
a
thing
to
be
so
experience
.
this
one
then
have
the
affection
for
truth
and
nobility
and
loyalty
and
make
of
they
a
moral
conviction
,
this
one
have
the
affection
for
luxury
and
succeed
in
living
and
be
a
superior
being
and
this
one
make
of
these
thing
a
moral
conviction
.
this
one
have
want
love
woman
in
he
and
this
one
have
protect
they
as
a
moral
conviction
,
this
with
love
luxury
and
succeed
in
living
and
truth
and
loyalty
and
courage
,
and
have
in
he
the
quality
of
not
have
attack
be
as
active
in
he
,
not
having
love
as
attack
in
he
,
all
this
make
this
one
very
confusing
.




this
one
then
be
perplex
,
slowly
it
come
to
I
to
know
it
to
be
true
of
he
that
he
have
not
,
as
this
one
think
he
have
,
a
slow
develop
mind
in
he
,
the
mind
in
he
be
slow
only
because
it
go
on
logically
work
when
all
the
actual
learning
have
be
do
by
this
one
as
experience
and
it
seem
slow
because
this
one
believe
that
his
mind
be
develop
thing
for
he
let
this
mind
run
he
and
keep
he
from
poignant
experiencing
and
so
this
one
be
to
himself
a
person
slowly
develop
himself
and
everything
in
he
and
this
be
not
true
of
he
,
he
be
slow
-
minded
to
himself
then
not
because
he
have
any
slow
-
minded
resist
be
in
he
but
because
his
mind
be
just
do
with
rationalise
what
this
one
have
already
do
with
experience
.
this
then
lead
to
bad
thing
in
this
one
in
develop
for
this
one
more
and
more
believe
in
his
mind
as
slowly
develop
in
himself
and
slowly
develop
learning
,
let
himself
be
run
by
it
himself
and
his
mind
be
not
as
fine
an
instrument
as
his
experiencing
and
so
run
himself
by
his
mind
be
not
for
this
one
a
true
way
of
develop
.
for
some
of
this
kind
of
they
it
be
the
true
way
of
develop
,
for
this
one
of
they
it
be
not
the
true
way
of
develop
.




it
be
now
a
little
clear
perhaps
to
some
one
how
this
one
be
perplex
to
I
to
make
of
this
one
a
whole
one
,
always
this
one
be
then
a
puzzle
to
I
,
two
thing
then
make
this
one
clear
to
I
,
the
knowing
that
his
mind
be
not
a
slow
steadily
develop
thing
,
the
recognition
that
although
there
be
only
one
kind
of
be
in
this
one
it
be
not
a
unified
thing
in
he
.
it
be
not
unify
in
he
as
I
find
out
by
more
thinking
about
this
one
because
this
one
have
all
the
part
of
the
kind
of
be
that
be
his
kind
of
be
equally
strongly
in
he
and
that
then
could
not
be
a
unified
one
for
there
be
nothing
make
a
bottom
and
so
then
this
one
be
clear
to
I
,
this
one
be
then
a
whole
one
to
I
,
this
one
then
be
such
a
one
as
I
have
be
describe
.




now
to
give
a
little
description
of
one
who
be
of
the
resist
kind
of
be
and
have
a
different
kind
of
complication
from
that
in
this
one
I
have
just
be
describe
but
one
who
also
have
only
one
kind
of
be
in
he
.




this
one
be
one
of
one
of
the
kind
in
man
and
woman
that
have
resist
be
in
they
.
as
I
be
say
when
I
be
describe
resist
being
,
these
,
those
have
resist
be
in
they
,
can
have
this
be
in
they
in
various
way
depend
on
the
condition
so
to
be
speak
of
the
substance
in
they
,
the
substance
that
be
they
.




this
one
that
I
be
now
begin
a
little
to
tell
about
to
make
the
fifth
one
of
the
six
that
I
be
now
describe
in
this
explaining
of
the
way
nature
be
and
be
mix
up
in
man
and
woman
,
this
one
have
in
he
resist
being
and
one
kind
of
resist
be
only
in
he
and
not
any
other
kind
of
nature
in
he
.
this
one
be
perplex
too
to
every
one
but
this
one
be
perplex
mostly
to
everyone
for
a
different
reason
from
that
in
the
case
of
any
of
the
other
that
I
have
be
describe
.
this
one
be
perplex
to
every
one
by
reason
of
his
fail
to
succeed
in
living
and
this
in
this
one
be
perplex
to
every
one
that
ever
come
to
know
this
one
.
this
be
now
a
little
a
history
a
little
an
explanation
of
this
one
,
a
little
a
description
of
learn
to
understand
the
being
in
this
one
.
this
one
be
then
of
the
resist
kind
in
man
and
woman
but
as
I
be
say
,
sometimes
it
be
not
easy
to
know
it
in
one
whether
the
be
in
that
one
be
of
the
resist
kind
in
they
or
of
the
attack
kind
in
they
.
this
be
now
perhaps
to
some
one
a
little
clear
in
the
way
I
know
it
in
man
and
woman
from
the
description
I
have
just
be
give
of
a
kind
of
they
that
have
attack
be
more
or
less
as
static
in
they
.




it
be
not
then
always
easy
even
after
much
knowing
of
some
one
to
know
whether
the
be
in
that
one
be
attack
or
resist
,
in
they
.




as
I
be
say
,
resist
be
in
some
be
in
such
a
thin
layer
in
they
that
reaction
in
they
be
as
quick
in
they
as
in
those
have
attack
be
in
they
.
in
some
,
as
I
be
say
,
those
have
resist
be
in
they
have
this
in
they
as
a
mass
dry
in
the
centre
and
only
actively
penetrable
for
reaction
by
they
of
the
surface
of
the
being
in
they
.
in
these
then
resist
being
may
be
very
quick
being
,
in
some
of
such
of
they
it
may
be
almost
brilliantly
quick
be
in
they
but
mostly
in
those
of
they
that
be
brilliantly
quick
the
central
portion
of
they
be
not
dead
dry
in
they
it
be
live
enough
in
they
to
give
meaning
to
the
clever
quick
surface
reaction
in
they
.
this
be
very
clear
to
my
feeling
,
this
be
very
clear
in
my
knowing
of
this
kind
in
man
and
woman
,
this
must
then
sometimes
be
clearly
make
into
a
description
.
I
be
now
begin
again
to
make
a
description
of
this
kind
of
be
in
man
and
woman
.




there
be
then
many
million
always
live
have
resist
be
in
whom
the
resist
solid
mass
of
be
in
each
one
of
they
be
not
act
and
so
such
of
they
never
in
their
living
be
slow
in
their
thinking
or
their
working
.
in
such
of
they
the
part
in
they
that
be
active
in
they
be
the
surface
of
this
being
and
this
give
to
such
of
they
clever
thinking
and
being
.
there
be
all
variety
in
this
kind
of
they
as
there
be
in
all
the
kind
of
they
in
all
the
resist
kind
of
they
in
all
the
attack
kind
of
they
.
I
be
always
feel
each
kind
of
they
as
a
substance
dark
,
light
,
thin
,
thick
,
muddier
,
clear
,
smooth
,
lumpy
,
granularer
,
mixeder
,
simple
like
every
kind
there
be
of
earth
or
of
anything
and
always
I
be
feel
in
each
one
of
they
their
kind
of
stuff
as
much
in
they
,
as
little
in
they
,
as
all
of
a
piece
in
they
,
as
lump
in
they
hold
together
sometimes
by
part
of
the
same
sometimes
by
other
kind
of
stuff
in
they
and
always
soon
or
later
for
each
one
I
be
feel
the
stuff
in
they
act
in
they
and
so
sometime
each
one
I
be
ever
know
come
to
be
make
of
something
really
exist
that
be
they
and
each
one
of
they
sometime
then
be
to
I
a
kind
of
stuff
that
all
of
a
certain
kind
of
man
and
a
certain
kind
of
woman
have
in
they
as
the
material
in
they
that
be
bottom
nature
in
they
,
that
be
other
nature
or
nature
in
they
.
each
one
then
sometime
come
to
be
to
I
make
out
of
a
real
something
that
always
be
there
act
and
that
be
that
one
and
sometime
then
I
really
know
that
one
,
I
really
understand
the
meaning
of
the
being
in
that
one
.




the
one
I
be
now
begin
to
describe
a
little
for
there
will
not
be
here
now
much
description
of
this
one
,
this
one
be
of
the
resist
kind
of
they
and
there
be
in
this
one
clever
being
for
this
one
be
of
the
kind
of
they
I
have
be
just
describe
,
the
central
mass
in
this
one
the
slow
fairly
clear
brown
not
completely
dry
mass
in
he
be
not
so
active
in
he
as
the
surface
of
the
mass
in
he
that
be
quickly
cleverly
react
.
but
in
this
one
this
cause
trouble
in
he
that
the
central
mass
be
not
quite
dry
in
he
,
in
some
place
the
central
mass
be
profoundly
active
and
this
make
a
complication
in
this
one
that
make
it
that
this
one
be
not
successful
in
living
and
this
be
very
very
interesting
and
this
be
now
a
little
a
description
of
this
one
in
which
description
there
will
be
a
mingling
of
the
history
of
this
one
,
of
the
description
of
the
being
in
this
one
,
of
the
learning
by
some
to
understand
the
meaning
of
the
being
in
this
one
.




this
one
as
I
be
say
never
really
succeed
in
living
and
that
be
surprising
to
every
one
for
this
one
be
very
clever
and
quick
and
energetic
,
this
one
have
really
a
quality
of
bottom
thinking
,
this
one
be
strong
in
keep
go
at
working
and
always
this
one
be
not
succeed
in
living
,
be
not
really
succeed
in
anything
.
always
this
one
,
though
always
this
one
be
work
steadily
and
sometimes
very
cleverly
,
this
one
never
really
finish
anything
.
always
this
one
be
capable
of
real
thinking
and
always
this
one
be
never
understand
anything
in
himself
or
in
any
one
.
and
always
this
one
know
it
in
he
that
he
be
fail
.
always
this
one
have
an
exalted
nature
in
he
and
always
this
one
be
not
in
any
way
petty
in
his
being
and
always
this
one
be
always
fail
in
be
decently
good
to
any
one
.
always
then
this
one
be
fail
in
living
and
this
be
perplex
he
and
perplex
to
every
one
that
ever
come
to
know
this
one
,
that
ever
come
to
think
about
this
problem
.
this
be
the
history
of
he
.




the
being
in
he
be
as
I
be
say
resist
being
and
this
one
have
in
he
only
the
one
kind
of
be
,
that
be
the
bottom
nature
in
he
,
there
be
not
in
he
any
other
nature
or
nature
of
any
other
kind
of
be
in
he
and
in
this
this
one
be
like
the
last
one
I
be
describe
.
this
one
be
very
different
though
from
the
last
one
I
be
describe
for
this
one
have
not
all
the
being
in
he
possible
to
the
kind
of
be
that
be
his
kind
of
be
.
this
one
have
however
certain
part
of
the
kind
of
be
in
he
that
be
natural
part
of
his
kind
of
being
,
that
without
other
part
of
that
be
be
in
he
make
a
fundamental
contradiction
in
his
being
and
this
be
the
meaning
of
the
being
in
this
one
.
to
begin
again
then
with
thinking
of
a
mass
of
be
of
the
resist
substance
very
active
at
the
surface
and
active
inside
toward
the
center
only
here
and
there
,
this
be
the
being
in
this
one
and
this
cause
the
trouble
in
this
one
.




always
then
this
one
have
in
he
active
in
he
isolate
spot
in
the
central
resist
mass
in
he
,
these
be
in
he
as
the
conception
that
be
the
starting
in
he
of
various
scheme
of
working
,
mostly
the
actual
work
in
he
be
do
by
the
quick
clever
surface
of
he
,
always
then
these
central
live
spot
in
the
whole
mass
of
he
would
be
react
to
all
the
mass
of
work
the
surface
of
he
have
be
do
and
there
be
not
enough
self
-
consciousness
in
he
to
know
that
it
be
a
poor
kind
of
work
than
he
have
want
that
he
have
be
do
and
it
be
to
he
only
that
that
time
he
have
not
succeed
in
do
the
work
he
have
be
plan
,
and
he
must
just
begin
again
.
so
it
go
on
with
he
and
so
he
never
be
finish
anything
and
the
two
kind
of
activity
of
the
being
in
he
be
that
they
be
of
the
same
kind
of
be
in
he
never
come
to
struggle
together
in
he
they
just
go
on
in
he
and
so
he
never
be
succeed
in
his
living
,
he
never
be
succeed
in
anything
,
he
never
could
finish
anything
with
all
his
steady
energetic
patient
work
.




so
then
when
some
one
have
in
she
or
in
he
separate
piece
active
of
the
one
kind
of
be
in
they
and
not
adjust
so
that
one
be
dominate
or
when
as
in
the
last
one
I
be
describe
some
one
have
all
the
piece
possible
of
one
kind
of
be
equally
active
in
he
such
a
one
can
never
really
come
to
a
completely
self
-
conscious
being
,
such
a
one
may
be
successful
in
living
but
such
a
one
never
have
in
he
a
unified
being
,
mostly
such
a
one
have
not
in
he
any
struggling
of
the
piece
with
each
other
in
he
.
of
this
last
I
be
not
yet
absolutely
certain
.




the
meaning
of
the
being
in
this
last
one
come
to
some
who
have
often
at
moment
think
about
this
one
.
mostly
no
one
puzzle
about
this
one
,
fail
in
live
in
this
one
,
though
succeed
in
living
could
have
come
to
this
one
to
every
one
,
have
something
about
it
curiously
inevitably
to
any
one
who
ever
come
to
know
this
one
,
and
so
as
I
be
say
mostly
no
one
really
puzzle
about
this
one
.
one
day
some
be
think
about
the
queer
history
of
this
one
and
they
begin
to
think
about
a
specific
case
in
which
this
one
have
not
finish
something
and
then
it
come
to
be
clear
to
they
for
they
realise
then
that
this
one
always
be
plan
and
criticise
his
complete
work
with
the
chunk
of
slow
solid
central
intelligence
and
feeling
in
this
one
and
always
this
one
be
work
with
the
surface
of
this
one
and
this
one
be
not
self
-
conscious
ever
to
criticise
his
way
of
work
,
only
to
criticise
the
specific
result
he
have
be
achieve
and
so
this
one
always
have
to
be
begin
again
and
this
be
then
the
history
of
this
one
.
sometime
perhaps
there
will
be
write
a
complete
history
of
this
one
,
sometime
perhaps
there
will
be
write
a
complete
history
of
every
one
.




now
to
give
one
little
additional
example
.
there
will
be
very
little
tell
about
this
one
.
this
one
be
different
from
the
two
last
one
I
have
be
describe
,
this
one
have
a
mixing
of
nature
in
he
and
very
little
in
he
of
each
of
the
kind
of
nature
in
he
.
there
be
as
a
bottom
be
in
he
a
kind
of
resist
being
.
this
one
have
as
bottom
be
rather
turgid
resisting
being
.
this
one
have
not
much
bottom
be
in
he
,
not
much
of
this
rather
turgid
resist
be
in
he
.
this
one
have
such
a
kind
of
bottom
be
in
he
,
enough
of
it
in
he
to
be
always
evident
in
he
to
any
one
really
look
at
he
.
this
one
have
other
nature
mix
up
in
he
with
this
bottom
nature
of
he
in
he
.
there
be
then
not
so
very
much
bottom
nature
in
he
,
all
that
there
be
of
it
be
of
this
quite
turgid
between
sodden
resist
and
engulf
resist
being
.
there
be
enough
of
this
in
he
as
a
bottom
nature
to
he
so
that
every
one
really
look
hard
at
he
know
this
in
he
.
it
be
in
this
way
,
by
look
at
he
and
so
understanding
,
that
one
know
this
one
know
the
bottom
nature
there
in
this
one
.
there
be
then
other
nature
in
this
one
.
there
be
in
this
one
mix
up
with
the
bottom
nature
in
this
one
two
other
kind
of
nature
in
this
one
,
one
a
kind
of
resist
being
,
one
a
kind
of
attack
be
.
the
kind
of
resist
being
that
be
in
he
be
of
the
kind
that
I
be
describe
in
the
first
of
these
six
that
I
be
now
finish
.
it
be
a
kind
of
smooth
dark
very
thick
engulfing
being
that
have
with
it
as
a
way
of
be
,
much
complete
vanity
and
separation
from
contact
with
any
one
and
much
needing
of
indolence
and
elegance
and
luxury
to
make
life
a
pleasant
thing
for
such
a
one
,
elegance
in
luxury
be
a
need
for
such
a
one
.
the
kind
of
attack
be
there
be
in
this
one
be
of
the
kind
that
I
have
be
just
describe
in
the
one
before
the
last
one
I
have
be
describe
.
this
be
give
to
this
one
I
be
now
describe
an
affection
for
all
beauty
in
living
and
in
be
,
it
give
to
this
one
that
in
the
beginning
of
his
conscious
living
this
one
have
embrace
as
a
conviction
the
need
of
steady
,
unexalted
,
slightly
ambitious
work
.




this
one
have
the
rationalise
mind
of
the
kind
of
attack
being
that
be
one
of
the
nature
in
he
this
one
then
know
very
early
in
his
living
that
love
a
beautiful
life
and
need
elegant
luxury
for
pleasant
living
and
yield
to
these
thing
in
he
would
soon
lead
he
to
be
dominate
by
the
bottom
being
of
he
,
the
sodden
resist
mixed
with
engulf
resist
bottom
be
in
he
and
this
would
lead
he
so
that
soon
or
later
the
beautiful
life
would
be
turn
by
he
into
an
ugly
one
.
this
one
dimly
then
know
this
in
he
,
this
one
as
I
be
say
have
mix
up
in
he
the
kind
of
attack
being
that
have
it
to
be
rationally
minded
and
ambitious
of
succeed
in
living
and
have
a
power
of
it
make
itself
into
a
life
-
long
resolution
and
a
carrying
of
it
out
completely
during
a
whole
living
as
if
it
be
the
natural
way
of
be
in
he
,
an
instinctive
be
in
he
,
the
kind
of
live
well
suit
to
the
purpose
rationally
embrace
by
such
a
one
.
this
one
then
that
I
be
describe
know
that
steady
unexalted
working
which
be
not
to
this
one
the
whole
natural
way
of
be
be
the
only
way
of
live
for
this
one
to
keep
this
one
from
make
ugly
,
beautiful
elegant
luxurious
being
that
be
in
he
and
that
in
this
work
this
one
must
not
wait
for
the
stimulation
of
experience
,
working
must
go
on
in
he
always
and
experience
and
need
elegant
luxury
and
the
bottom
be
in
he
must
just
be
there
act
while
always
this
one
be
work
,
always
this
one
be
succeed
fairly
well
in
living
.
perhaps
later
this
one
would
not
succeed
so
well
in
living
,
perhaps
this
one
would
be
more
and
more
worn
out
with
his
working
.
perhaps
this
be
what
would
happen
to
such
a
one
.
this
be
a
description
of
one
,
one
who
have
it
in
he
to
not
be
able
to
have
a
beautiful
elegant
luxurious
life
in
live
because
then
later
the
bottom
be
in
this
one
would
make
the
beautiful
life
an
ugly
one
.
this
one
then
live
by
energised
conviction
in
the
attack
kind
of
be
there
be
in
he
mix
with
the
other
be
in
he
.
this
one
then
be
one
that
one
could
know
the
bottom
being
of
he
by
look
at
he
,
mostly
in
his
living
he
be
work
by
energised
conviction
,
sometimes
he
would
be
wear
out
and
then
he
would
be
not
succeed
very
well
in
living
but
the
balance
of
nature
in
he
would
be
in
he
as
it
have
be
always
in
his
living
.
there
be
not
then
in
this
one
any
active
struggle
of
the
nature
in
he
,
but
keep
they
so
balanced
in
he
although
it
be
not
an
effort
in
he
for
energised
vocation
of
work
be
as
naturally
active
as
all
the
other
kind
of
be
that
be
in
he
,
that
be
the
peculiarity
of
the
type
of
attack
be
that
this
one
have
in
he
,
the
keep
they
so
balanced
in
he
be
wear
,
not
to
he
,
for
it
be
not
an
effort
in
he
,
but
be
wear
to
his
whole
being
,
his
whole
being
would
wear
itself
out
by
excessive
spontaneous
equilibration
and
so
this
one
more
and
more
then
would
be
not
successful
in
live
but
always
up
to
the
ending
of
the
acting
living
in
this
one
the
equilibration
of
nature
in
he
would
be
what
I
have
be
describe
.
here
end
then

describing
of

,
to
some
one
know
they
,
sometime
in
their
living
.
this
come
together
of
they
to
be
one
inside
they
,
in
some
come
to
be
in
they
in
the
beginning
of
their
living
,
in
some
in
the
middle
of
their
living
,
in
some
at
the
ending
of
their
living
,
they
come
together
inside
they
to
be
a
whole
one
in
they
,
sometime
,
mostly
every
one
.
some
come
together
to
be
one
in
they
in
different
kind
of
way
in
different
time
in
living
,
some
seem
to
come
together
and
be
not
really
together
then
,
some
really
come
together
as
one
and
come
together
really
sometime
as
another
whole
one
inside
they
,
mostly
when
some
one
have
come
together
to
some
one
it
make
that
one
more
or
less
interesting
than
that
one
be
before
to
the
one
know
that
one
.
to
some
then
the
one
that
have
come
together
to
be
a
whole
by
reason
of
having
come
together
be
then
no
long
interesting
,
the
mystery
of
that
one
be
then
end
to
the
one
know
that
one
as
a
whole
one
,
this
be
not
very
uncommon
.




some
be
so
uncertain
in
their
kind
of
they
,
the
kind
that
have
the
being
that
be
they
not
very
strongly
in
they
,
or
else
very
thinly
spread
out
in
they
,
or
rather
vacant
in
they
,
or
very
mixed
up
in
they
,
there
be
many
that
almost
never
really
be
a
whole
one
inside
they
or
be
a
whole
one
that
be
almost
without
form
and
substance
in
they
and
these
then
when
one
know
this
of
they
,
these
who
then
never
come
really
to
be
a
whole
one
to
any
one
,
to
themselves
inside
they
,
these
then
have
not
any
interest
to
any
one
,
as
not
be
a
whole
one
in
they
.
mostly
those
have
it
as
possible
to
be
really
a
whole
one
be
interesting
until
they
come
together
inside
they
to
themselves
or
to
some
one
,
mostly
after
that
they
be
to
many
that
know
they
less
interesting
;
many
after
that
come
together
be
more
interesting
to
those
that
know
they
,
mostly
all
of
they
those
become
then
more
,
those
become
then
less
interesting
,
in
short
mostly
all
man
and
woman
come
to
be
a
whole
one
inside
they
and
to
those
that
know
they
be
more
simply
repeat
themselves
to
every
one
.
some
as
I
be
say
be
more
whole
one
in
they
when
they
be
little
one
some
when
they
be
young
one
,
when
they
be
begin
their
living
,
than
they
be
any
other
time
in
their
living
.
some
and
many
man
and
woman
be
of
this
kind
of
they
be
more
entirely
whole
one
in
they
and
to
every
one
in
their
middle
living
.
some
in
the
ending
of
their
being
be
really
whole
one
to
themselves
and
to
other
for
the
first
time
in
their
living
.










5
.


this
come
together
in
they
to
be
a
whole
one
be
a
strange
thing
in
man
and
woman
.
sometimes
some
one
be
very
interesting
to
some
one
,
very
,
very
interesting
to
some
one
and
then
that
one
come
together
to
be
a
whole
one
and
then
that
one
be
not
any
more
,
at
all
,
interesting
to
the
one
know
that
one
,
that
one
then
be
shrink
by
be
a
whole
one
,
some
have
not
that
happen
to
they
by
be
a
whole
one
,
some
be
rich
then
,
all
be
solider
then
to
those
know
they
when
they
come
together
inside
they
.
it
be
very
strange
this
come
together
to
be
a
whole
one
.
as
I
be
say
some
come
together
as
different
whole
one
in
different
time
in
their
living
,
some
seem
to
come
together
inside
they
but
this
be
not
real
in
they
,
some
by
their
thinking
,
by
their
living
come
to
come
together
as
a
rich
whole
one
than
could
have
be
expect
from
they
,
often
there
be
some
little
thing
in
some
one
those
know
that
one
be
hardly
noticing
and
that
keep
that
one
from
come
together
until
that
one
in
his
being
have
come
to
be
rich
than
any
one
know
that
one
,
than
that
one
ever
expect
to
be
in
his
being
,
sometimes
some
one
have
something
in
they
that
seem
not
important
be
in
they
and
that
keep
they
open
to
grow
and
that
one
come
together
then
later
as
a
rich
whole
one
than
any
one
know
that
one
think
ever
to
find
that
one
,
and
then
there
be
very
many
of
they
that
lose
rich
be
with
lose
their
young
living
,
there
be
many
that
lose
it
with
lose
a
certain
kind
of
stimulation
,
there
be
many
that
have
a
covering
of
passion
,
of
emotion
,
of
quick
or
slow
reaction
to
everything
,
that
cover
they
,
and
sometime
to
some
one
they
come
together
to
be
a
whole
one
without
that
covering
,
sometimes
sometime
to
every
one
,
inside
they
they
come
together
to
be
a
whole
one
without
any
one
then
feel
the
covering
on
they
which
be
not
lively
then
in
its
active
being
and
such
a
one
may
then
be
very
disappointing
,
such
a
one
be
a
dry
whole
one
when
every
one
know
that
one
feel
that
one
a
rich
whole
until
that
one
come
together
as
a
dry
whole
one
.
and
so
on
and
so
on
,
the
way
of
come
together
be
many
and
interesting
,
more
and
more
to
every
one
,
every
one
sometimes
be
a
whole
mostly
every
one
sometime
come
together
in
they
as
a
whole
one
.
some
as
I
be
say
almost
never
come
together
in
they
as
a
whole
one
,
some
of
such
a
kind
of
they
be
then
not
any
long
interesting
when
it
be
almost
certain
of
they
that
they
will
not
come
together
in
they
ever
to
be
a
whole
one
inside
they
,
some
of
such
of
they
keep
on
be
tantalise
because
they
come
so
nearly
again
and
again
to
be
whole
one
inside
they
.




this
then
of
come
to
be
whole
one
sometimes
in
they
which
be
sometime
in
mostly
all
man
and
woman
,
this
be
very
interesting
.
some
as
I
be
say
never
come
really
to
be
a
whole
one
inside
they
not
at
any
time
in
their
living
not
in
their
beginning
,
not
in
their
middle
living
,
not
in
their
ending
.
these
be
of
many
kind
,
some
have
it
that
they
never
come
to
be
a
whole
one
in
they
because
they
be
make
of
little
lump
of
one
kind
of
be
hold
together
or
separate
from
each
other
,
as
one
come
to
feel
it
in
they
,
the
lump
in
they
from
each
other
by
other
kind
of
be
in
they
,
sometimes
by
other
kind
of
be
in
they
that
be
almost
the
complete
opposite
of
the
lump
in
they
,
some
because
,
the
lump
be
melt
always
into
the
surround
being
that
keep
the
lump
from
touch
,
in
some
because
the
kind
of
be
in
they
be
spread
out
so
thin
in
they
,
that
everything
they
have
learn
,
that
they
like
to
be
in
living
,
all
reaction
to
everything
interesting
,
in
they
,
have
really
nothing
to
do
in
they
with
the
thin
spread
be
in
they
.
there
be
other
one
who
have
many
kind
of
be
in
they
and
none
ever
really
dominate
,
and
there
be
many
kind
of
way
of
be
so
that
at
no
time
really
such
a
one
be
a
whole
one
in
they
but
really
mostly
every
one
sometime
come
together
in
they
to
be
a
whole
one
,
in
some
part
of
their
living
,
sometimes
early
in
their
living
in
love
or
in
work
and
then
later
in
their
living
in
natural
development
of
themselves
settle
in
they
.
there
be
many
way
of
disguise
the
whole
being
in
each
one
,
some
have
a
strong
disguise
in
their
beginning
than
in
their
middle
living
or
in
their
ending
.
soon
now
there
will
be
some
discussing
of
the
disguising
of
whole
be
in
young
living
.




some
as
I
be
say
never
come
to
be
whole
one
inside
they
.
some
be
always
whole
one
though
the
being
in
they
be
all
a
mushy
mass
with
a
skin
to
hold
they
in
and
so
make
one
.
such
a
one
be
a
whole
one
and
of
such
a
one
I
be
now
begin
a
description
.




these
other
I
have
be
describe
that
have
it
in
they
to
be
make
some
of
lump
of
one
kind
of
be
hold
together
by
other
kind
of
be
in
they
,
some
where
all
the
kind
of
be
be
mingle
in
they
,
some
where
there
be
little
lump
of
being
and
none
of
they
connect
with
the
other
lump
that
be
part
of
they
,
and
all
the
other
kind
of
they
that
never
have
it
in
they
to
be
a
whole
one
inside
they
not
at
any
time
in
their
living
,
though
they
may
be
active
enough
in
living
,
these
then
all
of
they
be
very
different
from
the
one
I
be
now
begin
describe
.




this
one
,
the
one
I
be
now
begin
describe
be
of
the
independent
dependent
kind
of
they
,
this
one
be
of
that
kind
of
they
,
the
independent
dependent
kind
of
they
,
the
mass
that
in
the
different
kind
of
they
be
work
into
different
concentration
to
make
they
.
this
one
then
that
I
be
now
describe
,
and
always
there
be
many
exist
like
this
one
,
this
one
then
be
a
whole
one
;
and
all
those
have
independent
dependent
be
have
the
kind
of
material
being
that
be
the
whole
of
this
one
.




sometime
there
will
be
a
description
of
a
complete
undifferentiated
one
that
be
of
the

independent
kind
of
they
.

will
be
a
little

this
one
a
completely
undifferentiated
independent
dependent
one
,

will
be
a
description
of
how
Martha
Hersland
be
make
like

only
more
concentrated
in
her

little
one
,
an
old
one
,
a
very
old
one
,
always
this
one
be
the
same
one
,
always
this
one
be
all
independent
dependent
be
in
solution
.
know
this
one
completely
be
then
a
very
important
thing
,
know
this
one
completely
will
make
it
easy
to
know
all
of
the
man
and
woman
have
in
they
independent
dependent
being
,
all
the
kind
there
be
of
independent
dependent
kind
in
man
and
woman
.




this
one
then
be
in
the
beginning
a
little
baby
and
then
a
little
girl
and
then
a
woman
and
always
every
one
know
all
the
being
in
this
one
,
the
being
that
be
never
change
in
concentration
or
in
action
.
this
one
be
a
flabby
mass
of
independent
dependent
be
hold
together
by
the
skin
surround
for
so
this
one
have
individual
being
.
this
one
then
be
one
that
have
this
meaning
,
the
be
all
independent
dependent
be
in
possibility
of
formation
.
this
one
then
be
a
very
important
one
,
there
be
always
many
million
of
they
live
and
each
one
of
they
be
hold
together
as
a
whole
one
by
the
skin
of
each
one
.
this
one
then
be
independent
be
in
solution
.




as
I
be
say
those
have
independent
dependent
being
have
attack
as
their
way
of
fighting
,
love
,
win
.
resist
in
such
of
they
as
I
be
say
be
mostly
in
they
stupid
be
.
this
be
the
natural
being
in
they
.
this
one
be
so
slow
always
in
she
attack
that
it
mostly
be
resist
in
she
as
it
mostly
,
the
attacking
be
in
this
one
,
just
be
barely
in
motion
.




this
one
be
of
the
independent
dependent
kind
of
they
,
attack
be
be
so
slow
in
action
that
it
make
of
this
one
a
mass
that
be
resist
,
that
be
mostly
all
stupid
being
.
this
one
be
as
I
be
say
of
the
independent
dependent
kind
of
they
.
this
one
start
somewhere
into
action
,
it
all
would
be
slowly
wobble
and
so
make
what
be
attack
being
but
any
one
come
against
this
one
would
only
be
feel
it
as
a
mass
to
stick
in
and
so
think
it
as
a
mass
resist
,
really
this
one
be
of
the
independent
dependent
kind
of
they
,
really
this
one
have
attack
as
a
way
of
fighting
,
as
a
way
of
loving
.
this
one
be
a
whole
one
because
this
one
be
hold
together
by
a
skin
,
as
I
be
say
.
this
one
always

any
incident
,
in
any
one
's
live
what
kind
of
be
they
have
in

.
kind
in
be
be
a
subject
that
be
very
puzzling
.
Martha
Hersland
have
independent
dependent
being
but
this
that
I
have
just
be
tell
might
have
be
in
the
living
of
a
little
one
have
independent
dependent
being
,
might
have
be
in

have
dependent
independent
being

might
have
be
in
the
living
of
a
little
one
have
a
mixture
in
its
being
.
this
then
be
in
the
living
of
Martha
Hersland
when
she
be
a
little
one
but
as
I
be
say
it
be
very
hard
to
know
from
anything
in
any
one
's
live
the
kind
of
be
in
they
.
slowly
some
one
come
to
know
the
being
in
some
one
.
slowly
then
now
every
one
reading
will
know
all
the
being
in
Martha
Hersland
.
this
be
then
a
beginning
.




some
have
the
real
being
in
their
living
in
their
young
living
,
some
do
not
have

will
be
some
description
of
young
live

.




sometime
there
will

of
all
young
living
,
feeling
,
talk
,
think
,
be
.

later
there
will
be
a
history
of
all
these
,
of
every
one
.




there
be
many
way
of
make
kind
in
man
and
woman
when
they
be
in
their
beginning
when
they
be
child
.
they
be
then
each
one
of
they
like
some
other
,
like
some
other
child
,
they
be
each
one
of
they
something
of
themselves
then
,
always
somehow
a
little
,
some
much
very
much
,
themselves
inside
they
,
each

in
each
way
of
make
kind
of

there
be
a
different
system
,
a
different
way
of
feeling
,
a
different
way
of
think
they
as
be
resemble
one
to

.
Martha

early
live
a
certain
number
of
child

now
there
will
be
more
history
of
some
,
more
history
of
other
of
they
.
as
I
be
say
Martha
be
throw
the
umbrella
in
the
mud
with
angry
feeling
as
she
be
tell
and
nobody
be
hear
.
as
I
be
say
no
one
know
this
as
having
be
Martha
's
way
of
act
then
when
she
a
little
one
be
fill
full
of
angry
feeling
,
with
despairing
feeling
,
with
responsible
feeling
,
with
frightened
feeling
,
no
one
then
could
be
very
certain
of
the
kind
of
be
Martha
have
in
she
.
not
any
one
could
know
then
whether
Martha
be
of
the
kind
of
they
have
attack
as
their
natural
being
,
the
kind
of
they
having
resist
as
their
natural
being
.
some
have
their
real
being
in
young
living
,
some
do
not
have
it
then
in
they
.
in
those
have
it
then
strongly
in
they
sometime
some
one
watch
they
can
know
it
in
they
.
mostly
it
be
hard
to
know
it
in
they
then
in
their
beginning
than
in
their
later
young
living
.
always
it
be
a
difficult
thing
,
in
some
it
be
almost
impossible
in
their
beginning
live
to
know
the
being
in
they
,
in
some
it
be
easy
then
.
now
there
will
be
a
little
description
of
young
live
in
some
.
know
a
map
and
then
see
the
place
and
know
then
that
the
road
actually
exist
be
like
the
map
,
to
some
be
always
astonishing
and
always
then
very
gratifying
.
to
some
there
be
the
same
thing
in
living
and
to
such
a
one
see
each
one
they
be
know
as
young
one
and
old
one
and
very
old
one
,
and
see
they
then
as
have
in
they
the
kind
of
be
that
hear
other
talk
,
and
read
what
other
have
write
,
make
every
one
know
be
the
nature
of
human
being
know
this
then
in
every
one
at
each
period
in
they
be
to
some
as
I
be
say
astonishing
and
then
gratifying
,
be
to
some
as
I
be
say
know
a
place
after
know
a
map
of
such
a
place
be
to
some
to
their
feeling
an
astonishment
and
then
a
gratification
.
this
be
then
always
there
all
their
living
in
some
,
that
be
to
say
these
one
come
to
know
in
those
of
they
that
be
of
their
own
generation
,
not
child
be
,
though
in
some
even
that
be
know
to
they
by
hear
and
reading
,
in
other
child
around
they
,
they
be
then
child
,
in
some
of
such
of
they
then
there
be
a
self
-
consciousness
then
enough
to

come
to
be
to
they
then
almost
overwhelming
as
astonishment

gratification
in

.
some
find
be

more

confuse
as
be
nature
in

.
child
be
confuse
and
deceive

and
woman
.
the
being
in
child
be
then
often
very
confusing
,
this
be
because
be
in
begin
the
nature
in
they
be
then
almost
hide
,
or
disguise
,
or
uncertain
,
or
change
,
or
too
loudly
in
they
.
child
be
then
often
very
confusing
for
they
be
often
all
of
they
do
the
same
thing
and
the
nature
in
they
do
not
affect
they
,
they
have
many
of
they
then
not
their
own
way
of
eat
,
drink
,
play
,
laugh
,
cry
,
have
angry
feeling
,
kicking
,
scream
,
love
,
deceive
,
some
have
then
their
own
individual
way
of
do
but
mostly
in
child
it
be
a
general
kind
of
action
a
general
kind
of
way
of
act
when
any
one
do
anything
to
they
and
they
be
not
like
this
thing
some
one
have
be
do
to
they
.
always
it
be
hard
to
know
the
real
being
in
any
one
from
know
thing
any
one
have
be
do
,
with
child
it
be
even
more
confusing
,
the
same
kind
of
acting
be
do
by
child
that
have
every
different
kind
of
nature
in
they
when
they
be
happy
,
when
they
be
play
,
when
they
be
cheat
,
when
they
have
angry
or
injure
feeling
.
mostly
then
the
being
in
child
,
the
individual
be
in
each
one
be
very
difficult
for
any
one
even
live
with
they
to
be
know
,
it
be
often
almost
hide
,
or
disguise
,
or
uncertain
,
or
change
,
or
too
loudly
in
they
,
and
so
they
have
not
then
really
in
they
individual
being
.
slowly
then
they
come
to
have
in
they
more
and
more
their
individual
being
.
slowly
more
and
more
individual
being
come
out
of
they
as
more
and
more
they
be
themselves
inside
they
.
it
be
very
hard
to
know
of
any
one
the
being
in
they
from
one
or
two
thing
they
have
be
do
that
some
one
be
tell
about
they
,
from
many
thing
even
that
they
have
be
do
and
that
one
know
of
they
.
know
real
being
in
man
and
woman
be
a
very
slow
proceeding
and
always
more
and
more
this
be
very
certain
.




as
I
be
say
it
be
almost
hard
to
know
it
in
child
and
young
man
and
woman
the
be
in
they
than
in
old
man
and
woman
.
not
every
one
think
that
this
be
certain
.
as
I
be
say
many
many
kind
of
little
boy
that
in
their
later
living
have
very
different
way
of
react
when
some
one
have
do
something
and
they
do
not
like
the
thing
some
one
have
be
do
,
many
many
man
who
have
very
different
way
of
act
when
some
one
have
do
something
they
be
not
like
,
very
different
nature
in
they
,
when
they
be
little
boy
and
some
little
boy
,
some
one
do
something
they
be
not
like
,
they
show
no
sign
of
react
to
it
then
and
then
later
they
hit
out
and
often
the
little
boy
the
some
one
who
have
do
the
thing
to
they
they
be
not
like
have
forget
,
so
long
be
the
little
boy
who
be
not
like
the
thing
the
other
one
do
to
he
in
respond
.
this
be
true
also
of
woman
,
many
kind
of
woman
with
very
different
kind
of
nature
in
they
,
when
they
be
little
girl
and
some
one
do
something
to
they
they
be
not
liking
show
at
first
no
reaction
and
then
they
show
angry
feeling
when
every
one
have
forget
the
thing
the
little
girl
have
not
be
like
.
in
some
man
,
in
some
woman
,
this
show
real
nature
in
they
,
in
some
it
be
just
that
nature
be
in
they
in
beginning
,
and
so
child
be
very
confusing
to
the
understanding
.




in
some
the
nature
in
they
be
clear
when
they
be
very
young
,
in
some
when
they
be
young
,
in
some
when
they
be
not
so
young
,
in
some
when
they
be
old
one
.
always
in
each
one
it
be
there
and
repeat
,
sometime
some
one
know
it
in
each
one
.




as
I
be
say
some
have
more
feeling
for
kind
in
man
and
woman
when
man
and
woman
be
in
beginning
,
some
have
more
feeling
for
kind
in
man
and
woman
when
man
and
woman
be
baby
than
in
any
other
time
in
their
living
,
some
have
more
feeling
for
kind
in
man
and
woman
when
man
and
woman
be
child
than
at
any
other
time
in
their
exist
.
as
I
be
say
,
to
some
,
be
in
child
be
very
confusing
because
the
nature
in
they
be
in
its
beginning
.




as
I
be
say
it
be
very
hard
tell
from
know
something
some
one
do
sometime
,
the
nature
in
they
.
as
I
be
say
it
be
very
difficult
to
know
the
nature
in
a
man
or
in
a
woman
from
know
even
quite
a
number
of
thing
they
be
do
;
it
be
even
hard
to
know
the
nature
in
child
from
the
action
in
they
as
I
have
be
just
say
,
that
be
true
of
many
child
,
not
of
all
of
they
by
any
mean
and
that
must
never
be
forget
.




as
I
be
say
Martha
Hersland
when
she
be
a
little
one
a
very
little
one
and
the
other
be
run
ahead
and
she
have
the
umbrella
for
one
of
they
and
she
be
struggle
to
catch
up
with
the
rest
of
they
and
they
be
disappear
and
she
be
be
fill
full
always
with
angry
feeling
and
resentment
and
desperation
and
she
be
cry
out
,
"
I
will
throw
the
umbrella
in
the
mud
,
"
and
nobody
be
hear
and
she
be
repeat
again
and
again
and
then
in
a
moment
of
triumphing
she
do
throw
the
umbrella
in
the
mud
and
then
she
go
on
cry
and
say
,
"
I
do
throw
the
umbrella
in
the
mud
,
"
this
be
a
description
of
an
action
that
many
very
different
kind
of
child
could
have
be
do
when
they
be
leave
behind
struggle
,
Martha
Hersland
do
this
and
she
be
a
little
girl
then
and
slowly
now
there
will
come
to
be
a
complete
description
of
the
nature
in
she

.
in
the
child
being
of
the
second
Hersland
child
the
elder
son
,
Alfred
Hersland
there
be
also
a
little
of
this
that
he
be
very
much
of
the
living
of
the
people
around
he
but
it
be
not
in
he
so
completely
inside
he
as
it
be
in
the
being
of
the
young
son
David
Hersland
,
the
young
of
the
three
Hersland
child
.
then
Alfred
Hersland
be
very
much
soon
through
with
have
it
in
he
the
living
of
the
people
around
he
as
part
of
the
being
in
he
than
either
his
young
brother
or
his
old
sister
.
he
be
then
really
less
of
they
the
poor
people
around
he
than
either
of
the
other
two
Hersland
child
but
nevertheless
in
his
young
live
in
his
playing
and
in
his
be
interested
then
,
he
too
be
very
much
of
they
the
poor
people
near
they
,
though
it
be
never
really
very
deep
in

and
it
be
very
soon
all
end
for
he
.
he
be
then
,
Alfred
Hersland
in
a
sense
in
his
be
less
really
of
the
being
of
the
people
live
in
small
house
near
he
,
more
of
the
people
it
be
natural
for
he
to
know
in
his
living
though
he
be
not
of
they
at
all
in
his
beginning
than
his
brother
or
his
sister
and
this
will
come
out
very
clearly
in

history
of
he
that
will
be
write
after
the
history
of

.
it
will
be
interesting
then
to

it
in
each
one
of
the
Hersland
child
just
how
they
be
of

say
David
,
the

and
of
the
people
that
know
these
people
and
the
child
that
know
these

and
so
they
,
all
of
they
the
being
in
they
the
nature
of
many
of
they
will

some
description
of

if
the
Hersland
family
have
be
live
the
well
to
do
living

from
some
few
thing
they

be
hard

sometime

any
one
have
some
feeling

.




there
be

way
of

some

end
live

some

be
end
live
than
at
any
other
time
in

.
some
do
not

more
disguising

be
now
the
way
every
one
know
Martha
Hersland
feel
the
being
in
she
.




Martha
Hersland
be
of
the
independent
dependent
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
the
one
I
be
describe
as
be
independent
dependent
being
as
in
fluid
condition
and
hold
together
to
be
one
by
the
skin
surround
that
one
be
of
the
same
kind
of
be
then
as
that
in
Martha
Hersland
,
in
Martha
the
being
be
in
a
little
more
concentrated
condition
but
the
proportion
of
attack
and
obstinate
resisting
and
quickness
and
hesitation
and
way
of
be
always
in
every
part
of
live
a
whole
one
be
the
same
in
Martha
Hersland
as
in
the
one
I
be
describe
as
be
independent
dependent
being
in
completely
fluid
condition
and
be
a
whole
one
only
,
and
always
be
one
,
by
have
a
skin
to
hold
it
in
and
to
separate
it
so
from
every
one
and
make
it
so
an
individual
one
.
Martha
then
be
of
the
independent
dependent
kind
in
man
and
woman
,
Martha
have
this
be
then
in
more
concentration
in
a
more
solid
condition
than
the
one
I
be
early
describe
.
it
be
a
little
true
now
to
I
of
Martha
and
a
little
true
to
I
of
many
man
and
woman
have
independent
dependent
be
in
they
that
the
be
in
they
be
like
the
one
I
be
describe
,
the
one
have
all
independent
dependent
be
in
solution
in
a
fluid
condition
,
and
my
know
independent
dependent
be
so
well
in
that
one
and
that
one
be
such
a
fluid
whole
one
,
give
to
I
see
they
an
uncomfortable
feeling
to
know
it
so
well
from
this
one
I
be
describe
,
the
being
in
they
,
the
activity
in
they
,
in
some
have
independent
dependent
being
;
sometimes
it
make
I
a
little
turn
away
from
see
the
being
in
some
have
in
they
independent
dependent
be
so
that
I
will
not
know
it
too
clearly
in
they
the
being
that
they
have
in
they
,
all
the
meaning
of
the
being
in
they
and
that
be
a
little
now
the
way
I
be
feel
in
look
at
the
being
in
Martha
Hersland
and
now
all
the
same
I
be
begin
completely
to
realise
all
the
meaning
there
be
in
the
being
there
be
in
she
and
always
now
I
will
look
straight
on
at
she
.
I
will
know
all
the
being
in
she
.
Martha
be
of
the
independent
dependent
kind
of
they
as
I
be
say
,
she
be
as
I
be
say
like
the
one
I
be
describe
that
be
independent
dependent
being
in
completely
fluid
condition
and
always
be
a
whole
one
in
the
beginning
of
the
being
there
be
in
that
one
in
the
middle
of
the
living
of
that
one
,
in
the
ending
of
the
living
of
that
one
.
Martha
then
be
like
that
one
in
the
relation
of
thing
in
her
being
,
she
be
more
concentrated
more
solid
than
that
one
,
it
be
not
only
the
skin
that
keep
she
apart
from
other
one
,
there
be
actual
individual
be
always
in
Martha
but
Martha
be
a
whole
one
,
in
her
beginning
,
in
her
middle
living
,
in
her
ending
,
she
be
all
through
she
of
the
same
concentration
,
of
the
same
nature
,
always
it
be
the
same
being
in
she
,
that
in
she
in
her
beginning
,
in
she
be
a
baby
,
a
little
one
,
a
little
big
one
,
and
so
on
.
always
Martha
like
the
other
one
I
be
describe
be
a
whole
one
.
this
be
now
some
description
of
what
each
one
who
know
she
feel
in
she
,
this
be
now
some
description
of
the
nature
in
she
,
of
the
living
that
be
in
she
.
when
she
be
a
very
little
one
sometimes
she
want
not
to
be
exist
.
this
be
a
very
common
thing
in
every
one
in
the
beginning
of
their
living
.
this
be
a
very
common
thing
in
mostly
every
one
in
the
beginning
of
their
living
.
many
want
then
not
any
long
to
be
exist
,
mostly
then
when
they
be
very
little
one
they
be
never
think
I
wish
I
have
never
come
into
exist
,
they
have
not
then
any
such
a
feeling
,
they
often
say
then
I
wish
I
have
die
when
I
be
a
little
baby
and
have
not
any
feeling
,
I
would
not
then
have
to
be
always
suffer
,
I
would
not
then
now
have
to
think
of
be
frighten
by
die
,
I
wish
I
have
be
dead
when
I
be
a
very
little
one
and
be
not
know
anything
.
it
be
very
interesting
the
way
anybody
feel
about
die
,
about
not
exist
,
about
everything
,
about
every
one
.
always
more
and
more
this
be
very
interesting
.




there
be
way
then
that
those
have
in
they
independent
dependent
be
feel
about
living
,
feel
about
die
,
feel
about
never
having
be
,
if
they
have
any
of
such
a
kind
of
feeling
in
they
,
that
be
common
to
all
of
they
as
be
different
from
the
way
those
have
in
they
dependent
independent
being
have
of
feeling
.




More
and
more
there
will
be
understanding
of
these
different
way
of
feel
their
own
being
,
feel
anybody
else
be
being
,
feel
the
ending
of
themselves
and
the
ending
of
any
one
,
feel
their
not
exist
,
that
make
one
kind
in
man
and
woman
,
make
that
kind
different
from
other
kind
of
they
.
there
will
then
be
a
very
little
always
be
make
that
slowly
will
make
a
great
deal
of
description
of
the
feeling
in
each
kind
in
man
and
woman
about
everything
.




as
I
be
say
Martha
be
of
the
independent
dependent
kind
of
they
.
as
I
be
say
it
be
hard
to
know
the
kind
of
be
in
any
one
from
just
a
description
of
some
thought
,
some
feeling
,
some
action
in
they
for
it
be
in
their
feeling
of
themselves
inside
they
that
the
kind
of
be
in
they
show
in
they
and
that
come
out
of
they
slowly
in
their
living
,
that
come
out
of
they
always
as
repeat
,
this
be
very
very
difficult
to
make
any
one
understand
from
a
description
of
they
.
this
be
now
what
I
be
always
try
.
I
know
much
of
all
this
and
sometime
sometimes
I
can
make
some
one
else
know
it
by
my
explaining
,
I
be
never
very
certain
but
always
there
be
again
and
again
for
I
a
beginning
of
this
try
.




as
I
be
say
many
little
one
have
a
feeling
about
not
want
any
more
to
be
live
,
some
want
to
have
be
dead
when
they
be
little
baby
and
not
know
anything
,
some
want
to
be
dead
then
so
that
every
one
will
miss
they
,
some
want
to
prove
themselves
all
noble
by
die
,
some
be
just
tired
of
struggle
when

there
be
in

always
one
kind
of
independent
dependent
being
as
I
be
say
and
it
be
mostly
all
always
completely
there
to
every
one
,
the
whole
be
in
she
to
every
one

.
mostly
then
always
she
really
be
a
whole
one
.
mostly
then
always
every
one
who
know
she
have
about
she
such
a
feeling
.
this
will
come
clear
in
the
history
of
she
.




she
be
as
I
be
say
of
one
kind
of
independent
dependent
being
and
all
her
living
there
be
about
the
same
concentration
to
she
,
the
same
relation
of
attack
and
succeed
and
failing
and
nervous
feeling
and
stupid
being
and
understanding
and
tired
feeling
in
she
.
Martha
be
then
once
a
very
little
one
,
a
baby
,
and
then
a
little
one
and
then
a
young
girl
and
then
a
woman
and
then
she
be
old
and
then
later
there
be
an
ending
to
she
and
always
all
through
this
living
in
she
she
be
the
same
whole
one
inside
she
and
to
every
one
who
know
she
.




in
some
the
nature
in
they
be
clear
when
they
be
very
young
,
in
some
when
they
be
young
,
in
some
when
they
be
not
so
young
,
in
some
when
they
be
get
old
,
in
some
when
they
be
old
one
.
Martha
be
mostly
always
to
every
one
who
know
she
the
same
whole
one
,
when
she
be
a
little
one
,
a
very
little
one
,
an
old
one
,
a
very
old
one
,
mostly
always
then
she
be
to
every
one
about
the
same
kind
of
a
whole
one
.
she
be
of
one
kind
of
that
kind
of
they
and
mostly
all
her
living
there
be
the
same
concentration
of
the
being
that
be
she
,
the
same
proportion
of
one
thing
to
the
other
thing
active
in
she
.




as
I
be
say
those
have
in
they
independent
dependent
be
have
in
they
attack
as
their
natural
way
of
win
fighting
,
as
their
natural
way
of
win
in
love
.
as
I
be
say
those
have
in
they
dependent
independent
being
have
in
they
resist
as
their
natural
way
of
win
fighting
,
have
resist
as
their
natural
way
of
win
in
love
.
this
then
be
the
being
in
those
have
in
they
independent
dependent
being
,
this
then
be
the
being
in
those
have
in
they
dependent
independent
being
.
these
then
be
the
two
different
way
of
be
in
man
and
woman
and
always
this
,
one
way
or
the
other
way
of
be
,
always
then
one
way
or
the
other
way
of
be
,
independent
dependent
being
or
dependent
independent
being
be
in
each
one
,
every
one
who
ever
be
or
be
or
will
be
live
.




often
it
be
very
confusing
for
as
I
be
say
sometimes
,
very
often
,
one
have
in
she
or
in
he
independent
dependent
being
,
that
be
having
attack
as
their
real
way
of
win
fighting
,
win
in
loving
,
such
a
one
seem
really
to
be
always
resist
.
this
then
the
kind
of
be
in
some
one
be
sometimes
,
be
one
might
say
truly
very
often
,
very
confusing
,
for
one
,
have
in
they
really
as
be
attack
as
the
way
of
win
fighting
,
as
the
way
of
win
love
,
always
sometimes
every
minute
in
their
living
to
themselves
and
to
every
one
know
they
seem
to
be
resist
,
seem
to
be
so
fight
and
win
,
so
love
and
win
.
this
be
then
very
confusing
to
every
one
know
that
one
.
slowly
then
the
real
fighting
being
,
the
real
love
be
in
that
one
come
to
be
understand
by
some
one
,
sometimes
not
really
by
any
one
,
mostly
in
every
one
,
sometime
by
some
one
.
this
be
true
then
of
very
many
have
in
they
independent
dependent
being
,
that
be
those
have
in
they
attack
as
their
real
way
of
win
fighting
,
attack
as
their
real
way
of
win
love
,
it
be
true
in
many
of
they
that
to
themselves
mostly
,
and
mostly
to
every
one
ever
know
they
,
they
have
in
they
resist
as
their
way
of
win
fighting
,
resist
as
their
way
of
win
in
love
.
in
those
have
in
they
dependent
independent
being
that
be
those
have
in
they
resist
as
their
real
way
of
win
fighting
,
resist
as
their
real
way
of
win
in
loving
,
there
be
very
many
of
they
who
seem
to
themselves
sometimes
and
mostly
always
to
every
one
ever
know
they
seem
to
be
always
and
incessantly
attack
,
seem
to
be
always
win
by
attack
in
fighting
and
in
love
.
sometime
it
come
out
of
they
that
they
be
not
really
win
,
more
and
more
perhaps
it
come
out
of
they
that
always
attack
they
be
never
really
win
,
sometimes
sometime
some
one
will
know
it
of
they
that
attack
be
not
in
such
of
they
the
way
of
win
fighting
,
win
loving
,
in
some
sometime
every
one
who
know
they
know
it
sometime
of
they
,
that
attacking
be
not
in
they
the
way
of
win
fighting
,
the
way
of
win
love
.
it
be
very
confusing
for
every
one
realise
this
description
must
be
really
understand
that
fail
do
not
prove
it
to
be
true
of
some
one
that
attack
be
not
the
real
way
of
win
fighting
for
one
do
their
fighting
by
attack
.
many
have
in
they
attack
as
their
natural
way
of
win
fighting
fail
to
succeed
to
win
by
attack
,
fail
to
succeed
in
love
by
attack
.
they
may
fail
then
those
have
in
they
such
being
,
they
may
even
succeed
by
resist
those
have
in
they
attack
as
their
way
of
win
and
yet
these
then
be
of
the
kind
of
they
have
attack
as
their
natural
way
of
win
fighting
,
as
their
natural
way
of
win
loving
,
be
in
short
of
the
independent
dependent
kind
of
they
.
of
those
have
in
they
resist
as
their
natural
way
of
win
fight
they
be
often
for
a
long
time
to
every
one
,
to
themselves
then
and
they
be
brag
of
it
and
they
have
it
in
they
to
themselves
and
to
every
one
that
they
be
always
succeed
by
attack
,
and
sometimes
they
be
really
never
fail
,
to
themselves
and
to
other
who
know
they
and
yet
always
to
some
one
know
the
whole
sum
of
they
the
whole
completeness
of
their
live
some
one
can
know
it
in
they
that
attack
be
not
in
they
their
real
way
of
win
fighting
,
of
succeed
in
be
love
and
in
love
.
so
then
as
I
be
say
it
be
very
confusing
and
sometimes
one
only
know
really
the
kind
of
be
in
some
by
the
kind
of
yield
in
they
,
the
kind
of
sensitiveness
in
they
for
there
be
in
each
kind
of
being
,
in
independent
dependent
being
,
in
dependent
independent
be
a
kind
of
way
of
yield
,
a
kind
of
way
of
be
dependent
,
a
kind
of
way
of
have
sensitiveness
in
they
that
make
that
kind
of
they
.
there
be
then
in
independent
dependent
be
a
kind
of
way
of
yield
,
of
have
sensitive
being
that
be
different
from
the
kind
of
way
of
yield
of
have
sensitive
be
in
dependent
independent
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
there
be
a
kind
of
way
of
yield
,
of
be
dependent
,
of
have
sensitive
be
in
those
have
in
they
dependent
independent
being
that
be
different
from
the
kind
of
way
of
yield
,
of
have
dependent
being
,
of
have
sensitive
be
in
those
have
in
they
any
of
the
kind
of
independent
dependent
being
.
in
short
there
be
one
way
of
have
dependent
being
,
of
yielding
,
of
sensitiveness
,
of
have
stupid
being
,
of
have
feel
about
object
,
about
practical
living
that
go
with
have
attack
as
the
natural
way
of
win
fighting
of
win
loving
,
of
win
anything
and
there
be
another
whole
system
of
be
that
be
very
different
from
this
,
a
way
of
yield
,
a
way
of
have
sensitiveness
in
be
,
a
way
of
see
and
feel
everything
in
living
,
a
way
of
choose
a
way
of
react
to
everything
that
go
with
have
it
as
be
,
the
win
fighting
by
resist
as
the
real
way
of
be
,
the
win
anything
in
live
,
loving
and
everything
by
resist
.
so
then
sometimes
there
will
be
much
very
much
description
of
the
way
of
yield
in
each
one
have
in
they
one
or
the
other
of
these
two
kind
of
be
,
independent
dependent
,
dependent
independent
,
that
be
of
everyone
,
of
all
man
,
of
all
woman
.




as
I
be
say
the
one
I
be
describe
that
have
all
independent
dependent
being
in
solution
,
this
one
have
as
all
of
those
have
independent
dependent
be
in
they
have
it
as
be
,
this
one
have
attack
as
the
natural
way
of
win
anything
.
this
one
as
I
be
say
have
all
the
being
in
a
flabby
kind
of
state
that
make
this
one
when
this
one
be
attack
make
all
the
being
in
this
one
then
when
the
be
in
this
one
be
in
motion
make
it
that
the
be
in
this
one
,
all
the
being
of
this
one
,
be
then
when
attack
just
in
a
state
of
motion
and
so
to
any
one
feel
this
one
this
one
would
seem
to
have
resist
be
as
the
natural
way
of
act
for
the
movement
of
the
whole
be
in
this
one
,
this
one
be
then
in
a
state
of
attack
really
be
then
to
every
one
know
this
one
in
this
state
of
action
,
for
it
be
so
slow
the
moving
of
the
whole
being
that
make
this
one
,
that
any
one
come
in
contact
with
this
one
then
or
any
such
a
one
,
stick
so
to
speak
in
the
mass
of
this
when
meet
this
one
would
think
of
this
one
as
resist
but
this
be
not
true
of
this
one
then
or
of
any
of
such
of
they
that
have
independent
dependent
being
in
solution
in
they
,
it
be
stupid
be
in
they
that
wobble
in
they
that
be
their
moving
that
be
so
slow
and
uncertain
that
to
any
one
know
they
,
feel
they
,
see
they
it
be
not
in
they
as
attack
move
activity
in
they
but
attack
that
be
the
being
in
this
one
and
in
the
other
like
this
one
have
in
they
each
one
independent
dependent
being
.
and
so
then
often
this
kind
of
a
one
be
from
the
spreading
of
the
being
in
that
one
always
then
slow
and
slow
in
move
in
the
attack
activity
of
such
a
one
,
and
very
very
often
with
such
a
one
the
attacking
never
come
to
real
action
as
a
using
of
the
energy
generate
in
the
attack
feeling
in
independent
dependent
being
of
such
a
kind
of
one
,
make
such
a
kind
of
one
a
nervous
kind
of
be
and
this
be
then
the
way
independent
dependent
being
can
in
some
be
very
confusing
for
attack
do
not
seem
to
be
the
way
of
active
being
of
they
and
so
it
take
much
knowing
of
the
being
in
man
and
woman
to
realise
the
action
in
they
.
this
one
then
the
one
I
be
describe
have
then
independent
dependent
being
but
attack
never
come
to
really
be
ever
an
action
and
so
this
one
be
to
many
very
resisting
,
stubborn
in
resist
and
this
be
only
because
attack
be
in
this
one
never
come
to
be
anything
more
than
the
whole
mass
of
be
that
be
this
one
be
just
move
.
as
I
be
say
before
,
this
one
that
I
be
describe
be
the
least
possible
concentration
,
the
most
diffuse
possible
kind
of
exist
of
independent
dependent
being
.
as
I
be
say
this
one
a
little
more
concentrated
be
what
make
the
being
of
Martha
Hersland
,
Martha
who
be
now
soon
to
be
a
complete
one
to
every
one
read
this
description
.
as
I
be
say
the
one
I
have
be
just
describe
have
with
this
attack
always
much
nervous
being
.
as
I
be
say
this
one
I
be
describe
be
make
a
little
into
something
have
a
little
more
concentration
would
be
the
being
I
be
now
begin
describe
.
as
I
be
say
the
one
I
be
describe
be
of
the
independent
dependent
kind
of
they
,
this
be
the
be
too
that
Martha
Hersland
have
in
she
.
the
one
I
be
describe
have
independent
dependent
being
in
its
weak
concentration
,
Martha
Hersland
have
independent
dependent
being
in
a
state
of
a
little
more
concentration
.
as
I
be
say
all
she
live
the
first
one
I
be
describe
be
a
whole
one
,
always
a
complete
one
to
herself
and
to
every
one
,
this
then
as
I
be
say
,
be
always
a
whole
one
to
herself
and
every
one
all
through
her
living
be
a
thing
every
one
will
know
soon
in
Martha
Hersland
.
the
first
one
then
I
be
describe
be
of
the
independent
dependent
kind
of
they
that
be
one
have
attack
as
the
natural
way
of
win
fighting
,
this
be
the
being
,
the
independent
dependent
being
,
be
the
being
that
be
in
Martha
Hersland
,
the
one
I
be
now
again
begin
describe
,
the
old
of
the
three
of
they
,
the
three
Hersland
child
.




as
I
be
say
there
be
a
kind
of
way
of
yield
,
a
kind
of
way
of
have
sensitive
be
that
every
one
have
independent
dependent
be
have
in
they
as
their
way
of
be
.
there
will
be
just
now
very
little
description
of
this
in
any
one
.
later
there
will
be
very
much
description
of
this
in
every
one
have
in
they
independent
dependent
being
.
now
there
will
be
mostly
a
beginning
of
understanding
of
attack
and
resist
and
stupid
being
,
and
nervous
being
,
and
a
little
of
the
yielding
and
the
sensitive
being
in
some
have
in
they
independent
dependent
being
and
now
there
will
be
a
beginning
of
all
these
in
one
and
this
one
be
Martha
Hersland
the
old
of
the
three
Hersland
child
.




as
I
be
say
when
Martha
be
a
very
little
one
,
the
Herslands
be
live
in
a
ten
acre
place
and
they
be
poor
people
in
small
house
live
near
they
and
the
Herslands
have
a
governess
and
servant
then
live
in
the
house
with
they
.




later
when
Martha
be
a
little
big
,
she
go
to
a
school
near
they
where
the
child
live
in
the
small
house
near
they
go
too
to
get
their
instruction
and
Martha
be
of
they
then
of
all
of
they
the
poor
people
near
they
;
the
Hersland
child
always
have
then
a
governess
in
the
house
with
they
.
this
make
two
different
kind
of
live
for
they
,
this
be
more
troublesome
to
Martha
than
to
the
two
other
child
who
be
boy
and
so
not
really
in
actual
relation
to
the
family
live
and
the
governess
in
the
house
with
they
.
to
begin
now
a
description
of
what
every
one
know
Martha
Hersland
when
she
be
a
little
one
feel
or
know
or
think
of
the
being
that
now
every
one
reading
be
commence
feeling
,
know
.




as
I
be
say
,
when
Martha
be
a
very
little
one
and
just
begin
to
go
out
with
other
child
the
governess
be
never
then
with
the
Hersland
child
,
any
of
they
,
when
they
be
very
little
one
and
go
out
with
other
child
.
the
child
be
of
the
living
of
the
people
about
they
,
they
have
that
kind
of
live
feeling
in
they
,
the
kind
of
living
feel
natural
in
the
people
live
in
the
small
house
near
they
.
the
Hersland
family
then
,
the
Hersland
child
all
three
of
they
have
the
live
feeling
in
they
of
the
people
about
they
.
Mr.
Hersland
have
not
the
live
feeling
of
the
people
about
they
completely
in
he
for
he
go
every
day
into
a
very
different
kind
of
living
but
he
have
a
good
deal
of
it
in
he
for
his
past
living
be
not
strongly
ever
in
he
.
Mrs.
Hersland
have
no
other
daily
living
than
her
household
and
her
child
and
the
live
feeling
of
the
people
in
the
small
house
near
they
but
in
Mrs.
Hersland
there
be
always
in
she
as
her
real
living
feeling
for
she
,
the
past
living
,
the
right
rich
american
living
that
be
the
natural
way
of
live
in
she
.
the
three
child
as
I
be
say
have
each
one
of
they
more
in
they
then
of
the
live
feeling
natural
to
the
people
then
around
they
than
they
have
the
live
feeling
belong
to
the
kind
of
live
natural
to
the
child
of
the
father
and
the
mother
of
they
.
each
one
of
the
three
of
they
Martha
,
Alfred
and
David
Hersland
have
in
they
the
living
feeling
natural
to
the
poor
people
around
they
differently
in
they
.
this
will
come
out
in
the
long
history
of
each
one
of
they
.
this
be
now
a
long
history
of
the
old
of
they
,
Martha
Hersland
and
this
be
now
a
beginning
of
description
of
the
way
she
have
in
she
to
be
of
they
the
people
live
near
the
Herslands
in
small
house
near
the
ten
acre
place
where
the
Herslands
be
live
then
in
that
part
of
Gossols
where
no
other
rich
people
be
live
.




as
I
be
say
when
Martha
be
a
little
one
,
when
she
first
go
to
school
and
this
be
very
soon
after
the
Herslands
begin
live
in
the
ten
acre
place
in
that
part
of
Gossols
where
no
other
rich
people
be
live
for
Martha
have
be
bear
when
the
Herslands
have
just
come
to
Gossols
and
be
live
in
the
hotel
as
I
be
say
,
in
the
hotel
where
Mrs.
Hersland
know
Sophie
Shilling
and
Pauline
Shilling
and
Mrs.
Shilling
;
and
so
as
I
be
say
when
they
come
,
the
Hersland
family
,
to
live
on
the
ten
acre
place
where
they
go
on
live
to
after
the
time
when
Martha
a
grown
woman
come
back
out
of
her
trouble
to
live
again
with
they
,
Martha
the
old
of
the
three
Hersland
child
be
old
enough
to
begin
her
schooling
,
be
old
enough
to
begin
have
live
feeling
form
in
she
,
to
be
of
they
the
people
live
near
they
.




as
I
be
say
Mr.
Hersland
believe
in
independence
for
his
child
,
in
democratic
schooling
for
they
,
in
have
a
governess
in
the
house
with
they
for
their
education
,
in
healthy
out
of
door
live
.




Martha
Hersland
then
when
she
be
a
very
little
one
,
when
she
be
a
little
one
,
when
she
be
a
big
one
,
when
she
be
run
her
own
living
,
when
she
be
a
lost
one
,
when
she
be
shrink
when
she
be
old
,
and
always
all
of
her
living
every
minute
in
her
living
be
the
same
one
,
the
same
whole
one
,
to
herself
and
to
every
one
ever
know
her
being
.
she
be
as
I
be
say
a
little
more
concentrated
version
of
the
one
I
be
just
describe
.
like
that
one
she
be
always
all
her
live
a
whole
one
,
like
that
one
always
all
her
live
be
a
whole
one
have
not
really
much
meaning
.
this
be
now
again
a
beginning
of
the
be
Martha
have
in
she
all
her
living
.




some
have
their
real
being
in
young
living
,
some
do
not
have
it
then
in
they
,
all
have
their
real
being
in
young
live
to
some
,
not
any
one
have
their
real
being
in
young
live
to
some
.
Martha
Hersland
have
in
her
independent
dependent
being
as
I
be
say
.
Martha
in
her
young
living
be
a
whole
one
,
always
all
her
live
Martha
be
a
whole
one
.
sometime
she
be
old
,
sometimes
she
be
happy
,
sometimes
she
be
nervouser
,
sometimes
she
be
far
from
and
sometimes
near
failure
,
always
she
have
the
same
being
in
she
,
always
she
be
of
the
independent
dependent
kind
of
they
,
always
she
be
like
the
other
one
I
be
describe
except
that
Martha
have
independent
dependent
being
in
a
little
more
concentrated
form
in
she
and
so
she
would
keep
together
even
without
the
skin
of
she
to
hold
she
,
one
part
would
stick
to
the
other
part
of
she
,
she
would
not
be
flow
everywhere
if
there
be
not
a
skin
to
hold
she
,
so
then
she
be
a
little
in
more
way
a
whole
one
than
the
one
I
be
describe
that
have
independent
dependent
be
in
solution
.
always
then
,
as
I
be
say
,
Martha
be
a
whole
one
.
when
Martha
be
a
little
one
,
as
I
be
say
she
be
of
they
the
poor
child
live
near
the
Hersland
family
then
and
she
go
to
school
with
they
.
when
she
be
a
little
one
as
I
be
say
the
Hersland
family
always
have
a
governess
live
in
the
house
with
they
to
educate
the
Hersland
child
in
music
,
french
and
german
and
any
other
kind
of
education
Mr.
Hersland
at
any
other
time
think
it
would
be
good
for
they
to
be
have
.
the
Hersland
family
then
have
a
governess
live
in
the
house
with
they
when
Martha
be
a
little
one
and
then
on
to
when
Martha
be
quite
old
enough
not
to
like
they
ever
to
be
interfere
with
anything
she
want
to
be
do
,
with
any
kind
of
reading
or
know
any
one
or
any
way
she
be
learn
anything
.
then
later
than
that
they
the
Herslands
still
have
one
and
then
more
and
more
the
governess
live
in
the
house
with
they
have
really
nothing
to
do
with
the
Hersland
child
,
but
always
as
long
as
a
governess
be
in
the
house
with
they
the
governess
would
be
a
little
sometime
troublesome
to
Martha
Hersland
and
her
live
then
.




to
those
know
Martha
Hersland
then
when
she
be
a
young
one
when
she
be
begin
her
individual
being
,
she
be
then
a
whole
one
,
to
no
one
quite
entirely
pleasing
,
but
most
of
those
know
she
then
like
she
well
enough
whenever
they
think
about
she
and
sometimes
then
they
do
not
like
she
.




as
I
be
say
she
go
to
school
with
the
child
near
they
,
the
for
the
Hersland
child
,
poor
child
near
they
.
as
I
be
say
when
the
Hersland
family
move
to
the
ten
acre
place
Martha
be
already
old
enough
to
begin
her
schooling
.
as
I
be
say
then
when
she
be
a
very
little
one
and
she
be
come
home
with
they
,
they
go
fast
than
she
could
then
,
they
leave
she
then
and
she
be
run
with
the
umbrella
one
of
they
have
leave
with
she
after
say
she
would
carry
it
for
she
and
she
be
say
I
will
throw
the
umbrella
in
the
mud
and
then
she
be
cry
,
I
have
throw
the
umbrella
in
the
mud
,
and
then
later
she
get
home
and
the
umbrella
be
not
with
she
but
one
of
the
other
one
one
of
those
who
have
leave
she
go
back
that
day
later
and
get
it
for
she
.
then
she
be
a
very
little
one
and
just
begin
know
the
child
near
she
.
when
she
be
a
little
big
she
be
in
her
live
almost
entirely
of
they
the
people
near
she
.
as
I
be
say
they
mostly
all
like
she
well
enough
when
they
think
about
she
,
they
do
not
think
very
much
about
she
,
sometimes
when
they
think
about
she
they
do
not
like
she
.
she
be
for
they
mostly
then
as
if
she
have
be
one
of
they
in
her
natural
way
of
living
,
there
be
nothing
in
she
to
make
she
a
different
kind
of
child
from
the
other
of
they
,
she
be
of
they
and
yet
a
little
sometimes
it
be
troublesome
to
she
and
for
they
in
she
that
she
be
not
of
they
in
the
living
that
would
have
be
natural
for
she
.
it
be
more
important
in
she
for
they
when
a
little
they
be
begin
all
of
they
to
have
love
in
they
,
for
she
not
be
of
they
a
little
must
not
get
into
a
kind
of
trouble
that
would
be
alright
for
they
in
the
kind
of
living
that
be
the
natural
way
of
live
for
they
.
neither
they
nor
she
really
know
this
inside
they
ever
in
their
living
but
it
be
a
little
troublesome
there
to
she
and
for
they
,
troublesome
as
the
governess
be
in
her
living
,
not
really
ever
interfere
,
sometimes
a
little
attempt
to
be
interfere
,
always
there
as
be
a
thing
that
have
no
meaning
really
in
her
living
but
could
not
ever
have
be
there
ever
if
the
living
that
be
then
for
her
real
living
have
be
for
her
her
natural
way
of
living
.
slowly
this
come
to
be
in
she
as
something
strong
,
something
slowly
make
a
difference
in
she
as
she
grow
old
.
slowly
then
thing
happen
to
these
child
she
know
then
as
they
grow
old
that
would
not
happen
to
she
as
she
grow
old
.
she
be
live
very
much
their
life
when
she
be
not
at
all
any
more
of
they
;
this
be
now
a
little
more
description
of
the
being
in
she
and
how
they
feel
she
every
one
who
then
know
she
.




Mr.
Hersland
as
I
be
say
,
in
his
middle
living
have
in
he
much
impatient
being
.
Mr.
Hersland
as
I
be
say
have
in
he
independent
dependent
being
as
a
bottom
nature
to
he
,
as
most
of
he
.
Martha
Hersland
as
I
be
say
have
independent
dependent
being
as
all
the
being
in
she
.
always
more
and
more
I
be
understand
independent
dependent
being
and
all
the
kind
of
way
it
have
of
be
,
make
different
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
always
more
and
more
I
be
understand
dependent
independent
being
and
all
the
way
it
have
of
be
in
the
kind
of
man
and
woman
have
such
be
in
they
.
always
more
and
more
then
I
be
understand
be
in
all
the
kind
there
be
ever
exist
of
man
and
woman
.
to
commence
again
now
with
Martha
Hersland
and
how
her
father
Mr.
David
Hersland
feel
she
.




as
I
be
say
Mr.
Hersland
have
a
strong
feeling
about
educate
his
child
.
mostly
always
it
be
strongly
in
he
the
feeling
of
the
need
of
educate
they
,
always
it
be
change
in
he
,
the
feeling
he
have
in
he
about
what
kind
of
education
be
the
right
kind
of
education
for
they
but
always
that
be
mostly
always
there
be
one
thing
constant
in
he
the
want
they
to
be
individual
and
independent
.
sometimes
when
they
be
too
much
of
one
kind
of
living
he
have
a
new
theory
of
independence
for
they
that
take
the
form
of
restriction
on
the
liberty
they
be
enjoy
and
sometimes
he
want
that
they
should
be
as
they
would
have
be
if
they
have
have
the
living
that
would
have
be
natural
for
they
and
this
come
to
he
a
few
time
in
the
living
of
his
daughter
Martha
and
he
try
to
make
she
over
but
mostly
he
want
they
to
have
an
education
make
they
to
be
strong
and
independent
.
about
their
live
the
life
,
of
the
poor
people
near
they
,
he
never
really
think
about
this
in
they
.
mostly
as
I
be
say
when
he
be
in
the
country
it
be
to
he
as
if
he
be
of
their
living
,
he
have
then
no
sense
of
social
distinction
,
they
be
poor
man
and
he
be
a
rich
one
,
he
never
want
then
his
child
to
have
any
position
.
his
feeling
about
his
daughter
Martha
then
in
the
beginning
be
that
she
be
of
they
,
later
that
she
could
learn
from
they
what
they
all
know
in
living
,
later
when
she
sometimes
meet
people
it
would
have
be
natural
she
should
be
know
he
be
impatient
at
the
way
she
be
look
and
he
be
full
up
then
with
impatient
feeling
.
mostly
she
be
never
important
to
he
,
very
much
later
in
her
living
she
fill
he
very
full
of
impatient
feeling
.
as
I
be
say
they
be
both
of
they
of
the
independent
dependent
kind
of
they
.
there
be
a
great
difference
in
the
way
they
have
in
they
each
one
of
they
independent
dependent
being
.
Mr.
Hersland
to
his
child
when
they
be
old
enough
to
realise
he
be
very
full
of
impatient
feeling
.
they
be
then
afraid
of
he
though
they
know
it
of
he
that
he
never
would
go
as
far
as
his
anger
could
drive
he
.
they
know
this
of
he
more
and
more
until
almost
they
be
not
afraid
of
he
.




Mr.
Hersland
have
in
he
independent
dependent
being
,
his
daughter
Martha
have
in
her
independent
dependent
being
.
this
being
be
very
different
in
Mr.
Hersland
than
in
Martha
Hersland
as
I
be
say
.
this
be
now
some
description
of
the
difference
between
they
.
this
be
now
some
description
of
the
feeling
in
Mr.
Hersland
in
different
part
of
she
live
about
his
daughter
Martha
and
what
he
think
and
say
about
she
.
to
begin
then
now
with
a
little
description
of
the
different
way
their
be
be
in
the
two
of
they
.




when
Martha
be
a
little
one
she
be
a
whole
one
,
always
she
be
a
whole
one
.
when
Martha
be
a
young
one
she
be
a
whole
one
.
she
be
not
very
interesting
to
her

a
little
interesting
to
some
one
.

be
never
very
interesting
to
her

be
always
with
he
.
in
her
young
living
as
I
be
say

be
really
not
very
interesting
to
any
one
.

be
a
little
interesting
to
some
.

be
never
really
very
interesting
to

of
the
independent
dependent
kind
of
they
.
More

and
more
I
be
understand
the
being
in
man
and
in

each
kind
of
the
two
kind
of
they

Mr.
Hersland
as
I
be
say
have
in
he
independent
dependent
being
.
as
I
be
say
more
and
more
in
his
living
he
be
full
up
with
impatient
being
.
as
I
be
say
he
have
it
in
he
to
always
be
strong
in
beginning
,
to
be
very
strong
in
attack
and
then
he
would
go
another
way
to
another
beginning
never
know
that
he
have
not
finish
to
really
win
,
never
know
this
in
he
,
not
really
even
when
in
his
later
live
his
child
when
they
be
angry
at
the
impatient
be
then
in
he
and
not
then
be
any
long
afraid
of
he
know
then
that
he
never
would
be
carry
through
to
the
end
of
the
anger
in
he
tell
it
to
he
.
he
never
really
know
it
in
he
but
this
be
the
being
in
he
as
I
be
say
.
he
never
know
the
being
in
his
daughter
Martha
until
she
in
his
old
age
living
manage
for
he
,
until
she
come
back
out
of
her
trouble
to
they
and
then
he
be
begin
already
to
be
shrink
from
the
outside
of
he
and
she
be
then
not
interesting
to
he
.
she
never
really
be
interesting
to
he
.
he
never
know
it
in
she
that
she
have
independent
dependent
be
in
she
,
because
for
he
she
be
not
thorough
in
anything
,
she
be
always
begin
and
never
really
begin
anything
.
this
be
in
she
for
he
when
she
be
a
little
one
and
then
when
she
be
begin
her
education
it
be
annoying
to
he
for
always
he
be
really
begin
and
always
she
be
almost
begin
and
then
when
he
be
change
she
be
then
really
begin
and
then
it
be
to
he
in
her
stupid
being
,
that
she
be
nervous
then
and
not
finish
anything
,
not
thorough
in
anything
.
his
feeling
be
very
different
with
his
two
son
who
each
in
their
way
be
annoying
to
he
but
Martha
be
annoying
to
he
be
as
she
be
of
the
same
kind
of
be
as
the
being
that
be
in
he
.
Martha
as
I
be
say
always
be
a
whole
one
,
as
I
be
say
when
she
be
a
young
one
she
be
of
the
living
of
the
people
live
in
small
house
near
the
Hersland
family
then
.
she
be
completely
of
their
living
then
,
the
governess
the
Hersland
family
have
live
with
they
be
sometimes
troublesome
to
Martha
in
her
living
but
only
one
of
they
the
last
one
Madeleine
Wyman
be
ever
really
troublesome
and
that
be
when
she
be
try
as
I
be
say
to
carry
out
in
the
child
and
mostly
on
Martha
who
be
a
girl
and
old
the
idea
of
education
Mr.
Hersland
have
then
in
he
.
it
be
then
that
Mr.
Hersland
come
to
a
realisation
that
Martha
be
not
really
thorough
in
anything
.
Martha
be
hard
-
work
and
do
well
enough
in
her
schooling
but
when
he
want
she
to
have
disciplining
,
to
make
strong
beginning
in
french
and
german
and
music
and
swimming
and
exercise
and
dance
,
as
I
be
say
she
be
always
a
little
mixed
up
in
beginning
and
then
have
a
nervous
confusion
from
the
change
and
Madeleine
Wyman
be
thorough
and
annoying
to
she
and
then
Martha
be
completely
of
they
the
poor
people
near
they
.
as
I
be
say
Martha
be
interesting
enough
then
to
every
one
but
not
really
very
interesting
to
any
one
know
she
then
.
as
I
be
say
she
be
more
completely
of
they
the
poor
people
near
they
when
the
governess
Madeleine
Wyman
be
live
with
the
Hersland
family
in
the
house
with
they
and
for
some
year
long
than
she
be
of
any
other
living
,
be
more
of
they
in
her
feeling
,
in
her
living
,
in
her
understanding
of
all
live
but
always
then
all
of
they
the
poor
people
live
in
small
house
near
they
be
have
thing
happen
to
they
,
the
young
boy
the
young
girl
whom
she
know
then
which
be
not
of
her
future
live
to
have
happen
to
she
then
and
always
neither
she
nor
they
know
this
in
they
but
always
it
be
there
between
they
and
Martha
be
then
there
in
live
neither
bird
or
beast
or
good
red
herring
and
she
do
not
know
it
nor
do
any
one
else
know
it
of
she
then
.




so
then
Martha
's
young
living
be
very
confusing
to
she
then
but
she
do
not
know
it
in
she
then
.
she
have
in
she
as
I
be
say
independent
dependent
being
,
she
have
attack
as
her
natural
way
of
fighting
but
as
I
be
say
she
be
only
a
little
more
concentrated
in
she
being
than
that
other
one
I
be
describe
and
so
when
she
be
in
motion
except
in
jerk
there
be
not
really
very
much
action
,
there
be
very
much
nervous
being
and
confusion
and
this
be
in
her
stupid
being
and
always
all
her
living
she
be
the
same
one
the
same
whole
one
I
have
be
just
describe
.




this
then
be
the
young
live
in
she
.
it
be
well
enough
but
rather
confused
inside
she
.
confusion
always
be
strong
in
she
.
all
of
she
when
it
be
in
motion
just
be
sort
of
knock
together
,
and
that
be
mostly
all
the
active
being
in
she
and
that
be
to
many
who
know
her
obstinacy
and
resist
in
she
and
to
her
father
it
be
that
she
be
never
thorough
.
sometimes
there
be
strong
reaction
for
a
moment
in
she
,
anger
,
or
a
deep
commotion
for
something
that
be
a
disgrace
to
some
one
or
to
she
and
then
she
be
a
little
more
than
the
whole
one
that
she
mostly
just
be
and
be
mostly
to
every
one
.




this
be
then
the
being
in
she
.
always
then
she
be
not
very
interesting
to
any
one
know
she
.
her
mother
have
never
a
very
lively
realisation
of
she
.
her
mother
more
and
more
be
external
to
she
when
she
Martha
be
to
her
mother
no
long
inside
she
.
not
that
Mrs.
Hersland
ever
know
this
in
she
,
always
she
have
a
feeling
of
having
have
and
have
she
as
a
child
as
part
of
she
and
always
she
have
her
dress
and
her
hat
and
all
as
important
to
she
but
as
I
be
say
Martha
be
then
when
she
be
grow
completely
as
completely
as
there
be
really
live
be
in
she
of
they
the
poor
people
live
in
the
small
house
near
the
Hersland
family
then
.
as
I
be
say
later
there
be
a
difference
,
that
they
be
have
live
that
could
not
be
in
one
go
to
be
have
a
different
future
from
that
that
any
of
they
would
have
as
natural
to
they
.
early
when
she
be
a
young
one
,
yes
there
be
a
little
difference
between
they
for
she
have
a
father
and
a
mother
to
they
and
these
other
child
could
be
conscious
of
the
father
and
the
mother
of
she
and
she
have
a
governess
live
in
the
house
with
she
and
servant
and
all
that
that
make
she
in
way
of
living
,
but
mostly
to
they
then
the
poor
people
live
in
the
small
house
those
that
know
she
then
they
do
not
feel
the
difference
to
be
a
difference
that
in
any
way
cut
she
off
from
the
live
natural
to
they
only
they
could
sometimes
be
conscious
of
the
mother
or
the
father
or
the
governess
or
the
servant
when
they
be
with
she
,
when
they
be
not
with
she
,
not
from
anything
in
she
but
from
their
be
really
exist
the
father
and
the
mother
and
the
governess
and
the
servant
of
the
Hersland
family
.
so
then
in
her
young
living
she
be
not
cut
off
from
they
by
her
future
for
the
child
she
be
then
know
be
young
then
and
not
have
any
such
feeling
.
almost
not
at
all
then
be
she
in
any
way
cut
off
from
they
.
sometimes
they
as
I
be
say
,
from
hear
other
people
or
their
parent
talk
,
from
see
they
or
from
something
that
Martha
say
in
talk
could
be
conscious
of
Martha
's
mother
or
father
or
governess
or
servant
live
in
the
house
with
she
and
so
they
might
be
just
by
a
shade
cut
off
from
she
but
mostly
then
she
be
completely
of
they
the
child
and
the
poor
people
live
near
they
.
as
I
be
say
she
be
really
then
,
Martha
,
not
very
interesting
to
any
one
know
she
then
.
she
be
completely
of
they
then
the
people
live
in
small
house
near
the
Hersland
family
then
.
she
have
no
feeling
in
she
of
a
different
kind
of
live
in
she
.
all
the
active
living
there
be
in
she
be
of
the
living
of
the
poor
people
near
she
.




as
I
be
say
when
she
be
quite
a
young
one
there
be
not
any
feeling
in
any
of
they
,
not
in
the
parent
of
these
child
then
any
feeling
that
she
be
in
her
feeling
cut
off
from
they
by
not
be
able
to
have
some
thing
happen
to
she
that
could
not
happen
to
any
one
have
the
kind
of
future
that
be
the
natural
kind
of
future
live
for
she
.
as
I
be
say
a
little
such
a
feeling
come
when
she
be
somewhat
old
,
when
she
be
old
with
they
,
but
in
her
young
living
there
be
not
in
herself
not
in
any
one
of
they
,
a
little
perhaps
in
her
mother
and
the
governess
and
servant
then
live
in
the
house
with
she
,
not
any
in
her
father
then
not
anything
of
such
a
feeling
.
and
so
she
be
completely
of
they
then
to
they
to
all
of
they
the
child
and
the
other
people
live
in
the
small
house
near
the
Hersland
family
ten
acre
living
place
then
,
she
be
completely
then
of
their
living
then
always
even
when
the
child
or
the
other
be
conscious
of
the
exist
of
Mr.
or
Mrs.
Hersland
or
the
governess
or
the
servant
live
with
they
.




at
this
time
Martha
be
completely
of
the
living
of
these
people
near
she
,
of
the
child
and
the
parent
of
they
,
then
in
her
young
living
.
later
as
I
be
say
there
be
the
developing
of
feel
the
natural
future
for
she
in
she
in
they
and
in
her
father
and
a
very
little
in
she
and
always
a
little
more
and
more
in
all
of
they
.
and
then
it
come
that
she
go
away
to
another
kind
of
living
.
this
be
now
a
little
history
of
how
they
feel
she
when
she
be
young
,
when
she
be
a
little
old
,
every
one
who
then
come
to
know
she
.
there
will
be
then
a
little
description
of
the
transition
to
another
kind
of
living
that
then
come
to
she
.




when
she
be
quite
a
young
one
,
as
I
be
say
,
she
be
then
quite
completely
of
the
living
of
the
child
and
the
people
live
near
the
Hersland
family
then
when
the
Hersland
family
be
live
in
that
part
of
Gossols
where
no
other
rich
people
be
live
then
.




she
be
completely
of
their
living
then
.
she
could
have
happen
to
she
then
what
could
happen
to
any
of
they
in
their
living
,
in
their
schooling
,
in
their
playing
,
in
their
quarrelling
,
in
their
liking
,
in
their
disliking
,
in
their
be
interesting
one
to
the
other
of
they
.




as
I
be
say
Martha
Hersland
be
not
then
very
interesting
to
any
of
they
,
she
be
good
enough
at
do
anything
,
they
be
friendly
enough
with
her
most
of
they
,
they
do
not
most
of
they
think
vary
well
of
the
way
she
do
quarrel
whenever
she
do
any
of
that
with
any
of
they
.
one
little
boy
want
she
to
do
love
the
little
boy
who
with
his
sister
live
with
the
father
who
smoke
to
help
his
asthma
but
this
be
not
very
much
of
a
success
for
Martha
then
have
a
nervous
feeling
and
be
not
very
daring
and
be
not
very
understanding
and
have
a
confusion
that
be
a
little
like
want
,
a
little
like
obstinate
hesitation
,
a
little
like
be
afraid
of
everything
,
a
little
like
a
very
stupid
way
of
be
,
and
the
little
boy
then
forget
about
she
be
exist
for
really
Martha
be
not
then
to
any
one
very
interesting
.
Martha
be
alright
then
but
she
be
not
interesting
enough
to
be
successful
in
quarrel
or
in
love
then
,
they
all
of
they
forget
she
a
little
when
she
want
to
be
quarrel
or
they
be
quarrel
or
they
want
to
be
love
or
she
want
to
be
love
.
perhaps
a
very
little
it
be
that
she
be
not
quite
entirely
completely
,
altogether
of
they
,
perhaps
it
be
that
she
be
not
then
really
interesting
to
any
one
.
she
be
of
they
then
so
that
she
be
live
their
living
entirely
then
with
they
and
they
do
begin
with
she
then
in
love
or
in
quarrel
as
they
do
with
each
other
in
their
living
then
but
as
I
be
say
she
be
not
interesting
then
,
the
being
in
she
as
I
be
say
when
it
be
active
be
just
knock
together
in
she
and
that
make
in
she
a
little
confusion
and
she
be
not
stupid
in
ordinary
living
and
she
be
not
interesting
and
that
be
her
young
living
.
when
she
be
a
little
old
she
be
still
always
with
they
the
people
near
the
Hersland
family
then
in
that
part
of
Gossols
where
no
rich
people
be
live
then
.
she
be
with
they
then
live
their
kind
of
be
,
hear
they
talk
and
know
everything
happen
to
they
but
not
any
of
they
then
include
she
with
they
in
quarrel
or
love
,
not
even
as
make
a
beginning
.
the
natural
future
for
she
be
then
separate
they
.
she
be
still
very
much
with
they
,
with
the
girl
she
would
help
the
mother
cook
or
set
the
table
,
she
know
their
daily
living
,
she
help
they
in
wipe
the
dish
when
they
be
wash
they
,
and
be
with
they
and
always
then
she
be
not
of
they
even
as
she
have
be
to
they
when
she
be
a
young
one
and
she
never
know
it
then
and
they
never
know
it
then
.
she
be
not
any
more
interesting
then
.
something
happen
to
she
then
that
make
she
now
for
a
little
time
more
than
the
whole
one
she
be
all
her
live
to
herself
and
perhaps
a
little
to
some
who
then
and
later
know
she
,
it
be
really
just
a
little
accentuation
of
be
put
in
motion
and
of
that
I
will
now
give
a
very
little
description
.




no
one
know
very
much
what
Martha
be

when
she
be

the
family
live
.
not

Martha
be
really
not
tell
any
one
very
much
in
her
young
live
the
feeling
she

in
a
way
too

be
really
then
no
way
for
she
to
tell
any
one
anything
about
her
feeling
.




now
there
will
be
a
little
more
telling
of
the
kind
of
a
whole
one
she
be
,
of
the
kind
of
nature
there
be
in
she
.
there
will
then
be
a
little
more
telling
of
the
moment
in
she
when
the
movement
of
the
being
in
she
be
a
little
fast
,
come
to
be
almost
violent
emotion
in
she
.
there
will
then
be
a
little
telling
of
her
living
,
what
she
be
know
,
what
she
be
feel
in
her
young
living
.
there
will
be
a
little
telling
of
how
much
she
have
hear
about
live
and
how
much
she
have
see
,
how
little
and
how
much
she
know
then
and
what
then
happen
in
she
when
she
see
something
that
really
make
all
her
be
move
together
and
fast
than
it
have
ever
have
motion
before
in
she
.
there
will
be
then
a
little
telling
of
how
much
she
have
hear
about
anything
in
live
,
how
much
she
have
hear
,
and
how
little
she
know
and
what
she
see
then
and
what
she
feel
then
when
she
see
something
that
I
will
now
soon
be
tell
.
this
be
now
a
little
description
of
how
much
she
have
hear
and
how
little
she
know
and
what
she
see
in
her
young
living
.
there
will
then
be
a
description
of
she
see
a
man
hit
a
woman
with
an
umbrella
in
another
part
of
town
from
that
in
which
the
Herslands
be
live
and
of
her
consequent
decide
to
go
to
college
and
get
that
kind
of
education
.
to
begin
then
.
Martha
as
I
be
say
be
of
the
independent
dependent
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
Martha
as
I
be
say
have
it
in
she
to
be
of
the
kind
of
they
that
have
attack
as
their
natural
way
of
win
fighting
.
Martha
as
I
be
say
be
of
this
kind
of
they
.
Martha
as
I
be
say
be
mostly
never
really
attack
.
Martha
as
I
be
say
when
her
be
be
all
of
it
in
motion
,
and
mostly
when
any
of
it
be
in
motion
it
be
all
of
it
in
motion
and
then
it
be
mostly
as
piece
knock
together
in
confusion
and
in
nervous
being
and
not
then
into
really
attack
,
sometimes
it
could
happen
but
this
be
not
very
often
,
yes
in
a
sense
a
very
little
of
it
be
in
she
very
often
,
but
enough
of
it
to
really
make
an
action
be
not
in
she
very
often
,
sometimes
it
could
happen
that
there
be
a
strong
impulse
and
then
there
be
a
strong
movement
of
her
being
of
all
the
being
that
be
Martha
Hersland
and
always
then
it
never
really
even
then
come
to
be
really
attack
,
it
just
go
off
into
very
strong
knock
together
of
piece
of
the
being
in
she
,
a
lively
confusion
inside
she
than
just
the
ordinary
confusion
in
she
and
that
be
all
there
be
of
attack
in
she
in
the
most
active
be
ever
in
she
.
this
be
the
being
in
she
it
be
independent
dependent
be
the
being
that
have
attack
as
the
natural
way
of
win
in
fighting
or
in
love
but
as
I
be
say
the
being
in
she
never
get
into
motion
to
carry
on
to
anything
as
object
in
attack
,
it
just
remain
inside
she
as
knock
together
in
she
to
be
a
confusion
and
a
nervous
being
in
she
.
she
have
in
she
as
I
be
say
,
independent
dependent
being
,
that
be
all
the
being
there
be
in
she
.
as
I
be
say
attack
be
be
the
natural
way
of
win
fighting
in
she
but
attack
never
come
to
be
really
an
action
carry
on
to
anything
outside
she
.




she
be
as
I
be
say
in
her
young
live
not
very
interesting
to
any
one
who
then
know
she
.
she
do
not
then
,
as
I
be
say
tell
very
much
to
any
one
any
feeling
she
have
in
she
,
really
then
nothing
come
to
be
in
her
clear
inside
she
to
tell
any
one
if
any
one
be
there
to
listen
to
she
.
this
be
true
of
she
mostly
all
her
young
living
as
I
be
say
.




she
be
then
as
I
be
say
all
her
young
live
completely
of
they
the
people
live
near
the
Hersland
family
then
,
she
be
then
not
of
the
living
of
her
father
and
her
mother
.
as
I
be
say
later
in
her
young
living
she
be
very
annoying
to
her
father
,
she
be
not
ready
enough
to
be
begin
and
then
there
be
confusion
in
she
when
he
be
change
to
a
new
beginning
and
this
be
often
like
stubborn
resistance
and
often
then
her
father
would
begin
to
have
in
he
very
much
impatient
feeling
and
some
anger
.
and
always
then
Martha
a
little
be
begin
to
be
begin
and
a
little
so
then
she
have
in
her
her
own
feeling
and
a
good
deal
then
she
be
afraid
to
hear
he
when
he
be
begin
with
she
though
always
she
feel
it
a
little
in
she
that
it
be
really
all
impatient
be
in
he
and
that
he
never
would
carry
it
through
against
she
as
anger
the
annoyed
impatient
angry
feeling
he
have
then
toward
she
.
as
I
be
say
all
this
be
mostly
a
trouble
to
she
when
the
governess
Madeleine
Wyman
be
begin
to
take
charge
of
she
.
this
be
too
annoying
to
be
only
confuse
in
she
,
what
right
have
Miss
Wyman
to
be
force
she
,
Martha
,
and
resistance
be
then
in
Martha
a
thing
have
in
she
a
clear
meaning
than
any
time
before
in
her
living
.
really
Martha
be
afraid
of
Madeleine
Wyman
more
in
a
way
than
she
be
of
her
father
,
Madeleine
Wyman
be
a
compact
power
that
keep
go
and
always
be
there
and
there
be
not
really
any
way
of
get
away
from
she
when
one
be
in
the
house
with
she
.
this
be
then
the
beginning
of
more
concentrated
consciousness
of
feeling
in
Martha
this
experience
with
Madeleine
Wyman
.
this
do
not
last
a
long
time
as
I
be
say
early
.
Madeleine
Wyman
come
soon
to
be
only
of
the
living
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Hersland
,
not
at
all
of
the
three
Hersland
child
.
always
she
be
sometimes
troublesome
to
they
but
more
and
more
as
I
be
say
she
be
only
of
the
living
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Hersland
and
not
at
all
of
the
three
Hersland
child
.
always
as
I
be
say
she
be
troublesome
to
they
then
and
later
in
their
living
and
there
will
be
later
more
history
write
of
the
feeling
about
she
in
each
one
of
the
three
of
they
.
now
there
be
to
be
a
little
description
of
Martha
Hersland
and
what
she
know
and
see
and
hear
in
her
young
living
.




as
I
be
say
in
her
young
living
she
be
not
really
ever
very
interesting
to
any
one
know
she
then
.
as
I
be
say
all
the
living
there
be
really
in
she
then
be
of
the
living
of
the
child
and
the
sister
and
the
brother
and
the
father
and
the
mother
of
the
child
that
she
be
know
then
.
the
Hersland
family
living
be
not
really
important
then
as
live
for
she
be
then
.
as
I
be
say
all
the
active
living
really
in
she
,
in
her
young
living
,
be
the
living
of
the
people
live
in
small
house
,
the
people
who
-
be
as
I
be
say
half
poor
city
people
half
poor
country
people
in
their
living
and
their
feeling
.




these
be
then
the
one
that
give
to
she
live
in
her
young
living
all
the
meaning
living
have
in
she
then
.




as
I
be
say
these
child
,
these
people
,
have
in
they
all
of
they
the
feeling
of
city
living
and
the
feeling
of
country
live
.
Martha
Hersland
in
her
young
living
be
completely
of
they
as
I
be
say
.
Martha
Hersland
have
then
in
her
young
live
the
kind
of
feeling
about
live
that
they
have
in
they
.
there
be
as
I
be
say
always
the
difference
of
she
have
a
different
kind
of
father
and
mother
and
way
of
live
from
any
of
they
but
that
be
not
there
in
her
feeling
and
be
not
there
in
their
thinking
,
it
do
however
make
a
difference
in
her
understanding
of
thing
that
happen
among
they
.
as
I
be
say
in
her
very
young
living
and
then
a
little
later
in
her
young
living
she
be
completely
of
they
the
people
live
in
the
small
house
there
then
there
where
there
be
no
rich
people
live
except
the
Hersland
family
as
I
be
say
.
she
be
completely
of
they
,
of
their
living
,
of
their
way
of
feeling
live
in
she
later
young
living
and
yet
already
as
I
be
say
there
could
be
in
she
a
little
less
really
be
of
they
even
than
there
have
be
because
already
then
future
living
be
important
in
the
present
living
of
all
of
they
and
her
future
living
be
a
different
thing
from
their
future
living
.
as
I
be
say
she
have
not
be
so
very
interesting
to
any
one
in
her
young
living
,
to
any
one
of
they
.
as
I
be
say
there
would
be
in
they
a
little
beginning
with
she
too
in
quarrel
one
little
boy
as
I
be
say
try
a
little
in
loving
,
in
thing
they
should
not
be
do
and
really
she
be
not
resist
but
it
could
not
come
to
anything
for
there
be
not
in
she
anything
really
active
inside
she
then
,
she
be
really
not
even
so
important
to
they
then
any
of
they
than
when
she
have
be
a
very
little
one
but
really
as
I
have
be
say
she
never
really
be
interesting
to
any
one
in
her
young
living
.




as
I
be
say
in
she
later
young
living
she
be
completely
with
they
and
yet
then
she
be
the
most
cut
off
from
they
for
then
future
living
be
begin
to
count
in
the
being
and
feel
and
do
of
all
of
they
and
always
her
future
live
more
and
more
certainly
be
a
different
thing
from
that
of
those
she
be
know
then
.
she
be
then
not
really
then
very
interesting
really
to
any
of
they
then
.




she
be
completely
with
they
then
in
her
daily
living
then
,
then
in
her
later
young
living
.
she
be
always
with
they
then
,
then
in
her
later
young
living
,
she
would
be
with
they
whatever
they
be
do
when
she
be
not
at
home
study
in
some
one
of
the
way
her
father
then
be
think
be
important
for
she
to
be
do
.




she
be
with
they
then
,
in
the
day
-
time
,
in
the
evening
,
all
the
time
she
be
with
they
,
the
people
live
in
small
house
near
they
.
some
of
the
girl
and
some
of
the
boy
have
already
commence
to
be
work
.
I
be
say
that
there
be
one
family
live
in
a
small
house
near
the
Hersland
family
then
of
a
mother
a
foreign
woman
who
be
father
wooden
,
and
a
father
who
be
not
important
to
any
one
,
and
three
daughter
who
each
one
sometime
come
to
have
real
beauty
in
they
.
it
be
the
second
one
of
they
whom
Martha
know
very
well
in
the
later
part
of
her
young
living
.
she
have
not
come
yet
to
have
beauty
in
she
this
one
,
she
be
just
begin
to
work
out
to
learn
dress
-
making
.
the
old
one
who
be
work
in
the
city
somewhere
have
come
to
have
her
beauty
and
there
be
queer
thing
one
hear
then
about
she
of
she
marry
a
rich
man
,
a
man
whose
family
make
much
money
make
chocolate
and
every
one
have
hear
of
they
from
eat
the
chocolate
they
be
make
and
the
name
sound
very
italian
and
somehow
every
one
know
though
no
one
of
they
have
ever
see
he
that
he
be
a
handsome
fierce
look
black
-
moustached
man
and
a
very
rich
one
.
none
of
the
family
of
this
girl
ever
say
anything
,
Martha
Hersland
do
not
know
really
where
she
hear
all
about
the
old
girl
for
when
she
think
it
over
she
know
no
one
have
tell
she
.
it
come
to
be
in
she
then
like
something
she
have
dream
about
some
one
and
so
it
have
all
of
it
no
real
meaning
for
she
.
she
know
dimly
that
all
of
they
the
three
Banks
boy
one
of
whom
be
learn
telegraph
,
one
of
whom
be
learn
shoemaking
,
the
other
learn
nothing
and
perhaps
sometimes
steal
something
,
she
know
they
know
the
three
girl
and
say
thing
to
they
that
Martha
be
never
really
hear
but
as
I
be
say
Martha
be
not
really
interesting
then
to
any
one
and
inside
,
her
feeling
be
not
active
to
be
to
herself
or
to
any
one
a
thing
possibly
have
then
any
expression
.
the
young
Rodman
boy
be
to
she
a
little
more
an
active
awakening
because
he
say
thing
to
make
she
be
understanding
.
there
be
two
of
they
,
the
eld
a
big
lumber
fellow
and
this
young
one
who
make
fun
of
she
whenever
he
see
she
and
he
just
annoy
she
and
that
be
not
really
very
active
then
in
she
.
she
be
,
as
I
be
say
,
of
they
,
she
be
always
with
they
,
all
of
they
,
she
hear
they
talk
,
she
know
what
they
be
do
,
she
would
listen
to
the
mother
and
the
father
of
they
talk
,
she
have
no
other
notion
of
living
than
that
she
see
and
hear
and
feel
and
have
when
she
be
with
they
and
always
her
future
would
be
a
different
one
and
so
she
be
not
then
understand
what
all
of
they
be
live
for
to
she
her
future
living
be
unknown
and
so
she
have
no
present
living
,
with
all
of
they
then
it
be
a
different
thing
,
their
present
living
be
their
future
living
and
so
she
be
not
really
ever
then
of
they
.
as
I
be
say
Martha
be
not
then
really
interesting
to
any
one
.
as
I
be
say
feel
be
then
in
she
not
very
clear
to
herself
or
to
any
one
.
as
I
be
say
she
be
annoying
then
to
her
father
by
she
not
make
very
good
beginning
and
not
be
as
he
put
it
really
thorough
in
anything
.
no
one
of
his
child
ever
be
to
he
in
their
young
living
really
thorough
in
anything
.
the
other
two
be
interested
in
resist
beginning
or
in
beginning
,
he
have
not
any
such
a
satisfaction
,
as
I
be
say
,
with
his
daughter
and
she
be
then
in
her
later
young
living
annoying
to
he
.
he
want
she
to
learn
housekeeping
then
and
to
he
it
be
a
good
thing
for
she
to
be
with
they
the
poor
people
live
near
they
so
she
could
do
what
all
those
other
girl
she
know
could
do
as
to
cooking
and
dress
-
making
and
of
course
Martha
could
not
really
do
they
and
sometimes
then
he
ask
she
to
do
some
such
thing
and
then
of
course
she
could
not
do
it
for
he
and
then
he
would
be
full
up
with
impatient
feeling
that
she
could
not
do
that
thing
,
that
always
she
be
not
as
he
put
it
ever
thorough
in
anything
.
and
always
all
this
time
she
be
study
in
one
way
or
another
,
with
tutor
or
a
teacher
from
the
school
near
she
and
sometimes
by
herself
and
then
there
come
to
be
a
change
in
she
and
for
she
.
always
her
mother
be
not
very
close
to
she
.
the
mother
be
there
always
for
all
of
her
child
but
this
be
for
Martha
only
when
she
be
a
little
sick
or
for
dress
or
for
an
occasional
visiting
.
this
be
the
time
when
Mrs.
Hersland
be
have
in
she
her
most
important
feeling
of
herself
inside
she
as
I
be
say
.
so
Martha
be
not
then
really
very
interesting
to
any
one
.
Martha
always
be
a
whole
one
as
I
be
say
.
Martha
be
not
then
really
very
interesting
to
any
one
.




there
will
be
much
description
of
the
feeling
her
brother
have
about
their
sister
in
the
long
history
that
will
be
write
later
of
the
two
of
they
.
there
will
be
very
much
write
of
the
feeling
the
father
Mr.
Hersland
have
about
she
in
the
history
to
be
write
later
of
the
ending
of
the
being
in
he
.
there
will
never
be
very
much
write
of
the
feeling
that
the
mother
have
about
she
.
always
then
,
as
I
be
say
,
to
each
one
she
be
a
whole
one
.
there
have
be
now
a
little
write
of
how
those
who
know
she
when
she
be
a
young
one
,
feel
she
.
as
I
be
say
mostly
she
be
not
really
very
interesting
to
any
one
.
as
I
be
say
she
be
then
not
very
interesting
to
any
one
who
then
know
she
.
the
servant
and
the
governess
except
perhaps
a
little
Madeleine
Wyman
when
she
be
try
to
carry
out
on
she
the
theory
of
education
Mr.
Hersland
always
be
explain
then
to
she
have
not
very
individual
feeling
about
she
.
she
be
one
of
the
Hersland
family
to
they
.
some
of
her
teacher
at
the
school
where
Martha
get
her
american
education
have
a
little
more
feeling
about
she
.
some
of
they
almost
be
nearly
interested
in
she
.
she
could
have
a
kind
of
earnestness
in
she
,
it
never
come
really
to
be
there
in
she
in
her
young
living
and
to
some
of
her
teacher
then
it
be
that
she
have
a
stupid
way
of
be
resist
,
of
be
obstinate
in
she
,
but
as
I
be
say
sometimes
a
little
one
of
they
almost
would
be
interested
in
she
particularly
after
a
governess
or
her
father
have
be
there
to
talk
about
she
,
to
explain
about
she
,
to
arrange
about
,
she
.
so
then
as
I
be
say
Martha
Hersland
in
her
young
living
be
not
really
very
interesting
to
any
one
who
then
know
she
.
Martha
Hersland
as
I
be
say
be
always
a
whole
one
.
Martha
as
I
be
say
be
of
the
independent
dependent
kind
of
they
.
the
being
in
Martha
as
I
be
say
be
mostly
always
just
in
a
state
of
be
in
confusion
.
there
be
as
I
be
say
in
Martha
very
much
nervous
be
accompany
the
confusion
in
she
be
whenever
the
being
in
she
be
in
motion
.
mostly
always
the
being
in
she
be
in
this
kind
of
a
confusion
.
as
I
be
say
Martha
be
of
the
independent
dependent
kind
of
they
.
this
be
now
again
a
little
a
description
of
the
being
in
she
.




Martha
be
as
I
be
say
of
the
independent
dependent
kind
of
man
and
woman
.
Martha
be
one
of
this
kind
of
they
and
have
it
as
be
to
have
this
kind
of
be
all
of
it
that
be
in
she
of
the
same
degree
of
concentration
,
that
be
to
say
that
there
be
no
part
of
the
being
in
she
more
accented
,
more
effective
in
she
than
another
part
of
the
being
in
she
.
that
be
to
say
it
be
like
this
in
she
.
the
one
that
I
be
describe
and
that
be
a
whole
one
only
ever
by
the
skin
of
she
hold
she
together
there
might
be
one
who
might
be
like
she
and
so
then
this
one
though
still
of
the
independent
dependent
kind
of
they
would
have
this
be
with
different
accent
different
meaning
in
different
part
of
the
being
that
be
this
one
.
some
have
all
kind
of
combination
of
kind
in
they
and
some
as
I
be
say
have
even
another
kind
of
substance
mix
up
with
they
,
the
dependent
independent
kind
of
be
as
we
be
say
.
now
Martha
Hersland
as
I
say
in
the
beginning
of
this
description
of
the
being
in
she
be
like
the
one
that
I
be
describe
that
be
all
independent
dependent
be
in
solution
and
in
so
fluid
a
condition
that
this
being
be
only
make
an
individual
one
by
the
skin
separate
it
from
flow
over
everything
near
it
to
lose
itself
in
everything
and
not
have
individual
exist
,
Martha
Hersland
then
as
I
be
say
be
like
this
one
only
Martha
be
a
little
more
solid
and
there
be
a
little
more
solidity
to
she
but
as
I
be
say
there
be
not
much
more
really
effective
movement
to
she
.
the
other
one
the
first
one
I
be
describe
when
substance
that
be
all
of
she
be
set
in
motion
mostly
it
just
sort
of
bobble
up
and
down
in
she
it
be
not
active
enough
to
give
any
onward
attack
motion
to
the
whole
of
she
that
be
make
by
the
skin
of
she
hold
she
together
and
so
there
never
come
to
be
real
attack
in
she
indeed
as
I
be
say
it
be
to
most
every
one
see
she
,
this
one
,
as
if
she
have
resist
be
in
she
for
the
substance
of
she
be
a
heavy
slightly
sticky
one
as
I
be
say
and
though
attack
being
be
the
way
of
active
be
in
she
it
come
to
it
that
she
be
really
resist
because
she
never
get
to
anything
more
than
a
little
bobbing
motion
and
this
one
be
so
an
obstruction
;
always
of
course
there
be
a
slight
attack
action
to
she
for
that
be
the
nature
of
the
being
in
she
but
to
every
one
feel
she
it
be
resist
,
stupid
being
,
obstinacy
of
a
dull
kind
in
she
,
and
that
be
the
being
in
she
.
now
Martha
Hersland
as
I
be
say
be
like
this
one
only
a
little
more
solid
and
so
when
there
be
a
strong
emotion
to
give
motion
to
she
there
could
be
more
real
attacking
be
in
she
than
there
ever
could
be
in
the
one
I
be
just
describe
.
as
I
be
say
Martha
have
as
be
a
substance
solid
enough
so
that
Martha
's
skin
so
to
speak
be
part
of
the
substance
of
she
,
she
be
a
whole
one
then
more
than
just
by
be
hold
together
by
a
skin
as
be
the
case
in
the
other
.
Martha
then
have
a
little
more
real
attacking
movement
in
she
than
the
other
one
I
be
describe
who
in
mixture
of
be
be
just
like
she
.
Martha
have
not
really
very
much
forward
attack
motion
in
she
.
mostly
in
she
too
it
be
a
confused
interaction
and
make
a
confused
being
in
she
that
be
to
many
know
her
stupid
be
in
she
.
this
be
in
she
to
many
know
she
like
resist
be
in
she
but
as
I
be
say
she
have
not
really
in
her
resist
being
as
a
way
of
win
,
as
a
way
of
fighting
,
as
a
way
of
loving
,
as
I
be
say
confused
being
that
be
resist
be
in
she
to
many
know
she
be
stupid
be
in
she
,
be
failure
in
she
.




as
I
be
say
Martha
when
she
be
a
young
one
be
not
really
very
interesting
to
any
one
who
know
she
then
.
she
be
until
she
be
nearly
,
almost
,
a
young
woman
of
the
feeling
and
the
living
of
poor
people
as
I
be
say
,
more
than
she
be
then
of
any
other
living
.
she
be
in
her
daily
living
of
their
living
and
their
feeling
as
I
be
say
.
this
be
now
a
little
description
of
the
feeling
and
the
living
she
then
have
in
she
.
she
be
always
then
as
I
be
say
of
the
living
and
the
feeling
of
the
people
,
and
the
other
people
that
know
they
,
of
people
in
very
small
house
live
near
the
Hersland
family
then
.
she
be
of
their
daily
living
then
as
I
be
say
.
this
be
now
a
little
description
of
what
she
know
with
they
and
what
she
do
not
know
with
they
then
.




as
I
be
say
Martha
Hersland
be
all
through
her
young
living
of
the
feeling
and
the
living
of
,
for
her
natural

.

be
of
the

have
in
they
as
I
say
of
they
half

she
be
as
I
be

as
there
be
in
she
then
of
feeling

living
of
their

time
,
she
be
of

more
than

.
as
I
be
just
say
she
be
with
they
often
in
the
evening
when
she
be
not
any
long
a
very
young
one
,
she
be
with
they
then
very
much
of
the
day
-
time
,
she
be
as
I
be
say
of
their
daily
living
and
their
daily
feeling
almost
all
the
daily
living
and
the
daily
feeling
there
be
in
she
then
.




she
be
with
they
as
I
be
just
say
often
in
the
evening
now
that
she
be
no
long
a
very
little
one
and
very
much
of
the
day
-
time
.
some
of
they
,
the
young
one
whom
she
know
then
be
begin
now
to
go
out
work
and
she
see
they
when
they
come
back
from
their
working
and
she
be
with
they
then
and
she
be
with
they
then
again
in
the
evening
.
as
I
have
say
almost
all
there
be
of
daily
living
and
daily
feeling
then
in
she
be
of
the
daily
living
and
the
daily
feeling
of
these
young
people
and
their
friend
and
relation
and
this
be
not
very
important
to
any
one
then
that
this
be
the
daily
living
and
the
daily
feeling
of
Martha
Hersland
then
.
sometimes
Mr.
Hersland
suddenly
remember
that
Martha
should
not
go
out
in
the
evening
,
mostly
he
do
not
pay
much
attention
to
the
daily
feeling
and
the
daily
live
in
she
then
.
sometimes
as
I
be
say
he
would
suddenly
remember
she
should
not
go
out
in
the
evening
alone
with
these
young
people
near
they
and
then
he
would
forbid
her
going
and
he
would
tell
she
that
she
should
stay
in
the
house
and
be
with
her
mother
and
then
he
would
lecture
her
brother
that
he
do
not
take
well
care
of
his
sister
.




"
you
have
to
take
care
of
her
sometime
and
you
might
as
well
begin
,
the
soon
the
well
.
you
will
have
to
do
it
soon
or
later
,
I
tell
you
.
"




"
I
'll
take
mine
later
,
"
say
the
brother
but
he
be
careful
that
his
father
do
not
hear
and
he
go
out
that
evening
as
he
do
many
evening
as
I
will
be
tell
later
in
the
long
history
of
the
living
of
he
,
but
on
that
evening
Martha
Hersland
could
not
go
out
to
be
with
the
other
.




Mr.
Hersland
's
remembering
that
she
should
not
go
out
in
the
evening
do
not
happen
very
often
.
mostly
she
go
out
in
the
evening
and
the
day
-
time
.
sometimes
her
father
come
home
from
the
city
and
see
Martha
stand
in
the
yard
of
some
of
the
small
house
talk
would
get
very
angry
that
she
be
not
at
home
study
.
he
could
often
get
very
angry
and
be
full
up
with
impatient
feeling
as
I
be
say
whenever
he
remember
that
Martha
be
his
daughter
and
be
not
just
what
he
would
have
she
.
at
this
time
they
have
not
any
governess
live
in
the
house
with
they
.
Madeleine
Wyman
have
leave
they
and
they
have
no
governess
after
this
one
.
Mrs.
Hersland
then
do
not
have
much
meaning
in
the
family
live
.
she
be
weaken
a
little
inside
she
then
as
I
say
when
I
be
describe
the
living
in
she
,
she
be
lose
then
between
her
big
child
and
the
father
of
they
as
I
be
then
say
then
when
I
be
describe
the
being
in
Mrs.
Hersland
.
so
then
as
I
be
just
say
Martha
be
in
her
daily
living
and
her
daily
feel
more
of
they
the
people
in
small
house
near
the
Hersland
family
then
than
she
be
of
any
other
daily
living
or
daily
feeling
then
.
as
I
be
say
she
be
with
they
often
in
the
evening
,
as
I
be
say
she
be
not
then
very
interesting
to
any
of
they
then
.
as
I
be
say
the
future
which
would
be
different
for
she
in
kind
than
the
future
of
they
make
a
separation
between
they
in
the
thing
she
be
know
with
they
and
the
thing
they
be
know
among
they
,
in
the
thing
she
be
feel
with
they
and
the
thing
they
be
feel
among
they
,
in
the
thing
she
be
do
with
they
and
the
thing
they
be
do
among
they
,
in
the
way
she
be
interesting
to
they
and
the
way
they
be
interesting
to
each
other
among
themselves
then
.
as
I
be
say
all
there
be
of
daily
living
and
daily
feeling
in
she
then
be
of
the
daily
feeling
and
daily
living
they
have
among
they
.
as
I
be
say
in
a
way
she
be
separate
from
they
,
though
all
the
living
and
feel
she
have
in
she
then
be
the
living
and
feel
she
have
from
they
,
by
the
future
living
that
would
be
different
in
she
live
from
the
future
live
any
of
they
would
naturally
be
have
.




as
I
be
say
she
be
then
not
really
very
interesting
to
any
one
.
she
might
have
be
a
little
interesting
a
couple
of
evening
to
Harry
Brenner
but
she
never
really
be
interesting
to
he
.
as
I
be
say
she
be
then
of
their
daily
living
and
their
daily
feeling
,
the
poor
people
near
they
,
and
she
be
with
they
a
good
deal
in
the
day
-
time
and
she
be
with
they
very
often
in
the
evening
.
as
I
be
say
sometimes
her
father
remember
that
she
should
not
be
out
with
they
in
the
evening
and
he
would
forbid
she
go
out
that
evening
and
he
would
lecture
her
brother
Alfred
because
he
do
not
take
care
of
his
sister
who
should
not
go
out
in
the
evening
in
the
way
she
be
do
and
the
father
be
full
up
then
as
I
be
say
with
impatient
feeling
and
then
that
would
be
the
end
of
his
interfere
with
Martha
's
daily
living
and
daily
feeling
and
Martha
be
go
out
in
the
evening
.
the
mother
Mrs.
Hersland
be
then
as
I
be
say
in
the
history
of
her
living
lose
then
among
her
child
and
the
father
of
they
.
always
then
in
her
young
live
Martha
be
of
they
the
people
near
they
and
this
be
of
she
until
she
be
almost
a
young
woman
.




as
I
be
say
she
be
of
they
the
poor
people
in
her
daily
living
and
in
her
daily
feeling
,
as
I
be
say
she
be
not
so
interesting
to
any
of
they
as
they
be
to
each
other
then
and
this
be
mostly
because
of
the
future
live
there
be
for
she
in
she
and
a
little
perhaps
from
the
way
be
be
in
she
but
mostly
it
be
from
the
future
living
of
she
that
be
naturally
to
be
different
from
that
of
those
she
be
then
know
.
as
I
be
say
she
be
not
so
interesting
to
any
of
they
as
they
be
to
each
other
then
and
she
be
not
feel
and
living
and
understand
anything
really
in
the
way
they
be
do
then
.
as
I
be
say
she
almost
might
have
be
interesting
to
they
from
she
almost
be
interesting
a
couple
of
evening
to
Harry
Brenner
who
be
one
of
they
but
she
do
not
come
to
be
really
interesting
to
he
.
perhaps
it
be
the
future
live
in
she
that
make
she
not
come
to
be
really
interesting
to
Harry
Brenner
then
although
there
be
almost
a
beginning
of
be
interested
in
he
.
that
be
the
end
of
it
though
then
,
she
never
as
I
be
say
be
really
interesting
to
any
of
they
then
.




so
then
this
be
the
being
,
the
living
,
the
feeling
,
the
understanding
in
Martha
Hersland
up
to
she
almost
be
a
young
woman
this
that
I
have
be
describe
.
her
father
as
I
be
say
have
many
idea
about
her
education
and
then
he
have
impatient
feeling
in
he
that
she
be
not
the
kind
of
daughter
he
have
want
to
have
as
a
daughter
to
he
.
the
mother
as
I
be
say
then
have
only
a
dim
feeling
then
of
the
being
,
and
the
living
,
and
the
feeling
there
be
then
in
her
child
.
thing
be
a
little
dim
in
she
then
but
to
herself
then
she
and
they
and
the
father
of
they
be
still
then
of
the
living
that
be
the
natural
living
for
they
.
to
herself
inside
she
they
be
never
at
any
time
neither
she
nor
her
husband
nor
her
child
nor
their
family
ever
really
cut
off
from
the
living
that
be
the
natural
living
to
they
.
really
she
be
then
lose
among
they
,
that
be
the
real
being
in
she
then
,
really
the
being
in
herself
and
in
her
husband
and
her
child
be
really
then
a
very
dim
thing
to
she
then
but
always
there
be
in
she
the
feeling
as
I
be
say
of
be
in
herself
and
in
her
husband
and
her
child
part
of
the
well
to
do
living
which
be
the
natural
being
for
she
,
the
only
be
she
ever
have
have
,
to
her
feeling
,
in
she
.




so
then
as
I
be
say
Martha
Hersland
in
her
daily
feeling
,
in
her
daily
living
be
of
the
daily
living
and
the
daily
feeling
of
the
people
live
in
small
house
near
the
Hersland
family
then
live
in
the
part
of
Gossols
where
no
other
rich
people
be
live
.
her
father
as
I
be
say
be
of
their
daily
living
and
their
daily
feeling
too
somewhat
then
and
on
Sundays
when
he
walk
and
stop
to
talk
to
they
and
sit
down
in
the
house
with
the
woman
when
they
be
cook
and
eat
something
there
in
the
kitchen
with
they
and
feel
inside
he
a
feeling
that
they
be
woman
there
in
a
room
with
he
.
then
it
be
to
he
a
good
thing
,
then
when
he
have
this
kind
of
feeling
of
they
the
woman
in
he
,
then
he
think
and
say
it
be
a
good
thing
Martha
should
learn
how
to
do
thing
,
cooking
and
sewing
and
living
and
feel
like
the
woman
he
be
see
then
have
as
woman
in
he
to
he
,
then
when
he
be
sit
with
they
in
the
kitchen
or
sometimes
in
their
little
garden
.
then
he
say
Martha
should
learn
the
living
they
have
in
they
,
and
he
say
it
to
they
and
then
he
say
it
to
Martha
when
he
see
she
.
this
be
one
way
he
have
of
feel
about
her
being
of
the
daily
living
and
the
daily
feeling
of
these
people
live
near
they
.
then
sometimes
of
an
evening
as
I
be
say
he
would
see
Martha
leave
the
house
and
he
would
suddenly
remember
then
she
should
not
go
out
of
an
evening
,
that
be
no
way
a
daughter
of
his
in
his
position
should
he
act
and
then
he
would
tell
she
he
would
see
to
it
that
she
should
stay
home
and
he
would
employ
some
one
to
look
after
she
and
make
of
she
the
kind
of
educate
person
that
it
be
right
he
should
have
for
a
daughter
.
and
so
as
I
be
say
Martha
Hersland
until
she
be
almost
a
young
woman
be
in
her
daily
living
and
in
her
daily
feeling
of
they
the
people
live
in
the
small
house
near
the
ten
acre
place
where
the
Hersland
family
be
live
then
and
she
be
with
they
and
in
the
house
of
they
a
good
deal
in
the
daytime
and
she
be
a
good
deal
with
all
of
they
in
the
evening
in
the
later
part
of
her
young
living
and
as
I
be
say
she
be
not
really
then
interesting
to
any
of
they
and
as
I
be
say
she
be
not
then
really
feel
and
really
live
and
really
understand
the
living
and
the
feeling
that
they
have
together
then
amongst
they
.
this
be
the
daily
living
and
the
daily
feeling
in
Martha
Hersland
and
the
being
in
Martha
Hersland
this
that
I
have
be
just
describe
when
it
come
that
she
have
an
awakening
into
realler
feeling
and
then
she
come
to
have
a
real
attack
moment
and
it
last
to
she
begin
her
university
education
.
this
be
now
a
little
description
of
this
in
she
.




as
I
be
say
she
have
a
being
in
she
that
be
mostly
in
a
condition
always
all
her
living
of
be
in
a
state
of
confusion
inside
she
.
this
give
to
she
always
very
much
nervous
be
in
she
,
this
make
she
to
every
one
often
very
stupid
in
resist
and
very
slow
in
beginning
and
very
foolish
in
not
remember
anything
that
she
should
have
be
learn
in
her
living
.
this
will
come
out
very
clearly
in
the
description
of
she
live
with
her
husband
and
then
later
with
her
father
after
she
have
come
back
to
live
with
he
after
all
the
trouble
she
have
in
her
living
.
it
will
come
out
very
clearly
then
the
being
in
she
,
the
confusion
always
in
she
that
make
she
to
every
one
know
she
mostly
always
very
stupid
in
resist
and
really
very
slow
and
yet
very
jerky
and
unexpected
in
beginning
and
very
foolish
in
not
remember
what
having
be
experience
something
any
one
would
have
suppose
she
would
have
be
really
learn
.




now
there
will
be
a
little
more
description
of
her
daily
living
,
of
the
living
and
the
feeling
of
the
living
and
the
feeling
of
the
people
in
the
little
house
near
the
Hersland
family
then
in
her
young
living
and
the
ending
in
she
of
this
living
and
this
feeling
.




the
kind
of
be
she
have
in
she
I
have
already
a
little
be
describe
,
the
kind
of
a
whole
one
that
she
be
and
the
nature
and
the
kind
of
way
her
be
be
active
in
she
.
there
have
be
too
a
little
description
of
how
much
she
have
hear
and
how
little
she
know
in
living
.
as
I
be
say
she
be
not
then
really
very
interesting
to
any
one
.
no
one
know
anything
very
much
then
of
what
she
be
feel
about
anything
then
and
she
do
not

what
she
feel
then
about
anything
in
living
and
nobody
know
what
she
feel
then
about
living
and
really
she
do
not
clearly
then
feel
anything
.




this
be
the
way
she
be
then
when
one
day
when
she
be
alone
in
another
part
of
the
town
where
she
have
go
to
take
a
lesson
in
singing
she
see
a
man
hit
a
woman
with
an
umbrella
,
and
the
woman
have
a
red
face
partly
in
anger
and
partly
in
asking
and
the
man
want
the
woman
to
know
then
that
he
want
she
to
leave
he
alone
then
in
a
public
street
where
people
be
pass
and
Martha
see
this
and
this
man
be
for
she
the
ending
of
the
living
I
have
be
describe
that
she
have
be
live
.
she
would
go
to
college
,
she
know
it
then
and
understand
everything
and
know
the
meaning
of
the
living
and
the
feeling
in
man
and
in
woman
.
she
would
go
to
college
and
she
tell
it
then
to
her
father
and
her
mother
and
they
have
no
objection
,
no
one
be
pay
very
much
attention
and
she
begin
her
preparation
and
she
come
to
know
some
other
young
girl
and
young
boy
,
not
rich
one
like
those
it
be
natural
she
should
then
be
know
but
more
of
her
natural
kind
than
any
she
have
know
before
in
her
living
.
one
of

once
a
very
little
one
a
baby
,
and
then
a

young
girl
and
then
a
woman
and
then
she
be
old
and
then
later
there
be
an
ending
to
she
and
always
all
through
this
living
in
she
she
be
the
same
whole
one
inside
she
and
to
every
one
who
know
she
.




in
the
description
of
she
that
I
have
be
write
so
far
Martha
have
be
a
very
little
one
,
a
baby
,
and
then
a
little
one
and
then
a
young
girl
and
then
about
to
become
a
young
woman
and
always
then
in
a
way
to
herself
inside
she
and
to
every
one
know
she
she
have
be
the
same
whole
one
.
this
be
then
as
I
be
say
in
a
way
always
true
she
be
always
the
same
whole
one
inside
she
and
to
every
one
ever
know
she
.




in
some
the
nature
in
they
be
clear
when
they
be
very
young
,
in
some
when
they
be
young
,
in
some
when
they
be
not
so
young
,
in
some
when
they
be
get
old
,
in
some
when
they
be
old
one
.
Martha
be
mostly
always
to
every
one
who
know
she
the
same
whole
one
,
when
she
be
a
very
little
one
,
a
little
one
,
an
old
one
,
a
very
old
one
,
mostly
always
she
be
to
every
one
about
the
same
kind
of
a
whole
one
.




and
this
in
a
way
always
be
true
of
she
,
all
her
living
she
be
the
same
whole
one
,
there
be
very
little
change
in
she
,
mostly
all
her
live
the
whole
of
she
be
repeat
completely
,
when
she
be
learn
,
when
she
be
love
,
when
in
her
later
live
she
be
still
struggle
.
she
be
then
all
her
live
the
same
whole
one
,
there
be
the
same
concentration
of
be
in
she
,
the
same
the
proportion
of
one
thing
to
the
other
thing
active
in
she
.




as
I
be
say
this
be
in
the
main
true
of
she
,
she
be
of
the
kind
of
man
and
woman
and
there
be
always
many
many
million
of
they
and
they
be
of
every
kind
in
a
way
of
man
and
woman
,
that
be
of
independent
dependent
or
dependent
independent
kind
of
they
who
be
all
their
living
the
same
whole
one
who
always
be
repeat
the
complete
whole
thing
they
always
be
in
themselves
and
to
every
one
,
who
have
the
same
concentration
of
the
being
in
they
always
all
their
living
when
they
be
baby
,
when
they
be
young
one
,
when
they
be
old
one
,
when
they
be
old
one
,
who
have
the
same
proportion
of
one
thing
to
the
other
thing
active
in
they
every
minute
in
their
living
.
as
I
be
say
Martha
Hersland
be
of
this
kind
of
they
though
there
be
moment
in
her
living
when
it
seem
a
little
different
in
she
for
sometimes
she
really
get
into
motion
and
mostly
as
I
be
say
motion
be
just
confusion
in
she
,
it
never
come
to
movement
in
she
it
just
be
mix
up
of
be
inside
she
.




as
I
be
say
she
be
of
the
independent
dependent
kind
of
be
those
have
in
they
attack
as
their
natural
way
of
win
fighting
,
as
their
natural
way
of
win
in
loving
,
and
as
I
be
say
mostly
in
she
,
commotion
in
she
do
not
make
an
actual
attack
by
she
for
she
and
this
be
not
there
really
to
herself
inside
she
,
to
herself
there
be
real
movement
in
she
,
but
to
every
one
then
there
be
only
stupid
resist
and
nervous
be
in
she
and
this
be
mostly
the
whole
history
of
she
.
as
I
be
say
this
be
not
quite
the
whole
history
of
she
,
it
do
come
to
happen
in
she
,
sometimes
in
the
living
,
in
the
history
of
she
,
that
the
shock
of
commotion
in
she
be
so
strong
as
to
give
a
forward
movement
to
she
.
as
I
be
say
that
happen
once
to
she
when
she
be
a
very
little
one
when
she
throw
down
the
umbrella
,
it
happen
every
now
and
then
in
she
,
it
happen
,
as
I
be
say
,
when
she
see
the
man
hit
the
woman
in
the
street
with
his
umbrella
to
rid
himself
then
of
she
and
of
the
asking
in
she
.
when
she
see
this
it
be
not
a
horror
she
have
in
she
,
really
she
have
not
any
very
certain
feeling
in
she
,
mostly
in
her
living
,
as
I
be
say
,
she
have
not
any
very
certain
feeling
,
mostly
as
I
be
say
it
be
confusion
,
excitement
and
nervousness
she
have
in
she
when
there
be
movement
inside
she
,
then
as
I
be
say
,
when
she
see
the
man
hit
the
woman
with
an
umbrella
and
she
be
just
then
pass
,
she
have
not
then
as
I
be
say
any
distinct
feeling
then
in
she
about
what
she
have
be
see
,
not
then
and
not
then
later
,
but
it
give
a
motion
to
she
,
it
give
her
direction
to
get
for
herself
a
university
education

Phillip
Redfern
be
bear
in
a
small
city

in
the
south
western
part
of
this
country
.
he
be
the
son
of
a
consciously
ill
-
assorted
pair
of
parent
and
his
early
intellectual
concept
so
in
his
later
living
he
be
always
say
as
I
will
soon
be
tell
,
be
the
realisation
of
the
quality
of
these
two
decisive
and
unharmonised
element
in
his
child
life
.
he
remember
too
very
well
his
first
definite
realisation
of
the
quality
of
woman
when
the
inherent
contradiction
in
the
claim
make
for
that
sex
awoke
in
he
much
confused
thought
.
he
often
say
that
he
have
often
puzzle
over
the
fact
that
he
must
give
up
his
chair
to
and
be
careful
of
little
girl
while
at
the
same
time
he
be
teach
that
the
little
girl
be
quite
as
strong
as
he
and
quite
as
able
to
use
liberty
and
to
perfect
action
.
in
his
later
living
he
say
that
when
he
be
a
very
little
one
this
have
be
so
much
a
puzzle
to
he
,
little
girl
then
,
to
he
,
have
everything
,
he
wish
then
when
he
be
a
little
one
and
this
be
a
puzzle
to
he
,
he
wish
he
have
be
a
little
girl
so
and
so
have
everything
.




his
mother
be
his
dear
dear
friend
then
and
from
she
he
receive
then
all
the
thought
and
conviction
that
be
definite
and
conscious
then
and
for
a
long
time
after
in
he
.
she
be
an
eager
,
impetuous
,
sensitive
creature
,
full
of
ideal
enthusiasm
in
her
being
,
with
moment
of
clear
purpose
and
vigorous
thinking
but
for
the
most
part
be
excitably
prejudiced
and
inconsequent
in
sensitive
enthusiasm
and
give
to
accept
and
giving
and
living
sensation
and
impression
under
the
conviction
that
she
have
they
as
carefully
think
out
theory
and
principle
that
be
complete
from
reasoning
.
her
constant
rebellion
against
the
pressure
of
her
husband
's
steady
domination
find
effective
expression
in
the
inspiring
training
of
her
son
to
be
the
champion
of
woman
.
it
would
be
a
sublime
proof
of
the
justice
of
all
the
poetry
of
live
so
she
be
always
think
for
the
son
of
James
Redfern
to
devote
the
strength
of
the
father
that
be
soon
to
be
in
the
son
of
he
to
the
winning
of
liberty
,
equality
,
opportunity
,
beauty
,
feeling
,
for
all
woman
.




James
Redfern
be
a
man
determine
to
be
master
always
in
his
house
.
he
be
a
man
courteous
and
deferential
to
all
woman
,
he
never
come
into
any
vivid
relation
with
any
human
being
.
he
be
cold
and
reserved
and
have
a
strong
calm
attacking
will
in
he
,
and
he
be
always
perfectly
right
in
do
everything
.
this
be
always
true
of
he
.
he
never
know
it
in
he
that
his
wife
have
a
set
purpose
in
she
to
make
their
son
any
particular
thing
in
living
.
such
a
thing
could
never
be
a
real
thing
to
he
,
such
a
thing
no
woman
he
could
have
live
in
the
house
with
he
could
have
in
she
,
to
he
.
it
could
have
no
meaning
such
a
fantastic
notion
and
then
too
she
never
say
it
to
he
.
it
would
not
have
any
meaning
except
as
word
if
she
have
ever
say
it
to
he
.
the
thing
that
have
no
meaning
as
exist
be
to
every
one
very
many
,
and
that
be
always
more
and
more
important
in
understand
the
being
in
man
and
woman
.
often
it
be
very
astonishing
,
it
be
like
see
something
and
some
one
who
always
have
be
walk
with
you
and
you
always
have
be
feel
that
one
be
see
everything
with
you
and
you
feel
then
that
they
be
see
that
thing
the
way
you
be
see
it
then
and
you
go
sometime
with
that
one
to
a
doctor
to
have
that
one
have
their
eye
examine
and
then
you
find
that
thing
you
be
see
they
can
not
see
and
never
have
be
see
and
it
be
very
astonishing
and
everything
be
different
and
you
know
then
that
you
be
see
,
you
be
write
completely
only
for
one
and
that
be
yourself
then
and
to
every
other
one
it
be
a
different
thing
and
then
you
remember
every
one
have
say
that
sometime
and
you
know
it
then
and
it
be
astonishing
.
you
know
it
then
yes
but
you
do
not
really
know
it
as
a
continuous
knowing
in
you
for
then
in
live
always
you
be
feel
that
some
one
else
be
understanding
,
feel
see
something
the
way
you
be
feel
,
see
,
understand
that
thing
,
and
always
it
be
a
shock
to
you
sometime
with
every
one
you
be
ever
know
and
many
never
really
know
it
of
any
one
that
they
be
feel
,
see
,
understand
a
different
way
from
they
and
this
be
very
very
common
.
as
I
be
say
it
never
would
come
to
Mr.
James
Redfern
to
be
realise
that
Mrs.
Redfern
have
a
destiny
for
their
son
such
as
be
a
champion
of
woman
.
such
a
thing
would
be
a
fantastic
dream
that
could
come
from
sickness
in
some
one
and
nothing
more
to
he
and
as
I
be
say
she
never
say
it
to
he
.
Mr.
Redfern
be
very
willing
that
Mrs.
Redfern
should
be
the
tender
dear
friend
of
their
son
,
he
be
too
simply
certain
of
the
being
in
himself
and
in
his
son
to
pay
much
attention
to
the
emotional
influence
that
Mrs.
Redfern
bring
to
bear
on
he
then
when
he
be
a
young
one
.
he
be
simply
certain
,
that
be
the
being
in
he
,
that
his
son
would
be
a
rational
man
.
emotional
woman
and
romantic
child
have
pleasant
fantastic
dream
that
be
alright
for
they
.
he
demand
from
his
son
then
obedience
and
in
his
presence
selfrestraint
and
for
the
rest
when
Phillip
be
a
man
be
his
father
's
son
would
make
he
the
man
all
the
Redferns
have
be
.




Phillip
Redfern
when
he
be
a
man
be
to
most
every
one
who
ever
come
to
know
he
a
person
have
in
he
a
strange
and
incalculable
nature
.
the
strong
enthusiasm
of
emotion
of
his
mother
's
nature
early
awake
in
he
with
the
stimulation
she
be
always
then
give
to
he
very
much
interest
to
he
for
the
emotional
life
he
could
have
in
he
.
the
interest
for
knowledge
and
domination
be
in
he
equally
strong
and
from
the
beginning
he
devote
himself
to
meditation
and
analysis
of
the
emotion
he
have
in
he
.
the
constant
spectacle
of
an
armed
neutrality
between
his
parent
early
fill
he
with
an
interest
in
the
nature
of
marriage
and
the
meaning
of
woman
.




many
child
who
be
always
in
the
society
of
old
man
and
woman
have
their
elder
's
feeling
in
they
and
these
old
man
and
woman
in
their
talking
and
their
feeling
if
they
have
very
decide
quality
in
they
to
give
to
they
the
child
always
with
they
a
knowledge
of
life
quite
out
of
relation
to
the
reality
of
the
child
's
experiencing
and
sometimes
such
a
one
one
of
such
child
while
know
and
accept
many
fact
that
his
elder
would
have
listen
to
in
astonished
horror
from
he
often
will
be
really
ignorant
of
the
meaning
of
the
simple
thing
that
happen
to
every
one
live
which
other
child
have
in
they
as
natural
thing
for
they
to
be
know
then
.
Phillip
Redfern
then
have
in
he
then
when
he
be
a
young
one
and
be
live
with
his
mother
and
his
father
as
the
only
people
then
for
he
in
he
,
his
own
living
where
there
be
much
knowledge
from
reading
and
thinking
,
wonderful
dream
,
keen
analysis
,
much
real
emotion
of
sympathising
and
very
little
experiencing
of
begin
live
.




from
his
father
then
and
from
his
mother
too
then
,
then
when
he
be
a
little
one
Phillip
Redfern
learn
careful
and
scrupulous
courtesy
to
woman
and
to
himself
and
to
every
one
he
be
ever
see
or
feeling
or
meeting
in
book
or
in
live
or
in
his
hearing
talk
or
in
his
dreaming
,
and
from
his
father
then
power
of
reserve
and
these
be
in
he
without
the
determined
standard
that
govern
the
eld
Redfern
.
Phillip
learn
his
principle
from
his
mother
and
these
be
in
her
longing
and
aspiration
rather
than
reason
settle
purpose
and
experience
and
they
be
real
in
he
though
really
then
he
do
not
believe
in
they
though
then
and
long
he
live
by
they
.




when
Phillip
be
begin
to
be
a
young
man
he
go
to
college
as
I
be
say
in
my
describe
the
living
of
Martha
Hersland
.
he
have
never
be
to
a
school
,
his
learning
have
be
gather
from
his
father
and
largely
by
himself
in
reading
.
now
for
the
first
time
in
his
living
he
with
his
brilliant
personality
for
he
have
that
then
to
himself
and
to
every
one
,
keen
intellect
,
ardent
desire
,
moral
aspiration
and
principle
that
he
know
he
could
know
by
analyse
they
be
not
well
reason
principle
for
he
to
have
in
he
but
be
to
he
as
his
mother
's
being
be
in
he
as
a
dear
dear
friend
inside
he
,
be
to
be
throw
into
familiar
relation
with
young
man
and
woman
.
the
college
of
which
Redfern
become
a
member
be
the
typical
coeducational
college
of
the
west
,
a
completely
democratic
institution
.
mostly
no
one
there
be
conscious
of
a
grand
-
father
unless
as
remember
one
as
an
old
man
live
in
the
house
with
they
or
as
live
in
another
place
and
be
write
to
sometimes
by
they
and
then
having
die
and
that
be
the
end
of
grand
-
father
to
they
.
no
one
among
they
be
hold
responsible
for
the
father
they
have
unless
by
some
particular
notoriety
that
have
come
to
the
father
of
some
one
.
it
be
then
a
democratic
western
institution
,
this
college
where
Redfern
go
to
have
his
college
education
.
this
democracy
be
too
simple
and
genuine
to
be
discuss
by
any
one
then
.
no
one
be
really
interested
how
any
man
or
woman
of
they
come
by
the
money
that
be
educate
they
,
whether
it
come
through
several
generation
of
gentleman
to
they
,
whether
it
come
through
two
generation
or
one
,
whether
one
of
they
earn
it
for
herself
or
for
himself
by
work
,
or
teaching
,
or
work
on
a
farm
or
at
book
-
selling
or
at
anything
else
that
would
bring
money
to
they
in
the
summer
or
whether
they
earn
a
little
by
be
a
janitor
to
a
school
building
in
the
winter
or
have
it
give
they
by
some
one
interested
in
they
.
this
democracy
be
then
almost
complete
among
they
and
be
the
same
between
the
man
and
woman
as
between
the
man
,
as
between
the
woman
.
this
democracy
be
really
almost
complete
among
all
of
they
and
include
very
simple
comradeship
among
they
all
,
all
of
the
man
and
woman
there
together
then
.
the
man
mostly
be
simple
,
direct
and
earnest
in
their
relation
with
the
woman
there
be
educate
with
they
,
the
man
,
most
of
they
treat
they
with
generosity
and
kindliness
enough
and
never
really
doubt
even
for
a
moment
their
right
to
any
learning
or
occupation
the
woman
,
any
of
they
be
able
to
acquire
then
.
the
student
be
many
of
they
earnest
experienced
man
and
woman
who
have
already
struggle
solidly
with
poverty
and
education
.
many
of
they
be
interested
in
the
science
and
the
practical
application
of
they
but
also
there
be
among
they
a
kind
of
feeling
and
yearning
for
beauty
and
this
then
often
show
itself
in
they
in
much
out
of
door
wandering
,
and
be
begin
a
little
with
some
of
they
to
realise
itself
in
attempt
make
picture
and
sculpture
.
it
be
of
such
a
sober
minded
,
earnest
,
moral
,
democratic
community
that
Redfern
be
now
become
a
part
.
his
moral
aspiration
find
full
satisfaction
in
the
serious
life
of
the
place
and
his
interest
in
emotional
enthusiasm
find
a
new
and
delightful
exercise
in
the
problem
of
woman
that
present
itself
so
strangely
here
.
at
this
time
the
return
to
honest
nature
to
he
,
be
complete
delight
in
he
for
elaboration
be
then
not
so
necessary
in
his
conviction
but
that
vigor
and
force
unadorned
then
make
he
forgetful
of
subtlety
and
refinement
.
the
free
simple
comradeship
of
the
man
and
woman
at
first
fill
he
with
astonishment
and
then
with
delight
.
he
could
not
feel
himself
a
part
of
it
,
he
could
not
love
the
sense
of
danger
in
the
presence
and
companionship
of
woman
,
his
instinct
bid
he
be
on
guard
but
his
ideal
he
feel
to
be
here
realise
.




among
the
many
vigorous
young
woman
in
the
place
there
be
Martha
Hersland
.
she
be
a
blond
good
-
look
young
woman
full
of
moral
purpose
and
educational
desire
.
she
have
an
eager
earnest
intelligence
,
fix
conviction
and
principle
by
then
,
and
restless
energy
.
she
and
Redfern
be
student
in
the
same
study
in
the
same
class
and
soon
single
themselves
out
from
the
crowd
,
it
be
all
new
,
strange
and
dangerous
for
the
south
-
western
man
and
all
perfectly
simple
and
matter
of
course
for
the
western
girl
.
they
have
long
talk
on
the
meaning
of
thing
,
he
discourse
of
his
life
and
aim
,
she
listen
,
understanding
and
sympathising
.
this
intercourse
steadily
grow
more
constant
and
familiar
.
Redfern
's
instinct
be
dangerous
be
always
there
as
a
conviction
in
he
,
his
ideal
simple
and
pure
be
almost
always
real
inside
he
,
slowly
he
realise
in
this
constant
companion
the
existence
of
instinct
as
simple
and
pure
as
his
ideal
.




they
be
go
through
the
country
one
wintry
day
,
plunge
vigorously
through
the
snow
and
like
the
cold
air
and
rapid
walking
and
excite
with
their
own
health
and
their
youth
and
the
freedom
.
"
you
be
a
comrade
and
a
woman
,
"
he
cry
out
in
his
pleasure
,
"
it
be
the
new
world
.
"




"
surely
,
there
be
no
difference
our
be
together
only
it
be
pleasanter
and
we
go
fast
,
"
be
her
eager
answer
.




"
I
know
it
,
"
say
Redfern
,
"
I
know
it
,
it
be
the
new
world
.
"




this
comradeship
continue
through
the
three
year
.
they
spend
much
time
in
explain
to
each
other
what
neither
quite
understand
.
he
never
quite
feel
the
reality
of
her
simple
conviction
,
she
never
quite
realise
what
it
be
he
do
not
understand
.




one
spring
day
a
boy
friend
come
to
see
she
a
young
brother
of
John
Davidson
who
use
to
play
duet
with
she
and
all
three
go
out
in
the
country
.
it
be
a
soft
warm
day
,
the
ground
be
warm
and
wet
and
they
be
healthy
and
they
do
not
mind
that
.
they
find
a
fairly
dry
hill
-
side
and
sit
down
all
three
too
indolent
to
wander
far
.
the
young
fellow
,
a
boy
of
eighteen
,
throw
himself
on
the
ground
and
rest
his
head
on
Martha
Hersland
's
lap
.
Redfern
do
not
stop
a
start
of
surprise
and
Martha
Hersland
smile
.
the
next
day
Redfern
frankly
come
to
she
with
his
perplexity
.




"
I
do
n't
understand
,
"
he
say
.
"
be
it
alright
for
Davidson
to
do
so
yesterday
.
I
almost
believe
it
be
my
duty
to
knock
he
off
.
"




"
yes
I
see
you
be
surprised
,
"
she
say
and
she
look
uneasy
and
then
she
resolutely
try
to
make
he
see
.
"
do
you
know
that
to
I
a
western
woman
it
seem
very
strange
that
any
one
should
see
any
wrong
in
his
action
.
yes
I
will
say
it
,
I
have
never
understand
before
why
you
always
seem
on
guard
.
"




she
end
pretty
steadily
,
he
flush
and
look
uneasy
.
he
look
at
she
earnestly
,
whatever
be
there
,
he
certainly
could
not
doubt
her
honesty
.
it
could
not
be
a
new
form
of
deliberate
enticement
even
though
it
make
a
new
danger
.




after
two
year
of
marriage
Redfern
's
realisation
of
she
be
almost
complete
.
Martha
be
all
that
she
have
promise
he
to
be
,
all
that
he
have
think
she
,
but
that
all
prove
sufficiently
inadequate
to
his
need
.
she
be
moral
,
strenuous
and
pure
and
seek
earnestly
after
high
thing
in
life
and
art
but
her
mind
be
narrow
and
in
its
way
insistent
,
her
intelligence
quick
but
without
grace
and
harsh
and
Redfern
love
a
gentle
intelligence
.
Redfern
be
a
hard
man
to
hold
,
he
have
no
tender
fibre
to
make
he
gentle
to
discordant
suffering
and
when
once
he
be
certain
that
this
woman
have
no
message
for
he
there
be
no
way
in
which
she
could
make
to
he
an
appeal
.
her
narrow
eager
mind
be
helpless
.




it
be
part
of
his
elaborate
chivalry
and
she
though
harsh
and
crude
should
never
cease
to
receive
from
he
this
respect
.
he
know
she
must
suffer
but
what
could
he
do
.
they
be
man
and
wife
,
their
mind
and
nature
be
separate
by
great
gulfs
,
it
must
be
again
an
armed
neutrality
but
this
time
it
be
not
as
with
his
parent
an
armed
neutrality
between
equal
but
with
an
inferior
who
could
not
learn
the
rule
of
the
game
.
it
be
just
so
much
the
more
unhappy
.




Mrs.
Redfern
never
understand
what
have
happen
to
she
.
in
a
daze
blind
way
she
try
all
way
of
break
through
the
wall
that
confine
she
.
she
throw
herself
against
they
with
impatient
energy
and
again
she
try
to
destroy
they
piece
by
piece
.
she
be
always
throw
back
bruise
and
daze
and
never
quite
certain
whence
come
the
blow
,
how
it
be
deal
or
why
.
it
be
a
long
agony
,
she
never
become
wise
or
more
indifferent
,
she
struggle
on
always
in
the
same
daze
eager
way
.
such
be
the
relation
between
Redfern
and
his
wife
when
Redfern
having
make
some
reputation
for
himself
in
philosophy
be
call
to
Farnham
college
to

of

there
.
there
be
then
a
dean
presiding
over
the
college
of
Farnham
who
in
common
with
many
of
her
generation
believe
wholly
in
the
essential
sameness
of
sex
and
who
have
devote
her
life
to
the
development
of
this
doctrine
.
the
Dean
of
Farnham
have
have
great
influence
in
the
life
of
many
woman
.
she
be
possess
of
a
strong
purpose
and
vast
energy
.
she
have
an
extraordinary
instinct
for
the
quality
of
man
and
rarely
fail
to
choose
the
good
of
the
young
teacher
as
they
come
from
the
university
.
she
rarely
keep
they
many
year
for
either
they
attain
such
distinction
that
the
great
university
claim
they
or
they
be
dismiss
as
not
be
able
enough
to
be
call
away
.
Phillip
Redfern

's
degree
in
philosophy
,
have
marry
and
presently
then

college
.
two
very
interesting
personality
in
the
place
be
the
dean
Miss
Charles
and
her
friend
Miss
Dounor
.




Redfern
have
previously
have
no
experience
of
woman
's
college
,
he
know
some
thing
of
the
character
of
the
dean
but
have
hear
nothing
of
any
other
member
of
the
institution
and
go
to
make
his
bow
to
his
fellow
instructor
in
some
wonder
of
anticipation
and
excitement
of
mind
.
the
new
professor
of
philosophy
be
invite
by
the
dean
to

the
assemble
faculty

be

.
she
be
a
dignified
figure
with
a
noble
head
and
a
preoccupied
abrupt
manner
.
she
be
a
member
of
a
family
which
be
proud
of
having
have
in
three
successive
generation
three
remarkable
woman
.




the
first
of
these
three
be
not
know
beyond
her
own
community
among
whom
she
have
great
influence
by
reason
of
her
strength
of
will
,
her
powerful
intellect
,
her
strong
common
sense
and
her
deep
religious
feeling
.
she
carry
to
its
utmost
the
then
woman
's
life
with
its
keen
worldly
sense
,
its
power
of
emotion
and
prayer
and
its
devout
practical
morality
.




the
daughter
of
this
vigorous
woman
be
know
to
a
wide
circle
and
seek
for
truth
in
all
variety
of
ecstatic
experience
.
she
mingle
with
her
genuine
mystic
exaltation
a
basal
common
sense
and
though
spend
the
great
part
of
her
life
in
examine
and
actively
take
part
in
all
the
exaggerated
religious
enthusiasm
of
her
time
she
never
lose
her
sense
of
criticism
and
judgement
and
though
convince
again
and
again
of
the
folly
and
hypocrisy
of
successive
saint
never
doubt
the
validity
of
mystic
religious
experience
.




in
the
third
generation
the
niece
of
this
woman
,
the
dean
Hannah
Charles
,
find
her
expression
in
still
wide
experience
.
she
do
not
expect
her
regeneration
from
religious
experience
and
find
her
exaltation
in
resist
.




through
her
influence
she
be
enable
to
keep
the
college
in
a
flourish
state
and
to
keep
the
control
of
all
thing
entirely
in
her
own
hand
but
she
be
anxious
that
in
the
teaching
staff
there
should
be
some
one
who
would
be
permanent
,
who
would
have
great
part
and
a
scholarly
mind
and
would
have
no
influence
to
trouble
hers
and
before
many
year
she
find
Miss
Dounor
who
ideally
fulfil
these
condition
.




Miss
Douner
be
a
graduate
of
an
eastern
college
and
have
make
some
reputation
.
she
be
utterly
unattached
,
be
an
only
child
whose
parent
die
just
before
she
enter
college
and
be
equally
detach
by
her
nature
from
all
affair
of
the
world
and
be
always
quite
content
to
remain
where
she
be
so
long
as
some
take
from
she
all
management
of
practical
affair
and
leave
she
in
peace
with
her
work
and
her
dream
.
she
be
possess
of
a
sort
of
transfigured
innocence
which
make
a
deep
impression
on
the
vigorous
practical
mind
of
Miss
Charles
who
while
keep
she
completely
under
her
control
be
nevertheless
in
awe
of
her
blindness
of
worldly
thing
and
of
the
intellectual
power
of
her
clear
sensitive
mind
.




though
Miss
Dounor
be
detach
by
the
quality
of
her
nature
from
worldly
affair
it
be
not
because
she
love
good
dream
and
abstract
think
,
for
her
deep
interest
be
in
the
variety
of
human
experience
and
her
constant
desire
be
to
partake
of
all
human
relation
but
by
some
quality
of
her
nature
she
never
succeed
in
really
touch
any
human
creature
she
know
.
her
transfigured
innocence
,
too
,
be
not
an
ignorance
of
the
fact
of
life
nor
a
puritan
's
instinct
indeed
her
desire
be
to
experience
the
extreme
form
of
sensuous
life
and
to
make
even
immoral
experience
her
own
.
her
detachment
be
due
to
an
abstract
spirit
that
could
not
do
what
it
would
and
which
be
evident
in
her
reserved
body
,
her
shy
eye
and
gentle
face
.




as
I
be
say
Phillip
Redfern
have
be
invite
by
the
dean
to
meet

"
you
must
meet
Miss
Dounor

"
she
say
to
he
break
abruptly
through
the
politeness
of
the
new
instructor
who
be
as
I
say
south
-
western
.




Redfern
look
with
interest
at
this
new
presentment
of
gentleness
and
intelligence
who
greet
he
with
awkward
shyness
.
her
talk
be
serious
pleasant
and
intense
,
her
point
of
view
clear
,
her
argument
just
,
and
her
opinion
sensitive
.
her
self
-
consciousness
disappear
during
this
eager
discussion
but
her
manner
do
not
lose
its
awkward
restraint
,
her
voice
its
gentleness
or
her
eye
their
shyness
.




while
the
two
be
still
in
the
height
of
the
discussion
there
come
up
to
they
a
blond
,

,
goodlooke
young
woman

Redfern
observe

Miss
Dounor
check
in
her
talk
be
throw
into
even
more
than
her
original
shy
awkwardness
and
look
with
distress
at
this
new
arrival
after
several
effort
to
bring
her
mind
to
understand
say
;
"

think
,
"
say
Mrs.
Redfern
nervously
and
Redfern
bow
to
his
wife
turn
again
to
Miss
Dounor
and
go
on
with
the
talk
.
an
observer
would
have
find
it
difficult
to
tell
from
the
mere
appearance
of
these
three
what
their
relation
toward
each
other
be
.
Miss
Dounor
be
absorb
in
her
talk
and
thought
and
oblivious
of
everything
except
the
discussion
,
her
shy
eye
fix
on
Redfern
's
face
and
her
tall
constrained
body
fill
with
eagerness
,
Redfern
be
listen
and
answer
show
the
same
degree
of
courteous
deference
to
both
his
companion
,
turn
first
toward
one
and
then
toward
the
other
one
with
impartial
attention
and
Mrs.
Redfern
her
blond
good
-
look
face
fill
with
eager
anxiety
to
understand
listen
to
one
and
then
the
other
with
the
same
anxious
care
.




later
Redfern
wander
to
a
window
where
Miss
Hannah
Charles
,
Miss
Dounor
and
Mrs.
Redfern
be
stand
look
out
at
a
fine
prospect
of
sunset
and
a
long
line
of
elm
define
a
road
that
lead
back
through
the
town
of
Farnham
to
the
woode
hill
behind
.
Redfern
stand
with
they
look
out
at
the
scene
.
Mrs.
Redfern
be
listen
intently
to
each
one
's
thinking
.
"
ah
of
course
you
know
Greek
,
"
she
say
with
eager
admiration
to
Miss
Dounor
who
make
no
reply
.




it
happen
often
about
the
twenty
-
ninth
year
of
a
life
that
all
the
force
that
have
be
engage
through
the
year
of
childhood
,
adolescence
and
youth
in
confused
and
sometimes
angry
combat
range
themselves
in
order
rank
,
one
be
uncertain
of
one
's
aim
,
meaning
and
power
during
these
year
of
tumultuous
growth
when
aspiration
have
no
relation
to
fulfillment
and
one
plunge
here
and
there
with
energy
and
misdirection
during
the
strain
and
stress
of
the
making
of
a
personality
until
at
last
we
reach
the
twenty
-
ninth
year
,
the
straight
and
narrow
gateway
of
maturity
and
life
which
be
all
uproar
and
confusion
narrow
down
to
form
and
purpose
and
we
exchange
a
dim
possibility
for
a
big
or
small
reality
.




also
in
our
american
life
where
there
be
no
coercion
in
custom
and
it
be
our
right
to
change
our
vocation
as
often
as
we
have
desire
and
opportunity
,
it
be
a
common
experience
that
our
youth
extend
through
the
whole
first
twenty
-
nine
year
of
our
life
and
it
be
not
till
we
reach
thirty
that
we
find
at
last
that
vocation
for
which
we
feel
ourselves
fit
and
to
which
we
willingly
devote
continued
labor
.
it
must
be
own
that
while
much
labor
be
lose
to
the
world
in
these
effort
to
secure
one
's
true
vocation
,
nevertheless
it
make
more
completeness
in
individual
life
and
perhaps
in
the
end
will
prove
as
useful
to
the
world
,
and
if
we
believe
that
there
be
more
meaning
in
the
choice
of
love
than
plain
propinquity
so
we
may
well
believe
that
there
be
more
meaning
in
vocation
than
that
it
be
the
thing
we
can
first
learn
about
and
win
an
income
with
.




Redfern
have
now
come
to
this
fateful
twenty
-
ninth
year
.
he
have
be
a
public
preacher
for
woman
's
right
,
he
have
be
a
mathematician
,
a
psychologist
and
a
philosopher
,
he
have
marry
and
earn
a
living
and
yet
the
world
be
to
he
without
worth
or
meaning
and
he
long
for
a
more
vital
human
life
than
to
be
an
instructor
of
youth
,
his
theme
be
humanity
,
his
desire
be
to
be
in
the
great
world
and
of
it
,
he
wish
for
active
life
among
his
equal
not
to
pass
his
day
as
a
guide
to
the
immature
and
he
prefer
the
criticism
of
life
in
fiction
to
the
analysis
of
the
mind
in
philosophy
and
now
the
time
be
come
in
this
his
twenty
-
ninth
year
for
the
decisive
influence
in
his
career
.
Cora
Dounor
have
on
her
side
too
her
ideal
which
in
this
world
she
have
not
find
complete
.
she
too
long
for
the
real
world
while
wrap
away
from
it
by
the
perverse
reserve
of
her
mind
and
the
awkward
shyness
of
her
body
.
such
friendship
as
she
have
yet
realise
she
feel
for
the
dean
Miss
Hannah
Charles
but
it
be
not
a
nearness
of
affection
,
it
be
a
recognition
of
the
power
of
do
and
work
,
and
a
deference
to
the
representative
of
effective
action
and
the
habitual
dependence
of
year
of
protection
.
what
ever
Miss
Charles
advise
or
undertake
seem
always
to
Miss
Dounor
the
good
that
could
be
do
or
affect
.
she
sustain
her
end
of
the
relation
in
be
a
learn
mind
,
a
brilliant
teacher
and
a
docile
subject
.
she
pursue
her
way
expound
philosophy
,
imbibe
beauty
,
desire
life
,
never
question
the
thing
nearest
she
,
interested
only
in
abstract
idea
and
concrete
desire
and
all
her
life
be
arrange
to
leave
she
untouched
and
unattached
but
in
this
shy
abstracted
,
learn
creature
there
be
a
desire
for
sordid
life
and
the
common
lot
.




it
be
interesting
to
see
the
slow
growth
of
interest
to
admiration
and
then
to
love
in
this
awkward
reserve
woman
,
unconscious
of
her
meaning
and
the
world
's
attention
and
who
make
no
attempt
to
disguise
or
conceal
the
strength
of
her
feeling
.




Redfern
's
life
experience
have
be
to
learn
that
where
there
be
woman
there
be
for
he
danger
not
through
his
own
affection
but
by
the
demand
that
this
sex
make
upon
he
.
by
this
extreme
chivalry
he
be
always
bind
to
more
than
fulfill
the
expectation
he
give
rise
to
in
the
mind
of
his
companion
.
indeed
this
man
love
the
problem
of
woman
so
much
that
he
willingly
endure
all
pain
to
seek
and
find
the
ideal
that
fill
he
with
such
deep
unrest
and
he
never
tired
of
meet
and
know
and
devote
himself
to
any
woman
who
promise
to
fulfill
for
he
his
desire
and
here
in
Cora
Dounor
he
have
find
a
spirit
so
delicate
so
free
so
gentle
and
intelligent
that
no
severity
of
suffering
could
deter
he
from
seek
the
exquisite
knowledge
that
this
companionship
could
give
he
.
and
he
know
that
she
too
would
willingly
pay
high
for
the
fresh
vision
that
he
bring
she
.
it
be
the
french
habit
in
think
to
consider
that
in
the
grouping
of
two
and
an
extra
it
be
the
two
that
get
something
from
it
all
who
be
of
importance
and
whose
claim
should
be
consider
;
the
american
mind
accustomed
to
waste
happiness
and
be
reckless
of
joy
find
morality
more
important
than
ecstasy
and
the
lonely
extra
of
more
value
than
the
happy
two
.
to
our
new
world
feel
the
sadness
of
pain
have
more
dignity
than
the
beauty
of
joy
.
it
take
time
to
learn
the
value
of
happiness
.
truly
a
single
moment
snatch
out
of
a
distracted
existence
be
hardly
worth
the
trouble
it
take
to
seize
it
and
to
obtain
such
it
be
wasteful
to
inflict
pain
,
it
be
only
the
cultivator
of
leisure
who
have
time
to
feel
the
gentle
approach
the
slow
rise
,
the
deep
ecstasy
and
the
full
flow
of
joy
and
for
these
pain
be
of
little
value
,
a
thing
not
to
be
remember
,
and
it
be
only
the
lack
of
joy
that
count
.
Martha
Redfern
eager
,
anxious
and
moral
have
little
understanding
of
the
sanctity
of
joy
and
hardly
a
realisation
of
the
misery
of
pain
.
she
understand
little
now
what
it
be
that
have
come
upon
she
and
she
try
to
arrange
and
explain
it
by
her
western
morality
and
her
new
world
humanity
.
she
could
not
escape
the
knowledge
that
something
strong
than
community
of
interest
bind
her
husband
and
Miss
Dounor
together
.
she
try
resolutely
to
interpret
it
all
in
term
of
comradeship
and
great
equality
of
intellectual
interest
never
admit
to
herself
for
a
moment
the
conception
of
a
possible
marital
disloyalty
.
but
in
spite
of
these
standard
and
conviction
she
be
fill
with
a
vague
uneasiness
that
have
a
different
meaning
than
the
habitual
struggle
against
the
hard
wall
of
courtesy
that
Redfern
have
erect
before
she
.




this
struggle
in
her
mind
show
itself
clearly
when
she
be
in
the
company
of
her
husband
and
Miss
Dounor
.
she
would
sit
conscientiously
bend
her
mind
to
her
self
-
impose
task
of
understanding
and
development
,
when
in
the
immediate
circle
of
talker
that
include
her
husband
and
Miss
Dounor
she
give
anxious
and
impartial
attention
to
the
word
of
one
and
the
other
occasionally
join
in
the
talk
by
an
earnest
inquiry
and
receive
always
from
Redfern
the
courteous
deference
that
he
extend
to
every
one
,
to
everything
,
to
all
woman
.
she
listen
with
admire
attention
particularly
to
Miss
Dounor
who
genuinely
unconscious
of
all
this
nervous
misery
pay
she
in
return
scant
attention
.
when
she
be
not
in
the
immediate
group
of
talker
with
these
two
she
keep
her
attention
on
the
person
with
whom
she
be
talk
and
show
the
burden
of
her
feel
only
in
the
anxious
care
with
which
she
listen
and
talk
.




she
be
not
to
be
leave
much
long
to
work
out
her
own
conclusion
.
one
afternoon
in
the
late
fall
in
the
second
year
of
their
life
at
Farnham
,
Miss
Charles
come
to
the
room
where
she
be
sit
alone
and
in
her
abrupt
way
speak
directly
of
the
object
of
her
visit
.
"
Mrs.
Redfern
,
"
she
begin
"
you
probably
know
something
of
the
gossip
that
be
at
present
go
on
,
I
want
you
to
keep
Mr.
Redfern
in
order
,
I
can
not
allow
he
to
make
Miss
Dounor
the
subject
of
scandalous
talk
.
"
she
stop
and
look
steadily
at
the
uneasy
woman
who
be
daze
by
this
sudden
statement
of
her
own
suspicion
,
"
I
,
I
do
n't
understand
,
"
she
stammer
.
"
I
think
you
understand
quite
well
.
I
depend
upon
you
to
speak
to
he
about
it
,
"
and
with
this
the
dean
depart
.




this
action
on
Miss
Charles
part
show
her
wisdom
.
she
know
very
well
the
small
power
that
Mrs.
Redfern
have
over
her
husband
and
she
take
this
method
of
attack
only
because
it
be
the
only
one
open
to
she
.
Mrs.
Redfern
could
not
accomplish
anything
by
any
action
but
she
be
a
woman
and
jealous
and
there
be
little
doubt
,
so
the
dean
think
,
that
before
long
she
would
effect
some
change
.
Martha
Redfern
's
mind
be
now
in
a
confusion
.
Miss
Charles
have
add
nothing
to
her
fact
nevertheless
her
statement
have
make
a
certainty
of
what
Mrs.
Redfern
have
resolutely
regard
as
an
impossibility
.
she
sit
there
long
and
long
thinking
over
again
and
again
the
same
weary
round
of
thought
and
terror
.
she
know
she
be
powerless
to
change
he
,
she
could
only
try
to
get
the
evidence
to
condemn
he
.
do
she
want
it
,
if
she
have
it
she
must
act
on
it
,
she
dread
to
obtain
it
and
could
not
long
exist
without
it
.
she
must
watch
he
and
find
it
all
out
without
questioning
,
must
learn
it
by
see
and
hearing
and
she
feel
dimly
a
terror
of
the
thing
she
might
be
catch
do
to
obtain
it
,
she
dread
the
condemnation
of
Redfern
's
chivalrous
honor
.
she
do
not
doubt
his
disloyalty
she
be
convince
of
that
and
she
still
fear
to
lose
his
respect
for
her
sense
of
honor
.
"
he
be
dishonorable
,
all
his
action
be
deceit
,
"
she
say
to
herself
again
and
again
but
she
find
no
comfort
in
this
thought
,
she
know
there
be
a
difference
and
that
she
respect
his
standard
more
than
her
own
justification
.




in
the
long
weary
day
that
follow
she
be
tear
by
these
desire
,
she
must
watch
he
always
and
secretly
,
she
must
gain
the
knowledge
she
dread
to
possess
and
she
must
be
deeply
ashamed
of
the
way
she
must
pursue
.
she
be
no
long
able
to
listen
to
other
when
her
husband
and
Miss
Dounor
be
in
her
presence
,
she
dare
not
keep
an
open
watch
but
her
observation
be
uncease
.
Redfern
be
not
wholly
unconscious
of
this
change
in
his
wife
's
manner
perhaps
more
in
the
relief
that
she
cease
her
eager
effort
to
please
he
than
in
the
annoyance
of
her
suspicious
watching
.
Redfern
be
a
man
too
much
on
guard
to
fear
surprise
and
with
all
his
experience
too
ignorant
of
woman
's
way
to
see
danger
where
danger
really
lie
.




it
be
the
end
of
May
and
one
late
afternoon
Mrs.
Redfern
fill
with
her
sad
past
and
sad
future
,
sit
in
her
room
watch
the
young
leave
shine
brilliantly
in
the
warm
sunshine
on
the
long
row
of
elm
that
stretch
away
through
the
village
toward
the
green
hill
that
rise
beyond
.
Mrs.
Redfern
know
very
well
the
feel
of
that
earth
warm
with
young
life
and
wet
with
spring
rain
,
know
it
as
part
of
her
dreary
life
that
seem
to
have
last
always
.
as
she
sit
there
in
sadness
,
the
restless
eagerness
of
her
blond
good
-
look
face
be
go
and
her
hand
lie
clasped
quietly
without
strain
,
time
and
sadness
have
become
strong
in
she
than
desire
.




Redfern
come
into
the
house
and
pass
into
his
own
study
.
he
remain
there
a
short
while
and
then
be
call
away
.
as
soon
as
he
be
out
of
sight
Mrs.
Redfern
arise
and
go
into
his
room
.
she
walk
up
to
his
desk
and
open
his
portfolio
see
a
letter
in
his
writing
.
she
scarcely
hesitate
so
eager
be
she
to
read
it
.
she
read
it
to
the
end
,
she
have
her
evidence
.




category
that
once
to
some
one
have
real
meaning
can
later
to
that
same
one
be
all
empty
.
it
be
queer
that
word
that
mean
something
in
our
thinking
and
our
feeling
can
later
come
to
have
in
they
in
we
not
at
all
any
meaning
.
this
be
happen
always
to
every
one
really
feel
meaning
in
word
they
be
say
.
this
be
happen
very
often
to
almost
every
one
have
any
realisation
in
they
in
their
feeling
,
in
their
thinking
,
in
their
imagining
of
the
word
they
be
always
use
.
this
be
common
then
to
many
have
in
they
any
real
realisation
of
the
meaning
of
the
word
they
be
use
.
as
I
be
say
category
that
once
to
some
one
have
real
meaning
come
later
to
that
same
one
not
to
have
any
meaning
at
all
then
for
that
one
.
sometimes
one
read
a
letter
that
they
have
be
keep
with
other
letter
,
and
one
be
not
very
old
then
and
so
it
be
not
that
they
be
old
then
and
forget
,
they
be
not
very
old
then
and
they
come
in
clean
something
to
read
this
letter
and
it
be
all
full
of
hot
feeling
and
the
one
,
read
the
letter
then
,
have
not
in
they
any
memory
of
the
person
who
once
write
that
letter
to
they
.
this
be
different
,
very
different
from
the
changing
of
the
feeling
and
the
thinking
in
many
who
have
in
they
real
realisation
of
the
meaning
of
word
when
they
be
use
they
but
there
be
in
each
case
so
complete
a
changing
of
experience
in
feeling
and
thinking
,
or
in
time
or
in
something
,
that
something
,
some
one
once
alive
to
some
one
be
then
completely
a
stranger
to
that
one
,
the
meaning
in
a
word
to
that
one
the
meaning
in
a
way
of
feeling
and
think
that
be
a
category
to
some
one
,
some
one
whom
some
one
be
know
,
these
then
come
to
be
all
lose
to
that
one
sometime
later
in
the
living
of
that
one
.




this
be
very
true
then
,
this
be
very
true
then
of
the
feeling
and
the
thinking
that
make
the
meaning
in
the
word
one
be
use
,
this
be
very
true
then
that
to
many
of
they
have
in
they
strongly
a
sense
of
realise
the
meaning
of
the
word
they
be
use
that
some
word
they
once
be
use
,
later
have
not
any
meaning
and
some
then
have
a
little
shame
in
they
when
they
be
copy
an
old
piece
of
writing
where
they
be
use
word
that
sometime
have
real
meaning
for
they
and
now
have
not
any
real
meaning
in
they
to
the
feeling
and
the
thinking
and
the
imagining
of
such
a
one
.
often
this
be
in
I
in
my
feeling
,
often
then
I
have
to
lose
word
I
have
once
be
use
,
now
I
commence
again
with
word
that
have
meaning
,
a
little
perhaps
I
have
forget
when
it
come
to
copy
the
meaning
in
some
of
the
word
I
have
just
be
write
.
now
to
begin
again
with
what
I
know
of
the
being
in
Phillip
Redfern
,
now
to
begin
again
a
description
of
Phillip
Redfern
and
always
now
I
will
be
use
word
have
in
my
feeling
,
think
,
imagine
very
real
meaning
.
as
I
be
say
Phillip
Redfern
be
to
very
many
who
know
he
a
queer
one
,
he
be
to
very
many
who
know
he
a
bad
one
,
he
be
to
some
who
know
he
so
good
a
one
that
he
be
almost
a
real
saint
for
they
.
this
be
true
of
he
then
and
now
I
will
begin
a
little
more
description
of
the
kind
of
be
in
he
,
of
the
kind
of
be
he
have
in
living
,
of
the
many
million
man
and
woman
always
be
like
he
.




he
be
of
the
kind
of
man
and
woman
who
,
in
the
end
,
to
every
one
,
have
be
as
if
they
have
be
a
failure
.
they
be
many
of
they
,
many
of
this
kind
of
they
,
many
of
the
kind
of
which
Redfern
be
one
,
that
have
have
very
much
reputation
,
have
be
well
known
for
their
living
,
for
the
being
in
they
,
in
their
live
very
many
of
this
kind
of
they
.
these
see
themselves
,
always
have
,
do
and
will
see
themselves
all
their
living
as
virtuous
,
as
heroic
,
as
noble
,
as
successful
,
as
beautiful
,
as
whatever
be
the
good
way
of
be
to
they
,
see
themselves
so
through
the
weakness
as
well
as
through
the
strong
thing
in
they
.
many
man
and
many
woman
see
themselves
as
virtuous
always
in
their
living
,
this
be
a
little
now
very
interesting
.




many
then
have
it
in
they
that
their
weakness
be
a
virtue
in
they
.
there
be
very
many
of
this
kind
of
they
then
.
Johnson
when
he
forget
his
emotion
,
the
emotion
he
have
when
he
be
friendly
or
love
or
fight
,
Johnson
when
he
forget
his
emotion
and
declare
it
to
have
be
all
the
other
one
be
do
attribute
his
having
yield
to
this
indulging
in
loving
,
fight
,
friendly
action
,
to
the
weakness
in
he
of
always
yield
.
this
weakness
of
his
be
uppermost
in
he
and
to
himself
,
having
forget
that
he
have
be
himself
want
the
thing
he
have
once
,
later
in
describe
,
feeling
of
think
the
action
over
he
say
it
be
because
he
have
the
weakness
of
never
be
able
to
resist
any
one
who
want
anything
.
perhaps
Johnson
begin
but
later
he
forget
his
having
be
want
the
thing
,
he
remember
only
that
always
he
do
anything
anybody
want
he
to
be
do
,
that
be
the
weakness
in
he
that
be
to
he
the
whole
principle
of
the
being
in
he
.
Frank
Hackart
attribute
his
do
anything
to
the
philanthropy
in
he
,
she
be
lonesome
and
throw
herself
on
he
,
take
possession
and
what
do
he
do
but
take
care
of
she
.
this
later
in
telling
,
in
remembering
,
in
feeling
be
always
the
history
of
any
woman
and
he
.
Mary
Helbing
always
put
it
down
to
,
that
they
want
it
and
she
give
it
but
she
have
no
responsibility
,
it
be
because
she
be
so
game
that
she
do
it
,
that
be
always
the
reason
she
do
it
,
she
be
so
game
she
never
refuse
anything
that
be
a
challenge
,
there
be
never
anything
that
she
be
ever
want
in
her
living
that
she
be
ever
get
.
Sarah
Sands
put
she
yield
down
to
unsuspiciousness
,
that
be
the
reason
she
yield
,
she
be
so
easy
,
that
be
the
secret
of
it
.
Phillip
Redfern
be
of
this
kind
of
they
,
he
be
to
himself
completely
chivalrous
,
completely
a
gentleman
,
woman
,
every
one
should
always
have
complete
courtesy
always
from
he
.
and
they
be
right
all
of
they
,
all
these
thing
,
each
thing
in
each
one
,
be
characteristic
in
each
one
but
they
all
think
that
one
characteristic
be
the
whole
of
they
,
they
all
of
they
forget
the
other
thing
in
they
that
be
active
in
they
,
they
all
have
it
in
common
that
in
remember
anything
they
forget
all
the
emotion
they
have
then
in
they
and
so
it
must
have
be
the
other
person
's
fault
it
happen
,
anything
.
all
of
they
in
remembering
have
not
have
any
emotion
except
the
one
and
so
they
have
none
then
and
so
it
must
have
be
the
other
person
.
this
be
a
little
now
very
interesting
.




as
I
be
say
Phillip
Redfern
be
of
this
kind
in
man
and
woman
.




there
will
be
now
more
description
of
virtuous
being
,
virtuous
feeling
in
man
and
woman
.
there
will
be
now
some
description
of
religious
feeling
in
some
man
and
woman
,
of
virtuous
and
religious
feeling
in
they
,
of
the
being
in
they
,
of
the
sensitiveness
in
they
,
of
the
worldly
feeling
in
they
,
of
succeed
and
fail
in
they
.
first
then
there
will
be
more

some

I
be

have
honor
in

and
religion
from
the
nature
of

when
this
be
strong
enough
in

can

can
do

all
of

all
of

making

some
can
just
resist
and
not
make
their
own
anything
,
there
be
many
of
they
.
some
out

some
be
control
by
other
people
's

,
and
then
it
scare
they
.
listen
to
each
one
tell
about
their
own
virtue
and
that
grow
to
make
a
god
for
they
,
grow
to
be
a
law
for
they

often
afterwards
scare
they
,
some
afterwards
like
it
,
some
forget
it
,
some
be
it
.
some
honor
what
be
right
to
they
for
they
to
be
do
.
some
separate
honor
from
the
doing
of
the
thing
,
have
it
as
a
feeling
.




some
love
themselves
enough
to
not
want
to
lose
themselves
,
immortality
can
to
they
mean
nothing

this
thing
.
some
love

negatively
,
then
impersonal
future
life
be

alright
,
a

that
be
all
there
be

they
do
not
have

man

many
of

there
be
perhaps
some
million
of
they
.
mostly
every
one
as
I
be
say
have
in
she
or
in
he
some
kind
of
feeling
of
be
of
virtue
in
live
.
some
from
the
thing
they
feel
as
weakness
in
they
,
some
from
the
thing
they
feel
as
strength
in
they
.
Phillip
Redfern
have
it
in
he
to
make
a
virtue
for
he
of
a
thing
he
feel
as
a
weakness
in
he
.
there
be
very
many
of
this
kind
of
they
,
many
,
very
many
man
,
many
woman
.




mostly
all
of
this
kind
of
man
and
woman
have
some
kind
of
religion
in
they
.
this
be
now
a
little
a
discussion
of
the
being
in
some
of
they
.




as
I
be
say
Phillip
Redfern
be
of
the
kind
of
man
and
woman
,
and
there
be
always
many
man
of
this
kind
of
they
and
some
woman
of
this
kind
of
they
,
who
have
in
their
live
a
good
deal
of
reputation
from
the
living
and
the
being
in
they
and
then
they
be
not
successful
in
live
successful
in
the
whole
of
their
living
and
to
many
know
they
they
be
romantic
in
their
living
,
or
beautiful
,
or
dramatic
in
their
living
and
to
some
,
saint
in
living
,
and
Redfern
be
such
a
one
and
to
most
every
one
he
be
a
man
always
fail
in
his
living
,
and
to
Miss
Dounor
he
be
a
saint
among
man
and
to
Mrs.
Redfern
he
be
wonderful
in
the
honorable
courtesy
in
he
and
mostly
every
one
sometime
think
he
be
a
bad
man
and
mostly
to
every
one
he
be
a
man
give
to
lie
.
he
say
once
of
some
one
,
"
Lathrop
tell
a
lie
as
if
it
be
the
truth
and
I
tell
the
truth
as
if
it
be
a
lie
.
"
he
be
to
himself
a
man
simple
,
sensuous
and
passionate
and
that
be
to
himself
the
whole
of
he
.
as
I
be
say
his
weakness
be
to
himself
the
strength
in
he
and
so
always
all
his
living
to
every
one
who
ever
come
to
know
,
except
to
some
to
whom
he
be
a
saint
in
suffering
,
to
every
one
mostly
he
be
fail
from
the
weakness
there
be
in
he
.
to
himself
as
I
be
say
he
be
a
simple
,
sensuous
,
passionate
be
from
whom
chivalry
demand
he
should
be
always
yield
when
he
himself
be
not
active
in
feeling
.
he
be
a
man
always
on
guard
,
with
every
one
always
able
to
pierce
he
.
that
be
the
living
he
have
in
he
.




for
the
rest
of
his
day
he
be
a
literary
man
and
sometimes
a
politician
.
he
plunge
deeply
into
the
political
life
of
his
time
and
fail
everywhere
,
in
this
life
as
in
all
of
his
human
relation
his
instinct
give
the
lie
to
his
ideal
and
his
ideal
to
his
instinct
.
it
be
interesting
to
many
to
witness
the
life
of
this
man
,
to
see
he
go
up
again
and
again
,
against
the
yield
spirit
in
he
,
go
up
with
unwearied
courage
only
to
meet
with
certain
defeat
.
he
be
himself
the
only
one
of
all
the
looker
on
who
dream
of
victory
.
the
other
whether
watch
with
indifference
,
with
deep
sympathy
or
stern
condemnation
,
with
malicious
or
righteous
triumph
know
that
he
would
fail
,
but
he
always
struggle
on
fill
to
the
very
end
with
hope
and
courage
,
always
defeat
and
always
ready
to
make
the
fresh
assault
.




as
I
be
say
there
be
a
Johnson
who
have
make
some
reputation
in
his
living
,
by
the
living
that
be
romantic
to
every
one
know
,
by
the
being
in
he
and
always
he
be
certain
in
tell
,
feeling
,
and
think
that
everything
that
have
happen
to
he
when
as
be
the
way
in
he
,
he
be
finish
with
that
thing
,
that
it
be
because
he
be
weak
and
open
to
any
suggesting
and
that
make
,
it
happen
that
he
be
in
a
relation
and
he
have
the
right
to
get
out
in
any
way
he
want
for
that
be
the
right
he
have
to
defend
himself
when
every
one
have
he
where
they
want
to
have
he
because
he
be
so
weak
to
every
one
's
suggest
.
he
would
brag
of
thing
he
have
do
when
he
be
fill
up
with
they
and
always
he
be
fill
up
with
they
and
he
would
know
he
have
a
right
to
run
away
or
do
anything
to
defend
himself
for
every
one
could
hold
he
by
suggest
to
he
by
the
sensitive
suggestibility
in
he
and
this
be
his
great
weakness
in
he
and
he
make
of
it
the
principle
of
his
living
to
himself
in
his
talking
,
think
,
feeling
,
and
he
be
of
the
kind
of
they
and
perhaps
Lord
Byron
and
Oscar
Wilde
be
of
this
kind
of
they
,
he
be
of
they
who
become
romantic
,
heroic
,
beautiful
,
saintly
by
the
weakness
in
they
that
be
there
always
act
,
that
be
true
of
they
,
but
always
these
be
do
thing
and
boasting
of
they
in
their
active
living
.
there
be
very
many
of
such
of
they
.
Redfern
be
such
a
one
.
a
Johnson
I
be
describe
be
such
a
one
.
some
have
only
this
a
little
in
they
enough
to
make
they
very
sentimental
in
their
living
,
some
have
it
a
little
more
in
they
than
those
have
it
just
as
sentimental
be
in
they
and
some
of
such
of
they
be
man
's
man
and
some
of
such
of
they
be
woman
's
man
.
and
Hackart
that
I
be
just
describe
be
one
of
such
of
they
.
some
have
it
just
a
little
more
in
they
than
the
sentimental
one
and
they
be
dramatic
in
their
living
and
there
be
very
many
woman
and
there
be
very
many
man
who
have
this
be
in
they
and
a
Sarah
Sands
be
such
a
one
as
I
be
just
say
.
there
be
some
who
have
this
way
of
be
only
in
spot
in
they
.
there
be
many
such
of
they
,
many
woman
and
many
man
of
such
of
they
.




as
I
be
say
such
a
one
as
the
Johnson
I
have
be
just
describe
,
when
he
forget
his
emotion
that
make
he
do
a
thing
,
always
declare
it
to
have
be
all
the
other
one
be
do
,
attribute
his
having
yield
to
his
own
weakness
of
be
very
susceptible
to
suggest
that
be
the
thing
in
he
uppermost
in
he
to
make
a
principle
continuous
in
he
of
live
.
this
be
all
different
from
selfrighteousness
which
be
a
way
of
be
that
everything
in
one
be
right
and
should
be
so
consider
by
every
one
,
self
-
righteousness
be
believe
that
the
one
act
be
so
right
that
if
every
one
act
like
they
everything
would
be
right
in
living
and
every
one
would
be
a
good
one
.
this
be
a
very
different
thing
from
the
feeling
that
I
be
describe
.
these
that
I
be
describe
make
a
principle
to
free
they
,
from
the
weakness
in
they
.
it
be
a
weakness
,
they
be
always
say
it
of
they
,
one
that
he
be
too
susceptible
to
suggest
,
another
that
when
a
woman
need
protect
of
course
he
must
give
she
that
because
she
be
a
weak
thing
and
he
be
always
weak
in
yield
protection
to
a
weak
woman
,
another
because
she
be
so
unobserving
that
she
have
no
realisation
of
what
anybody
be
do
though
maybe
it
be
her
vanity
that
keep
she
from
really
see
.
all
these
thing
be
true
as
characteristic
in
each
one
of
they
that
make
a
principle
of
they
,
these
thing
be
in
each
one
of
they
,
that
be
quite
true
of
they
but
they
all
think
that
characteristic
be
the
whole
of
they
and
so
they
have
not
to
themselves
the
responsibility
of
the
condition
.
some
be
noble
in
it
,
some
be
not
,
but
all
of
they
be
sure
of
it
,
for
that
be
the
principle
of
their
being
,
to
each
one
of
they
in
short
,
they
all
,
each
one
of
this
kind
of
they
forget
their
emotion
they
have
in
the
thing
they
be
do
,
and
so
to
themselves
after
,
it
must
have
be
the
other
person
's
fault
that
it
happen
,
this
thing
,
and
these
then
after
have
no
emotion
of
this
thing
,
unless
they
be
live
it
again
in
imagine
and
then
they
be
the
same
as
when
they
have
it
really
in
they
,
always
else
they
have
not
the
emotion
,
it
be
the
other
person
's
fault
the
thing
happen
between
they
,
these
have
no
emotion
that
they
be
remember
except
the
kind
of
weakness
they
know
always
to
be
in
they
each
one
and
so
they
have
no
emotion
then
,
they
know
that
well
in
they
,
and
so
it
must
have
be
their
weakness
and
the
other
person
's
willing
they
that
make
they
have
this
thing
in
they
.




as
I
be
say
Phillip
Redfern
be
such
a
one
.
as
I
be
say
all
this
be
very
interesting
in
the
meaning
of
virtue
and
religion
that
such
a
one
have
in
they
.
this
kind
of
be
can
be
in
they
have
independent
dependent
or
dependent
independent
being
in
they
,
have
any
kind
of
be
in
they
.
Johnson
when
he
forget
his
emotion
and
declare
it
to
have
be
all
the
other
one
be
do
,
attribute
his
having
yield
to
his
own
weakness
,
that
be
the
thing
in
he
to
he
uppermost
in
he
.
Frank
Hackart
attribute
his
to
philanthropy
,
she
be
lonesome
and
throw
herself
on
he
,
take
possession
,
and
what
do
he
do
but
take
care
of
she
.
Melanctha
put
it
down
to
that
they
want
it
and
she
give
it
but
she
have
no
responsibility
,
it
be
because
she
be
so
game
that
she
do
it
.
Sarah
Sands
put
she
yield
down
to
unsuspiciousness
,
that
be
the
reason
she
yield
,
she
be
so
easy
and
that
be
it
.
all
these
thing
be
true
as
characteristic
in
each
one
but
they
all
think
that
characteristic
be
the
whole
of
they
.
it
be
n't
.
they
all
forget
their
emotion
and
so
it
must
have
be
the
other
person
's
fault
it
happen
and
they
have
now
no
emotion
and
so
they
have
none
and
so
it
must
have
be
the
other
person
's
.




Phillip
Redfern
as
I
be
say
be
of
this
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
he
be
always
on
his
guard
and
always
a
woman
could
reach
he
inside
his
guard
and
he
must
do
then
what
it
be
right
for
a
man
always
on
guard
to
do
when
he
be
touch
inside
the
guard
.
he
must
give
they
their
revenge
and
always
again
they
would
touch
he
.
he
must
always
be
elaborately
on
guard
and
always
he
must
give
they
what
they
ask
of
he
when
they
touch
he
in
spite
of
his
guard
himself
from
they
.

little
of
the
way
some
come
to
have
their
certainty
in
they
.
some
build
certainty
up
with
little
and
little
sure
thing
and
make
a
pile
of
they
,
some
be
summary
and

embrace
in
the
certain
feeling
they
have
always
in

be
certain
of
almost
anything
,
some
be
hardly
certain
of
anything
,
some
have
to
have
a
complete
system
for
each
certain
feeling
in
they
,
some
have
a
sense
of
dramatic
arrangement
to
complete
the
scene
of
the
certain
conviction
,
the
certain
emotion
they
have
in
they
and
the
complete
scene
change
for
they
with
each
new
certainty
they
have
in
they
.
Certainty
worry
some
and
some
never
have
certainty
to
be
a
worry
to
they
.
some
have
certainty
by
comparison
,
by
compare
the
thing
they
have
then
with
what
any
other
one
they
be
know
be
have
,
some
never
compare
anything
with
any
one
,
certainty
be
a
real
thing
in
they
,
in
some
of
such
of
they
as
a
little
pile
they
be
gradually
increase
,
in
some
in
something
that
they
keep
there
inside
they
always
of
the
same
dimension
.
some
need
company
to
keep
their
certainty
from
freeze
or
melt

have
the
certainty
in
the

.
what
be
Phillip
Redfern
's
way
with
certainty
and
virtue
and
distinction
in
himself
to
himself
inside
he
.
he
be
to
himself
as
I
be
say
simple
,
sensuous
and
passionate
.
this
be
not
really
a
description
of
he
to
any
other
one
.
this
be
all
he
ever
say
to
any
one
of
the
being
in
he
.
this
be
the
feeling
he
have
in
he
of
the
being
he
have
in
he
.
he
never
say
it
any
differently
of
himself
to
any
one
.
he
be
to
himself
of
the
good
kind
in
man
and
woman
,
he
be
on
guard
because
woman
and
other
thing
be
dangerous
thing
,
he
always
feel
he
would
be
win
and
always
he
be
fail
and
this
be
always
happen
to
he
.
always
to
mostly
every
one
he
be
lie
.
always
he
be
tell
all
that
it
be
right
for
he
to
tell
to
any
one
.
that
be
the
way
any
man
would
act
,
of
that
he
be
very
certain
.
no
man
would
tell
more
than
he
should
tell
if
he
be
the
kind
of
a
man
Redfern
would
speak
of
as
a
good
one
.
this
be
very
certain
knowledge
in
he
,
in
Phillip
Redfern
.
he
be
certain
always
that
he
be
tell
all
that
it
be
right
for
he
,
for
any
man
to
tell
to
any
one
.
to
mostly
every
one
he
be
a
man
who
be
mostly
always
lie
about
himself
and
about
every
other
one
who
have
any
relation
to
he
.
this
be
true
in
his
living
,
he
be
tell
all
that
it
be
right
he
should
be
tell
to
any
one
,
every
one
be
always
feel
,
always
say
that
he
be
mostly
always
always
lie
.
to
himself
it
be
not
a
virtue
in
he
that
he
be
never
tell
anything
more
about
anything
about
himself
about
any
one
than
it
be
right
that
he
should
be
tell
,
it
be
to
himself
then
,
this
in
he
,
not
a
virtuous
feeling
in
he
,
it
be
a
thing
it
be
natural
for
he
to
be
do
,
never
to
tell
anything
,
it
be
not
right
that
he
should
say
really
to
any
one
.
he
have
not
then
from
this
any
feeling
of
virtue
in
he
.
he
have
a
feeling
of
virtue
although
it
be
as
he
feel
it
in
he
a
weakness
in
he
that
he
always
keep
himself
on
guard
so
that
temptation
should
never
come
close
to
he
.
this
be
to
he
in
a
way
a
virtue
in
he
,
that
he
always
be
on
guard
so
that
no
woman
,
nothing
he
do
not
want
should
touch
he
,
should
come
close
to
he
.
this
be
to
he
a
virtue
in
he
,
though
it
be
from
the
weakness
of
he
that
he
need
to
be
always
guard
but
it
be
a
weakness
of
what
can
any
man
do
when
a
demand
be
make
upon
he
,
kind
of
weakness
in
he
,
that
be
a
weakness
that
any
man
who
be
a
man
must
have
in
living
,
and
so
he
Redfern
always
be
on
guard
have
from
that
to
himself
a
virtuous
feeling
in
he
,
and
this
then
as
I
be
say
be
very
common
.
one
man
Johnson
as
I
be
say
have
it
that
he
always
run
away
and
leave
the
other
one
to
manage
any
trouble
they
have
make
together
and
this
be
a
weakness
in
he
,
yes
,
but
it
be
a
consistent
thing
in
he
and
he
need
it
for
living
,
and
it
really
be
wisdom
in
he
,
this
thing
and
so
in
a
way
it
be
a
virtuous
thing
in
he
some
have
this
kind
of
virtuous
feeling
in
resist
always
all
experience
.
there
be
many
way
as
I
be
say
of
have
this
kind
of
virtuous
feeling
.




as
I
be
say
people
have
in
they
any
of
the
kind
of
be
I
have
be
describe
very
often
have
very
much
reputation
in
their
living
sometime
from
the
living
and
the
being
they
have
in
they
.
very
many
of
they
in
their
living
be
to
some
one
believe
in
they
,
saint
or
hero
or
beautiful
creature
or
wonderfully
romantic
creature
in
their
living
and
be
to
very
many
people
know
they
,
liar
and
coward
and
bad
man
and
bad
woman
and
to
themselves
they
be
man
and
woman
have
in
they
a
weakness
yes
and
a
virtuous
feeling
yes
and
a
certain
feeling
of
the
real
distinction
of
the
consistent
action
their
weakness
entail
on
they
.




Johnson
as
I
be
say
always
attribute
his
having
yield
to
be
in
any
situation
to
his
own
weakness
that
be
the
uppermost
thing
in
he
to
he
and
always
then
that
be
the
true
reason
he
be
in
the
situation
he
be
in
,
to
himself
then
,
he
have
it
as
the
only
right
thing
for
he
always
to
be
do
then
be
escape
and
he
always
then
do
run
away
and
leave
the
other
one
with
the
trouble
or
the
blame
of
the
situation
they
both
be
in
.
Hackart
attribute
his
trouble
,
when
he
have
any
,
and
he
often
have
they
to
the
philanthropy
in
he
,
she
be
lonesome
and
take
possession
of
he
and
what
do
he
do
but
take
care
of
she
and
so
after
all
when
some
one
else
need
he
,
he
must
leave
she
for
of
course
he
must
help
the
one
that
need
he
most
,
that
be
easy
for
any
one
to
see
and
that
be
what
Hackart
be
always
do
,
be
a
man
's
man
and
a
woman
's
man
and
philanthropic
in
his
feeling
.
another
one
put
she
yield
to
her
grit
and
she
have
give
everything
,
herself
and
everything
and
then
the
other
one
want
more
and
that
be
a
ridiculous
thing
and
of
course
she
will
not
pay
any
attention
to
the
clamoring
of
that
other
one
who
have
be
give
everything
and
by
one
who
never
want
anything
from
any
one
.
another
put
she
yield
down
to
guilelessness
and
always
believe
anything
anybody
want
to
make
she
believe
and
then
she
get
sick
and
must
defend
herself
by
attack
and
she
ought
really
to
learn
to
attack
the
other
one
before
she
have
suffer
by
they
but
this
can
never
come
to
she
because
of
the
nature
in
she
to
be
always
believe
in
every
one
.
Redfern
always
be
on
guard
,
that
be
his
contribution
to
defend
himself
and
then
some
one
come
close
to
he
and
then
he
give
that
one
always
all
her
live
everything
she
ever
want
from
he
.
he
always
give
to
every
one
who
ever
be
in
any
relation
with
he
completely
everything
they
could
ask
of
he
every
minute
in
his
living
and
to
the
ending
of
their
or
his
living
.
this
be
a
certain
thing
in
his
feeling
,
he
give
every
one
unceasingly
everything
they
could
possibly
demand
of
he
.
that
be
his
being
and
his
living
to
himself
all
his
living
.
that
be
his
being
and
his
living
to
one
or
two
and
these
make
a
great
person
or
a
saint
of
he
to
they
and
to
very
many
he
be
one
who
be
in
a
complete
sense
a
man
never
trustworthy
in
anything
,
never
realise
his
obligation
to
any
one
.
this
then
have
be
some
description
of
the
being
in
Phillip
Redfern
.
to
the
last
hour
of
his
living
he
be
faithful
to
the
certainty
of
having
be
faithful
to
every
one
who
ever
have
come
to
have
any
claim
upon
he
.
to
the
last
hour
of
his
living
he
be
to
himself
completely
give
himself
to
any
one
that
have
come
to
touch
he
.
always
he
be
guard
himself
,
always
to
the
last
moment
of
his
living
to
himself
,
always
to
himself
to
the
last
moment
of
his
living
he
be
faithful
to
everything
he
owe
to
every
one
and
any
one
.




this
be
now
then
a
little
more
description
of
the
being
in
three
woman
who
have
each
one
their
own
feeling
about
he
,
Miss
Dounor
,
Miss
Charles
and
his
wife
Mrs.
Redfern
.
this
be
now
a
little
more
description
of
the
be
each
one
of
the
three
of
they
have
in
they
the
being
and
the
complete
living
of
each
one
of
they
.




to
begin
then
with
Miss
Dounor
,
her
feeling
and
her
living
and
her
feel
Phillip
Redfern
in
her
living
.




to
very
many
,
to
,
sometimes
any
one
would
think
,
mostly
every
one
some
one
's
way
of
loving
,
some
other
one
's
way
of
loving
,
some
other
one
's
way
of
living
,
some
other
one
's
way
of
keep
something
and
not
other
thing
,
of
throw
away
some
thing
and
not
other
thing
,
some
one
's
way
of
buy
some
thing
and
not
buy
other
thing
be
a
foolish
one
.
mostly
every
one
find
that
thing
other
one
be
want
be
very
foolish
thing
for
any
one
to
be
want
,
for
that
one
to
be
want
,
to
be
buy
,
to
be
keep
.
each
one
have
in
he
a
very
certain
feeling
of
thing
any
one
have
any
sense
in
they
should
be
want
to
have
in
living
.
it
be
very
hard
for
mostly
every
one
to
understand
why
another
one
have
that
way
of
loving
,
that
way
of
be
angry
in
they
that
they
have
in
they
.
some
try
to
understand
the
other
one
's
way
of
do
these
thing
but
mostly
every
one
find
it
very
puzzling
.
what
can
any
one
want
with
buying
,
keeping
,
want
any
such
thing
each
one
say
of
something
some
one
have
be
want
,
buy
,
keeping
.
this
be
very
common
.
very
many
could
forgive
some
one
anything
except
the
way
that
one
have
angry
feeling
or
injure
feeling
in
they
.
some
could
let
anything
pass
except
the
kind
of
way
some
one
have
of
love
.
that
give
they
an
angry
feeling
,
that
be
all
there
be
about
it
to
they
.
it
be
very
very
common
that
some
one
could
forgive
anybody
anything
except
the
way
they
have
of
have
angry
or
injure
feeling
in
they
.
this
be
very
very
common
.
some
can
never
understand
the
queer
way
in
another
one
.
Mr.
Hersland
always
be
say
to
his
three
child
that
the
way
they
have
in
they
be
only
habit
,
there
be
no
need
they
should
have
these
way
in
they
.
he
have
way
in
he
,
they
be
he
to
he
,
the
way
his
child
have
in
they
be
habit
and
it
be
not
at
all
necessary
that
they
should
have
any
such
habit
in
they
.
many
think
that
some
one
,
some
other
could
do
the
work
they
be
do
in
some
other
way
from
the
way
these
be
do
their
working
.
as
I
be
say
it
be
very
,
very
common
that
some
one
could
forgive
some
one
anything
except
the
way
they
have
angry
feeling
,
or
injure
feeling
or
love
feeling
in
they
.
now
then
to
begin
a
little
description
of
the
being
in
some
woman
and
the
feeling
they
each
have
about
the
other
one
and
the
feeling
they
each
one
have
about
Redfern
.
perhaps
no
one
ever
will
know
the
complete
history
of
every
one
.
this
be
a
sad
thing
.
perhaps
no
one
will
ever
have
as
a
complete
thing
the
history
of
any
one
.
this
be
a
very
sad
thing
.
sometime
each
one
will
have
make
a
complete
history
of
they
in
the
repeat
always
come
out
of
they
.
sometime
perhaps
some
one
will
really
know
it
of
some
one
,
that
will
be
a
very
content
thing
to
some
.
some
see
a
mistake
in
their
copying
,
say
then
,
oh
how
can
I
ever
be
certain
,
perhaps
I
have
make
many
mistake
I
have
not
be
notice
.
this
be
a
sad
thing
.
some
every
time
they
see
a
mistake
they
have
be
make
say
,
if
I
almost
do
not
see
this
one
in
read
it
again
,
very
likely
there
be
very
many
I
do
not
see
for
I
would
not
have
see
this
one
if
I
have
not
be
notice
very
carefully
when
I
be
see
this
one
,
and
this
be
a
very
sad
thing
.
some
say
then
,
I
notice
this
one
and
so
always
I
be
notice
all
the
mistake
I
be
ever
make
and
that
be
very
pleasant
if
any
one
can
believe
what
they
be
hear
from
some
one
,
and
then
some
one
say
with
a
mistake
they
have
be
noticing
,
this
be
certainly
the
first
mistake
I
have
ever
make
in
copying
and
that
be
comfort
too
only
one
can
hardly
at
all
believe
that
one
and
then
some
one
say
of
a
copying
,
I
never
make
any
mistake
in
copying
and
that
be
almost
irritate
to
be
hear
for
always
every
one
be
make
mistake
and
that
be
a
very
sad
thing
.




perhaps
no
one
ever
will
know
the
complete
history
of
every
one
.
this
be
a
sad
thing
.
perhaps
no
one
will
ever
have
as
a
complete
thing
the
history
of
any
one
.
this
be
a
very
sad
thing
.
surely
some
one
sometime
will
have
a
complete
history
of
some
one
.
all
this
give
to
some
a
very
despairing
feeling
.
some
one
be
hear
something
,
and
they
think
then
,
it
be
only
by
an
accident
that
I
have
hear
that
thing
,
I
have
know
that
thing
,
always
there
be
many
thing
that
I
be
not
know
,
that
be
very
certain
,
every
one
always
be
repeat
,
that
there
be
not
any
deny
,
certainly
sometime
some
one
always
pay
all
attention
must
know
sometime
the
history
of
some
one
.
perhaps
no
one
ever
get
a
complete
history
of
any
one
.
this
be
very
discouraging
thinking
.
I
be
very
sad
now
in
this
feeling
.
always
,
hear
something
,
give
to
some
a
sad
feeling
of
realise
everything
they
have
not
be
hear
and
that
they
be
not
know
and
perhaps
they
can
never
have
really
in
they
the
complete
history
of
any
one
,
no
one
ever
can
have
in
they
the
complete
history
of
any
one
and
that
be
then
a
very
melancholy
feeling
in
they
.
there
be
a
little
comfort
to
some
of
such
of
they
that
always
every
one
be
repeat
the
whole
of
they
,
that
always
every
one
always
be
repeat
all
the
being
in
they
and
then
that
be
a
little
a
comfort
to
such
a
one
and
then
such
a
one
know
always
how
important
each
repeat
in
each
one
be
to
make
a
completer
realisation
of
that
one
and
how
each
repeat
be
more
and
more
a
completion
of
the
history
of
the
being
of
each
one
and
then
such
a
one
know
how
many
repeating
out
of
each
one
that
one
be
not
hear
have
in
that
one
a
very
dreary
feeling
.
sadness
be
then
in
that
one
,
sadness
and
gentle
melancholy
despairing
.
repeat
be
in
each
one
,
yes
,
always
come
out
of
they
,
yes
that
be
a
little
a
comforting
,
each
repeat
be
important
to
be
know
and
that
be
interesting
and
that
be
a
sad
thing
to
one
want
to
have
in
they
complete
history
of
man
and
woman
.




sometimes
in
listen
to
a
conversation
which
be
very
important
to
two
man
,
to
two
woman
,
to
two
man
and
woman
,
sometime
then
it
be
a
wonderful
thing
to
see
how
each
one
always
be
repeat
everything
they
be
say
and
each
time
in
repeat
,
what
each
one
be
say
have
more
meaning
to
each
one
of
they
and
so
they
go
on
and
on
and
on
and
on
repeat
and
always
to
some
one
listen
,
repeat
be
a
very
wonderful
thing
.
there
be
many
of
they
who
do
not
live
in
each
repeat
each
repeat
come
out
of
they
but
always
repeat
be
interesting
.
repeating
be
what
I
be
love
.
sometimes
there
be
in
I
a
sad
feeling
for
all
the
repeat
no
one
love
repeating
be
hear
,
it
be
like
any
beauty
that
no
one
be
see
,
it
be
a
lovely
thing
,
always
some
one
should
be
know
the
meaning
in
the
repeat
always
come
out
of
woman
and
of
man
,
the
repeating
of
the
being
in
they
.
so
then
.




every
one
be
a
brute
in
her
way
or
his
way
to
some
one
,
every
one
have
some
kind
of
sensitiveness
in
they
.




some
feel
some
kind
of
thing
other
feel
other
kind
of
thing
.
mostly
every
one
feel
some
kind
of
thing
.
the
way
some
thing
touch
some
and
do
not
touch
other
one
and
kind
in
man
and
woman
then
I
will
now
begin
to
think
a
little
bit
about
describe
.
to
begin
then
.




I
be
think
it
be
very
interesting
the
relation
of
the
kind
of
thing
that
touch
man
and
woman
with
the
kind
of
bottom
nature
in
they
,
the
kind
of
be
they
have
in
they
in
every
way
in
they
,
the
way
they
react
to
thing
which
may
be
different
from
the
way
they
feel
they
.




I
be
think
very
much
of
feel
thing
in
man
and
woman
.
as
I
be
say
every
one
be
a
brute
in
her
way
or
his
way
to
some
one
,
every
one
have
some
kind
of
sensitiveness
in
they
.
mostly
every
one
have
some
inner
way
of
feeling
in
they
,
almost
every
one
have
some
way
of
react
to
stimulus
in
they
.
this
be
not
always
the
same
thing
.
these
thing
have
many
complication
in
they
.
I
be
begin
now
a
little
a
description
of
three
woman
,
Miss
Dounor
,
Miss
Charles
and
Mrs.
Redfern
.
I
be
begin
now
a
little
a
realisation
of
the
way
each
one
of
they
be
in
her
way
a
brute
to
some
one
,
each
one
have
in
her
way
a
kind
of
sensitiveness
in
be
.
this
be
now
some
description
of
each
one
of
the
three
of
they
Miss
Dounor
,
Miss
Charles
and
Mrs.
Redfern
.




in
listen
to
a
conversation
,
as
I
be
say
,
repeat
of
each
one
and
the
gradual
rise
and
fall
and
rise
again
of
realisation
be
very
interesting
.
this
be
now
some
description
of
the
three
woman
and
as
I
be
say
of
the
sensitiveness
in
each
one
of
they
to
something
and
the
insensitiveness
to
other
thing
and
the
bottom
nature
in
they
and
the
kind
of
repeat
in
they
and
the
bottom
nature
and
the
other
nature
mix
with
the
bottom
nature
in
each
one
of
they
.
sensitiveness
to
something
,
understand
anything
,
feel
anything
,
that
be
very
interesting
to
understand
in
each
one
how
much
,
when
and
where
and
how
and
when
not
and
where
not
and
how
not
they
be
feel
,
think
,
understanding
.
to
begin
again
then
with
feel
anything
.
mostly
every
one
be
a
brute
in
her
way
or
his
way
to
some
one
,
mostly
every
one
have
some
kind
of
sensitiveness
in
they
.




mostly
every
one
can
have
some
kind
of
feeling
in
they
,
very
many
man
and
very
many
woman
can
have
some
understanding
in
they
of
some
kind
of
thing
by
the
kind
of
be
sensitive
to
some
kind
of
impression
that
they
have
in
they
.




some
kind
of
man
and
woman
have
a
way
of
have
sensation
from
some
thing
and
other
man
and
woman
have
it
in
they
to
be
able
to
be
impressionable
to
other
kind
of
thing
.
some
man
and
some
woman
have
very
much
of
sensitive
be
in
they
for
the
kind
of
thing
they
can
be
feel
,
they
can
then
be
very
loving
,
or
very
trembly
from
the
abundant
delicate
fear
in
they
,
or
very
attack
from
the
intensity
of
the
feeling
in
they
,
or
very
mystic
in
their
absorption
of
feeling
which
be
then
all
of
they
.
there
be
some
man
and
woman
have
in
they
very
much
weakness
as
the
bottom
in
they
and
watery
anxious
feeling
,
and
sometimes
nervous
anxious
feeling
then
in
they
and
sometimes
stubborn
feeling
then
in
they
.
there
be
some
who
have
vague
or
vacant
being
as
the
bottom
in
they
and
it
be
very
hard
to
know
with
such
one
of
they
what
feel
they
have
ever
in
they
and
there
be
some
with
almost
intermittent
being
in
they
and
it
be
very
hard
to
tell
with
such
of
they
what
kind
of
thing
give
to
they
a
feeling
,
what
kind
of
feeling
they
ever
have
really
in
they
.
as
I
be
say
mostly
every
one
sometimes
feel
something
,
some
one
,
be
understand
something
,
some
one
,
have
some
kind
of
sensitiveness
in
they
to
something
,
to
some
one
,
mostly
every
one
.




as
I
be
say
some
man
and
some
woman
have
very
much
of
sensitive
be
in
they
for
something
that
can
give
to
they
real
feeling
.
they
can
then
,
some
of
these
of
they
,
when
they
be
fill
full
then
of
such
feeling
,
they
can
then
be
completely
loving
,
completely
believe
,
they
can
then
have
a
trembling
awed
be
in
they
,
they
can
have
then
abundant
trembly
feel
in
they
,
they
can
then
be
so
full
up
then
with
the
feeling
in
they
that
they
be
a
full
thing
and
action
have
no
place
then
in
they
,
they
be
completely
then
a
feeling
,
there
be
then
man
and
woman
,
there
be
then
woman
and
man
who
have
then
this
finely
sensitive
complete
feeling
that
be
sometime
all
they
and
perhaps
Cora
Dounor
be
one
of
such
of
they
.
perhaps
she
be
one
of
they
and
be
such
a
one
in
love
Phillip
Redfern
.
perhaps
that
be
the
whole
being
she
have
in
she
then
.




each
one
as
I
be
say
have
it
in
they
to
feel
more
or
less
,
sometime
,
something
,
almost
certainly
each
one
sometime
have
some
capacity
for
more
or
less
feel
something
.
some
have
in
they
always
and
very
little
feeling
,
some
have
some
feeling
and
much
nervous
be
always
in
they
,
some
have
as
a
bottom
to
they
very
much
weakness
and
eagerness
together
then
and
they
have
then
such
of
they
some
sensitiveness
in
they
to
thing
come
to
they
but
often
after
they
be
then
full
up
with
nervous
vibration
and
then
nothing
can
really
touch
they
and
then
they
can
have
in
they
nervous
vibratory
movement
in
they
,
anxious
feeling
in
they
and
sometimes
stubborn
feeling
then
in
they
and
then
nothing
can
touch
they
and
they
be
all
this
be
then
this
nervous
vibratory
-
quiver
and
perhaps
Mrs.
Redfern
be
such
a
one
Mrs.
Redfern
who
have
be
Martha
Hersland
and
be
marry
now
to
Phillip
Redfern
and
have
come
to
Farnham
and
have
there
see
Phillip
Redfern
come
to
know
Miss
Dounor
and
have
be
then
warn
to
take
care
of
he
by
the
dean
of
Farnham
Miss
Charles
.
she
never
know
then
,
Mrs.
Redfern
never
know
then
that
she
would
not
ever
again
have
he
,
have
Redfern
again
.
this
never
could
come
to
be
real
knowledge
in
she
.
she
be
always
then
and
later
always
work
at
something
to
have
he
again
and
that
be
there
always
in
she
to
the
end
of
he
and
of
she
.
there
will
be
a
little
more
description
of
she
write
in
the
history
of
the
ending
of
the
living
in
her
father
,
in
the
history
of
the
later
living
of
her
brother
Alfred
Hersland
who
now
just
when
her
trouble
be
commence
be
just
then
marry
Julia
Dehning
,
in
the
history
of
her
brother
David
Hersland
her
young
brother
.
More
description
of
she
will
be
part
of
the
history
of
the
ending
of
the
exist
of
the
Hersland
family
.
there
will
be
very
much
history
of
this
ending
of
all
of
they
of
the
Hersland
family
—
write
later
.




the
dean
Miss
Charles
be
very
different
from
either
Miss
Douner
or
Mrs.
Redfern
.
she
have
it
in
she
to
have
her
own
way
of
feel
thing
touch
she
,
mostly
there
be
in
she
less
reactive
than
self
-
directive
action
in
she
than
there
be
in
the
two
woman
who
be
just
then
concern
she
,
Miss
Dounor
and
Mrs.
Redfern
.




it
be
hard
to
know
it
of
any
one
whether
they
be
enjoy
anything
,
whether
they
be
know
they
arc
give
pain
to
some
one
,
whether
they
be
plan
that
thing
.
it
be
hard
to
know
such
thing
in
any
one
when
they
be
tell
when
they
be
not
tell
to
any
one
what
they
know
inside
they
.
it
be
hard
tell
it
of
any
one
whether
they
be
enjoy
a
thing
,
whether
they
know
that
they
be
hurt
some
one
,
whether
they
have
be
plan
the
acting
they
have
be
do
.
it
be
hard
tell
it
of
any
one
whether
they
be
enjoy
anything
,
whether
they
know
that
they
be
hurt
any
one
,
whether
they
have
be
plan
the
acting
they
be
do
.
it
be
very
hard
then
to
know
anything
of
the
being
in
any
one
,
it
be
hard
then
to
know
the
being
in
many
man
and
in
many
woman
,
it
be
hard
then
to
know
the
being
and
the
feeling
in
any
man
or
in
any
woman
.
it
be
hard
to
know
it
if
they
tell
you
all
they
know
of
it
.
it
be
hard
to
know
it
if
they
do
not
tell
you
what
they
know
of
it
in
it
.
Miss
Cora
Dounor
then
could
do
some
planning
,
could
do
some
hurt
with
it
,
that
be
certain
.
this
be
perhaps
surprising
to
some
,
reading
.
to
begin
then
with
her
feeling
and
her
being
and
her
acting
.




as
I
be
say
she
have
it
in
she
to
be
compound
of
beautiful
sensitive
being
,
of
be
able
to
be
in
a
state
of
be
completely
possess
by
a
wonderful
feeling
of
loving
and
that
be
then
the
whole
of
the
being
that
be
be
then
in
she
and
then
it
come
to
be
in
she
that
she
could
be
hurt
first
Miss
Charles
and
then
Mrs.
Redfern
,
then
Miss
Charles
and
Mrs.
Redfern
by
plan
.
this
be
then
the
being
in
she
this
that
I
be
now
with
very
much
complication
slowly
realise
,
not
yet
completely
realise
,
not
yet
completely
ready
to
be
completely
describe
,
begin
now
to
be
describe
.
the
dean
Miss
Charles
be
a
very
different
person
,
she
be
of
the
dependent
independent
kind
of
they
.
to
understand
the
being
in
she
there
must
be
now
a
little
realisation
of
the
way
begin
be
in
very
many
person
have
in
they
a
nature
that
be
self
grow
and
a
nature
that
be
react
to
stimulation
and
that
have
it
in
they
to
have
these
two
nature
act
in
not
very
great
harmony
inside
they
.
Mrs.
Redfern
as
I
be
say
in
a
long
description
that
have
be
already
write
be
a
very
different
kind
of
person
from
Miss
Dounor
and
Miss
Charles
.
these
be
then
the
three
of
they
that
be
struggle
and
each
of
they
have
in
they
their
own
way
of
be
brutal
,
hurt
some
one
,
have
each
of
they
their
own
way
of
be
sensitive
to
thing
and
people
near
they
.




sometimes
I
be
almost
despairing
.
yes
it
be
very
hard
,
almost
impossible
I
be
feel
now
in
my
despairing
feeling
to
have
completely
a
realising
of
the
being
in
any
one
,
when
they
be
tell
it
when
they
be
not
tell
it
,
it
be
so
very
very
hard
to
know
it
completely
in
one
the
being
in
one
.
I
know
the
being
in
Miss
Dounor
that
I
be
begin
describe
,
I
know
the
being
in
Miss
Charles
that
I
be
soon
go
to
be
begin
describe
,
I
know
the
being
in
Mrs.
Redfern
,
I
have
be
describe
the
being
in
that
one
.
I
know
the
being
in
each
one
of
these
three
of
they
and
I
be
almost
despairing
for
I
be
doubt
if
I
be
know
it
poignantly
enough
to
be
really
know
it
,
to
be
really
know
the
being
in
any
one
of
the
three
of
they
.
always
now
I
be
despairing
.
it
be
a
very
melancholy
feeling
I
have
in
I
now
I
be
despair
about
really
know
the
complete
being
of
any
one
of
each
one
of
these
three
of
they
Miss
Dounor
and
Miss
Charles
and
Mrs.
Redfern
.




Miss
Dounor
as
I
be
say
be
to
Redfern
the
most
complete
thing
of
gentleness
and
intelligence
he
could
think
of
ever
see
in
anybody
who
be
live
,
Miss
Dounor
have
it
to
have
in
she
the
complete
thing
of
gentleness
,
of
beauty
in
sensitiveness
,
in
completeness
of
intelligent
sensitiveness
in
completely
loving
.
she
be
the
complete
thing
then
of
gentleness
and
sensitiveness
and
intelligence
and
she
have
it
as
a
complete
thing
gentleness
and
sensitiveness
and
intelligence
in
completely
loving
.
it
be
in
her
complete
in
loving
,
complete
in
creative
loving
,
it
be
then
complete
be
,
it
be
then
completely
in
her
completely
love
Phillip
Redfern
.
and
always
to
the
ending
of
his
living
in
all
the
other
loving
and
other
troubling
and
the
other
enjoying
of
man
and
woman
in
he
he
be
faithful
to
the
thing
she
have
be
,
be
and
would
be
to
he
the
complete
incarnation
of
gentleness
and
sensitiveness
and
intelligence
,
gentle
intelligence
and
intelligent
sensitiveness
and
all
to
the
point
of
completely
creative
loving
that
be
to
he
the
supreme
thing
in
all
live
.
Miss
Dounor
be
then
completely
what
Redfern
find
she
to
he
,
she
be
of
they
of
the
independent
dependent
kind
or
they
who
have
sensitive
be
to
the
point
of
creative
being
,
of
attack
,
of
creative
loving
,
creative
feeling
,
of
sometimes
creative
thinking
and
writing
.
she
be
then
such
a
one
and
completely
then
this
one
and
she
have
in
her
completely
sensitive
be
to
the
point
of
attack
.
she
could
have
in
she
a
planning
of
attack
and
this
come
to
be
in
she
from
the
completeness
of
sensitive
creative
loving
that
she
have
then
in
she
then
when
she
be
know
Phillip
Redfern
.




perhaps
she
be
not
of
this
kind
of
they
.
perhaps
she
be
at
the
bottom
,
of
the
resist
kind
of
they
.
I
think
she
be
of
the
resist
kind
of
they
and
so
she
need
to
own
the
one
she
need
for
loving
,
so
she
could
do
resist
to
planning
make
an
attacking
.
I
be
almost
despairing
,
yes
a
little
I
be
realise
the
being
in
Miss
Dounor
and
in
Miss
Charles
and
Mrs.
Redfern
,
but
I
be
really
almost
despairing
,
I
have
really
in
I
a
very
very
melancholy
feeling
,
a
very
melancholy
being
,
I
be
really
then
despairing
.




Miss
Charles
be
of
the
kind
of
man
and
woman
that
I
speak
of
and
have
speak
of
as
the
dependent
independent
kind
of
they
.
I
will
now
tell
a
little
about
what
I
mean
by
self
grow
activity
in
such
of
they
and
reactive
activity
in
such
of
they
.
as
I
be
say
a
long
time
back
when
I
be
describe
the
dependent
independent
kind
of
they
,
reaction
be
not
poignant
in
they
unless
it
enter
into
they
the
stimulation
be
lose
in
they
and
so
set
it
,
the
mass
,
in
motion
,
it
be
not
as
in
the
other
kind
of
they
who
have
it
to
have
a
reactive
emotion
to
be
as
poignant
as
a
sensation
as
be
the
case
in
the
independent
dependent
kind
of
they
.
Miss
Charles
then
as
I
be
say
be
of
the
kind
of
they
where
reaction
to
have
meaning
must
be
a
slow
thing
,
but
she
have
quick
reaction
as
mostly
all
of
they
of
this
kind
of
they
have
they
and
those
be
in
she
mostly
attack
be
as
be
very
common
in
those
have
in
they
dependent
independent
being
.




it
be
so
very
confusing
that
I
be
begin
to
have
in
I
despair
melancholy
feeling
.
Mrs.
Redfern

I
be
say
be
of
the
independent
dependent
kind
of
they
and
be
in

be
never
really
attack
,

be
mostly
never
active
into
forward
movement

be
incessantly
in
action
as
be
in
a
state
of
most
continual
nervous
agitation

have
this
be
in
she
.
she
could
have
some
planning
in
she
,
this
come
from
the
completeness
of
pride
in
she
.
this
now
come
to
be
clear
,
that
she
have
as
completely
pride
in
she
as
sensitiveness
and
intelligent
gentleness
inside
she
.

this
make
it
that
she
have
plan
in
she
,
this
make
attack
sometimes
in
she
.
this
never
make
any
action
in
she
toward
a
lover
,
this
give
to
she
a
power
of
planning
and
this
be
in
she
and
she
could
be
wonderfully
punish
some
around
she
.
this
could
be
turn
into
melodrama
if
the
intelligence
in
she
have
not
be
so
gentle
and
so
fine
in
she
,
this
in
many
who
be
like
she
be
a
melodrama
.
in
she
it
make
she
able
to
do
some
planning
against
some
to
punish
they
not
for
interfere
but
for
exist
and
so
claim
something
that
entirely
belong
to
she
.
what
be
in
Redfern
to
he
himself
a
weakness
in

that
they
have
generalise
moral
aspiration
,

they
be
vigorous
egotistic
sensual
nature
,
love

,
reading
,
eat
,
drink
,

,
find
out
everything
,
and
slowly
they
get
courage
in
they
to
feel
the
being
in
they
they
have
in
they
,
slowly
they
get
courage
in
they
to
live
the
being
they
have
in
they
.
some
like
Miss
Charles
keep
on
have
tranquilly
inside
they
equally
strongly
in
they
moral
aspiration
general
and
detail
in
they
,
egotistic
expedient
domineering
as
a
general
aspiration
and
as
detailed
living
in
they
.
some
be
always
struggle
,
some
of
this
kind
of
they
,
some
get
to
have
in
they
that
the
moral
fervor
in
they
in
the
general
and
specific
expression
of
they
get
to
be
the
whole
of
they
,
some
get
to
have
it
all
fairly
mixed
up
in
they
.
this
be
now
a
little
description
of
how
one
of
they
when
she
be
a
young
one
one
of
the
first
kind
of
they
who
slowly
come
to
have
the
courage
of
feeling
and
then
live
the
real
being
come
to
have
the
struggle
as
a
beginning
.
later
then
come
the
courage
to
be
more
certain
of
the
real
being
.
this
be
now
a
little
piece
of
such
a
description
of
such
beginning
experience
.




as
I
be
say
in
many
of
such
one
there
be
the
slow
react
,
slow
express
being
that
come
more
and
more
in
their
living
to
determine
they
.
there
be
in
many
of
such
one
aspiration
and
conviction
due
to
quick
reaction
to
other
around
they
,
to
book
they
be
read
,
to
the
family
tradition
,
to
the
lack
of
articulation
of
the
meaning
of
the
being
in
they
that
make
they
need
then
to
be
fill
full
with
other
reaction
in
they
so
that
they
will
then
have
something
.
some
then
spend
all
their
living
struggle
to
adjust
the
being
that
slowly
come
to
active
stirring
in
they
to
the
aspiration
they
have
in
they
,
some
want
to
create
their
aspiration
from
the
being
in
they
and
they
have
not
the
courage
in
they
.
it
be
a
wonderful
thing
how
much
courage
it
take
even
to
buy
a
clock
you
be
very
much
like
when
it
be
a
kind
of
one
every
one
think
only
a
servant
should
be
own
.
it
be
very
wonderful
how
much
courage
it
take
to
buy
bright
colored
handkerchief
when
every
one
have
good
taste
use
white
one
or
pale
colored
one
,
when
a
bright
colored
one
give
you
so
much
pleasure
you
suffer
always
at
not
have
they
.
it
be
very
hard
to
have
the
courage
of
your
be
in
you
,
in
clock
,
in
handkerchief
,
in
aspiration
,
in
like
thing
that
be
low
,
in
anything
.
it
be
a
very
difficult
thing
to
get
the
courage
to
buy
the
kind
of
clock
or
handkerchief
you
be
love
when
every
one
think
it
be
a
silly
thing
.
it
take
very
much
courage
to
do
anything
connect
with
your
being
unless
it
be
a
very
serious
thing
.
in
some
,
express
their
being
need
courage
,
for
,
foolish
way
to
every
one
else
,
in
they
.
it
be
a
very
difficult
thing
to
have
courage
to
buy
clock
and
handkerchief
you
be
like
,
you
be
seriously
like
and
everybody
think
then
you
be
joke
.
it
be
a
very
difficult
thing
to
have
courage
for
something
no
one
be
think
be
a
serious
thing
.




as
I
be
say
Miss
Charles
have
in
she
what
I
be
call
dependent
independent
being
,
that
be
be
that
be
not
in
its
quick
react
poignant
in
its
feeling
,
not
have
emotion
then
have
the
keenness
of
sensation
as
those
have
independent
dependent
being
have
it
in
they
.
Miss
Charles
be
then
such
a
one
.




this
be
then
a
very
common
thing
as
I
be
say
.
Miss
Charles
have
in
she
this
being
.
as
I
be
say
there
be
two
way
then
of
act
in
a
being
like
those
I
have
be
just
describe
.
the
act
from
the
personality
slowly
develop
,
the
acting
from
the
organised
reaction
to
contemporary
ideal
,
tradition
,
education
and
need
of
have
,
before
the
developing
of
their
own
being
,
complete
aspiration
.
often
these
keep
on
as
they
do
in
Miss
Charles
and
no
one
be
know
which
be
the
strong
way
of
be
in
such
a
one
.
sometimes
there
be
as
I
be
say
in
the
beginning
very
much
struggle
and
then
slowly
the
personality
come
to
action
and
that
one
drop
away
the
early
filling
,
sometimes
the
early
filling
come
to
be
the
later
filling
and
in
such
a
one
then
there
be
not
any
change
.
this
be
quite
interesting
and
will
be
always
more
and
more
dwelt
upon
.
this
then
be
the
being
in
Miss
Charles
and
this
be
the
meaning
of
her
action
with
Miss
Dounor
and
Mrs.
Redfern
and
Mr.
Redfern
that
I
have
be
describe
.




there
will
be
now
a
very
little
more
description
of
the
being
in
they
,
of
the
virtuous
feeling
in
they
,
of
the
religious
feeling
in
they
,
of
the
sensitiveness
in
they
,
of
the
worldly
feeling
in
they
,
of
the
succeed
and
fail
in
they
,
in
each
one
of
the
three
of
they
,
Miss
Dounor
,
Miss
Charles
and
Mrs.
Redfern
.




every
one
have
their
own
being
in
they
.
every
one
be
right
in
their
own
living
.
this
be
a
pleasant
feeling
to
have
in
one
about
every
one
.
this
make
every
one
very
interesting
to
one
have
such
a
feeling
in
they
.
every
one
be
right
in
their
living
.
each
one
have
she
or
his
own
being
in
she
or
in
he
.
each
one
be
right
in
the
living
in
she
or
in
he
.
each
one
of
these
three
of
they
be
right
in
their
living
.
this
be
now
a
little
more
description
of
the
being
in
each
one
of
they
.




it
be
a
very
difficult
thing
to
know
it
of
any
one
whether
they
be
enjoy
anything
,
whether
they
be
know
they
be
give
pain
to
some
one
,
whether
they
be
plan
that
thing
.
it
be
a
very
difficult
thing
to
know
it
of
any
one
what
be
the
kind
of
thing
they
be
sensitive
to
in
living
,
what
be
the
bottom
nature
in
they
,
whether
they
will
in
living
be
mostly
succeed
or
mostly
fail
.
it
be
hard
to
know
such
thing
in
any
one
when
they
be
tell
everything
they
have
in
they
,
when
they
be
not
tell
to
any
one
anything
of
what
they
know
inside
they
.
it
be
a
very
difficult
thing
the
tell
it
of
any
one
whether
they
be
enjoy
a
thing
,
whether
they
know
that
they
be
hurt
some
one
,
whether
they
have
be
plan
the
acting
they
be
do
.
it
be
a
very
difficult
thing
then
to
know
anything
of
the
being
in
any
one
,
it
be
hard
then
to
know
the
being
in
many
man
and
in
many
woman
,
it
be
a
very
difficult
thing
then
to
know
the
being
and
the
feeling
in
any
man
or
in
any
woman
.
it
be
hard
to
know
it
if
they
tell
you
all
they
know
of
it
.
it
be
hard
to
know
it
if
they
do
not
tell
you
what
they
know
of
it
in
it
.
nevertheless
now
almost
I
be
understand
the
being
in
the
three
of
they
Miss
Charles
,
Miss
Dounor
and
Mrs.
Redfern
.
there
will
be
now
a
very
little
more
description
of
the
being
in
they
,
of
the
virtuous
feeling
in
they
of
the
religious
feeling
in
they
,
of
the
sensitiveness
in
they
,
of
the
worldly
feeling
in
they
,
of
the
succeeding
and
failure
in
they
,
in
each
one
of
the
three
of
they
Miss
Charles
,
Miss
Dounor
and
Mrs.
Redfern
.




Miss
Cora
Dounor
could
do
some
planning
,
could
do
some
attack
with
it
,
that
be
certain
.
this
be
perhaps
surprising
to
some
reading
.
to
begin
then
with
her
feeling
and
her
being
and
her
do
,
and
her
succeed
and
her
fail
.




she
be
then
complete
in
her
loving
,
she
have
complete
understanding
in
desire
in
all
her
relation
with
Phillip
Redfern
,
she
have
completely
then
the
realisation
later
in
she
that
Phillip
Redfern
be
saintly
and
she
have
then
in
she
the
complete
possession
of
her
adoration
,
the
complete
understanding
and
possession
of
her
adoration
of
the
saintly
be
in
he
,
and
this
be
then
in
she
a
complete
succeeding
in
being
and
in
living
.
this
be
not
exactly
virtuous
or
religious
being
in
she
this
be
complete
understanding
desire
and
complete
intelligent
being
in
she
and
this
be
in
she
succeed
in
her
being
and
in
her
living
.
this
be
very
certain
.
this
be
in
she
succeed
in
her
being
and
in
her
living
.
she
have
then
in
her
complete
understanding
in
desire
,
she
have
then
completely
in
her
complete
intelligence
in
adoration
and
this
be
complete
be
in
she
and
it
be
a
complete
possession
of
she
and
by
she
and
this
be
then
completely
succeed
in
living
.
this
be
now
very
certain
.




she
have
then
complete
succeed
in
her
living
as
I
be
say
,
she
have
in
her
complete
pride
in
she
and
this
could
be
in
her
strong
sensitive
attacking
but
this
be
not
completely
a
succeeding
in
her
living
.
as
I
be
say
Mrs.
Redfern
have
in
she
no
intelligence
whatever
in
desire
,
this
be
in
she
then
presumption
in
she
to
Miss
Dounor
,
not
the
thing
for
which
Mrs.
Redfern
be
ask
,
Mrs.
Redfern
have
the
right
to
ask
for
anything
or
everything
,
it
be
desire
in
she
that
be
a
thing
Miss
Dounor
could
rightly
condemn
in
she
and
later
she
make
it
very
certain
to
every
one
that
Mrs.
Redfern
have
no
intelligence
no
understanding
in
desire
and
then
at
last
Mrs.
Redfern
reproach
she
and
so
then
in
a
sense
Miss
Dounor
be
then
fail
in
she
be
completely
proud
inside
she
.
Mrs.
Redfern
attempt
to
attack
she
,
attack
she
even
though
fail
in
attack
be
a
failing
of
the
complete
intelligent
pride
in
the
understanding
sensitive
planning
attack
pride
in
Miss
Dounor
and
so
Miss
Dounor
in
her
living
be
not
then
completely
succeed
.
this
be
certain
.
there
be
then
complete
succeed
in
Miss
Dounor
in
she
love
in
her
completely
understand
desire
,
in
her
complete
intelligence
of
adoration
,
in
the
completion
of
the
being
then
in
she
,
there
be
in
she
then
some
fail
that
Mrs.
Redfern
could
attack
she
with
go
on
attempt
desire
.
this
be
all
very
certain
.




Miss
Dounor
hold
Miss
Charles
from
really
touch
her
real
being
,
she
do
not
hold
she
from
really
touch
Redfern
's
being
.
she
never
recognise
this
fail
in
herself
inside
she
but
it
be
a
failing
of
the
completeness
of
pride
in
she
and
later
much
later
when
Redfern
be
no
long
exist
in
live
it
make
they
separate
from
one
another
,
later
it
in
spot
make
Miss
Dounor
bitter
.
Miss
Charles
then
be
not
succeed
in
keep
Miss
Dounor
with
she
,
she
be
win
by
not
then
have
any
remembrance
in
she
of
the
trouble
she
have
have
with
she
.
Miss
Dounor
then
be
succeed
and
fail
in
some
way
as
I
have
be
say
.
there
be
real
succeed
in
she
as
I
have
be
say
,
there
be
real
fail
in
she
as
I
have
be
say
.
this
be
all
very
certain
.
this
have
be
some
description
of
the
being
in
Miss
Dounor
and
of
her
fail
and
of
she
succeed
.




Miss
Charles
be
of
the
kind
of
they
the
kind
of
man
and
woman
I
know
very
well
in
living
.
I
know
very
well
all
the
variety
of
this
kind
of
they
.
in
each
kind
of
they
they
be
nice
one
they
be
those
that
be
not
such
nice
one

some
of

be
in

so
concentratedly
it
be
a
wonderful
thing
to
see

so
complete
in
one
man
or

one
woman
.
Miss
Charles
be
of
a
kind
of
be
I
know
very
well
in
living
,
very
well
indeed
in
living
,
I
know
very
well
all
the
variety
of
the
kind
of
be
that
Miss
Charles
be
in
live
in
all
the
very
many
million
ever
live
having
have
or
have
that
kind
of
be
in
they
.
some
then
of
a
kind
of
be
be
nice
one
,
some
of
that
kind
of
they
be
not
very
nice
one
,
some
of
that
kind
of
they
be
not
at
all
nice
one
.
some
of
a
kind
of
they
be
nice
one
of
that
kind
of
they
and
then
they
have
a
mixture
in
they
of
other
kind
of
be
in
they
and
then
that
one
be
not
a
nice
one
though
that
one
have
a
nice
kind
of
one
kind
of
be
in
that
one
.
that
often
make
one
a
very
puzzle
one
to
every
one
.
there
be
then
all
kind
of
way
of
be
one
kind
of
they
in
man
and
woman
.
some
be
a
nice
kind
of
a
kind
of
they
,
and
some
be
not
a
nice
kind
of
that
same
kind
of
they
.
sometimes
be
in
one
who
be
a
nice
one
of
a
kind
of
they
and
then
have
other
thing
mix
up
in
they
be
very
perplexing
and
sometimes
no
one
in
such
a
one
ever
come
to
an
understanding
of
that
one
.
well
then
that
be
true
then
that
of
each
kind
of
they
there
be
nice
one
and
nice
enough
one
and
not
very
nice
one
,
and
not
at
all
nice
one
and
very
horrid
one
.
this
can
he
in
they
with
any
strength
or
weakness
of
their
kind
of
be
in
they
,
it
be
from
the
mixing
and
the
accenting
and
the
relation
of
part
of
their
kind
of
nature
in
they
.
there
be
one
thing
very
certain
of
each
kind
of
they
of
each
kind
there
be
of
man
and
woman
there
be
nice
one
and
then
there
be
not
at
all
nice
one
of
they
.
and
about
some
mostly
every
one
be
agree
and
about
some
there
be
very
much
disagree
and
there
be
very
many
way
of
feel
every
one
and
every
one
have
their
own
being
in
they
.
yes
every
one
have
their
own
being
in
they
and
yes
every
one
be
right
in
live
their
own
being
in
they
and
this
be
a
very
difficult
thing
to
be
realise
and
it
be
a
very
pleasant
thing
to
have
inside
one
when
it
come
to
be
really
in
one
.




Miss
Charles
be
of
a
kind
of
man
and
woman
I
know
very
well
in
all
the
kind
of
way
of
be
they
have
in
they
.
Miss
Charles
be
one
of
the
independent
dependent
kind
of
they
.
Miss
Charles
be
one
who
be
herself
a
very
strong
one
in
her
being
and
it
slowly
come
to
be
more
and
more
filling
inside
she
.
Miss
Charles
be
one
who
have
it
in
she
to
have
reaction
in
she
to
influence
around
she
when
she
be
young
,
to
desire
in
she
,
to
tradition
and
mob
action
and
to
very
many
thing
then
and
they
make
moral
aspiration
in
she
they
make
a
reformer
of
she
,
they
make
an
aggressive
attack
person
of
she
and
when
she
be
a
young
one
all
this
then
almost
completely
fill
she
.
she
be
as
I
be
say
of
the
dependent
independent
kind
in
man
and
woman
and
resist
,
slow
realisation
be
the
bottom
way
of
feeling
and
of
fighting
and
of
understanding
in
she
.
this
come
then
slowly
to
be
strong
in
she
,
this
make
then
of
her
one
that
could
be
feel
and
understand
brilliant
man
and
brilliant
woman
,
brilliant
and
sensitive
man
and
brilliant
and
sensitive
woman
,
make
she
feel
they
then
and
choose
they
then
,
then
when
her
resist
sensitive
understanding
have
come
to
be
more
completely
the
whole
filling
in
she
,
then
when
slow
steady
detailed
domination
come
to
be
then
really
fill
then
inside
she
,
then
when
reform
attack
be
change
in
she
to
the
personal
being
that
then
be
mostly
all
the
filling
in
she
.
it
be
never
all
the
filling
in
she
always
she
have
in
she
a
little
of
the
special
reforming
attack
which
be
reaction
in
she
,
quick
reaction
to
thing
and
condition
around
she
and
always
she
have
very
much
in
she
of
the
generalise
moral
attacking
conviction
that
come
from
the
generalisation
of
her
attacking
and
that
make
a
righteous
moral
person
of
she
and
this
be
a
very
common
thing
and
later
there
will
be
endless
discussing
of
the
meaning
of
this
kind
of
moral
being
in
all
kind
of
man
and
woman
,
the
generalise
conviction
and
the
relation
of
it
to
the
concrete
living
,
feeling
,
be
in
they
,
but
this
will
come
later
in
the
beginning
of
the
understanding
of
Alfred
Hersland
that
will
pretty
soon
now
commence
to
be
write
.




Miss
Charles
be
of
the
dependent
independent
kind
of
they
.
these
have
it
in
they
then
to
have
when
they
have
quick
reaction
in
they
that
be
not
a
stirring
from
the
depth
of
they
these
have
it
very
often
that
this
in
they
be
a
violent
attacking
,
often
continuous
bragging
,
often
moral
reform
conviction
,
often
nervous
action
in
they
,
often
incessant
talking
,
incessant
action
,
incessant
attack
in
they
and
this
be
in
those
of
they
that
be
the
pure
thing
of
dependent
independent
being
and
attack
be
not
their
way
at
all
of
win
fighting
.
there
be
some
who
have
in
they
resist
being
and
they
have
in
they
attack
be
as
another
nature
in
they
but
that
be
a
different
thing
from
this
thing
that
I
be
now
describe
,
from
the
being
in
Miss
Charles
.
Miss
Charles
be
completely
dependent
independent
being
,
attack
be
not
her
way
of
win
fighting
,
it
be
resist
as
I
be
say
in
tell
what
she
do
to
win
her
fighting
for
Miss
Dounor
with
Redfern
.
that
be
then
when
she
be
a
young
one
when
she
be
no
long
a
young
one
,
when
her
own
being
be
almost
completely
then
her
filling
,
when
there
be
in
she
the
generalise
moral
emotion
that
come
from
the
reaction
that
fill
she
a
good
deal
in
her
young
living
,
reaction
that
make
attack
be
then
in
she
,
in
she
who
have
in
she
to
have
resist
as
her
way
of
win
fighting
,
that
be
then
what
give
to
she
then
attempt
dominate
every
one
by
attack
and
this
be
a
very
common
thing
in
those
have
in
they
dependent
independent
being
,
this
be
a
very
common
thing
in
they
in
their
young
living
when
their
real
way
of
win
fighting
have
not
come
yet
to
be
in
they
.
I
be
not
say
that
those
have
in
they
dependent
independent
being
can
not
have
in
they
religion
and
moral
or
reform
passion
as
the
expression
of
the
being
in
they
,
there
be
very
many
of
they
who
have
it
in
they
as
I
be
say
,
the
old
man
Hissen
have
it
in
he
and
there
be
very
many
of
they
of
this
kind
of
they
and
there
be
very
many
of
many
various
kind
of
they
of
the
dependent
independent
kind
of
they
that
have
religious
or
virtuous
or
moral
or
reform
passion
in
they
as
the
whole
expression
of
the
being
in
they
but
these
express
this
then
by
resist
fighting
which
be
their
way
of
win
fighting
.
as
I
be
say
there
be
many
have
in
they
dependent
independent
being
,
and
there
be
some
of
they
who
have
it
in
they
only
when
they
be
young
one
and
some
have
it
in
they
very
strongly
in
they
up
to
their
ending
,
there
be
very
many
of
they
who
have
much
attacking
of
quick
react
,
much
attack
in
bragging
,
in
be
quickly
certain
of
everything
,
of
be
very
quick
in
judge
everything
and
these
then
some
of
they
be
mostly
all
fill
up
with
this
kind
of
react
attack
in
they
which
be
not
in
they
their
real
way
of
win
fighting
.
this
be
a
very
important
thing
to
know
in
man
and
woman
,
a
very
important
thing
to
know
in
they
in
know
they
,
in
judging
of
the
power
in
they
of
succeed
or
of
fail
in
their
living
.
the
independent
dependent
kind
in
man
and
woman
can
have
quick
reaction
that
be
completely
poignant
,
that
be
attack
,
in
they
,
that
be
their
real
way
of
win
fighting
.
those
have
in
they
dependent
independent
nature
in
they
have
not
real
power
in
quick
resisting
,
in
attack
fighting
,
many
of
they
have
this
fill
they
all
their
living
,
many
of
they
have
this
fill
they
in
their
young
living
when
their
own
way
of
win
fighting
be
not
yet
develop
in
they
enough
to
fill
they
,
some
have
almost
nothing
of
this
kind
of
act
in
they
some
of
the
dependent
independent
kind
of
they
.
all
this
be
very
important
,
very
very
important
,
sometime
there
will
be
very
very
much

they
before
the
complete
ending
of
their
middle
living
whether
they
will
be
succeed
or
fail
in
their
living
.
in
many
man
and
in
many
woman
,
the
character
in
they
come
completely
to
be
repeat
and
one
can
know
it
completely
in
they
as
in
repeat
it
come
out
of
they
,
one
can
come
to
know
of
they
the
complete
limit
of
the
variation
of
all
repeat
in
they
and
yet
one
,
no
one
can
yet
be
completely
certain
of
they
whether
they
will
be
succeed
or
fail
in
the
whole
living
of
they
.
and
this
be
always
and
always
a
certain
thing
and
always
and
always
it
be
more
exciting
the
knowing
in
one
completely
the
character
of
they
,
the
whole
repeat
in
they
,
the
whole
range
of
be
in

not
then
be

,
some

that
kind
of

have
more
fail
in
they
than
other
of
that
kind
of

and
some
be
very
uncertain
about
whether
there
be
succeed
or
fail
in
they

be
an
uncertain
thing
always
about

be
to
I
all
three
just
now
very
interesting
.
shortly
I
will
try
to
tell
a
little
of
the
way
some
come
to
have
their
certainty
in
they
.
some
build
certainty
up
with
little
and
little
sure
thing
and
make
a
pile
of
they
,
some
be
summary
and
all
embrace
in
the
certain
feeling
they
have
always
in
they
,
some
be
certain
of
almost
anything
,
some
be
hardly
certain
of
anything
,
some
have
to
have
a
complete
system
for
each
certain
feeling
in
they
,
some
have
certainty
in
they
and
they
do
not
know
it
then
in
they
,
some
have
to
have
it
come
out
of
they
as
action
and
then
they
be
not
certain
,
some
be
certain
only
after
there
be
not
any
more
action
in
they
from
that
certain
thing
in
they
,
some
have
some
action
in
they
and
then
slowly
they
know
they
have
certainty
in
they
,
some
have
to
understand
a
thing
to
accept
it
and
then
afterwards
they
have
certainty
in
they
,
some
have
hardly
any
certainty
at
all
ever
really
in
they
,
very
many
have
very
many
certainty
always
in
they
,
some
have
a
sense
of
dramatic
arrangement
to
complete
the
scene
of
the
certain
conviction
the
certain
emotion
they
have
in
they
and
the
complete
scene
change
for
they
with
each
new
certainty
they
have
in
they
.
Certainty
worry
some
and
some
never
have
certainty
as
a
worry
to
they
.
some
have
certainty
by
comparison
,
by
compare
the
thing
they
have
then
with
what
any
other
one
they
be
know
,
hear
,
seeing
be
have
,
some
never
compare
anything
with
anything
in
any
one
,
certainty
be
a
real
thing
in
some
,
in
some
of
such
of
they
as
a
little
pile
they
be
gradually
increase
,
in
some
as
something
that
they
keep
there
inside
they
always
of
the
same
dimension
,
in
some
as
something
they
have
because
they
be
defend
that
thing
,
in
some
as
something
they
have
because
they
be
attack
some
one
for
that
thing
,
in
some
as
something
that
give
to
they
for
that
thing
a
stubborn
feeling
in
they
.
some
need
company
to
keep
their
certainty
from
freeze
or
melt
or
evaporate
or
in
some
way
disappear
.
some
do
not
know
they
have
certainty
in
they
,
do
not
ever
concern
themselves
with
such
a
thing
.
some
have
it
,
some
do
not
have
it
in
they
.
some
have
it
sometimes
,
some
have
it
sometime
in
they
.
some
have
it
and
do
not
know
it
.
some
have
it
and
do
not
know
it
until
it
be
act
.
some
be
not
certain
then
when
it
be
act
that
they
have
it
in
they
.
some
have
it
and
lose
it
while
they
be
speak
.
quite
a
number
have
it
and
lose
it
while
they
be
speak
or
act
.
some
almost
always
almost
have
it
and
they
do
not
have
it
just
at
the
last
moment
before
they
be
certain
.
some
be
very
energetic
to
express
it
but
always
they
do
not
have
it
in
they
.
some
be
energetic
to
express
it
and
they
always
almost
have
it
in
they
.
in
some
it
pass
very
easily
out
of
they
.
very
many
lose
it
every
second
in
their
living
.
some
be
always
think
they
be
lose
this
thing
.
some
need
company
to
keep
any
certainty
in
they
,
some
like
company
around
they
while
they
have
their
own
certainty
inside
they
,
some
need
to
have
the
certainty
in
the
presence
of
the
company
that
they
need
to
have
with
they
always
in
their
living
.
Certainty
and
virtuous
feeling
and
important
feeling
in
man
and
woman
be
very
interesting
.
I
wish
I
could
know
everything
of
any
such
thing
I
would
then
be
a
very
wise
one
to
every
one
.




some
feel
some
kind
of
thing
other
feel
other
kind
of
thing
.
mostly
every
one
feel
some
kind
of
thing
.
the
way
some
thing
touch
some
and
do
not
touch
other
one
,
and
kind
in
man
and
woman
then
,
I
will
now
begin
to
think
some
about
describe
.




it
make
I
a
little
unhappy
that
everything
be
a
little
funny
.
it
make
I
a
little
unhappy
that
many
thing
be
funny
and
peculiar
and
strange
to
I
.
it
make
I
a
little
unhappy
that
everything
and
every
one
be
sometime
a
little
queer
to
I
.
it
make
I
a
little
unhappy
that
every
one
seem
sometime
almost
a
little
crazy
.
it
do
make
I
a
little
unhappy
that
every
one
sometime
be
a
queer
one
to
I
.
it
do
make
I
sometime
a
little
uncertain
,
it
do
sometimes
make
I
very
uncertain
about
everything
and
always
then
it
be
perplex
what
be
certain
what
be
not
certain
,
who
be
a
queer
one
,
what
be
a
funny
thing
for
some
one
to
be
want
or
not
want
or
do
or
not
do
or
think
or
not
think
or
believe
or
not
believe
.




it
do
certainly
make
I
a
little
unhappy
that
every
one
sometime
be
a
queer
one
to
I
.
it
do
certainly
make
I
a
little
unhappy
quite
often
that
every
one
be
really
inside
they
or
in
thinking
,
in
do
or
in
feeling
or
in
believe
a
queer
one
.
it
certainly
do
make
I
an
uncomfortable
one
and
sometimes
a
little
an
unhappy
,
a
gently
almost
melancholy
sulky
one
that
every
one
sometime
be
a
queer
one
.




More
and
more
in
live
each
one
be
certain
that
other
one
have
believe
something
in
they
that
be
almost
an
impossible
thing
for
each
one
to
believe
that
any
other
one
can
really
be
believe
,
any
other
one
who
be
not
a
crazy
one
.
always
more
and
more
in
live
each
one
,
every
one
be
learn
that
other
one

something
,
that
one
think
another
one

something
that
one
only
would
be

if
he
be
a
crazy
one
and
the
other
one
be
not
a
crazy
one
and
the
other
one
be
believe
a
thing
that
to
some
one
be
not
possible
that
any
one
not
a
crazy
one
could
really
be
believe
.
this
be
a
very
common
thing
.
this
be
a
very
common
thing
and
very
many
more
and
more
in
their
living
come
to
a
realising
that
other
one
be
believe
thing
and
it
be
more
and
more
interesting
and
sometimes
very
depressing
to
any
one
of
such
of
they
that
want
to
be
understand
the
being
in
man
and
woman
.
this
then
be
as
I
be
say
a
very
common
thing
that
other
be
believe
thing
that
it
seem
absolutely
impossible
those
one
should
be
believe
and
often
it
be
altogether
puzzle
and
more
and
more
in
live
if
any
one
be
listen
to
other
one
's
thinking
and
believe
,
more
and
more
this
be
bear
in
on
that
one
.
always
it
be
very
interesting
,
sometimes
it
be
surprising
,
sometimes
puzzle
,
sometimes
depressing
,
sometimes
a
very
funny
thing
and
in
every
kind
of
a
way
always
to
one
listen
to
other
's
repeat
always
more
and
more
it
be
bear
in
on
such
a
one
.




as
I
have
be
say
each
one
have
their
own
being
in
they
,
each
one
have
their
own
sensitiveness
to
thing
in
they
,
each
one
be
of
a
kind
of
they
.
of
each
kind
of
they
some
be
more
completely
themselves
than
other
of
their
kind
of
they
and
this
be
now
a
very
long
discussion
of
the
way
being
be
in
some
and
in
other
of
one
kind
of
they
and
then
of
be
in
some
and
in
other
of
all
the
kind
of
they
all
the
kind
there
be
of
man
and
woman
.




disillusionment
in
living
be
find
that
no
one
can
really
ever
be
agree
with
you
completely
in
anything
.
Disillusionment
then
in
living
that
give
to
very
many
then
melancholy
feeling
,
some
despairing
feeling
,
some
resignation
,
some
fairly
cheerful
beginning
and
some
a
forgetting
and
continue
and
some
a
dreary
trickling
weep
some
violent
attacking
and
some
a
letting
themselves
do
anything
,
disillusion
then
be
really
find
,
really
realise
,
really
be
certain
that
no
one
really
can
completely
agree
with
you
in
anything
,
that
,
as
be
very
certain
,
not
,
those
fight
beside
you
or
live
completely
with
you
or
anybody
,
really
,
can
really
be
believe
anything
completely
that
you
be
believe
.
really
realise
this
thing
,
completely
realise
this
thing
be
the
disillusionment
in
live
be
the
beginning
of
be
an
old
man
or
an
old
woman
be
be
no
long
a
young
one
no
long
a
young
man
or
a
young
woman
no
long
a
grow
old
young
man
or
grow
old
young
woman
.
this
be
then
what
every
one
always
have
be
mean
by
live
bringing
disillusion
.
this
be
the
real
thing
of
disillusion
that
no
one
,
not
any
one
really
be
believe
,
see
,
understanding
,
think
anything
as
you
be
think
,
believe
,
see
,
understand
such
a
thing
.
this
be
then
what
disillusion
be
from
live
and
slowly
then
after
fail
again
and
again
in
change
some
one
,
after
find
that
some
one
that
have
be
fight
for
something
,
that
every
one
that
have
be
fight
something
beside
you
for
a
long
time
that
each
one
of
they
split
off
from
you
somewhere
and
you
must
join
on
with
new
one
or
go
on
all
alone
then
or
be
a
disillusioned
one
who
be
not
any
long
then
a
young
one
.
this
be
then
disillusionment
in
living
and
sometime
in
the
history
of
David
Hersland
the
young
son
in
the
Hersland
family
live
then
in
a
part
of
Gossols
where
they
alone
of
rich
people
be
live
there
will
be
completely
a
history
of
the
disillusionment
of
such
a
realising
and
the
die
then
of
that
one
,
of
young
David
Hersland
then
.




this
be
then
complete
disillusionment
in
living
,
the
complete
realisation
that
no
one
can
believe
as
you
do
about
anything
,
so
not
really
any
single
one
and
to
some
as
I
be
say
this
be
a
sad
thing
,
to
mostly
every
one
it
be
sometime
a
shocking
thing
,
sometimes
a
shocking
thing
,
sometime
a
real
shock
to
they
,
to
mostly
every
one
a
thing
that
only
very
slowly
with
constant
repetition
be
really
a
complete
certain
thing
inside
to
give
to
they
the
being
that
be
no
long
in
they
really
young
being
.
this
be
then
the
real
meaning
of
not
be
any
long
a
young
one
in
living
,
the
complete
realise
that
not
any
one
realty
can
believe
what
any
other
one
be
believe
and
some
there
be
,
enough
of
they
,
who
never
have
completely
such
a
realisation
,
they
be
always
hope
to
find
she
or
he
,
they
be
always
change
she
or
he
to
fit
they
,
they
be
always
look
,
they
be
always
forget
fail
or
explain
it
by
something
,
they
be
always
go
on
and
on
in
try
.
there
be
a
very
great
many
of
they
who
be
this
way
to
their
ending
.
there
be
a
very
great
many
who
be
this
way
almost
to
their
very
ending
,
there
be
a
great
many
man
and
woman
who
have
sometime
in
they
in
their
live
complete
disillusion
.




there
be
then
as
I
be
say
complete
disillusion
in
living
,
the
realising
,
completely
realise
that
not
any
one
,
not
one
fight
for
the
same
thinking
and
believe
as
the
other
,
not
any
one
have
the
same
believing
in
she
or
in
he
that
any
other
one
have
in
they
and
it
come
then
sometime
to
most
every
one
to
be
realise
with
feel
this
thing
and
then
they
often
stop
have
friendly
feeling
and
then
often
they
begin
again
but
it
be
then
a
different
thing
between
they
,
they
be
old
then
and
not
young
then
in
their
feeling
.




young
one
sometimes
think
they
have
it
in
they
,
this
thing
,
some
young
one
kill
themselves
then
,
stop
live
then
,
this
be
often
happen
,
young
one
sometimes
,
very
often
even
,
think
they
have
in
they
this
thing
but
they
do
not
have
it
in
they
,
mostly
not
any
young
one
,
as
a
complete
realisation
,
this
thing
,
they
have
it
in
they
and
it
be
sometimes
,
very
often
then
an
agony
to
they
,
some
of
they
kill
themselves
or
be
kill
then
,
but
really
mostly
not
any
of
they
have
really
realise
the
thing
,
they
may
be
dead
from
this
thing
,
they
have
not
realise
the
thing
,
it
have
be
an
awful
agony
in
they
,
they
have
not
really
grasp
the
thing
as
have
general
human
meaning
,
it
have
be
a
shock
to
they
,
it
may
perhaps
even
have
kill
completely
very
completely
some
of
they
,
mostly
then
a
young
one
have
not
really
such
a
thing
in
they
,
this
be
pretty
nearly
certain
,
later
there
will
be
much
description
of
disillusionment
in
the
being
of
David
Hersland
who
be
always
in
his
living
as
I
be
say
try
to
be
certain
from
day
to
day
in
his
living
what
there
be
in
living
that
could
make
it
for
he
a
completely
necessary
thing
.




this
be
then
a
very
little
description
of
feel
disillusionment
in
living
.
there
be
this
thing
then
there
be
the
moment
and
a
very
complete
moment
to
those
that
have
have
it
when
something
they
have
buy
or
make
or
love
or
be
be
a
thing
that
they
be
afraid
,
almost
certain
,
very
tearful
that
no
one
will
think
it
a
nice
thing
and
then
some
one
like
that
thing
and
this
then
be
a
very
wonderful
feeling
to
know
that
some
one
really
appreciate
the
thing
.
this
be
a
very
wonderful
thing
,
this
be
a
thing
which
I
will
now
be
illustrate
.




disillusionment
in
live
be
the
finding
out
nobody
agree
with
you
not
those
that
be
and
be
fight
with
you
.
disillusionment
in
live
be
the
finding
out
nobody
agree
with
you
not
those
that
be
fight
for
you
.
complete
disillusionment
be
when
you
realise
that
no
one
can
for
they
ca
n't
change
.
the
amount
they
agree
be
important
to
you
until
the
amount
they
do
not
agree
with
you
be
completely
realise
by
you
.
then
you
say
you
will
write
for
yourself
and
stranger
,
you
will
be
for
yourself
and
stranger
and
this
then
make
an
old
man
or
an
old
woman
of
you
.




this
be
then
one
thing
,
another
thing
be
the
perfect
joy
of
find
some
one
,
any
one
really
like
something
you
be
like
,
make
,
do
,
be
.
this
be
another
thing
and
a
very
pleasant
thing
,
sometimes
not
a
pleasant
thing
at
all
.
that
depend
on
many
thing
,
on
some
thing
.




it
be
a
very
strange
feeling
when
one
be
love
a
clock
that
be
to
every
one
of
your
class
of
live
an
ugly
and
a
foolish
one
and
one
really
like
such
a
thing
and
like
it
very
much
and
like
it
be
a
serious
thing
,
or
one
like
a
colored
handkerchief
that
be
very
gay
and
every
one
of
your
kind
of
living
think
it
a
very
ugly
or
a
foolish
thing
and
think
you
like
it
because
it
be
a
funny
thing
to
like
it
and
you
like
it
with
a
serious
feeling
,
or
you
like
eat
something
and
like
it
be
a
childish
thing
to
every
one
or
you
like
something
that
be
a
dirty
thing
and
no
one
can
really
like
that
thing
or
you
write
a
hook
and
while
you
write
it
you
be
ashamed
for
every
one
must
think
you
be
a
silly
or
a
crazy
one
and
yet
you
write
it
and
you
be
ashamed
,
you
know
you
will
be
laugh
at
or
pity
by
every
one
and
you
have
a
queer
feeling
and
you
be
not
very
certain
and
you
go
on
writing
.
then
some
one
say
yes
to
it
,
to
something
you
be
like
,
or
do
or
make
and
then
never
again
can
you
have
completely
such
a
feeling
of
be
afraid
and
ashamed
that
you
have
then
when
you
be
write
or
like
the
thing
and
not
any
one
have
say
yes
about
the
thing
.
in
a
way
it
be
a
very
difficult
thing
to
like
anything
,
to
do
anything
.
you
can
never
have
again
either
about
something
you
have
do
or
about
something
any
one
else
have
do
the
same
complete
feeling
if
some
one
else
besides
the
first
one
see
it
,
some
other
one
if
you
have
make
it
,
yourself
if
you
have
understand
something
,
you
can
never
again
have
the
complete
feeling
of
recognition
that
you
have
then
.
you
can
have
very
many
kind
of
feeling
you
can
only
alone
and
with
the
first
one
have
the
perfect
feeling
of
not
be
almost
completely
fill
with
be
ashamed
and
afraid
to
show
something
to
like
something
with
a
really
serious
feeling
.




I
have
not
be
very
clear
in
this
telling
,
it
will
be
clear
in
the
description
of
master
and
school
in
living
and
in
working
,
and
in
painting
and
in
writing
and
in
everything
.




it
be
a
very
queer
thing
this
not
agree
with
any
one
.
it
would
seem
that
where
we
be
each
of
we
always
tell
and
repeat
and
explain
and
do
it
again
and
again
that
some
one
would
really
understand
what
the
other
one
be
always
repeat
.
but
in
loving
,
in
work
,
in
everything
it
be
always
the
same
thing
.
in
love
some
one
be
jealous
,
really
jealous
and
it
would
seem
an
impossible
thing
to
the
one
not
understand
that
the
other
one
could
have
about
such
a
thing
a
jealous
feeling
and
they
have
it
and
they
suffer
and
they
weep
and
sorrow
in
it
and
the
other
one
can
not
believe
it
,
they
can
not
believe
the
other
one
can
really
mean
it
and
sometime
the
other
one
perhaps
come
to
realise
it
that
the
other
one
can
really
suffer
in
it
and
then
later
that
one
try
to
reassure
the
other
one
the
one
that
be
then
suffer
about
that
thing
and
the
other
one
the
one
that
be
receive
such
reassuring
say
then
,
do
you
think
I
ever
could
believe
this
thing
,
no
I
have
no
fear
of
such
a
thing
,
and
it
be
all
puzzle
,
to
have
one
kind
of
feeling
,
a
jealous
feeling
,
and
not
have
a
fear
in
they
that
the
other
one
do
not
want
they
,
it
be
a
very
mix
thing
and
over
and
over
again
when
you
be
certain
it
be
a
whole
one
some
one
,
one
must
begin
again
and
again
and
the
only
thing
that
be
a
help
to
one
be
that
there
be
really
so
little
fundamental
change
in
any
one
and
always
every
one
be
repeat
big
piece
of
they
and
so
sometime
perhaps
some
one
will
know
something
and
I
certainly
would
like
very
much
to
be
that
one
and
so
now
to
begin
.




all
this
lead
again
to
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
this
then
will
be
soon
now
a
description
of
difference
in
man
and
woman
morally
and
intellectually
in
they
between
concrete
acting
,
think
and
feel
in
they
and
generalise
acting
,
think
and
feel
in
they
.




many
woman
and
man
have
a
completely
sure
feeling
in
they
.
many
man
and
woman
have
certain
feeling
with
something
inside
they
.




many
have
a
very
certain
feeling
about
something
inside
they
.
many
need
company
for
it
,
this
be
very
common
,
many
need
a
measure
for
it
,
this
will
need
explain
,
some
need
drama
to
support
it
,
some
need
lie
to
help
it
,
some
be
not
let
their
right
hand
know
what
their
left
hand
be
do
with
it
,
some
love
it
,
some
hate
it
,
some
never
be
very
certain
they
really
have
it
,
some
only
think
they
love
it
,
some
like
the
feeling
of
love
it
they
would
have
if
they
could
have
it
.
some
have
a
feeling
they
would
have
it
if
they
have
their
life
to
live
over
again
and
they
sigh
about
it
.
certain
feeling
in
man
and
woman
be
very
interesting
.




as
I
be
say
in
many
there
be
the
slow
react
,
slow
express
being
that
come
more
and
more
in
their
living
to
determine
they
.
there
be
in
many
of
such
one
aspiration
and
conviction
due
to
quick
reaction
to
other
around
they
,
to
book
they
be
read
,
to
the
family
tradition
,
to
the
spirit
of
the
age
in
educating
,
in
believing
,
to
the
lack
of
power
of
articulate
the
being
in
they
that
make
they
need
then
to
be
fill
full
with
other
reaction
in
they
so
that
they
will
then
have
something
.
some
of
such
of
they
spend
all
their
living
in
adjust
the
being
that
come
to
active
condition
inside
they
in
their
living
to
the
being
they
have
come
to
be
in
live
from
all
be
that
have
be
affect
they
in
all
their
living
,
some
of
such
of
they
want
a
little
in
they
to
create
their
living
from
the
being
inside
they
and
they
have
not
the
power
in
they
for
this
thing
,
they
go
on
then
live
the
being
of
even
one
that
have
be
make
they
.
it
be
a
wonderful
thing
how
very
much
it
have
to
be
in
one
,
how
it
need
to
be
so
strongly
in
one
anything
,
how
much
it
need
to
be
in
one
anything
so
that
thing
be
a
thing
that
come
then
to
be
do
,
it
be
a
wonderful
thing
how
very
much
it
need
to
be
in
one
anything
,
any
little
any
big

often
that
he
do
many
thing
,
when
he
be
a
young
man
when
he
be
an
old
man
,
when
he
be
an
old
man
.
some
kind
of
young
man
do
thing
because
they
be
so
good
then
they
want
every
one
to
be
wise
enough
to
take
care
of
themselves
and
so
they
do
some
thing
to
they
.
this
be
very
common
and
these
then
be
very
often
good
enough
kind
of
young
man
who
be
very
good
man
in
their
living
.
there
will
soon
be
a
little
description
of
one
of
they
.
there
be
then
very
many
man
and
there
be
then
from
the
generalise
virtue
and
concrete
action
that
be
from
the
nature
of
they
that
might
make
one
think
they
be
hypocrite
in
living
but
they
be
not
although
certainly
there
be
in
live
some
man
want
to
deceive
other
man
but
this
be
not
true
of
this
kind
of
they
.
one
of
such
of
these
kind
of
they
have
a
little
boy
and
this
one
,
the
little
son
want
to
make
a
collection
of
butterfly
and
beetle
and
it
be
all
exciting
to
he
and
it
be
all
arrange
then
and
then
the
father
say
to
the
son
you
be
certain
this
be
not
a
cruel
thing
that
you
be
want
to
be
do
,
kill
thing
to
make
collection
of
they
,
and
the
son
be
very
disturb
then
and
they
talk
about
it
together
the
two
of
they
and
more
and
more
they
talk
about
it
then
and
then
at
last
the
boy
be
convinced
it
be
a
cruel
thing
and
he
say
he
would
not
do
it
and
his
father
say
the
little
boy
be
a
noble
boy
to
give
up
pleasure
when
it
be
a
cruel
one
.
the
boy
go
to
bed
then
and
then
the
father
when
he
get
up
in
the
early
morning
see
a
wonderfully
beautiful
moth
in
the
room
and
he
catch
he
and
he
kill
he
and
he
pin
hint
and
he
wake
up
his
son
then
and
show
it
to
he
and
he
say
to
he
"

good
father
I
be
to
have
catch
and
kill
this
one
,
"
the
boy
be
all
mix
up
inside
he
and
then
he
say
he
would
go
on
with
his
collecting
and
that
be
all
there
be
then
of
discuss
and
this
be
a
little
description
of
something
that
happen
once
and
it
be
very
interesting
.




it
happen
very
often
that
a
man
have
it
in
he
,
that
he
do
thing
,
that
he
do
something
,
that
he
do
many
thing
when
he
be
a
young
man
and
an
old
man
and
an
old
man
,
that
he
feel
always
in
a
way
about
everything
,
that
he
be
a
good
enough
man
in
living
,
that
he
be
a
very
good
man
.




some
kind
of
young
man
do
thing
with
a
feeling
that
they
be
teach
people
to
be
strong
and
good
one
and
to
take
care
of
themselves
and
they
be
do
something
and
almost
every
one
would
say
it
be
a
very
wicked
thing
this
thing
they
be
do
and
in
some
it
make
of
they
a
very
unpleasant
person
and
some
of
such
of
they
be
not
the
least
bit
unpleasant
one
because
they
have
no
mixing
between
the
generalise
conception
and
the
concrete
action
.
many
old
man
do
thing
to
keep
themselves
warm
then
,
when
they
be
old
one
and
they
be
need
to
be
warm
then
.
some
of
they
be
cold
then
and
they
need
to
be
warm
then
and
need
to
be
warm
up
then
,
and
some
be
shrink
away
from
the
outside
of
they
then
when
they
be
old
man
and
need
some
one
to
oil
they
and
they
do
concrete
action
then
and
their
generalise
sensation
be
keep
warm
then
,
their
generalise
intention
be
of
keep
warm
then
and
this
be
all
very
interesting
and
always
if
Alfred
Hersland
and
Mr.
Herman
Dehning
and
George
Dehning
come
to
be
clear
one
in
this
describe
always
then
sometime
many
will
be
completely
understand
this
being
I
be
now
understand
,
now
completely
understanding
.




there
be
very
many
kind
of
man
.
in
each
kind
of
they
there
be
some
of
they
who
have
it
in
they
to
have
the
being
in
they
so
that
the
concrete
thing
they
be
do
be
very
different
from
the
generalise
feeling
in
they
of
what
it
be
right
and
decent
and
good
and
bad
to
be
do
.
there
be
very
many
kind
of
man
,
quite
a
number
of
kind
of
they
and
of
each
kind
of
they
there
be
always
very
great
many
million
of
they
always
live
and
very
many
million
of
they
always
have
the
being
in
they
,
very
many
million
of
each
kind
of
they
that
the
be
in
they
be
so
in
they
that
the
concrete
action
,
feeling
in
they
be
very
different
in
they
from
the
generalise
feeling
strongly
in
they
and
this
be
true
of
many
of
all
the
kind
there
be
of
man
and
these
then
may
be
sentimental
from
this
thing
,
and
it
may
be
very
simply
in
they
,
they
may
be
very
unpleasant
then
from
this
thing
and
they
may
not
be
unpleasant
unpleasant
to
hardly
any
one
from
this
thing
and
this
be
something
that
in
all
the
living
of
every
one
of
they
be
interesting
in
they
,
in
all
the
living
of
a
great
many
man
be
interesting
to
they
.




there
be
so
many
of
they
,
each
kind
of
they
do
it
differently
from
the
other
kind
of
they
,
each
one
of
a
kind
of
they
do
it
differently
from
the
other
of
that
kind
of
they
and
in
some
it
be
more
in
the
thinking
than
the
feeling
,
in
some
more
in
act
than
in
thinking
and
in
feeling
,
it
be
a
very
complete
thing
to
be
understanding
,
each
one
have
in
he
his
own
being
,
each
one
of
they
have
in
he
his
own
way
of
repeat
this
thing
in
he
,
each
one
have
in
he
the
way
of
have
this
in
he
that
his
kind
of
man
have
it
in
they
.
woman
have
it
in
they
,
that
will
come
later
in
writing
.




it
happen
then
very
often
that
a
man
have
it
in
he
that
he
do
something
and
that
thing
be
a
concrete
acting
and
no
one
would
ever
think
that
man
have
do
that
thing
and
that
man
be
a
good
man
,
and
he
do
it
very
often
.




it
happen
very
often
that
a
man
do
something
and
he
do
it
very
often
and
it
be
an
awful
shock
to
he
if
sometime
some
one
tell
it
to
he
and
as
I
be
say
one
of
such
of
they
be
a
paralytic
from
be
tell
it
by
one
of
his
child
in
his
later
living
and
always
such
a
man
do
a
thing
and
it
be
a
concrete
thing
and
as
a
man
he
have
many
concrete
action
in
he
and
these
he
do
very
often
and
in
his
living
,
in
his
feeling
a
complete
generalise
sincere
feeling
always
completely
he
,
not
a
sentimental
thing
,
a
real
thing
in
he
by
which
he
very
often
be
completely
live
and
he
do
a
concrete
thing
and
do
it
very
often
do
many
of
they
that
have
no
place
in
his
generalised
sincere
feeling
and
sometimes
it
be
tell
to
he
and
he
can
be
kill
then
and
almost
by
hear
this
thing
say
of
he
so
strongly
be
it
in
he
that
he
be
not
do
that
concrete
thing
,
that
he
have
never
do
that
thing
.
these
then
this
kind
of
they
be
not
self
-
righteous
man
who
think
the
way
they
do
thing
should
be
the
way
of
all
man
,
they
be
not
man
like
those
I
be
describe
who
make
an
ideal
out
of
the
weakness
in
they
,
they
be
the
man
they
very
ordinary
man
who
have
it
in
they
to
believe
that
that
they
have
inside
they
in
their
living
in
their
feeling
in
their
thinking
what
all
good
decent
man
have
in
they
in
their
thinking
,
in
their
living
,
in
their
feeling
and
this
be
a
generalise
conviction
of
themselves
to
themselves
always
in
they
,
all
their
living
,
and
they
see
themselves
in
their
living
,
and
their
being
and
their
thinking
,
in
their
feeling
as
good
enough
man
,
good
enough
father
,
good
enough
husband
,
good
enough
citizen
,
and
always
they
be
see
themselves
as
each
of
they
and
so
they
see
all
of
their
concrete
action
and
sometimes
and
very
often
they
be
do
something
,
that
thing
they
do
very
often
and
that
thing
be
a
thing
not
any
man
who
be
a
good
enough
man
would
be
do
and
mostly
a
very
great
many
of
they
of
these
who
be
to
themselves
completely
good
enough
man
be
very
very
often
do
such
a
thing
and
it
be
to
they
when
they
be
young
one
and
a
little
old
one
that
they
be
do
it
to
be
instruct
to
other
so
that
other
one
will
know
something
and
when
they
be
old
one
they
do
it
then
because
in
their
realler
feeling
they
know
thing
be
not
so
important
as
they
once
be
think
they
be
to
they
and
every
one
,
and
then
when
they
be
old
one
they
need
any
way
there
be
that
can
warm
they
and
always
to
themselves
they
be
the
generalised
good
enough
man
and
always
then
they
be
do
very
often
a
thing
something
that
be
not
include
in
such
a
generalisation
and
then
sometimes
it
be
tell
to
they
,
it
come
to
they
,
very
many
never
have
it
bring
in
to
they
a
very
great
many
of
they
,
some
of
they
have
it
bring
in
to
they
and
some
of
such
of
they
have
their
life
break
be
make
sick
man
then
and
all
this
be
very
common
,
this
be
the
being
in
very
many
million
of
every
kind
of
man
and
this
be
interesting
and
this
be
soon
to
be
a
history
of
Alfred
Hersland
and
his
connection
with
the
family
of
Mr.
Henry
Dehning
.




it
be
very
perplexing
the
generalise
conception
which
be
of
virtue
in
many
man
and
many
woman
and
the
concrete
feeling
that
be
not
of
virtue
in
they
.
this
be
perplexing
,
one
come
then
to
understand
this
thing
as
a
complete
thing
and
then
always
it
be
a
shock
to
that
one
as
in
live
case
of
this
always
be
be
thrust
upon
that
one
.
some
one
build
up
conviction
from
some
other
one
,
some
know
then
that
they
do
not
believe
that
thing
and
some
do
it
then
because
it
be
a
pleasant
thing
,
some
do
it
to
please
some
one
,
some
begin
to
believe
it
and
then
they
lose
it
and
they
do
n't
say
anything
,
some
begin
not
to
believe
and
then
they
come
when
they
be
old
one
to
believe
what
they
begin
with
as
not
believe
but
say
it
to
please
some
one
,
very
many
then
in
very
many
way
have
other
one
conviction
come
to
be
the
determine
frame
for
they
,
some
believe
it
then
,
some
who
be
not
believe
it
then
,
very
many
who
do
not
know
then
whether
they
do
or
do
not
believe
that
thing
.
this
be
a
common
thing
,
very
many
man
do
it
,
very
many
man
do
it
because
they
be
in
it
,
very
many
man
do
it
,
for
very
many
woman
,
for
some
woman
,
very
many
man
do
it
for
man
and
for
woman
,
and
for
other
woman
,
and
for
child
,
very
many
do
it
for
very
many
,
very
many
do
it
for
some
,
very
many
do
it

very
intimately
Plymouth
Brethren
woman
.
she
have
know
other
woman
but
it
have
not
happen
to
she
to
have
know
about
this
thing
.
she
be
a
child
of
Plymouth
Brethren
and
she
think
that
what
happen
to
all
woman
every
month
only
happen
to
Plymouth
Brethren
woman
,
woman
have
that
religion
,
she
be
twenty
eight
year
old
when
she
learn
that
it
happen
to
every
kind
of
woman
.
this
be
not
an
astonishing
thing
that
she
should
have
believe
this
thing
.
every
one
mostly
always
be
think
feel
believe
know
something
that
be
to
every
one
else
when
they
know
it
about
they
a
thing
no
one
that
be
not
a
crazy
one
would
be
think
feel
believe
or
know
.
mostly
every
one
can
be
content
with
be
certain
that
the
other
one
never
do
believe
that
thing
.




there
be
a
very
great
many
man
and
woman
and
they
be
very
well
educate
intelligent
one
who
be
very
certain
that
a
river
can
not
flow
north
because
water
can
never
be
go
up
hill
in
a
natural
way
of
flow
.
they
be
very
certain
of
this
thing
and
when
one
understand
it
about
they
,
some
of
they
,
it
be
astonishing
that
they
can
really
be
think
such
a
thing
and
sometimes
it
take
almost
a
quarrelling
to
make
they
realise
that
a
river
can
how
north
and
that
north
be
not
go
up
hill
.
they
be
know
then
that
north
be
not
go
up
hill
when
they
think
of
it
as
travel
,
they
think
of
north
as
up
hill
when
they
think
of
it
as
water
flow
and
this
be
very
common
.
such
thing
then
be
very
common
,
every
kind
of
way
there
ever
can
be
of
think
feel
believe
know
do
be
common
and
the
way
mostly
every
one
have
it
in
they
the
way
one
have
it
in
they
of
know
feeling
,
believe
thinking
do
be
a
thing
that
every
one
know
that
one
if
they
really
think
that
one
be
really
believe
feeling
thinking
know
do
as
that
one
really
be
,
be
and
will
be
think
feeling
do
believe
knowing
would
be
think
that
one
a
crazy
one
,
that
one
a
fool
,
that
one
a
liar
and
a
bad
one
,
would
be
afraid
or
hale
or
despise
or
pity
that
one
or
completely
puzzle
by
that
one
.
mostly
then
no
one
really
be
ever
believe
any
other
one
really
can
be
believe
feel
thinking
do
know
,
the
thing
the
other
one
really
be
feel
believe
thinking
do
know
.




kind
of
be
in
woman
and
in
man
be
a
peculiar
thing
,
that
there
be
always
the
same
kind
of
they
exist
be
a
peculiar
thing
.
that
there
be
so
very
many
always
exist
of
each
kind
of
they
be
a
peculiar
thing
.
that
there
be
so
very
many
always
exist
of
every
kind
of
they
be
a
peculiar
thing
.
when
one
see
a
very
great
many
of
any
thing
,
if
it
be
jewel
,
or
exotic
fruit
or
old
furniture
or
any
precious
thing
in
any
place
then
always
one
be
think
they
must
be
cheap
there
,
they
have
so
many
of
they
it
must
be
that
they
be
sell
they
cheap
they
have
so
many
of
they
and
one
mostly
always
have
this
feeling
and
this
be
the
kind
of
feel
very
many
man
and
woman
have
about
man
and
woman
,
there
be
so
many
they
must
be
cheap
thing
and
one
can
use
they
any
way
one
can
be
want
they
without
any
thinking
about
they
and
this
be
a
very
natural
thing
and
then
when
it
be
a
store
and
one
want
to
buy
the
rare
thing
or
something
where
they
have
so
many
of
they
and
then
one
find
out
one
have
to
pay
they
the
same
as
in
the
store
where
there
be
only
a
few
of
these
thing
that
they
have
for
selling
and
that
be
always
astonishing
,
that
be
to
some
always
a
certain
shock
to
they
and
this
be
now
begin
to
be
very
true
of
man
and
woman
everywhere
where
man
and
woman
be
live
,
they
come
just
as
high
where
there
be
a
great
many
of
they
as
where
there
be
a
few
of
they
.
but
this
be
another
thing
,
always
to
my
feeling
there
be
a
very
great
many
man
and
woman
always
exist
,
always

my
feeling

one
of
they
be
an
expensive
thing
to
be
learn
to
be
understanding

now
I
begin
again
.

will
now

writing
about

always
more
or
less
do
the

not
dead
then
everybody
be
of
this
then
very
certain
and
always
dead
be
dead
be
the
simply
instinctive
live
in
these
man
then
and
very
many
of
these
then
have
it
in
they
that
they
be
those
have
concrete
action
that
be
very
often
very
different
from
what
these
be
certain
all
decent
man
and
they
themselves
be
always
do
,
these
then
can
as
I
be
say
kill
the
butterfly
in
the
morning
because
they
be
so
good
to
their
son
when
in
the
evening
just
before
they
completely
persuade
he
the
son
that
kill
butterfly
be
a
cruel
action
no
good
man
should
be
do
,
and
some
of
such
of
they
as
I
be
say
can
have
it
in
they
that
they
have
do
something
very
often
and
later
in
their
living
a
daughter
can
write
to
they
that
what
that
daughter
be
do
that
be
a
disgrace
to
the
family
then
come
to
be
a
way
of
do
from
the
thing
the
father
be
often
show
to
she
when
she
be
a
young
one
and
such
a
one
then
can
have
a
paralytic
stroke
from
the
shock
of
realisation
,
of
dead
be
dead
and
that
by
religion
to
his
saying
that
dead
be
not
dead
and
of
the
difference
in
he
of
general
and
concrete
conviction
.




there
be
a
very
great
many
then
that
have
as
a
concrete
realisation
always
in
they
that
dead
be
dead
,
that
thing
be
as
they
see
they
,
that
they
be
do
thing
when
they
be
do
they
and
these
then
can
have
it
in
they
that
they
realise
as
a
generalisation
that
to
be
dead
be
not
to
be
so
very
really
dead
,
that
thing
be
not
perhaps
what
they
be
to
they
,
that
they
be
live
with
other
man
around
they
who
have
it
in
they
to
have
religion
in
they
which
be
certain
that
to
be
dead
be
not
to
be
a
really
dead
one
and
these
then
have
it
in
they
to
equilibrate
themselves
to
this
opinion
,
the
opinion
the
conviction
of
be
not
dead
when
they
be
dead
of
have
virtue
in
they
when
they
be
not
do
any
good
thing
of
never
do
anything
any
good
man
can
not
be
do
when
really
they
be
do
that
thing
very
often
and
this
be
a
generalised
sense
in
they
all
through
their
living
and
always
then
they
be
really
live
the
dead
be
dead
live
as
a
concrete
living
.
to
some
have
this
equilibrating
,
this
generalise
conception
be
only
sentimental
in
they
,
in
some
it
be
a
way
of
be
important
to
themselves
inside
they
to
make
it
strongly
in
they
this
generalise
equilibration
in
they
,
to
very
many
it
be
a
very
simple
thing
of
be
like
every
one
for
every
one
to
mostly
any
one
be
like
this
in
their
living
be
be
of
a
conviction
that
dead
be
not
really
dead
,
that
good
be
progress
,
that
every
one
be
a
good
one
in
some
way
of
endeavor
.
this
be
a
very
common
thing
then
and
always
and
always
it
will
in
its
simple
in
its
complicated
form
will
be
interesting
,
will
be
illuminate
in
the
being
and
the
living
of
Alfred
Hersland
and
Mr.
Herman
Dehning
and
his
son
George
Dehning
.




explain
one
vice
by
one
virtue
be
one
way
of
feeling
,
think
,
believe
,
know
,
think
believe
,
feel
,
know
oneself
inside
one
in
living
.
this
be
a
very
different
thing
from
that
which
I
have
be
just
describe
as
sometimes
perplex
,
as
very
common
,
the
generalise
conception
which
be
of
virtue
in
many
man
and
many
woman
and
the
concrete
feeling
and
act
that
be
not
of
virtue
in
they
.
explain
one
vice
by
one
virtue
then
be
one
way
of
feel
think
know
believe
the
be
inside
in
one
different
from
that
I
have
be
just
describe
,
different
from
the
being
in
Redfern
which
I
be
once
describe
which
be
as
I
be
then
say
be
an
explain
one
virtue
by
the
vice
in
they
.
there
be
then
explain
one
virtue
by
one
vice
and
other
then
explain
their
vice
by
the
virtue
in
they
.
there
be
certainly
a
very
great
many
way
of
have
virtuous
feeling
in
they
in
man
and
woman
and
yet
after
all
there
be
not
such
a
very
great
many
way
of
they
,
there
be
a
good
many
way
though
and
this
be
now
some
more
description
of
virtuous
feeling
,
be
,
think
,
know
believe
,
in
man
and
in
woman
.
later
then
there
will
be
very
much
discussion
of
different
kind
of
sensibility
and
way
of
have
it
in
they
in
man
and
woman
.




a
man
have
it
in
he
to
have
the
generalise
conviction
of
good
being
as
completely
he
and
the
concrete
acting
of
be
a
mean
spirited
and
tyrannical
man
in
living
and
always
take
everything
he
can
that
it
be
not
dangerous
for
he
to
be
take
and
never
give
anything
that
be
not
take
from
he
,
one
of
such
a
kind
of
they
can
have
it
in
he
to
be
always
speak
and
very
often
in
his
talking
it
come
out
again
and
again
that
he
be
a
good
man
,
and
a
noble
man
,
and
a
very
angry
one
whenever
any
one
ever
be
do
anything
that
he
know
of
they
that
be
not
a
fine
action
a
good
generous
way
of
do
,
think
,
believe
,
feeling
and
sometime
perhaps
some
one
might
say
to
he
a
sister
-
in
-
law
or
a
brother
-
in
-
law
of
he
,
of
such
a
one
,
why
do
you
do
that
mean
thing
to
that
man
,
and
he
would
then
say
to
such
a
one
,
because
he
be
such
a
mean
man
he
deserve
all
I
could
give
he
to
get
the
good
of
he
,
and
then
the
brother
-
in
-
law
or
the
sister
-
in
-
law
might
say
then
to
he
,
but
you
say
you
be
such
an
awfully
good
man
how
could
such
a
good
man
as
you
be
do
such
a
mean
thing
to
any
one
,
and
then
such
a
one
would
be
answer
,
a
good
man
could
do
such
a
thing
to
another
mean
man
,
do
n't
I
do
that
thing
to
that
mean
kind
of
a
man
and
do
n't
you
know
do
n't
every
one
always
know
it
in
he
that
I
be
a
good
man
,
you
know
that
,
and
then
there
would
be
no
answer
that
could
touch
he
.
such
man
be
very
common
,
they
be
very
often
not
full
up
with
religion
these
be
good
man
that
be
the
conviction
that
be
the
feeling
of
themselves
inside
they
to
themselves
in
they
,
that
be
the
complete
be
in
they
to
themselves
completely
in
all
the
believe
,
feeling
,
do
,
think
ever
in
they
.
these
then
be
not
be
good
in
the
name
of
god
or
in
the
conviction
of
religion
,
they
never
do
a
bad
thing
in
secret
as
some
do
who
be
good
man
in
the
name
of
religion
or
virtue
or
of
god
can
do
it
and
then
not
be
let
their
right
hand
know
what
their
left
hand
be
do
,
no
,
such
a
one
as
I
have
be
describe
have
it
as
a
complete
generalise
conviction
his
own
virtue
as
he
and
be
himself
completely
constantly
himself
to
himself
in
his
being
,
have
the
complete
thing
of
be
important
in
all
live
from
the
complete
realisation
that
he
be
completely
a
good
noble
generous
human
being
and
such
a
one
never
have
any
need
of
any
secret
action
,
such
a
one
tell
every
one
everything
he
do
in
living
,
any
mean
thing
,
any
bad
thing
,
anything
,
for
always
it
be
there
completely
in
he
that
he
do
this
thing
and
a
good
man
could
,
would
,
do
do
that
thing
,
he
do
that
thing
,
he
a
good
man
who
never
do
anything
he
should
not
be
do
do
this
thing
do
something
and
so
it
be
right
for
he
to
do
that
thing
and
he
can
tell
it
as
a
thing
he
be
proud
to
do
in
living
,
everything
he
ever
do
in
living
be
a
thing
he
be
proud
to
be
tell
to
every
one
,
he
be
completely
a
good
man
,
he
have
no
need
of
secret
living
,
everything
he
be
ever
do
be
a
thing
he
can
be
boast
he
be
do
for
he
be
completely
a
good
man
,
he
be
not
a
good
man
in
the
name
of
religion
of
god
or
of
his
country
or
of
his
profession
,
he
be
a
good
man
completely
a
good
one
to
himself
inside
he
,
that
be
important
be
in
he
,
that
be
his
be
to
himself
inside
he
,
that
be
all
be
in
he
,
he
be
the
complete
thing
of
a
generalise
conviction
of
virtuous
being
.




all
these
kind
of
way
then
of
have
virtuous
being
,
feeling
,
think
,
believe
,
do
,
know
inside
in
one
be
very
interesting
to
be
describe
,
study
,
realise
,
understanding
.
it
make
then
one
way
of
realise
kind
in
man
and
woman
the
realising
of
the
different
way
different
one
have
virtuous
feeling
in
they
.
I
have
already
be
describe
some
of
they
,
I
will
now
be
describe
other
of
they
.




many
have
virtuous
feeling
from
something
inside
they
.
many
need
company
to
have
it
,
this
be
very
common
.
many
need
a
leader
for
it
,
this
be
in
very
many
woman
and
very
many
man
.
some
need
drama
to
support
it
,
some
need
lie
to
help
it
,
some
always
need
to
leave
out
something
in
their
tell
anything
to
have
it
,
some
need
always
to
leave
out
something
in
their
feeling
,
in
their
doing
,
in
their
knowing
,
in
their
realising
,
in
their
believing
,
and
they
have
it
mostly
in
they
,
some
need
always
to
leave
out
piece
of
everything
they
have
in
they
to
make
for
themselves
the
complete
creation
of
virtuous
being
of
themselves
to
themselves
inside
they
.
many
have
virtuous
feeling
about
something
inside
they
.
some
need
drama
to
support
it
,
some
need
lie
to
help
it
,
some
need
company
to
feel
it
,
some
love
it
when
they
have
it
,
some
do
not
then
love
it
,
some
hate
it
,
some
be
it
,
some
be
burden
with
it
,
some
enjoy
it
,
some
never
be
very
certain
they
really
ever
have
it
.
virtuous
feeling
in
man
and
woman
be
what
I
be
now
a
little
describe
.




some
then
and
these
be
now
another
kind
of
they
from
any
I
have
be
describe
,
some
then
have
an
ideal
in
they
and
always
they
poetically
,
romantically
,
dramatically
,
idealistically
,
sentimentally
conceive
themselves
as
do
that
thing
and
they
be
not
good
at
invent
and
they
be
always
do
everything
and
they
leave
out
mostly
everything
in
tell
anything
and
they
be
always
then
very
fond
of
tell
this
thing
and
so
they
have
it
in
they
to
be
idealistically
,
romantically
,
sentimentally
,
dramatically
one
thing
and
that
be
always
in
they
an
ideal
thing
.
these
then
be
such
one
as
would
have
it
in
they
to
be
to
themselves
suppose
it
be
a
chaste
one
or
a
forgive
one
that
kind
of
one
completely
in
they
.
be
with
they
,
know
they
,
some
of
they
,
it
be
climb
mountain
for
always
when
you
be
think
you
have
hear
the
whole
thing
about
the
ideal
they
be
to
themselves
in
themselves
to
every
one
a
new
peak
come
up
behind
and
you
begin
again
climb
,
they
be
not
really
chaste
then
such
a
one
yes
that
be
certain
they
will
sometime
tell
that
thing
but
the
claim
then
come
from
a
new
kind
of
relation
in
they
that
be
a
real
one
of
a
completely
chaste
thing
,
they
violate
that
one
and
then
a
new
one
be
to
they
the
complete
thing
of
idealistic
romantic
chastity
for
they
and
always
in
their
telling
they
leave
out
everything
that
can
destroy
the
truth
of
the
late
idealistic
chastity
in
they
,
and
then
every
one
know
of
that
new
violation
and
they
be
then
create
a
new
idealism
and
again
they
be
tell
everything
with
leave
out
in
their
telling
,
feeling
,
think
,
believe
anything
that
show
another
violation
they
have
be
make
of
their
idealistic
conception
,
and
these
then
go
on
and
they
go
on
and
everybody
laugh
about
they
that
such
a
one
should
have
idealistic
romantic
conception
of
chaste
being
and
always
this
one
have
a
new
one
and
always
this
one
then
in
telling
be
leave
out
everything
that
tell
the
last
violation
of
the
late
idealistic
romantic
dramatic
conception
of
chaste
being
and
these
then
be
lie
but
not
by
invention
but
by
idealistic
romantic
dramatic
sentimental
omission
and
that
be
then
very
amusing
and
I
know
just
now
several
of
such
a
kind
of
they
and
everybody
can
laugh
at
they
sometime
.




this
happen
very
often
with
very
many
in
loving
,
they
be
explain
that
with
that
last
one
they
be
not
real
in
loving
,
this
they
be
now
do
be
really
love
,
always
before
they
have
not
be
really
love
that
be
certain
,
this
be
very
common
in
loving
,
it
be
very
common
very
often
in
woman
,
it
be
very
common
it
be
very
often
in
man
in
their
real
feeling
,
in
their
real
thinking
,
it
be
very
common
in
man
and
woman
it
be
very
common
in
love
in
woman
and
in
man
it
be
very
common
in
love
often
in
man
and
woman
.




another
form
of
have
virtuous
feeling
be
think
what
any
one
be
do
be
only
a
habit
in
they
,
and
this
be
pretty
common
in
man
,
quite
common
in
man
and
in
woman
.




this
way
of
feeling
then
be
that
not
any
one
be
really
a
bad
one
that
be
hardly
any
one
,
mostly
every
one
do
a
thing
because
it
be
a
habit
and
all
that
they
need
then
be
to
change
their
habit
to
some
other
thing
,
some
other
way
of
do
that
thing
do
something
and
that
one
will
be
a
good
one
.
this
be
fairly
common
in
man
and
woman
this
way
of
have
a
feeling
about
virtue
in
other
one
and
in
themselves
then
,
in
some
it
be
strong
in
beginning
,
when
they
be
young
,
but
in
very
many
have
this
kind
of
conception
it
be
in
they
all
through
their
living
.
they
be
not
actually
ever
change
the
habit
they
have
in
they
neither
be
any
other
one
they
be
know
but
that
do
not
affect
their
conviction
that
do
bad
thing
be
only
a
habit
in
themselves
and
in
every
one
,
and
this
be
indeed
quite
common
in
man
and
in
woman
.




another
very
common
way
of
have
virtuous
feeling
about
oneself
inside
one
be
from
have
always
the
sense
of
be
oneself
inside
one
and
so
one
oneself
do
something
do
it
,
a
wrong
thing
,
with
a
different
feeling
from
any
other
one
and
so
it
be
not
really
then
a
wrong
thing
.
this
be
very
common
even
with
many
woman
many
man
who
have
not
much
personality
in
they
,
who
do
such
very
bad
thing
as
a
regular
way
of
living
that
no
one
not
know
would
ever
think
it
of
they
that
they
know
it
in
they
that
they
themselves
inside
they
with
the
feeling
of
themselves
inside
they
make
it
that
the
wrong
thing
they
be
do
be
not
so
bad
as
when
other
one
do
that
wrong
thing
.
they
be
themselves
inside
they
,
they
feel
themselves
inside
they
,
each
one
of
they
and
so
then
the
thing
they
be
do
be
personal
thing
,
not
mercenary
,
vulgar
thing
like
those
the
other
one
do
the
same
thing
be
do
.
this
be
very
common
in
woman
,
this
be
very
common
in
man
,
each
man
mostly
each
woman
mostly
have
a
feeling
of
their
own
being
,
of
be
themselves
inside
they
in
they
and
that
in
itself
make
each
one
do
something
less
bad
in
do
that
thing
than
any
other
one
do
that
thing
.
a
man
painting
,
a
painter
exhibiting
have
such
feeling
.
a
painter
be
say
that
exhibition
be
so
disgusting
because
just
look
one
see
that
all
the
picture
be
bad
and
that
be
disgusting
,
one
's
own
picture
be
hang
there
and
one
look
at
they
and
realise
that
they
be
bad
thing
know
by
remember
how
each
one
of
they
happen
to
come
to
be
not
a
good
one
and
that
then
make
it
alright
for
there
be
reason
that
one
's
own
picture
be
not
good
one
while
with
all
the
other
they
be
bad
one
and
that
be
all
there
be
to
they
,
there
be
not
reason
to
explain
they
to
the
feeling
of
any
one
look
at
they
and
this
be
a
very
common
way
of
have
a
conviction
of
virtue
in
they
in
a
wonderfully
large
number
of
man
and
woman
.




there
be
other
who
build
it
up
in
piece
the
virtuous
be
the
virtuous
feeling
in
they
,
slowly
they
build
it
up
in
living
,
slowly
carefully
and
always
they
be
add
,
piece
alter
piece
be
be
add
by
they
to
make
sometime
pretty
completely
a
whole
thing
and
some
of
these
be
very
good
one
indeed
in
living
and
some
be
not
such
very
good
one
,
but
very
many
of
they
be
very
good
one
in
living
.
some
of
such
of
they
may
have
many
other
thing
in
they
that
be
not
such
good
thing
in
they
but
these
do
not
affect
the
good
thing
of
they
,
the
good
part
of
they
,
the
virtuous
be
in
they
that
these
be
steadily
build
up
in
they
by
steady
add
,
sometimes
quickly
sometimes
slowly
but
always
,
mostly
always
,
very
often
safely
,
completely
safely
in
they
.
there
be
so
many
of
they
then
man
and
woman
that
have
virtuous
feeling
in
they
,
important
be
in
they
from
virtuous
feeling
in
they
that
it
be
a
large
undertaking
to
understand
it
and
realise
it
and
describe
it
and
I
be
now
not
any
long
begin
the
do
this
thing
.




there
be
some
who
have
very
much
virtuous
feeling
virtuous
be
in
they
,
some
who
have
not
so
much
virtuous
be
virtuous
feeling
in
they
,
some
who
have
very
little
,
some
who
have
hardly
any
and
some
who
have
not
any
interest
in
any
such
a
thing
.




some
have
virtuous
feeling
in
they
from
have
in
they
concrete
and
generalise
virtue
always
really
in
they
.
some
have
virtuous
feeling
in
they
from
have
in
they
concrete
and
generalise
virtue
almost
always
really
in
they
.
some
have
virtuous
feeling
in
they
from
have
in
they
concrete
and
generalise
virtue
very
often
really
in
they
.
some
have
virtuous
feeling
in
they
from
have
in
they
concrete
and
generalise
virtue
sometimes
really
in
they
.
some
have
virtuous
feeling
in
they
from
have
in
they
concrete
and
generalise
virtue
sometime
really
in
they
.




there
be
lot
more
way
of
have
virtuous
feeling
in
one
than
these
that
I
have
be
describe
.
I
be
keep
they
back
now
from
crowd
on
I
,
slowly
they
will
come
to
I
and
out
from
I
,
this
have
be
a
description
of
a
few
of
they
and
there
be
lot
of
they
but
I
have
be
already
describe
a
good
many
of
they
and
always
I
be
understand
woman
and
man
more
and
more
by
listen
to
they
as
in
repeat
it
come
out
of
they
the
telling
by
they
of
how
goodness
be
in
they
even
in
those
who
never
be
really
talk
about
any
such
a
thing
.
always
sometime
it
come
out
of
every
one
the
way
they
have
virtuous
feeling
in
they
and
always
more
and
more
to
I
it
be
interesting
.




it
be
very
perplexing
the
generalise
conception
which
be
of
virtue
in
many
man
and
many
woman
and
the
concrete
feeling
and
act
that
be
not
of
virtue
in
they
.
this
be
perplexing
,
this
be
sometimes
not
at
all
perplexing
,
mostly
it
be
perplex
always
to
the
family
of
they
,
those
know
always
the
kind
of
they
,
this
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
Alfred
Hersland
will
soon
then
be
interesting
.
there
will
soon
be
a
description
of
he
begin
.




there
be
many
way
of
be
and
of
love
and
of
win
and
of
lose
,
and
have
honor
in
they
,
and
horror
of
something
,
and
religion
in
they
and
virtuous
feeling
be
believe
and
think
in
they
from
the
nature
of
they
when
this
be
strong
enough
in
they
to
make
their
own
in
man
and
woman
.
sometimes
some
one
to
every
one
be
strong
enough
to
make
his
own
or
her
own
living
thinking
feeling
be
love
,
horror
,
working
and
religion
and
virtuous
feeling
and
this
be
not
then
true
of
that
one
,
this
one
be
one
have
anticipate
suggestion
and
then
be
like
a
resounding
board
to
the
suggestion
they
be
anticipate
and
so
give
it
forth
then
so
that
to
themselves
then
and
mostly
to
every
one
they
be
strong
to
do
their
own
living
,
to
make
their
own
opinion
and
virtue
and
working
and
think
and
loving
and
religion
and
this
will
soon
now
be
some
description
of
such
a
one
.
some
then
can
make
their
own
honor
,
and
virtue
and
work
and
thinking
and
loving
and
religion
.
some
can
make
their
own
horror
,
some
their
own
loving
,
some
their
own
religion
,
some
be
weak
and
can
do
one
thing
their
own
,
some
be
strong
enough
and
all
of
it
be
some
one
else
's
thinking
,
feeling
,
do
,
religion
,
virtue
in
they
,
they
be
strong
enough
man
and
woman
.
there
be
some
can
just
resist
and
not
make
their
own
anything
.
some
out
of
their
own
virtue
make
a
god
who
sometimes
later
be
a
nuisance
to
they
,
a
terror
perhaps
to
they
,
a
difficult
thing
to
be
forget
.
some
be
control
by
other
's
virtue
and
religion
and
that
scare
they
,
it
be
a
superstition
to
they
and
always
after
it
be
a
scared
part
of
they
.
some
like
religion
,
some
forget
it
,
some
be
it
,
some
have
a
prejudice
against
it
.
there
be
many
who
love
themselves
enough
to
not
want
to
lose
themselves
from
live
,
to
not
want
other
people
,
existence
to
lose
they
,
to
very
many
woman
,
to
very
many
man
this
come
to
be
as
a
religion
in
they
,
this
make
religion
a
real
thing
to
they
.
some
love
themselves
so
much
immortality
can
have
no
meaning
for
they
,
the
young
David
Hersland
be
such
a
one
,
there
will
be
a
long
history
of
he
sometime
write
.
some
love
themselves
negatively
and
they
like
think
about
immortal
living
.
some
love
themselves
or
other
one
so
forcibly
in
they
that
death
can
have
no
meaning
as
an
ending
,
these
be
then
certain
of
exist
,
these
then
be
make
to
have
religion
,
that
be
certain
,
some
do
not
have
it
then
in
they
,
really
they
be
certain
that
every
one
be
continue
,
they
may
not
know
it
as
religion
,
they
mostly
all
of
they
sometime
know
it
in
they
.
some
love
themselves
so
completely
or
some
other
one
that
they
think
they
exist
when
they
do
n't
,
will
exist
when
they
wo
n't
,
be
in
communication
with
they
when
they
certainly
be
not
,
some
of
these
do
not
make
it
as
a
religion
,
they
have
it
as
a
conviction
as
a
certainty
in
they
,
these
have
a
future
life
feel
in
their
present
living
.
this
be
pretty
common
.
some
have
fervent
love
in
they
for
themselves
or
some
one
with
very
much
fear
in
they
and
some
of
such
of
they
have
religion
in
they
and
very
many
of
such
of
they
have
none
.




this
be
now
to
be
a
little
a
very
little
description
of
some
have
in
she
or
in
he
the
feeling
of
original
creation
from
anticipated
suggestion
and
the
way
virtue
then
be
in
they
,
in
such
of
they
.
then
there
will
be
a
beginning
of
the
being
in
Alfred
Hersland
after
this
little
description
which
have
not
much
to
do
with
anything
but
be
to
I
interesting
have
be
make
,
as
I
be
just
say
.




some
have
very
much
sensitive
be
in
they
,
very
many
have
sensitive
be
as
creative
activity
in
they
,
very
many
have
it
as
an
instrument
nature
in
they
,
some
of
they
have
it
so
that
they
can
be
almost
creative
by
resonate
,
resoundingly
anticipate
another
one
's
suggestion
before
that
suggestion
come
as
a
completion
and
such
then
be
often
for
the
very
long
kind
of
time
really
puzzle
as
have
in
they
sensitiveness
to
the
creation
of
real
personality
in
they
as
original
activity
in
they
and
these
very
often
have
it
in
they
that
they
be
intelligent
and
so
can
reflect
and
then
reflect
about
the
thing
they
be
create
from
anticipation
of
the
suggesting
of
other
one
be
to
they
,
they
be
quick
,
these
then
,
quick
really
than
chain
lightning
and
sometimes
for
a
very
long
time
these
be
confusing
.
sometimes
these
then
can
be
understand
by
one
when
one
realise
of
they
that
they
be
as
greatly
one
thing
as
any
other
thing
if
the
proper
influence
have
come
into
the
circle
of
their
living
and
that
never
to
themselves
when
they
be
begin
a
new
thing
do
the
other
thing
the
last
thing
they
be
create
,
the
last
kind
of
thing
they
be
do
completely
express
the
personality
of
they
to
their
thinking
,
such
of
they
be
never
fail
in
anything
,
they
be
always
succeed
,
later
they
be
always
certain
they
have
not
completely
express
the
personality
in
they
in
the
last
thing
they
be
do
,
they
be
now
completely
express
the
personality
in
they
and
then
later
in
remember
they
know
they
have
not
completely
express
the
personality
in
they
and
always
in
each
kind
of
thing
they
be
do
they
be
succeed
,
they
be
never
stop
do
the
last
thing
because
they
be
tired
of
do
that
thing
,
they
be
begin
a
new
thing
without
really
leave
the
last
thing
;
in
their
generalised
living
,
slowly
every
one
can
come
to
know
it
of
they
they
be
not
really
original
in
inspiration
,
it
come
then
that
it
be
change
but
not
an
evolution
of
they
everything
,
there
be
no
generalised
conception
that
form
itself
from
they
in
they
,
they
may
be
fairly
successful
in
live
they
may
not
be
successful
in
living
,
always
then
they
be
quick
than
chain
lightning
really
in
their
sensitive
being
.




the
weakness
of
the
being
in
they
may
come
to
be
clear
from
the
virtue
feel
in
they
,
from
religion
in
they
,
from
the
way
they
need
for
that
always
to
have
company
around
they
,
this
be
generalise
be
in
they
and
they
need
close
company
around
they
to
support
they
,
they
can
not
for
this
do
concrete
working
that
give
to
every
one
the
illusion
that
inspiration
be
inside
they
.
this
be
pretty
clear
to
my
thinking
,
not
completely
clear
yet
and
I
be
now
tell
it
here
to
a
little
rid
myself
of
it
and
to
begin
again
to
think
and
feel
about
it
.
sometime
I
will
have
to
do
much
more
realise
,
understand
the
sensitive
being
in
man
and
woman
,
it
be
a
completely
necessary
thing
and
I
be
always
work
and
think
and
feeling
and
I
will
not
now
say
any
more
about
this
thing
,
this
be
enough
now
and
I
have
be
relieve
myself
enough
now
of
my
wisdom
.




perhaps
this
description
that
I
have
be
just
make
have
a
little
after
all
to
do
with
something
in
this
writing
.
this
then
and
other
thing
that
have
be
write
have
something
to
do
with
prepare
the
understanding
of
myself
then
and
some
other
perhaps
then
for
the
being
in
Julia
Dehning
.




there
must
be
much
alternate
all
through
in
this
writing
of
prepare
to
be
describe
Alfred
Hersland
and
the
living
in
he
and
Julia
Dehning
who
come
later
to
be
marry
he
.
these
two
then
will
be
mostly
all
of
they
in
this
part
of
this
writing
and
always
I
be
alternate
between
they
and
always
a
little
prepare
understand
one
and
a
little
prepare
understand
the
other
one
and
so
sometime
perhaps
everything
will
come
to
be
show
something
and
that
will
be
then
a
happy
ending
of
all
this
beginning
.




sensitive
be
be
completely
interesting
.
it
will
sometime
be
a
long
book
that
one
when
everything
be
write
about
sensitive
being
and
kind
of
it
and
the
meaning
of
it
in
every
man
and
every
woman
.
sometime
it
must
be
do
for
so
only
can
there
be
write
a
history
of
every
one
.




all
this
describe
then
of
virtuous
being
,
feeling
,
know
,
think
,
in
man
and
in
woman
make
it
right
now
to
begin
the
complete
understanding
and
description
of
the
living
and
the
being
in
Alfred
Hersland
and
every
one
important
in
his
living
.

with
that
kind
of
they
all
there
be
of
that
kind
of
they
as
child
and
I
be
now
as
I
be
say
wait
.




to
begin
again
with
Mr.
Hissen
the

Alfred
Hersland
.
this
one
be
as
I
be
say
a
man
have
it
in
he
that
he
be
really
all
that
there
be
of
religion
,
he
be
a
man
as
I
be
say
a
man
completely
be
that
thing
to
himself
inside
he
,
a
man
live
that
thing
completely
every
moment
in
his
living
,
a
man
hold
they
as
part
of
he
his

all
there
be
of
religion

he
be
a
man
then
have
a
connection
with
such
as
those
I
be
describe
who
have
it
to
be
completely
to
themselves
that
they
be
completely
a
good
one
only
those
that
I
have
be
describe
have
it
in
they
to
have
concrete
live
in
they
and
generalise
conviction
of
themselves
besides
in
they
and
see
themselves
in
the
light
of
the
generalisation
and
the
generalisation
come
from
the
conviction
of
be
that
be
not
in
concrete
exist
really
in
they
,
in
Mr.
Hissen
then
it
be
a
different
thing
,
his
generalisation
be
a
complete
generalisation
from
the
complete
feeling
act
be
think
in
he
,
he
be
completely
then
all
that
there
be
of
religion
,

be
live
know
be
think
feeling
believe
that
he
be
himself
all
that
there
be
of
religion
and
he
be
concretely
live
every
minute
in
this
being
and
concrete
and
generalise
being
be
the
same
being
in
he
and
he
do
not
think
that
when
lie
would
be
dead
he
would
be
live
,
dead
be

this
then
be
one
of
the
kind
of
they
that
one
must
be
understand
to
understand
the
being
in
Alfred

,
I
have
be
describe
Mr.

again
the
grandfather
of
Alfred
Hersland
,
I
will
now
tell
a
little
more
of
religious
desiring
in
some
of
this
kind
of
they
,
some
who
have

he
be
not
judge

,
he
have
not
any
fear
in
he
,
he
die
of
old
age
when
he
come
to
be
a
dead
one
,
to
be
dead
be
to
be
dead
of
that
he
be
very
certain
,
he
have
not
then
any
fear
in
he
,
he
have
not
in
he
ecstasy
or
idealisation
,
he
have
completion
in
he
,
he
have
all
that
there
be
of
religion
for
he
in
he
,
when
he
would
be
a
dead
one
he
would
be
dead
of
that
he
be
completely
certain
,
he
be
then
a
complete
one
,
concrete
and
generalised
conviction
be
the
same
in
he
,
he
be
the
grandfather
of
Alfred
Hersland
,
he
be
one
of
one
kind
in
man
and
woman
,
I
be
now
pretty
settle
in
my
direction
,
I
be
still
now
wait
,
I
be
still
now
not
go
on
,
I
be
still
now
wait
and
that
be
what
I
be
now
do
.




this
then
the
being
in
Mr.
Hissen
the
grandfather
of
the
three
Hersland
child
be
one
way
of
have
religion
,
feeling
of
virtue
,
in
one
,
it
be
an
important
thing
to
have
it
completely
inside
I
the
feeling
of
religion
in
Mr.
Hissen
.
it
be
pretty
completely
inside
I
now
and
still
a
little
I
be
wait
,
I
will
now
soon
be
describe
one
who
have
another
way
of
have
religion
,
the
complete
other
extreme
and
still
of
the
same
kind
of
they
as
Mr.
Hissen
and
then
I
will
be
describe
the
in
between
kind
of
they
and
so
then
I
will
come
again
to
Alfred
Hersland
.
and
all
of
these
then
be
of
the
resist
kind
of
they
the
dependent
independent
kind
of
they
and
now
then
again
a
little
I
be
begin
to
be
wait
.
I
will
be
wait
quite
a
little
now
before
I
begin
again
.




there
be
some
who
naturally
be
know
dead
be
dead
but
these
be
not
then
certain
that
to
be
dead
be
to
be
a
dead
one
.
there
be
many
who
be
say
to
be
dead
be
to
be
a
dead
one
but
these
then
be
not
very
certain
that
to
be
dead
be
to
be
really
a
dead
one
.
there
be
some
who
be
practically
speak
completely
certain
that
to
be
dead
be
to
be
a
really
dead
one
but
always
these
then
be
afraid
in
living
and
always
these
then
be
a
little
afraid
of
be
a
dead
one
,
some
then
be
very
completely
afraid
of
become
a
really
dead
one
some
of
these
then
be
think
feel
when
they
be
be
completely
afraid
of
be
a
completely
dead
one
when
they
will
be
dead
one
that
perhaps
then
to
be
dead
be
not
to
be
really
a
dead
one
,
they
know
it
in
they
that
to
be
dead
be
to
be
completely
entirely
a
dead
one
,
these
be
certain
then
of
this
thing
and
they
be
afraid
then
every
moment
in
their
living
that
it
will
come
to
be
in
they
that
they
will
come
to
be
a
really
dead
one
and
then
many
of
these
then
have
it
in
they
as
a
fear
in
they
that
to
be
a
dead
one
be
to
be
really
a
dead
one
and
they
know
that
be
really
in
they
that
to
be
dead
be
to
be
really
a
dead
one
and
so
then
they
have
it
in
they
that
they
think
they
have
it
in
they
that
they
be
believe
then
that
to
be
a
dead
one
be
not
to
be
really
a
dead
one
and
then
they
do
not
know
it
in
they
whether
that
be
really
a
comforting
thing
to
they
,
they
do
not
know
it
in
they
whether
they
be
ever
really
think
that
to
be
a
dead
one
be
not
to
be
really
dead
then
and
these
be
not
certain
whether
it
be
a
comfort
to
they
any
such
a
feeling
and
there
they
be
then
these
then
full
up
then
with
fear
inside
they
every
kind
of
fear
they
can
possibly
have
then
for
they
have
it
in
they
that
to
be
dead
be
to
be
a
dead
one
and
they
have
it
in
they
to
never
to
be
want
to
be
such
a
kind
of
a
really
dead
one
and
then
they
have
it
in
they
from
this
fear
in
they
come
out
of
this
fear
in
they
that
they
will
soon
come
to
be
a
really
dead
one
,
that
perhaps
a
dead
one
be
not
really
a
dead
one
and
then
they
have
the
fear
in
they
of
a
dead
one
not
be
then
a
really
dead
one
and
fear
then
be
complicate
in
they
and
there
be
a
very
considerable
number
of
such
of
they
always
exist
and
fear
then
make
of
they
that
they
have
a
generalise
conception
that
they
have
religion
in
they
and
virtuous
be
in
they
and
this
be
of
the
feeling
in
they
that
come
from
the
reaction
in
they
from
the
fear
in
they
of
be
a
really
dead
one
that
perhaps
be
a
dead
one
be
not
really
be
a
really
dead
one
and
always
then
these
have
in
they
as
a
continuous
concrete
realisation
and
this
be
always
be
in
they
that
to
be
dead
be
to
be
completely
really
a
dead
one
.




some
have
it
as
a
complete
feeling
in
they
that
to
be
dead
be
to
be
dead
and
this
then
a
world
without
end
be
in
they
for
to
be
dead
be
to
be
a
dead
one
and
so
then
not
any
thing
to
they
have
ever
any
ending
.
everything
then
to
such
of
they
be
go
on
forever
and
forever
to
they
and
always
then
to
be
a
dead
one
be
to
be
a
dead
one
and
always
then
there
be
a
continue
for
ever
and
ever
to
such
of
they
of
everything
and
so
then
to
these
of
they
there
be
no
ending
of
anything
and
living
and
be
a
dead
one
be
to
these
then
the
very
same
thing
and
to
be
a
dead
one
be
to
be
a
dead
one
and
to
be
a
live
one
a
live
one
and
to
very
many
of
these
dead
and
living
be
all
one
and
these
then
have
in
they
religion
as
be
of
everything
that
be
never
end
and
some
of
these
then
come
to
have
it
in
they
this
I
be
describe
to
be
certain
that
to
be
dead
be
to
be
a
dead
one
and
to
be
live
be
to
be
a
live
one
and
that
always
everything
be
never
end
,
come
then
to
have
it
in
they
as
love
be
in
they
and
these
then
can
come
to
have
it
in
they
that
they
be
of
they
that
have
it
to
be
of
the
kind
of
they
that
own
the
thing
they
need
for
love
and
so
then
these
then
have
it
as
love
in
they
that
nothing
be
ever
end
and
to
be
dead
be
to
be
a
dead
one
and
to
be
live
be
to
be
a
live
one
and
that
nothing
be
ever
end
and
have
this
in
they
as
love
be
and
own
the
thing
they
need
for
loving
be
very
interesting
in
religion
.




all
these
then
that
I
have
be
describe
all
these
then
all
these
kind
of
they
that
I
have
be
describe
I
be
think
as
of
the
resist
kind
in
man
and
woman
,
the
dependent
independent
kind
of
they
.




these
then
some
man
and
woman
always
there
be
a
good
many
of
these
living
who
have
it
in
they
to
have
resist
being
and
some
way
of
feeling
that
to
be
a
dead
one
be
to
be
a
dead
one
and
have
in
they
religion
from
this
thing
mix
up
with
this
thing
in
they
,
these
then
that
I
have
be
describe
be
of
the
resist
kind
in
man
and
woman
,
they
be
of
that
kind
of
they
that
have
love
in
they
as
resist
and
own
those
they
need
in
love
not
from

in
the
history
of
the
young
Hersland
brother
David
Hersland
.
now
I
be
still
wait
to
be
begin
really
begin
the
history
of
Alfred
Hersland
from
the
beginning
of
his
living
.




there
have
be
then
now
,
be
in
this
description
,
the
three
generation
of
man
and
woman
.
there
be
then
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Hissen
and
the
old
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Hersland
,
there
be
then
Mr.
and
Mrs.
David
Hersland
and
these
then
have
three
child
Martha
and
Alfred
and
David
and
the
history
of
Martha
have
be
now
already
mostly
write
,
not
completely
altogether
write
but
a
good
deal
write
and
now
there
will
be
begin
to
be
write
the
history
of
Alfred
Hersland
and
every
one
he
ever
come
to
know
in
his
early
living
,
in
his
marrying
and
in
his
later
living
.




there
be
then
Mr.
Hissen
and
Mrs.
Hissen
and
Alfred
Hersland
have
it
in
he
to
have
a
good
deal
in
he
Mr.
Hissen
be
but
it
be
a
very
different
thing
in
he
this
be
in
he
than
it
be
in
Mr.
Hissen
.
Alfred
never
have
in
he
at
any
time
in
he
religion
,
he
be
a
mixture
then
of
old
Mr.
Hissen
and
old
Mr.
Hersland
who
be
a
butcher
when
he
be
a
young
man
work
and
who
be
a
man
who
have
important
feeling
in
he
from
having
be
a
little
important
then
in
religion
.
Alfred
Hersland
then
,
to
be
certain
of
the
being
in
he
,
be
of
the
resist
kind
of
they
in
man
and
woman
and
now
then
I
will
wait
again
and
soon
then
I
will
be
full
up
with
he
,
I
be
now
then
not
completely
full
up
with
he
.
now
I
be
again
begin
wait
to
be
full
up
completely
full
up
with
he
.
I
be
very
considerably
full
up
now
with
the
kind
of
be
in
he
,
I
will
be
wait
and
then
I
will
be
full
up
with
all
the
being
in
he
,
that
be
certain
,
and
so
then
now
a
little
again
once
more
then
I
be
wait
wait
to
be
fill
up
full
completely
with
he
with
all
the
be
ever
in
he
.




there
be
then
some
living
who
be
say
that
to
be
a
dead
one
be
to
be
really
a
dead
one
and
these
then
be
not
very
certain
that
to
be
a
dead
one
be
to
be
really
a
dead
one
.
they
be
then
some
who
have
it
in
they
that
dead
be
dead
and
these
then
be
not
very
certain
that
to
be
dead
be
to
be
a
dead
one
.
there
be
then
very
many
who
in
living
have
it
in
they
that
dead
be
dead
and
these
then
be
not
certain
that
to
be
a
dead
one
be
to
be
a
really
entirely
completely
certainly
altogether
dead
one
.
there
be
very
many
then
of
these
always
live
,
perhaps
Alfred
Hersland
be
one
of
this
kind
of
they
.
perhaps
he
be
of
this
kind
of
man
.
perhaps
he
be
not
this
kind
of
a
one
,
not
one
of
this
kind
of
they
of
woman
and
man
.
anyway
this
much
be
certain
,
he
be
of
the
resist
kind
of
they
,
he
be
of
the
resist
kind
of
man
,
of
the
dependent
independent
kind
of
they
.
he
be
certainly
of
the
engulf
resist
kind
in
man
and
woman
.




of
these
Alfred
Hersland
be
not
really
one
,
Julia
Dehning
be
of
this
kind
of
they
.
they
can
be
either
attack
or
resist
kind
of
they
.
there
be
some
,
indeed
there
be
a
very
great
many
of
they
,
I
know
some
of
they
always
in
living
,
there
be
many
of
they
some
very
successful
in
live
some
very
brilliant
in
living
,
some
not
successful
in
live
,
some
of
every
kind
of
they
as
to
succeed
and
fail
,
there
be
a
very
great
number
of
they
always
live
woman
and
man
who
have
it
that
the
be
the
root
of
be
in
they
be
intensity
of
emotion
and
these
then
be
do
,
feel
believe
many
thing
in
living
,
some
many
thing
very
different
from
those
other
one
of
that
kind
of
they
be
feel
,
think
and
believe
,
many
of
they
very
different
thing
from
what
they
have
be
and
will
be
believe
feel
thinking
do
knowing
and
always
each
thing
any
of
these
be
feel
think
believe
know
do
be
for
they
completely
bathe
and
float
by
the
intensity
of
emotion
that
be
all
be
in
they
and
these
have
it
that
to
themselves
inside
they
they
be
deeply
profoundly
move
by
the
thing
and
really
then
they
be
really
profoundly
move
by
the
emotional
intensity
in
they
,
not
any
thing
in
they
,
in
those
of
they
that
be
completely
this
kind
of
they
not
anything
they
ever
be
feel
think
know
believe
do
in
living
have
any
other
value
than
any
other
thing
they
be
ever
feel
know
do
thinking
believe
for
always
all
of
the
being
in
they
be
intensity
in
emotion
and
very
many
of
such
of
they
have
sometime
very
strongly
religion
in
they
and
mostly
always
virtuous
feeling
in
they
,
that
be
natural
for
they
to
be
have
in
they
as
any
one
understand
anything
of
human
being
certainly
will
be
more
or
less
realise
.
these
then
and
there
be
a
very
considerable
number
always
exist
of
they
as
I
be
say
be
often
succeed
very
well
in
living
and
be
brilliant
one
in
living
and
some
of
they
be
weak
and
stupid
one
in
living
and
there
be
all
degree
in
between
but
always
it
be
certain
that
these
have
in
they
emotional
intensity
as
be
in
they
and
often
for
a
very
long
time
they
be
puzzle
,
they
be
often
for
long
year
puzzle
to
some
one
for
it
be
a
very
difficult
thing
to
know
it
of
they
that
not
anything
they
be
ever
feel
know
thinking
believe
understanding
be
profoundly
in
they
when
they
be
so
completely
move
and
envelop
by
and
envelop
that
thing
,
it
be
a
very
puzzling
thing
very
often
with
these
for
they
come
so
nearly
to
be
original
in
live
feeling
think
be
know
believe
and
they
be
really
not
then
original
one
and
it
be
disconcert
for
often
one
be
a
very
long
time
convince
by
they
by
such
of
they
who
be
so
completely
themselves
live
by
that
thing
in
they
then
which
be
not
they
but
be
sustain
by
the
intensity
of
emotion
which
be
the
really
truly
they
.
it
be
very
certain
that
these
then
be
very
strong
one
for
follow
in
religion
for
be
certain
of
virtue
in
they
,
these
must
be
that
for
otherwise
they
would
know
that
they
have
not
originality
in
they
,
this
will
be
all
so
very
interesting
when
I
be
go
to
be
describe
Julia
Dehning
,
this
be
a
completely
interesting
thing
but
now
there
must
be
a
beginning
to
the
real
realisation
in
I
of
Alfred
Hersland
and
his
living
,
I
have
be
do
a
very
great
deal
of
wait
,
wait
be
to
I
very
interesting
for
always
something
be
come
or
else
nothing
be
come
and
there
be
eat
,
sleep
,
laugh
,
living
,
talking
and
a
little
tickling
in
the
body
and
the
mind
then
that
be
very
pleasant
to
any
one
like
waiting
and
then
there
be
always
the
drowsiness
of
go
to
be
lively
wake
and
all
this
be
in
I
in
wait
and
I
like
very
well
do
waiting
and
now
perhaps
a
little
more
I
will
be
wait
but
always
I
be
a
little
near
to
beginning
and
now
once
more
again
I
be
wait
and
now
I
be
content
myself
again
with
wait
and
that
be
a
very
pleasant
feel
a
pleasant
thing
for
any
one
content
inside
they
with
it
in
they
.




I
be
always
now
feel
the
temper
stir
in
Alfred
Hersland
the
kind
of
temper
he
have
in
he
when
he
be
a
boy
and
when
he
be
a
man
and
he
have
a
temper
in
he
that
be
a
common
thing
with
those
have
in
they
resist
be
tend
to
the
engulf
kind
of
that
kind
of
they
and
Alfred
Hersland
have
this
kind
of
angry
action
in
he
although
he
be
not
an
angry
or
a
sullen
person
mostly
in
he
.




I
be
very
nearly
full
up
with
he
with
Alfred
Hersland
and
his
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
it
be
all
fill
in
I
now
to
over
flow
.
Alfred
Hersland
be
a
very
little
one
and
then
a
child
and
then
a
boy
then
.
he
learn
to
understand
talk
and
answer
and
it
be
surprising
when
he
begin
this
thing
as
it
be
with
every
one
.
once
one
see
a
little
one
and
he
be
not
understand
anything
any
one
say
to
he
and
he
be
not
try
to
do
anything
and
then
in
a
very
little
while
a
couple
of
month
of
living
and
he
be
understanding
and
answer
and
be
try
to
have
thing
,
that
he
can
have
a
liking
for
then
and
that
be
a
very
certain
thing
and
Alfred
Hersland
have
this
in
he
and
later
then
he
be
a
boy
in
his
living
and
then
he
be
come
to
be
a
very
young
man
and
he
have
it
then
in
he
to
be
want
to
be
help
his
sister
to
have
freedom
so
then
he
be
very
certain
and
he
want
to
be
help
and
to
be
instruct
and
to
be
a
good
deal
an
example
to
his
brother
who
be
a
young
one
and
he
be
then
begin
resist
for
every
one
to
his
father
then
,
and
his
mother
then
have
about
he
a
strong
feeling
of
worry
when
he
be
a
little
late
for
dinner
in
the
evening
and
later
to
be
miss
he
when
he
have
leave
they
to
go
to
Bridgepoint
for
his
college
education
and
he
be
then
certain
he
be
a
man
devote
to
everything
and
every
one
and
he
always
write
to
every
one
then
to
be
good
one
and
he
be
a
man
then
and
then
very
much
later
he
be
marry
Julia
Dehning
and
all
this
then
be
in
he
as
much
later
live
and
in
the
beginning
he
be
a
little
baby
and
then
begin
understanding
and
talk
and
then
a
boy
then
and
then
a
boy
come
to
be
go
to
be
a
very
young
man
and
then
he
be
full
up
with
public
feeling
for
every
one
live
in
the
house
with
he
,
his
sister
,
his
brother
,
his
father
,
his
mother
,
every
one
,
in
the
beginning
then
he
be
a
very
little
one
,
this
be
now
then
the
beginning
of
the
complete
history
of
the
being
and
the
living
of
he
.




it
be
a
nice
thing
,
it
be
mostly
pleasant
for
every
one
when
the
eld
son
be
the
eld
of
the
child
,
in
family
live
.
this
be
not
the
case
with
Alfred
Hersland
,
he
be
the
eld
son
,
he
be
not
the
old
of
the
three
Hersland
child
,
Martha
be
the
old
of
they
,
it
be
very
certain
that
mostly
in
family
live
it
be
a
pleasanter
thing
when
the
old
one
of
the
child
be
the
old
son
,
this
most
generally
be
pleasanter
for
every
one
,
for
that
one
who
be
the
old
one
,
it
be
not
such
a
pleasant
thing
for
that
one
when
a
woman
a
girl
a
sister
be
the
old
one
when
he
be
the
old
son
,
this
mostly
then
make
it
a
little
a
difficult
thing
when
he
be
a
son
and
not
the
old
one
of
the
child
,
in
family
live
.
very
often
in
family
live
when
one
be
not
the
old
of
the
three
child
but
be
the
old
son
,
very
often
then
he
be
such
a
one
as
I
be
soon
go
to
be
describe
as
Alfred
Hersland
.
very
often
in
family
live
when
one
be
not
the
old
of
the
child
but
be
the
old
son
,
very
often
then
that
one
be
such
a
one
as
Alfred
Hersland
be
in
his
living
.
I
know
now
three
of
such
of
they
who
have
it
in
they
to
be
of
the
kind
of
they
that
Alfred
Hersland
be
and
who
have
it
in
their
living
that
they
be
the
old
son
and
that
they
have
a
sister
who
be
a
few
year
old
and
that
put
they
in
a
position
that
I
will
now
soon
be
describe
in
the
early
living
,
in
the
beginning
of
be
a
young
man
in
the
living
of
Alfred
Hersland
.




Alfred
Hersland
then
be
now

,
this
be
now
a
history
of
he
.

be
a
good
enough
look
one
,
many
say
he
be
a
very
good
look
one
.




sometimes
in
reading
,
sometimes
in
thinking
,
sometimes
in
realise
,
sometimes
in
a
kind
of
a
way
in
feeling
,
know
repeat
know
always
everything
be
repeat
,
know
that
there
will
be
go
on
live
be
sadden
.
sometime
then
in
reading
,
in
realise
anything
,
a
little
sometimes
in
feel
something
it
be
sadden
to
be
think
,
feel
,
realise
that
always
everything

be
in
their
middle
living
and
that
now
some
one
be
an
old
one
and
sometimes
it
be
a
queer
feeling
in
one
this
and
then
not
anything
,
not
wait
,
read
,
die
,
be
a
dead
one
,
live
,
be
a
young
one
,
be
one
be
a
real
thing
inside
in
one
then
and
always
then
it
be
certain
that
always
every
one
be
live
and
every
one
have
their
be
in
they
and
every
one
be
feel
think
know
something
and
always
then
it
be
certain
that
every
one
be
like
some
other
one
and
everything
be
exist
and
it
be
sadden
then
and
exist
be
not
a
real
thing
then
to
some
one
feeling
then
every
one
as
exist
and
be
themselves
inside
they
and
some
one
be
like
some

and
each
one
be
either
a
young
one
or
a
middle
aged
one
or
an
old
one
and
sometimes
then
this
be
a
little
a
dreary
thing
and
sometimes
then
it
be
a
very
queer
thing
and
mostly
then
it
be
all
then
something
and
mostly
then
it
be
certain
that
everything
be
exist
and
mostly
then
it
be
inside
in
some
one
that
not
anything
be
a
real
thing
,
that
it
be
dreary
to
be
write
.




I
be
feel
always
that
I
be
not
certain
that
I
be
ever
really
full
up
with
any
one
in
be
as
a
young
one
,
it
be
such
a
difficult
thing
to
be
a
young
one
inside
one
,
an
old
one
inside
one
,
to
be
any
age
inside
in
one
,
I
be
feel
that
it
be
a
very
queer
thing
to
be
know
some
one
who
be
a
young
one
,
to
be
know
any
one
,
I
be
not
then
have
any
one
inside
I
now
in
my
realising
,
not
myself
inside
I
in
my
feeling
,
I
be
live
that
be
certain
,
I
be
now
begin
a
little
again
feel
that
I
be
not
yet
full
up
with
the
being
in
Alfred
Hersland
.
I
be
now
again
begin
wait
.




I
have
not
any
more
any
one
in
I
to
my
feeling
.
always
then
there
be
Alfred
Hersland
and
I
know
very
well
what
kind
of
be
there
be
in
he
.
I
have
not
any
one
in
I
to
my
feeling
.
not
Alfred
Hersland
then
and
and
so
again
now
I
be
beginning
wait
.




how
can
any
one
know
it
in
they
that
they
be
a
young
one
,
that
they
be
a
middle
aged
one
,
that
they
be
an
old
one
.
mostly
there
be
not
any
way
to
know
it
inside
in
one
that
one
be
a
young
one
that
one
be
an
old
one
that
one
be
an
old
one
,
there
be
not
any
way
of
know
such
a
thing
inside
in
one
,
mostly
then
each
one
must
be
tell
it
by
some
one
and
mostly
then
that
one
do
not
then
really
know
it
in
they
.
mostly
then
there
be
not
any
way
any
one
by
themselves
can
know
it
in
they
that
they
be
a
young
one
a
very
young
one
,
a
young
one
not
such
a
very
young
one
,
an
old
one
,
a
good
deal
old
one
,
an
old
one
,
a
very
old
one
.
there
be
not
then
any
way
any
one
can
know
it
inside
they
the
difference
in
they
of
be
a
young
one
or
an
old
one
when
some
one
be
not
somehow
tell
it
to
they
,
some
other
one
,
this
can
be
a
telling
by
that
other
one
this
can
be
a
telling
by
the
other
one
because
the
other
one
be
exist
at
another
stage
in
living
.
I
have
be
see
a
young
man
and
have
be
talk
very
much
with
he
and
he
be
quite
a
young
man
and
he
be
very
much
like
one
I
be
see
very
much
when
I
be
quite
a
young
one
.
now
this
one
that
I
be
now
see
be
quite
a
young
one
that
be
to
I
very
certain
and
there
be
in
I
a
feeling
that
to
any
one
to
himself
now
there
be
not
very
much
meaning
in
many
thing
he
be
now
always
say
and
yet
I
know
it
by
remember
that
that
one
that
I
be
know
very
well
when
I
be
quite
a
young
one
and
who
be
so
very
like
this
one
,
I
know
that
that
one
be
not
then
to
himself
or
to
I
then
a
young
one
,
I
must
date
it
to
myself
to
be
really
certain
that
that
other
one
who
be
in
be
just
like
this
one
be
then
such
a
young
one
,
young
as
this
one
be
now
in
his
being
,
it
be
certain
that
that
other
one
be
such
a
young
one
,
he
be
not
now
to
my
remembering
of
that
time
a
young
one
,
he
be
at
that
time
to
my
feeling
as
now
I
be
remember
he
be
at
that
time
to
my
feeling
then
not
at
all
a
very
young
one
,
he
really
be
then
as
old
as
I
be
now
in
my
feeling
,
for
it
be
certain
not
any
one
be
any
age
inside
they
to
their
feeling
,
every
one
be
inside
they
live
,
that
be
about
all
there
can
ever
be
in
they
really
of
feeling
of
themselves
inside
they
,
that
they
be
live
inside
in
they
,
they
can
not
be
inside
in
they
any
age
inside
they
not
any
one
and
that
make
it
a
very
hard
thing
to
be
really
realise
a
young
one
or
an
old
one
or
any
one
,
or
one
's
own
self
inside
one
,
and
now
I
be
not
go
to
be
do
this
thing
with
Alfred
Hersland
I
be
now
outgoing
to
be
tell
the
being
in
he
and
the
living
in
he
and
what
he
do
in
live
with
any
other
one
.
not
any
one
in
they
be
to
themselves
any
age
inside
they
.
they
know
in
they
by
look
and
look
at
other
one
and
talk
and
know
thing
they
be
think
,
have
be
think
,
by
thing
they
be
and
will
be
do
,
by
realise
by
an
effort
in
they
or
simply
in
they
thing
happen
in
they
by
remember
but
really
then
not
any
one
be
to
themselves
anything
but
only
just
live
inside
they
,
that
be
all
feeling
of
themselves
inside
they
that
they
can
have
in
they
with
not
anything
to
help
they
by
tell
they
or
by
their
see
other
then
to
help
they
.




always
then
Alfred
Hersland
have
a
being
in
he
that
now
I
be
begin
describe
.
always
Alfred
Hersland
be
live
to
his
ending
.
this
be
the
being
then
that
be
in
every
one
,
they
be
exist
until
there
be
an
end
of
they
.
each
one
have
their
own
being
in
they
,
each
one
be
of
a
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
Alfred
Hersland
be
of
a
kind
of
man
and
woman
as
I
be
say
,
he
be
the
eld
son
but
not
the
eld
child
as
I
be
say
and
that
have
some
effect
on
he
as
I
be
say
it
do
have
on
those
that
be
eld
son
but
not
the
eld
child
in
family
living
,
and
Alfred
Hersland
be
all
through
his
early
living
live
with
poor
people
near
he
and
in
a
way
he
be
of
they
,
he

thing
with
they

then
he
leave
home
to
go
to
Bridgepoint
for
his
college
training
and
before
that
he
be
at
the
stage
of
be
very
instructive
and
very
desirous
to
be
the
head
of
his
family
and
a
good
citizen
and
after
he
leave
he
be
a
tender
feeling
in
his
mother
's
living
and
then
he
have
some
kind
of
love
in
he
and
then
as
I
be
say
he
come
to
be
married
to
Julia
Dehning
and
later
then

then
Alfred
Hersland

have
very
much
trouble
in
his
married
living
and
many
people
come
then
to
be
important
to
he
and
then
there
be
more
and
more
live
in
he
and
this
be
now
to
be
a
complete
history
of
he
.
I
be
now
almost
all
through
with
wait
.
I
be
now
begin
to
be
free
with
the
being
of
he
inside
I
in
my
feeling
.
I
be
now
completely
certain
that
not
any
one

to
himself
inside
he
in
his
or
her
feel
any
age
inside

a
natural
part
of
rich
living
,
but
be
rich
one
be
then
not
inside
they
as
a
feeling
important
in
the
Hersland
child
live
,
they
be
then
all
three
of
the
living
of
the
poor
people
in
small
house
and
a
half
country
half
-
city
living
feeling
.
Alfred
Hersland
be
then
such
a
one
in
his
living
,
and
living
be
then
the
important
thing
in
he
and
slowly
then
family
living
come
to
be
important
to
he
,
but
now
in
the
beginning
when
he
be
a
very
young
one
,
family
living
be
not
important
in
he
.
this
be
now
to
be
a
complete
history
of
the
living
in
he
all
his
living
.
when
he
be
quite
a
very
young
one
family
live
his
family
position
be
not
of
any
importance
in
he
,
then
it
come
to
be
more
important
,
then
very
important
in
he
,
then
after
his
marrying
Julia
dehne
very
much
less
important
in
he
.
always
all
the
time
he
be
live
in
Gossols
even
when
family
living
be
important
to
he
he
be
live
with
the
poor
people
near
he
.
later
after
he
marry
Julia
dehne
he
in
a
way
come
back
to
such
a
living
although
they
be
then
different
one
he
be
then
know
.




mostly
it
be
very
hard
realise
about
another
one
that
that
one
be
not
think
,
be
not
think
when
it
would
seem
that
thing
be
a
thing
they
would
naturally
be
do
.
it
be
very
hard
for
any
one
who
be
ever
do
writing
to
be
really
realise
that
very
many
be
not
do
thinking
,
remembering
,
it
be
a
very
hard
thing
to
be
realise
about
other
one
and
then
it
be
a
very
hard
thing
to
be
realise
that
some
who
would
naturally
be
think
the
kind
of
way
one
writing
be
think
be
not
ever
think
that
kind
of
a
way
about
anything
,
about
something
.
it
be
a
very
hard
thing
then
know
what
any
one
ever
be
see
,
feeling
,
think
,
I
be
all
alone
now
and
I
have
then
an
unreal
lonesome
feeling
,
it
be
like
a
little
boy
who
be
howl
and
they
all
rush
out
to
help
he
,
I
be
all
alone
,
he
say
,
and
all
of
a
sudden
it
have
scare
he
.
it
be
not
frightening
to
some
but
it
be
hard
work
for
they
then
for
such
a
one
may
then
perhaps
be
almost
in
need
of
begin
again
.




every
one
be
a
whole
one
in
I
and
now
a
little
every
one
be
in
fragment
inside
I
.
there
be
a
very
great
many
not
now
in
I
,
mostly
every
one
now
in
I
be
in
piece
inside
I
.
mostly
not
any
one
now
be
a
whole
one
inside
I
.
Alfred
Hersland
be
in
fragment
inside
I
,
I
will
now
begin
again
and
it
will
be
a
describing
of
piece
then
,
piece
of
perhaps
a
whole
one
.
perhaps
not
any
one
really
be
a
whole
one
inside
they
to
themselves
or
to
any
one
.
perhaps
every
one
be
in
piece
inside
they
and
perhaps
every
one
have
not
completely
in
they
their
own
be
inside
in
they
.
perhaps
each
one
be
in
piece
and
repeating
be
come
out
of
they
that
be
certain
but
as
repeat
of
piece
in
they
.
repeating
be
always
coin
out
of
each
one
that
be
certain
,
in
all
moment
of
despairing
that
be
certain
,
that
every
one
always
be
repeat
.
that
every
one
always
be
repeat
be
a
certain
thing
.




I
be
very
certain
of
that
thing
that
every
one
always
be
repeat
the
being
in
they
,
sometimes
it
be
to
I
as
piece
that
do
not
make
any
meaning
as
a
whole
one
.
mostly
always
sometime
each
one
be
a
whole
one
to
I
,
very
often
each
one
be
in
piece
to
I
.
always
every
one
be
repeat
,
repeat
and
repeat
the
being
in
they
and
always
repeat
be
come
out
of
each
one
,
always
all
through
all
the
living
they
be
do
,
always
all
their
living
and
sometimes
it
be
exciting
to
know
it
in
they
,
sometimes
a
very
dreary
thing
,
sometimes
a
very
discouraging
feeling
for
living
,
sometimes
a
friendly
one
and
sometimes
then
it
make
of
some
one
not
such
an
important
one
as
one
have
think
they
,
sometimes
then
it
make
of
some
one
a
more
important
one
than
one
have
think
they
,
sometimes
it
be
a
habit
in
one
to
expect
it
of
they
the
repeat
from
some
one
.




now
then
,
mostly
every
one
be
a
good
deal
in
piece
to
my
feeling
,
Alfred
Hersland
then
now
be
such
a
one
to
my
feeling
,
a
good
deal
in
piece
to
my
feeling
.
always
all
his
being
be
always
repeat
in
all
his
living
.
he
be
a
good
deal
in
piece
to
my
feeling
.




he
be
not
then
the
old
of
the
Hersland
child
,
he
be
young
than
Martha
and
that
always
make
a
difference
in
a
boy
's
living
,
not
that
Martha
be
very
important
to
he
in
his
early
living
but
there
come
to
be
for
he
when
it
come
to
be
in
he
when
he
be
a
go
to
be
young
man
and
be
come
to
feel
like
a
good
citizen
and
have
strong
family
feeling
,
it
come
to
he
then
to
be
direct
and
he
be
not
then
the
eld
of
the
Hersland
child
.
he
do
help
Martha
some
then
,
he
do
help
she
a
little
to
be
able
to
go
to
college
as
she
be
want
to
do
then
but
they
be
not
very
interesting
ever
to
each
other
Martha
and
Alfred
Hersland
,
a
little
then
when
she
be
to
go
to
college
Martha
be
a
little
interesting
to
Alfred
then
and
very
much
later
in
her
living
when
Alfred
be
have
trouble
long
after
he
have
be
marry
to
Julia
Dehning
he
be
a
little
then
a
little
interesting
to
Martha
who
be
then
take
care
of
her
father
in
Gossols
after
he
have
lose
their
great
fortune
.
Alfred
then
be
a
little
really
interested
in
Martha
when
she
be
leave
home
for
a
college
education
,
later
he
and
his
brother
David
be
a
little
interesting
one
to
the
other
one
when
they
be
live
in
Bridgepoint
together
after
Alfred
be
married
and
then
later
,
and
the
mother
Mrs.
Hersland
have
a
tender
feeling
in
she
for
the
clothe
Alfred
have
leave
with
she
and
the
room
he
have
sleep
in
,
when
he
leave
the
family
live
to
go
to
Bridgepoint
to
do
his
studying
,
and
Mr.
Hersland
he
never
have
in
he
a
very
certain
important
feeling
about
Alfred
except
a
little
when
he
might
have
be
need
he
or
when
a
little
Alfred
might
be
oppose
he
but
really
then
the
three
Hersland
child
not
any
of
they
be
really
important
ever
to
Mr.
David
Hersland
to
his
feeling
.
he
have
sometimes
a
kind
of
feel
about
one
or
the
other
of
they
because
of
something
,
some
specific
thing
,
but
mostly
Mr.
Hersland
be
as
big
as
all
the
world
in
his
feeling
.




every
one
to
I
just
now
be
in
piece
to
I
.
that
be
to
say
every
one
be
to
I
just
now
as
piece
to
I
.
that
be
to
say
that
each
complete
one
be
only
as
a
piece
to
I
,
that
all
there
be
of
each
one
at
anytime
in
they
give
to
I
a
feeling
of
piece
not
of
a
whole
thing
,
that
be
to
say
I
be
have
just
now
with
each
one
I
be
know
or
remember
a
feeling
an
emotion
from
they
as
if
they
be
each
one
not
a
whole
thing
.
I
have
this
perhaps
not
altogether
with
every
one
but
I
have
it
just
now
with
a
good
many
of
they
a
good
many
that
I
be
know
,
know
now
or
remember
now
and
most
of
the
time
now
I
have
such
a
feeling
.
a
little
it
come
to
I
I
be
certain
from
my
realisation
that
many
of
they
be
not
completely
think
or
feel
the
way
a
complete
one
of
their
kind
of
they
would
be
think
or
feeling
.
they
be
think
and
feel
in
piece
then
now
to
I
to
my
feeling
just
now
in
my
emotion
and
that
make
of
they
to
I
piece
of
being
,
make
all
there
be
of
they
of
each
one
,
not
whole
one
,
this
be
very
strongly
in
I
just
now
in
my
feeling
,
very
very
strongly
in
I
,
man
and
woman
very
many
of
they
those
I
be
know
those
I
be
remember
,
not
all
of
they
,
I
do
not
say
that
it
be
true
of
all
of
they
even
just
now
in
my
feeling
but
very
many
a
great
many
of
they
be
to
I
just
now
in
piece
to
I
.
there
be
piece
then
and
that
be
whole
being
,
there
be
a
piece
then
and
that
be
the
whole
being
of
some
one
,
they
may
be
,
such
a
one
may
be
completely
of
one
kind
of
be
,
but
it
be
only
a
piece
of
such
a
kind
of
be
as
that
one
be
in
be
.
it
be
not
such
a
very
joyous
feeling
,
have
the
emotion
of
have
every
one
as
a
piece
to
one
,
it
do
make
of
everything
a
thing
without
end
and
all
the
time
then
there
be
not
any
use
of
anything
keep
on
go
.
why
should
anything
any
one
keep
on
go
if
not
ever
at
any
time
anything
any
one
will
be
a
whole
one
,
what
be
the
use
of
anything
or
everything
keep
on
go
if
not
at
any
time
I
will
not
be
have
a
sensation
that
any
one
anything
will
be
a
whole
one
,
once
every
one
sometime
be
a
whole
one
,
now
mostly
every
one
be
a
piece
of
a
one
,
not
all
the
being
as
a
complete
one
and
yet
every
one
have
their
own
being
in
they
and
put
all
of
each
kind
of
they
together
to
make
a
whole
one
can
not
be
to
I
a
satisfaction
,
can
not
give
to
I
any
real
satisfaction
can
not
be
a
satisfactory
way
in
my
feeling
of
have
completion
of
have
anything
or
any
one
a
whole
one
can
not
give
to
I
any
reason
why
the
world
should
keep
on
be
,
there
be
not
any
reason
if
in
repeat
nothing
be
give
to
I
a
sensation
of
a
complete
one
,
I
have
then
this
in
I
now
and
mostly
every
one
I
be
know
or
remembering
be
to
I
just
now
a
piece
of
a
kind
of
being
and
every
one
be
themselves
inside
they
,
that
be
always
to
my
feeling
certain
and
so
then
feel
each
one
be
a
piece
of
a
kind
of
be
and
always
then
feel
each
one
be
entirely
exist
so
that
each
one
be
not
a
part
of
any
whole
thing
I
can
not
to
myself
have
any
very
real
satisfaction
from
get
together
all
the
one
there
be
of
a
kind
of
they
,
to
make
a
whole
one
,
that
is
,
not
to
my
feeling
,
that
can
not
give
to
I
an
emotion
of
satisfaction
,
that
be
not
to
my
feeling
satisfy
and
so
then
I
be
not
feel
each
one
be
sometime
to
I
a
whole
one
,
no
then
no
,
I
be
now
feel
that
mostly
all
of
they
every
one
I
be
know
every
one
I
be
remember
be
to
I
a
piece
of
being
and
so
then
there
be
not
any
use
in
the
world
go
on
exist
so
that
every
one
can
keep
on
with
repeat
a
piece
of
be
,
not
any

use
then
really
to
any
one
and
this
be
now
then
the
real
state
of
feeling
I
be
now
have
.




Alfred
Hersland
be
to
I
a
piece
of
be
,
he
be
not
in
I
a
whole
one
,
this
be
certain
,
mostly
every
one
be
to
I
a
piece
of
be
,
every
one
have
their
own
being
in
they
,
Alfred
Hersland
have
his
own
being
in
he
,
alright
,
I
know
it
of
every
one
,
I
know
it
that
every
one
have
their
own
being
in
they
,
I
know
it
and
always
I
feel
it
,
I
always
feel
it
and
I
always
know
it
,
every
one
have
their
own
being
in
they
yes
every
one
,
every
kind
of
a
one
,
every
one
that
ever
be
or
be
or
will
be
live
,
yes
,
alright
,
I
know
it
of
every
one
that
every
one
have
their
own
being
in
they
,
Alfred
Hersland
have
his
own
being
in
he
,
yes
every
one
have
their
own
being
in
they
,
yes
that
be
alright
,
I
know
that
of
they
,
I
know
that
very
well
of
they
,
I
know
every
one
have
their
own
being
in
they
,
I
feel
it
of
they
,
I
know

mostly
every
one
be
a
piece
of
be
,
not
a
whole
one
in
they
and
so
then
there
be
not
any
use
of
the
world
go
on
for
any
one
,
and
there
be
not
any
way
of
make
a
complete
one
of
any
be
by
put
together
all
of
some
kind
of
they
all
of
any
kind
of
they
for
each
one
have
their
own
being
in
they
and
so
after
all
there
be
not
any
way
of
make
a
whole
one
.
every
one
to
I
just
now
be
as
a
piece
to
I
,
that
be
to
say
each
one
mostly
be
not
a
complete
one
of
anything
to
my
feeling
,
each
one
just
now
to
my
feeling
be
a
piece
of
something
and
that
be
to
I
very
certain
by
my
very
strongly
realise
in
every
one
the
way
they
be
not
think
,
feel
a
complete
thing
of
their
kind
in
feeling
and
think
.
now
then
Alfred
Hersland
be
a
piece
of
be
to
I
and
now
I
will
tell
of
it
the
way
I
feel
it
in
I
,
the
way
I
feel
he
and
every
one
just
now
in
I
.




Alfred
Hersland
have
a
kind
of
be
in
he
that
in
some
who
have
it
in
they
make
of
they
very
good
one
,
some
not
such
very
good
one
.
this
be
in
a
way
true
of
every
kind
there
be
of
be
.
of
the
kind
of
one
that
Alfred
Hersland
be
in
his
being
they
range
from
very
good
one
through
to
pretty
bad
one
but
this
be
true
of
every
kind
there
be
of
man
and
woman
.
Alfred
have
it
in
he
to
have
his
being
in
he
so
that
it
be
a
little
passionate
in
he
,
not
very
affectionate
in
he
,
not
so
as
to
be
very
good
in
he
,
not
really
ever
very
bad
in
he
,
sometimes
as
aspiration
in
he
,
more
or
less
as
ambitious
in
he
,
sometimes
as
virtuous
and
didactic
in
he
.
the
kind
of
be
he
have
in
he
be
of
a
kind
of
be
that
in
some
have
it
in
they
make
of
they
devout
in
religion
,
make
of
they
mystic
in
religion
,
so
as
to
let
themselves
be
absorb
,
all
exist
,
some
of
they
have
this
kind
of
be
in
they
have
religion
in
they
but
then
it
be
like
that
in
the
grandfather
of
Alfred
Hersland
,
Mr.
Hissen
.
some
have
this
kind
of
be
in
they
be
meek
enough
in
living
and
yet
a
little
dominating
in
family
living
and
be
just
enough
in
thinking
and
impersonal
in
feeling
,
and
some
of
such
of
they
need
to
have
as
a
wife
to
they
some
one
very
vibratingly
exist
to
give
to
they
enough
stimulation
to
make
they
keep
really
alive
inside
they
.
all
these
then
be
of
the
resist
,
the
dependent
independent
kind
of
they
.
some
of
they
have
the
being
in
they
very
murkily
passionate
inside
and
some
of
these
then
be
try
to
engulf
every
one
near
they
to
be
lose
inside
they
,
to
be
swallow
by
they
and
some
of
they
be
not
interested
in
very
many
person
near
they
but
some
of
they
they
need
to
have
engulf
by
they
and
so
then
Alfred
Hersland
be
of
the
kind
of
they
the
resist
dependent
independent
kind
of
they
,
the
kind
that
own
those
they
need
for
loving
.
many
of
such
of
they
do
not
really
in
their
living
need
any
one
for
loving
,
in
a
way
Mr.
Hissen
the
old
man
important
in
religion
,
be
inside
he
all
there
be
of
religion
be
such
a
one
of
this
kind
of
they
.
Alfred
Hersland
then
to
my
feeling
have
be
in
he
as
piece
only
of
be
,
he
be
himself
inside
he
,
he
have
be
in
he
,
he
have
really
live
in
he
,
every
one
have
real
being
to
I
in
they
but
as
I
be
say
very
many
to
I
now
be
piece
of
be
and
yet
they
be
themselves
inside
they
,
I
know
that
of
they
,
I
know
that
in
they
,
I
know
that
in
myself
with
they
,
and
so
then
to
I
then
just
now
then
in
my
feeling
,
very
much
mostly
every
one
be
as
piece
of
living
,
piece
of
be
,
to
I
then
now
to
my
feeling
,
piece
everywhere
of
something
be
exist
and
repeat
,
repeat
of
piece
of
something
and
yet
whole
one
be
inside
they
be
repeat
all
around
I
as
live
,
feeling
,
being
,
think
,
exist
and
in
a
way
then
not
whole
one
and
not
a
part
of
anything
because
they
be
one
each
one
all
there
be
of
they
and
so
then
just
now
to
my
feeling
it
be
a
little
fragmentary
all
there
be
of
live
and
keeping
go
be
only
in
everything
because
it
be
not
end
yet
and
that
be
then
my
feeling
just
now
inside
I
and
Alfred
Hersland
be
to
I
a
real
being
but
not
have
completion
in
the
sense
of
a
whole
meaning
,
everything
then
every
one
,
that
be
mostly
every
one
mostly
everything
be
just
now
to
my
feeling
as
piece
of
being
,
piece
alive
completely
inside
they
and
so
always
repeat
as
a
whole
one
but
having
not
mean
as
a
whole
one
.
Alfred
Hersland
then
be
a
kind
of
they
he
have
a
kind
of
be
in
he
that
be
in
he
as
more
or
less
engulfing
,
somewhat
passionate
,
not
very
bad
,
certainly
not
very
good
,
engulf
resist
dependent
independent
being
,
need
to
own
those
he
would
need
for
loving
,
very
often
need
some
one
poignantly
alive
to
influence
he
.




of
the
kind
of
one
that
Alfred
Hersland
be
in
his
being
they
range
from
very
good
one
through
to
pretty
bad
one
,
from
very
tyrannical
one
to
very
just
one
,
from
very
good
one
through
to
pretty
bad
one
,
from
very
religious
one
to
completely
skeptical
one
,
from
very
dominant
one
to
very
meek
one
,
from
very
passionate
one
to
completely
indifferent
one
and
all
of
these
in
their
living
be
of
the
resist
kind
of
they
the
dependent
independent
kind
of
they
,
those
of
they
should
have
then
need
to
own
those
they
need
for
loving
.
Alfred
Hersland
then
have
in
he
to
be
a
little
passionate
and
engulf
,
a
little
meek
and
a
little
tyrannical
in
living
,
a
little
didactic
and
superior
in
aspire
,
and
certainly
not
really
a
very
good
one
and
in
religion
mostly
not
believe
and
yet
not
be
really
completely
certain
that
to
be
dead
be
to
be
really
completely
a
dead
one
,
he
have
it
a
little
in
he
to
be
a
little
go
to
be
save
himself
by
a
little
religion
in
himself
or
in
somebody
very
near
to
he
whom
in
a
way
then
he
be
own
.




of
the
kind
of
one
that
Alfred
Hersland
be
in
his
being
,
the
kind
of
they
man
and
woman
have
in
they
such
kind
of
be
range
from
very
good
one
through
to
pretty
bad
one
,
have
all
kind
of
mixture
in
they
,
have
every
kind
of
way
of
living
be
many
of
they
pretty
successful
in
live
,
some
very
successful
and
some
pretty
miserably
fail
,
some
pretty
steady
with
the
being
in
they
,
some
pretty
intermittent
and
some
meek
and
some
very
weak
in
being
and
all
this
be
true
of
every
kind
there
be
of
man
and
woman
.




I
be
think
now
of
six
of
they
that
have
such
a
kind
of
nature
in
they
like
that
in
Alfred
Hersland
and
these
have
it
very
differently
in
they
than
he
have
it
in
he
and
then
there
be
his
grandfather
Mr.
Hissen
of
whom
I
have
write
.
there
be
one
and
he
be
not
very
successful
not
very
not
successful
in
live
,
he
be
successful
enough
in
living
and
he
have
it
in
he
to
be
impersonal
and
just
and
kindly
enough
with
mostly
every
one
,
and
he
have
not
any
engulfing
passionate
nature
in
he
,
not
at
all
any
such
a
kind
of
this
kind
of
be
in
he
,
and
he
be
almost
altogether
certain
that
to
be
dead
be
to
be
really
a
dead
one
and
he
do
not
altogether
completely
like
it
such
a
feeling
and
he
could
be
a
little
not
certain
of
it
inside
he
though
mostly
altogether
he
be
certain
that
to
be
dead
be
to
be
really
truly
a
dead
one
and
he
like
it
very
well
that
his
wife
who
could
be
make
lively
living
feeling
be
very
certain
that
to
be
dead
be
not
at
all
to
be
a
dead
one
and
he
like
it
then
that
she
be
such
a
kind
of
one
and
mostly
then
this
one
be
successful
enough
in
living
,
and
kindly
and
not
meek
and
not
give
to
aggression
and
master
in
his
own
house
by
patient
overseeing
and
successful
enough
in
live
by
patient
persisting
and
this
then
be
all
there
be
now
to
be
write
of
the
living
this
one
have
in
he
.
this
one
then
be
of
the
resist
kind
of
they
that
have
it
in
they
not
to
be
engulf
,
not
to
be
aggressive
nor
meek
in
their
resist
winning
,
to
be
need
to
be
own
those
they
need
for
loving
but
to
be
only
love
one
human
being
,
to
be
kindly
but
impersonal
really
with
every
other
one
.
that
be
all
then
of
the
being
of
one
of
the
six
of
they
.




another
of
the
six
of
they
be
one
have
it
in
he
to
have
a
good
deal
in
he
of
the
engulfing
passionate
be
of
his
kind
of
they
but
the
being
in
he
be
not
really
ever
in
action
,
it
never
amount
to
any
more
in
he
than
to
be
a
little
wiggling
in
he
and
that
be
all
then
,
he
want
it
to
be
in
action
,
he
want
to
be
passionate
,
and
succeed
,
and
aspire
,
and
despairing
,
he
try
it
always
all
his
living
,
he
be
always
a
little
scare
and
fill
with
hope
his
family
for
the
despair
and
the
possible
activity
in
succeed
in
live
in
he
and
mostly
then
nothing
ever
happen
and
he
come
as
near
in
his
living
as
a
man
can
come
to
fail
who
be
not
completely
fail
in
living
.
he
love
a
very
pale
anaemic
woman
but
he
never
come
to
marry
,
he
be
always
a
man
consider
as
perhaps
promise
successful
living
and
so
it
go
on
and
on
and
he
be
an
old
one
and
still
he
himself
and
a
little
some
other
one
have
still
a
hopeful
feeling
that
this
one
would
sometime
be
really
succeed
,
would
really
be
do
something
.
this
then
have
be
a
very
little
description
of
another
one
of
the
six
of
they
.




another
one
of
they
have
the
passionate
murky
engulfing
be
in
he
in
a
completely
concentrated
form
that
make
he
active
,
sensitive
,
amusing
and
successful
,
quite
successful
in
live
.
he
be
always
love
but
it
never
be
a
trouble
to
he
,
he
be
so
active
he
never
be
know
that
he
be
engulf
the
other
one
,
that
he
own
those
he
need
for
love
.
he
be
a
very
active
,
sensitive
,
amusing
,
successful
enough
person
and
the
murky
engulfing
passionate
resist
being
that
make
he
be
so
concentrated
in
he
that
he
be
a
compactly
exist
being
and
in
a
way
not
interested
in
anything
or
any
one
he
be
not
just
then
really
need
.
he
be
a
very
nice
,
a
nice
,
amusing
,
sensitive
,
successful
enough
one
of
this
kind
of
they
,
the
passionate
engulf
resist
kind
of
they
,
in
this
one
this
being
be
quite
a
concentrated
pleasant
thing
.
this
be
then
all
there
will
now
be
write
of
this
one
.




another
one
have
it
in
he
to
be
completely
certain
in
all
his
acting
and
his
feeling
and
his
living
that
to
be
dead
be
to
be
a
dead
one
and
so
this
one
must
keep
on
be
a
live
one
and
must
have
everything
he
can
be
seize
to
keep
by
he
and
always
this
one
in
his
talking
and
his
thinking
and
his
feeling
be
very
certain
that
he
be
very
certain
that
to
be
dead
be
not
to
be
a
dead
one
and
if
it
be
,
what
then
,
a
really
noble
man
would
not
let
it
effect
he
and
he
be
most
certainly
such
a
one
.
this
one
then
have
this
being
,
the
resist
being
I
have
be
describe
as
not
really
in
he
as
engulf
as
not
really
in
he
not
engulf
,
as
not
really
in
he
as
passion
and
yet
as
just
enough
in
he
as
passion
to
give
he
a
little
something
that
make
it
that
mostly
one
would
not
trust
he
and
yet
that
for
very
many
he
have
some
real
attraction
.
this
one
have
some
aggression
of
resist
be
in
he
,
this
one
be
quite
successful
enough
in
live
.




this
one
that
I
be
now
begin
describe
have
murky
passionate
resist
being
but
its
action
in
he
be
very
intermittent
and
it
be
at
different
time
in
very
different
condition
in
he
.
sometimes
it
be
in
he
in
a
fairly
concentrated
condition
and
it
make
of
he
some
one
very
quick
and
sensitive
and
charming
and
a
musician
,
sometimes
it
be
very
quiet
in
he
and
then
sometimes
it
burst
out
as
uncontrollable
temper
in
he
.
twice
in
his
life
it
lead
to
loving
and
both
time
then
it
make
trouble
for
he
for
he
be
not
strong
enough
in
persist
to
be
able
to
keep
on
own
the
one
he
need
for
love
.
this
one
be
not
very
successful
in
live
.




this
one
be
very
successful
in
live
,
this
one
that
I
be
now
begin
describe
.
this
one
have
this
be
not
at
all
as
murky
not
at
all
as
engulf
,
he
have
it
in
he
as
efficient
emotion
,
as
active
practical
reasonably
aggressive
resistant
action
,
as
steadily
and
not
too
sensitively
in
he
,
as
warmly
affectionate
and
rationally
self
-
understanding
.
he
be
a
little
sentimental
and
this
be
all
the
weakness
there
be
in
he
.
the
being
in
he
be
perfectly
adjust
to
steadily
succeed
in
living
.
sometime
perhaps
there
will
be
a
very
long
history
write
of
he
and
four
other
very
like
he
,
perhaps
in
the
history
of
David
Hersland
and
George
Dehning
.




this
then
have
be
,
a
little
,
description
of
six
kind
of
be
that
be
kind

very
much
almost
not
any
feeling
of
the
living
,
the
rich
right
american
living
that
would
have
be
a
natural
living
for
she
to
be
have
.
she
be
to
her
feeling

nearly
altogether
like

to
work
to
earn
any
and
that
be
a
natural
thing
in
her

be
completely
of
they
and
this
be
in
she
all
of
her
young
living
.
in
Alfred
Hersland

be
a
little
different
,

way
Alfred

,
sometimes
some
with

then
a
little
beginning

a
good
citizen
,
that
he
be
the
old

Alfy
be
begin
then
to
have
such
a
feeling
about
himself
in
he
that

should
send
she
in
and
later
then
if
she
do
not
do
something
he
want
she
should
be
do
he
always

she
always
have
a
sullen
fear
inside
she
.
neither
of
they
then
as
I

that
they
be

.
he
be
never
then
leave
out
by
they
.
to
they
his
future

do
mostly
everything
they
be
do
with
they
.
he
be
himself
inside
he
,
later
as
I
be
say
he
have
some
feeling
in
he
that
he
never
have
be
cut
off
from
rich
american
living
,
later
then
this
come
to
be
in
he
,

still
then
do
everything
he
do
with
those
he
be
know
in
Gossols
where

so
do
his
music
teacher
Arragon
this
be
all
to
be
write
later
.




Alfred
Hersland
then
be
himself
inside
he
,
he
be
perhaps
not
a
very
complete
one
,
as
I
be
say
some
,
a
good
many
just
now
be
piece
to
I
,
they
be
themselves
inside
they
.
Alfred
Hersland
be
one
of
such
of
they
.
he
be
certainly
himself
inside
he
,
perhaps
he
be
not
such
a
very
complete

,
this
be
a
little
my
feeling
of
he
just
now
and
I
have
mention
it
again
.
he
be
himself

be
of
the
engulf
resist
kind
of
they
in

be
perhaps
not
a
very
complete
one
,

be
to
mostly
every
one
not
very
pleasant
not
very
unpleasant
,
he
be
not
popular
or
unpopular
with
man
or
with
woman
.
this
be
now
to
be
some
description
of
the
being
in
he
.




he
be
some
one
to
himself
inside

that
be
certain
,

be
now
to
be

of
man
and
woman
.
some
have
a
little
such
knowledge
in
they
about
some
one
when
they
have
know
that
one
completely
entirely
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
all
through
they
for
a
good
deal
of
the
living
in
they
.
some
even
then
be
very
apt
to
be
believe
that
any
minute
that
one
will
go
much
far
in
do
something
than
that
one
really
ever
will
be
do
,
much
less
far
in
do
something
than
that
one
be
really
ever
go
.
this
be
quite
common
.
there
be
a
very
great
many
who
be
very
certain
that
some
one
will
be
do
something
and
these
then
have
it
in
they
to
be
easily
quickly
very
completely
forget
all
the
time
they
be
mistaken
.
but
then
it
certainly
be
certain
that
some
have
more
feeling
for
what
other
be
go
to
be
do
from
minute
to
minute
in
their
living
than
other
have
it
in
they
.
some
have
an
exaggerated
notion
of
the
way
they
do
not
have
it
in
they
.
but
some
and
I
mention
it
for
I
be
one
of
such
of
they
have
practice
very
often
in
think
to
be
plan
the
action
of
some
one
they
be
know
very
well
in
living
and
always
then
though
often
they
know
the
general
direction
mostly
always
they
think
something
be
go
to
be
happen
much
soon
than
it
do
really
happen
or
much
later
than
it
do
really
happen
or
much
more
strongly
than
that
one
be
go
to
do
that
thing
or
much
more
weakly
than
that
one
be
go
to
be
do
that
thing
and
very
often
then
too
such
a
one
be
wrong
about
the
kind
of
action
that
some
one
they
be
know
very
well
be
go
to
be
do
.
I
be
very
busy
mention
this
thing
because
I
have
always
be
very
interested
in
see
how
very
wrong
I
can
be
when
I
be
tell
about
any
one
how
they
be
go
to
be
live
from
day
to
day
in
their
living
.
and
yet
more
and
more
in
my
living
I
come
to
be
more
understanding
of
the
complete
meaning
of
the
being
in
each
one
I
be
know
,
I
get
to
be
more
able
more
and
more
to
know
of
they
what
will
be
the
quality
of
living
of
work
in
they
what
on
the
whole
will
be
the
quality
of
succeed
and
fail
in
they
and
always
then
I
want
to
be
mistaken
I
want
to
make
mistake
so
that
I
can
see
something
in
they
which
make
of
that
one
a
more
complete
one
,
always
then
I
want
to
be
more
certain
of
all
the
variation
that
make
some
one
so
very
much
like
some
one
really
different
from
that
one
.
always
then
more
and
more
I
want
to
be
feel
completely
feel
the
complete
being
,
all
the
being
in
each
one
I
be
ever
know
and
feel
in
they
the
kind
and
quality
and
quantity
of
work
and
living
and
love
in
they
.
I
can
never
have
really
much
feeling
of
what
specifically
they
will
be
do
from
moment
to
moment
in
their
living
I
have
not
any
dramatic
imagination
for
action
in
they
,
I
only
can
know
about
action
in
they
from
know
action
they
have
be
do
any
of
they
,
I
mention
this
so
that
every
one
can
be
certain
I
do
not
know
this
about
any
one
any
man
or
woman
,
I
tell
about
the
living
in
they
from
the
living
they
have
have
in
they
I
can
not
ever
construct
action
for
they
to
be
do
,
I
have
certainly
constructive
imagination
for
be
in
they
,
sometimes
with
very
little
watching
I
have
pretty
complete
realisation
of
pretty
nearly
all
the
being
in
they
.
I
just
feel
like
mention
this
thing
and
so
I
have
just
mention
it
here
so
that
every
one
can
be
certain
that
I
have
not
any
dramatic
constructive
imagination
.
I
be
always
more
and
more
and
that
be
certain
realise
under
stand
construct
with
complete
imagination
the
complete
be
each
one
of
man
and
woman
.
the
actual
thing
each
one
be
do
I
only
know
from
know
the
actual
detail
in
the
actual
living
of
each
actual
one
I
be
ever
know
.
I
certainly
more
and
more
be
always
more
and
more
realise
the
being
in
each
one
I
be
see
.
I
be
always
more
and
more
realise
kind
in
man
and
woman
,
the
being
in
each
one
of
each
kind
of
they
.
I
have
mention
this
because
I
have
be
feel
for
some
time
like
mention
this
thing
,
sometime
I
will
make
more
of
this
and
will
illustrate
it
then
.
this
will
come
to
be
do
very
much
later
in
my
living
.
of
that
I
be
almost
certain
.




now
there
will
be
some
description
of
the
being
in
Alfred
Hersland
and
then
after
that
have
be
a
little
write
there
will
be
write
more
history
of
his
Gossols
live
and
more
description
of
those
with
whom
lie
be
then
in
his
daily
living
.
there
will
then
be
write
a
description
of
he
in
his
Bridgepoint
living
and
of
his
later
marry
Julia
Dehning
and
of
every
one
whom
he
know
just
then
and
then
there
will
be
more
history
write
and
there
will
be
more
and
on
and
on
then
until
somewhere
nearly
to
the
end
of
he
.
and
then
sometime
later
there
will
be
write
the
ending
of
he
and
of
his
generation
in
the
Hersland
live
.




this
then
be
now
to
be
a
little
description
of
the
being
that
be
he
,
as
I
be
say
be
be
interesting
to
I
and
I
have
some
understanding
of
be
in
man
and
woman
.
as
I
be
say
the
being
in
Alfred
Hersland
be
more
or
less
like
a
piece
of
a
whole
one
but
always
he
have
his
own
being
in
he
,
in
a
way
he
be
himself
inside
he
and
this
be
now
a
little
description
of
my
feeling
about
be
in
he
,
about
be
in
a
good
many
man
and
woman
.
almost
every
one
sometime
be
a
piece
of
one
not
a
whole
one
,
almost
every
one
sometime
be
a
whole
one
.
this
be
true
of
many
man
and
woman
to
I
of
mostly
every
one
.
I
will
now
try
to
understand
my
meaning
in
this
feeling
.




to
be
use
a
new
word
in
my
writing
be
to
I
a
very
difficult
thing
.
every
word
I
be
ever
use
in
writing
have
for
I
very
exist
being
.
use
a
word
I
have
not
yet
be
use
in
my
writing
be
to
I
very
difficult
and
a
peculiar
feeling
.
sometimes
I
be
use
a
new
one
,
sometimes
I
feel
new
meaning
in
an
old
one
,
sometimes
I
like
one
I
be
very
fond
of
that
one
one
that
have
many
meaning
many
way
of
be
use
to
make
different
meaning
to
every
one
.
sometimes
I
like
it
,
almost
always
I
like
it
when
I
be
feel
many
way
of
use
one
word
in
writing
.
sometimes
I
like
it
that
different
way
of
emphasising
can
make
very
different
meaning
in
a
phrase
or
sentence
I
have
make
and
be
reread
.
always
in
write
it
,
it
be
in
I
only
one
thing
,
a
little
I
like
it
sometimes
that
there
can
be
very
different
way
of
read
the
thing
I
have
be
write
with
only
one
feeling
of
a
meaning
.
this
be
a
pleasant
thing
,
sometimes
I
be
very
well
pleased
with
this
thing
,
very
often
then
I
be
like
a
word
that
can
have
many
way
of
feeling
in
it
,
it
be
really
a
very
difficult
thing
to
I
to
be
use
a
word
I
have
not
yet
be
use
in
writing
.
I
may
know
very
well
the
meaning
of
a
word
and
yet
it
have
not
for
I
completely
weight
and
form
and
really
exist
being
.
there
be
only
a
few
word
and
with
these
mostly
always
I
be
write
that
have
for
I
completely
entirely
exist
being
,
in
talk
I
use
many
more
of
they
of
word
I
be
not
live
but
talk
be
another
thing
,
in
talk
one
can
be
say
mostly
anything
,
often
then
I
be
use
many
word
I
never
could
be
use
in
writing
.
in
write
a
word
must
be
for
I
really
an
exist
thing
,
it
have
a
place
for
I
as
live
,
this
be
the
way
I
feel
about
I
write
.
I
have
be
mention
this
thing
for
I
be
just
now
feel
a
learning
in
I
for
some
word
I
have
just
be
begin
use
in
my
writing
.
now
I
be
go
on
with
a
description
of
being
,
of
be
in
piece
and
as
whole
one
to
my
feeling
,
of
be
in
Alfred
Hersland
as
I
be
say
.




I
will
not
go
on
about
piece
and
whole
one
in
everybody
be
be
.
each
one
mostly
sometimes
be
a
whole
one
to
I
.
very
often
later
then
they
be
piece
to
I
some
that
have
be
sometimes
completely
whole
one
to
I
.
that
happen
then
to
I
quite
often
,
that
happen
to
I
again
and
again
.
sometimes
some
one
I
have
be
feel
as
a
completely
whole
one
from
the
love
be
in
that
one
come
then
to
I
all
of
a
sudden
to
be
love
love
more
than
love
some
one
something
and
that
one
then
be
a
piece
of
one
to
I
,
not
any
long
the
whole
one
I
be
feel
.
then
I
begin
again
very
often
and
make
of
this
one
a
new
whole
one
begin
again
with
this
piece
and
remember
everything
I
ever
know
of
this
one
.
one
then
have
be
to
I
a
whole
one
have
complete
love
being
,
such
a
one
then
come
to
have
to
I
love
love
more
than
love
anything
and
that
realisation
of
that
one
make
that
one
to
I
then
not
a
whole
one
.
this
may
come
to
I
of
some
one
,
of
any
one
,
of
all
who
be
whole
one
to
I
,
I
may
have
in
I
then
some
realisation
of
they
and
that
realisation
make
they
not
a
whole
one
.
every
one
be
not
a
whole
one
,
now
I
be
wait
a
little
for
an
inspiration
about
this
thing
to
explain
completely
my
feeling
.
I
will
now
soon
be
tell
my
feeling
about
man
and
woman
,
about
whole
be
in
they
,
about
they
as
a
piece
of
live
each
one
about
they
always
all
each
one
have
their
own
being
in
they
,
always
then
each
one
of
they
each
one
who
ever
be
or
be
or
will
be
live
.
then
there
will
be
a
complete
description
of
be
in
Alfred
Hersland
for
my
realisation
.




Alfred
Hersland
be
of
a
kind
in
man
and
woman
as
I
be
say
.
he
be
the
eld
son
but
not
the
eld
child
as
I
be
say
,
and
that
have
some
effect
on
he
as
I
be
say
.
I
be
write
everything
as
I
be
learn
anything
.
I
be
write
everything
as
I
be
learn
anything
,
as
I
be
feel
anything
in
any
one
as
be
,
as
lam
have
a
realisation
of
any
one
,
I
be
say
everything
then
as
I
be
full
up
then
with
a
thing
,
with
anything
of
any
one
.
I
be
certain
that
some
be
sometime
whole
one
to
I
,
that
some
be
sometimes
a
piece
of
their
kind
of
they
in
I
,
always
I
be
certain
each
one
be
exist
,
they
be
themselves
inside
they
,
sometime
mostly
every
one
be
a
whole
one
to
my
feeling
,
very
often
before
then
very
often
after
then
that
one
be
not
a
whole
one
in
my
feeling
;
that
one
be
a
piece
of
the
kind
of
be
that
be
the
being
they
be
of
in
be
.
this
come
then
very
often
to
be
in
my
feeling
and
just
now
I
be
quite
a
little
far
from
certain
that
each
one
be
a
whole
one
and
always
I
be
certain
somehow
always
each
one
be
exist
inside
they
and
that
in
a
way
sometimes
give
to
I
a
very
unsatisfactory
way
of
feel
be
for
not
any
one
then
be
completely
a
whole
one
to
my
feeling
mostly
not
any
one
and
yet
they
be
not
each
one
part
of
a
being
to
my
feeling
each
one
then
be
exist
inside
in
they
and
I
be
then
not
very
well
satisfied
with
my
feeling
all
be
.
I
be
have
that
kind
of
feel
a
good
deal
when
several
of
they
that
have
be
completely
whole
one
to
my
feeling
be
not
any
long
such
completely
whole
one
,
as
I
be
say
this
can
happen
in
they
from
realise
that
they
be
not
original
but
anticipatorily
suggestible
some
one
that
be
to
I
as
one
completely
self
-
suggest
in
living
,
or
it
can
come
from
some
one
having
be
a
completely
love
being
and
then
this
one
be
not
really
love
the
one
they
be
completely
love
and
loving
be
not
the
complete
be
in
they
.
some
come
to
be
piece
of
themselves
as
a
whole
one
from
there
be
anger
in
they
,
failure
,
stupid
being
that
make
a
dead
piece
in
they
,
uncertain
being
,
weakness
in
they
sometimes
make
of
they
a
piece
sometimes
of
their
whole
one
and
some
and
a
little
in
a
way
Alfred
Hersland
be
such
a
one
never
come
to
be
a
whole
one
to
I
,
he
always
have
be
a
piece
of
himself
as
a
whole
being
and
now
I
begin
again
.




I
have
not
be
very
interesting
in
explain
be
in
man
and
woman
in
my
feeling
as
I
be
just
now
have
it
a
good
deal
in
I
.
that
be
quite
certain
,
sometime
later
I
will
do
it
again
.
now
I
will
begin
with
the
being
in
Alfred
Hersland
.
I
be
not
yet
quite
full
up
with
the
being
in
he
.
again
I
be
beginning
wait
.
again
I
be
begin
a
little
to
feel
he
.
I
be
still
hope
to
be
more
certain
in
my
feeling
.
I
be
wait
and
wait
,
I
have
not
in
I
now
any
impatient
feeling
.
piece
in
be
,
whole
one
in
be
,
word
say
what
I
be
want
,
word
have
existence
in
they
to
my
feeling
,
Alfred
Hersland
and
the
being
in
he
and
the
kind
he
be
of
man
and
woman
all
these
thing
will
come
soon
to
be
more
completely
in
I
,
that
be
certain
.




Alfred
Hersland
be
of
a
kind
of
man
and
woman
.
this
be
now
some
description
of
that
kind
of
they
.




some
one
seem
to
be
talk
in
such
a
very
different
kind
of
way
to
mostly
every
one
than
I
be
ever
hear
from
that
one
and
sometimes
then
I
do
not
think
of
any
one
really
tell
I
what
that
other
one
have
be
say
,
at
least
it
be
a
very
difficult
thing
to
realise
that
one
can
have
such
a
free
talking
in
he
when
always
I
have
not
hear
it
come
out
of
he
.
for
many
year
I
be
slowly
learn
that
very
often
some
one
be
not
talk
in
my
hearing
the
way
he
be
talk
when
some
one
else
be
listen
.
for
very
many
it
be
a
very
difficult
thing
to
be
realise
the
effect
they
have
on
man
and
woman
.
I
have
often
be
listen
again
and
again
to
some
one
,
have
be
very
much
with
they
and
always
then
they
have
,
that
one
a
certain
kind
of
way
of
talk
that
seem
then
to
be
the
completely
natural
way
of
talk
in
they
,
I
have
see
such
of
they
talk
from
suffer
,
from
excited
feeling
,
from
happy
feeling
in
they
,
from
gayety
and
from
be
very
serious
inside
they
and
then
some
one
tell
I
about
they
about
such
a
one
that
that
one
say
such
and
such
a
thing
in
talk
be
always
say
such
and
such
a
kind
of
thing
always
in
talk
and
that
be
then
to
I
astonishing
,
very
astonishing
,
and
then
sometime
I
realise
it
of
they
slowly
that
such
a
one
,
that
one
,
can
be
say
that
thing
,
always
have
such
a
kind
of
talk
come
out
of
they
that
it
be
a
natural
thing
in
they
and
slowly
then
always
then
I
be
always
learn
how
each
one
be
talk
to
every
one
,
and
more
and
more
then
slowly
then
I
be
listen
.




a
little
again
now
to
I
each
one
be
a
whole
one
sometime
.
a
good
deal
to
I
now
yet
each
one
be
a
piece
of
living
and
always
inside
they
be
their
own
being
.
always
to
I
there
be
kind
in
man
and
woman
that
be
certain
and
now
then
to
begin
again
describe
the
kind
of
one
Alfred
Hersland
be
in
living
,
all
the
kind
there
be
of
that
kind
of
they
,
all
the
kind
of
way
there
be
in
I
of
learn
they
of
feel
they
.




there
be
a
kind
of
a
kind
of
they
and
Alfred
Hersland
be
one
of
this
kind
of
a
one
,
one
of
the
kind
of
they
that
be
one
kind
of
the
engulf
resist
kind
of
they
that
have
it
mostly
all
of
they
to
have
it
that
mostly
every
one
know
they
feel
it
of
they
know
it
in
they
that
they
be
a
piece
of
be
and
always
they
have
it
in
they
very
many
of
they
to
be
very
alive
inside
they
,
to
be
to
themselves
a
be
very
much
living
and
aspiring
,
very
much
really
exist
.
there
be
a
kind
of
every
kind
there
be
of
be
that
have
it
in
they
to
be
a
piece
of
be
very
much
to
every
one
and
those
then
those
of
that
kind
of
they
be
active
inside
they
in
be
,
be
active
and
aspiring
,
be
very
completely
live
one
in
their
exist
and
these
then
be
a
good
deal
to
a
good
many
know
they
completely
a
piece
of
being
and
as
I
be
say
there
be
some
kind
of
every
general
kind
there
be
in
man
and
woman
of
all
the
kind
of
they
there
be
some
kind
of
each
kind
of
they
that
have
this
in
they
the
be
to
mostly
every
one
know
they
as
piece
of
a
being
and
as
I
be
say
some
of
these
kind
of
they
be
very
active
and
aspire
in
their
being
and
their
living
and
Alfred
Hersland
be
one
of
such
of
they
and
now
I
be
beginning
inquire
into
the
being
of
such
of
they
into
the
being
of
all
of
such
of
they
who
have
it
in
they
to
be
to
very
many
know
they
piece
of
be
and
have
active
and
completely
aspire
be
in
they
completely
and
continuously
aspire
be
in
they
.
Alfred
Hersland
then
be
such
a
one
.
as
I
be
say
he
be
of
the
engulfing
resist
being
,
as
I
be
say
he
have
active
and
aspire
be
in
he
,
as
I
be
say
he
be
mostly
to
every
one
ever
know
he
a
piece
of
being
and
this
be
now
to
be
a
history
of
the
living
in
he
,
a
description
of
the
being
in
he
,
an
inquiring
into
the
connection
in
be
between
he
and
all
those
other
one
that
like
he
be
piece
of
be
to
mostly
every
one
know
they
.
there
be
a
very
great
many
man
and
woman
that
be
such
of
they
.
Alfred
Hersland
be
of
these
then
be
such
a
one
this
be
now
then
again
the
continue
of
realise
the
kind
of
they
that
have
it
in
they
to
be
a
piece
of
be
to
mostly
every
one
know
they
.
Alfred
Hersland
as
I
be
say
all
his
living
be
such
a
one
,
be
one
of
this
kind
of
they
.




some
one
have
milk
bring
to
the
house
by
the
milkman
and
it
be
waste
and
yet
always
that
one
be
continue
have
that
amount
of
milk
bring
in
because
that
one
be
think
that
sometime
that
one
will
be
a
sick
one
and
then
if
the
milkman
have
not
the
habit
of
bring
milk
every
day
to
that
one
then
when
that
one
be
a
sick
one
that
one
will
not
have
milk
bring
every
day
by
a
milkman
.
it
will
be
too
late
then
to
be
begin
then
when
that
one
be
so
sick
that
one
can
not
go
out
to
order
anything
.
one
have
in
that
one
a
feeling
that
nothing
should
be
waste
by
any
one
live
can
have
such
a
way
of
do
with
a
milkman
bring
milk
for
that
one
.
such
a
one
can
have
it
that
that
one
never
throw
away
anything
,
never
waste
anything
in
living
and
always
there
be
more
milk
there
than
that
one
can
be
use
in
the
daily
living
,
in
a
kind
of
a
way
this
be
very
common
,
not
about
milk
leave
,
but
about
a
way
of
feeling
in
living
and
a
way
of
act
.
this
be
in
a
way
common
.
mostly
then
I
have
just
now
a
feeling
mostly
such
a
one
be
part
of
a
being
.
mostly
just
now
I
have
a
good
deal
of
such
feeling
that
every
one
be
not
a
whole
one
that
each
one
be
not
ever
a
complete
one
.
one
quite
young
one
be
love
another
one
and
that
one
be
say
to
the
one
that
one
be
love
,
I
only
love
they
like
you
with
dark
hair
and
brown
eye
for
I
be
a
blond
one
and
I
could
only
be
love
a
dark
one
.
then
this
one
see
a
picture
of
another
one
,
I
could
love
that
one
say
this
one
.
but
that
one
be
a
blond
one
,
the
one
this
one
be
think
of
love
tell
this
one
and
you
just
say
you
could
only
love
a
dark
one
,
yes
that
be
true
but
I
think
I
could
love
that
one
,
and
this
be
very
common
,
and
always
there
be
very
many
have
it
always
in
they
that
they
be
a
piece
of
being
and
always
each
one
be
a
whole
one
in
the
sense
that
each
one
be
be
really
in
they
be
exist
and
sometimes
then
very
often
there
be
to
I
not
any
kind
of
a
whole
one
really
in
any
one
and
anything
and
now
I
be
not
really
care
any
more
anyway
about
this
thing
,
about
be
be
a
whole
one
in
any
one
in
any
way
.




always
there
be
very
many
of
every
kind
there
be
in
man
and
woman
who
be
to
mostly
every
one
know
they
piece
of
living
,
they
be
themselves
too
inside
they
.
perhaps
Alfred
Hersland
be
one
of
these
,
I
be
now
begin
a
description
of
the
kind
of
be
the
kind
he
be
of
man
and
woman
have
in
they
.




these
then
all
of
they
have
it
in
they
that
they
be
resist
and
some
of
they
be
engulf
in
resist
and
some
of
they
be
slowly
resist
and
many
of
they
be
superficially
attack
and
all
of
they
have
it
in
they
to
some
way
own
those
they
need
for
love
.




mostly
then
these
the
resist
kind
in
man
and
woman
have
it
in
they
to
feel
very
strongly
the
completely
exist
of
everything
,
they
have
it
in
they
to
be
certain
that
everything
in
a
way
be
make
out
of
real
earth
the
way
it
be
do
to
make
Adam
that
be
to
say
the
resist
kind
of
they
in
their
feeling
have
it
to
be
certain
that
a
thing
be
exist
more
than
that
a
thing
have
a
use
and
can
give
to
they
an
emotion
.
these
have
it
in
they
then
mostly
that
emotion
be
not
as
poignant
in
they
as
sensation
,
that
be
then
their
way
of
be
although
as
I
have
be
say
some
of
such
of
they
can
be
engulf
,
some
vacant
in
they
,
some
certain
that
to
be
they
be
to
be
attack
to
be
quick
and
poignant
in
emotion
and
to
be
that
to
mostly
every
one
see
they
do
their
living
.
in
a
way
though
always
it
be
true
of
all
of
they
all
of
those
have
in
they
this
be
I
be
now
describe
,
that
they
have
a
slow
sure
feeling
that
everything
be
make
out
of
earth
and
have
that
kind
of
very
certain
exist
.
sometime
I
be
hope
to
make
it
completely
clear
inside
I
and
in
my
express
the
two
kind
there
be
in
man
and
woman
and
all
the
kind
there
be
of
these
two
kind
of
they
.
to
begin
again
with
the
kind
Alfred
Hersland
be
in
living
,
the
kind
he
be
and
some
of
the
kid
more
or
less
connect
in
kind
with
his
kind
of
they
.
I
be
go
on
now
with
a
history
of
he
,
a
complete
history
of
he
.




some
always
be
lie
when
any
one
be
ask
anything
and
then
they
come
to
be
say
I
do
n't
know
that
thing
and
then
they
come
to
tell
the
true
story
about
that
thing
.
that
be
the
way
they
do
about
everything
about
anything
and
this
be
quite
common
.




it
be
very
hard
to
know
it
of
any
one
whether
they
be
lie
that
be
to
say
it
be
very
hard
to
know
it
in
any
one
whether
they
be
know
the
relation
between
what
they
be
say
and
what
have
happen
what
be
happen
to
they
.
it
be
a
very
difficult
thing
to
know
it
of
any
one
whether
they
,
to
themselves
,
be
say
what
be
not
what
they
be
think
.
lie
,
stupid
be
in
man
and
woman
,
religion
,
aspiration
,
sensitiveness
to
any
one
to
anything
in
man
and
woman
,
appreciation
and
enthusiasm
,
emotion
and
be
afraid
in
they
of
something
of
anything
of
everything
of
any
one
,
of
almost
every
one
,
all
these
then
be
very
interesting
in
man
and
woman
and
very
often
,
very
very
often
it
be
a
necessary
thing
to
know
all
the
being
every
bit
of
the
being
in
any
one
to
know
it
of
they
what
they
have
in
they
of
these
thing
inside
they
of
lying
and
aspiration
and
stupid
being
and
virtuous
feeling
and
important
feeling
and
religion
and
fear
and
realisation
of
material
exist
.
it
be
necessary
then
to
know
of
some
all
the
being
in
they
to
be
certain
of
they
whether
they
be
lie
,
whether
they
be
feel
,
whether
they
be
believe
,
whether
they
be
understand
,
whether
they
be
afraid
,
whether
they
be
good
,
whether
they
be
bad
,
whether
they
be
important
inside
in
they
to
themselves
inside
they
.
it
be
a
very
difficult
thing
then
to
know
the
be
really
in
mostly
every
one
.
very
often
when
some
one
be
know
the
complete
being
of
some
one
that
one
be
still
only
a
piece
of
a
being
,
there
be
not
in
the
being
of
that
one
a
quality
of
completion
,
there
be
no
reason
why
that
one
from
the
being
in
that
one
should
keep
on
exist
,
should
have
keep
on
exist
and
when
that
one
be
a
dead
one
it
be
an
accidental
kind
of
thing
that
that
one
should
be
an
ended
one
,
it
be
not
a
complete
or
a
cut
off
thing
the
ended
one
,
and
that
be
a
very
common
thing
to
be
feel
about
many
man
and
many
woman
.
this
be
a
kind
of
feel
almost
every
one
know
he
have
about
Alfred
Hersland
as
I
have
be
say
again
and
again
.




I
will
now
give
some
description
of
a
considerable
number
of
man
and
woman
of
kind
connect
in
kind
with
the
kind
of
man
and
woman
of
which
Alfred
Hersland
be
one
.
there
will
be
now
some
description
of
each
one
of
a
considerable
number
of
man
and
woman
each
of
a
kind
of
man
and
woman
of
one
kind
of
the
kind
of
they
that
be
connect
in
kind
with
the
kind
of
they
of
which
Alfred
Hersland
be
one
.
in
the
description
of
these
there
will
be
an
explanation
with
the
description
of
each
one
of
they
of
the
way
each
one
be
a
complete
one
sometimes
to
some
one
or
not
a
complete
one
.




there
will
then
now
be
a
description
of
a
considerable
number
of
man
and
woman
,
there
will
be
then
now
some
further
expression
of
the
feeling
some
one
every
one
have
about
some
one
about
every
one
.
there
will
be
now
perhaps
more
understanding
of
the
way
each
one
be
or
be
not
sometime
a
complete
one
.
there
will
now
perhaps
be
some
understanding
of
lying
,
aspiration
,
religion
,
feeling
,
being
,
think
,
in
a
considerable
number
of
man
and
woman
,
in
a
number
of
kind
of
the
resist
kind
of
be
in
man
and
woman
.
to
really
again
begin
then
.
later
there
will
be
a
complete
history
of
Alfred
Hersland
,
later
there
will
be
a
complete
history
of
Julia
Dehning
.




to
begin
now
then
just
now
with
little
description
of
a
considerable
number
of
man
and
woman
who
all
of
they
be
some
kind
of
the
resist
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
to
begin
this
then
.
some
as
I
have
say
already
somewhere
early
in
my
writing
,
some
of
the
resist
kind
of
they
have
it
in
they
to
have
generalise
feeling
that
be
of
ideal
aspiration
and
concrete
feeling
that
be
in
continual
action
and
of
very
material
seize
and
hold
.
some
as
I
have
be
say
already
in
my
description
have
it
in
they
to
be
completely
certain
that
to
be
dead
be
to
be
really
truly
a
dead
one
and
always
then
perhaps
to
be
a
dead
one
be
not
to
be
really
truly
a
dead
one
and
it
be
a
good
thing
then
to
be
married
to
one
who
be
certain
that
to
be
dead
be
not
to
be
really
a
truly
dead
one
.
this
be
true
of
some
this
be
true
of
the
first
one
that
I
be
now
describe
.
this
one
be
not
meek
not
aggressive
not
arrogant
not
egotistical
in
living
,
this
one
could
have
resist
in
he
,
this
one
like
very
many
have
such
a
kind
of
be
be
fairly
slow
in
action
and
in
feeling
,
if
he
be
not
slow
in
feeling
and
in
acting
and
in
listen
such
a
one
would
not
be
certain
that
he
himself
be
do
that
acting
,
listen
,
feeling
,
such
a
one
would
be
think
that
something
be
happen
,
it
would
be
over
and
that
one
would
not
be
realise
that
he
himself
be
listen
,
feeling
,
act
,
and
this
be
very
common
with
many
have
in
they
dependent
independent
resisting
being
.
this
first
one
then
that
I
be
now
begin
describe
have
resist
be
as
fairly
sensitive
being
as
slowly
react
be
as
not
at
all
engulf
be
,
as
a
complete
be
only
this
one
be
not
quite
entirely
certain
that
to
be
dead
be
to
be
a
really
dead
one
and
he
like
it
that
the
wife
that
he
have
always
with
he
be
certain
that
to
be
dead
be
not
to
be
at
all
a
dead
one
.
this
one
that
I
be
describe
,
this
first
one
have
resist
be
as
completely
sensitive
,
fairly
slowly
react
,
this
one
be
not
meek
not
aggressive
in
living
,
this
one
be
persistently
and
patiently
and
in
detail
dominate
in
family
living
,
this
one
be
very
just
in
thinking
and
in
judging
,
this
one
have
not
very
much
imagination
and
be
impersonal
in
feeling
,
this
one
have
pleasant
affection
,
this
one
have
completely
honest
action
,
this
one
have
a
good
deal
of
fear
a
good
deal
of
affection
in
he
,
this
one
be
quite
a
good
man
in
living
,
this
one
be
pretty
certain
that
everything
be
exist
,
this
one
have
love
and
such
thing
reasonably
in
he
,
this
one
could
have
it
in
he
to
have
it
that
he
find
himself
even
a
well
one
than
he
really
be
in
living
but
really
he
be
a
very
good
one
in
living
and
though
a
little
he
have
the
abstract
conception
of
himself
as
a
more
ideal
one
than
he
be
in
concrete
feeling
,
mostly
he
be
realise
pretty
completely
all
that
he
be
really
experience
,
only
a
little
he
be
not
realise
that
have
a
little
fear
in
he
that
to
be
dead
be
not
to
be
really
a
dead
one
do
not
make
in
he
an
experiencing
that
he
be
a
well
one
than
actual
living
in
he
make
he
.
he
be
as
I
be
say
glad
to
be
have
a
wife
who
be
completely
certain
that
know
that
to
be
dead
be
not
to
be
at
all
a
really
dead
one
make
every
one
a
very
much
well
one
than
each
one
really
be
in
living
.
this
be
then
a
complete
history
of
the
being
in
this
one
.
this
one
then
be
a
sensitive
,
slowly
react
,
fairly
affectionate
,
quite
good
,
reasonably
just
and
a
little
fearful
and
quite
impersonal
and
somewhat
love
quite
very
good
resisting
independent
dependent
one
.
this
one
be
pretty
completely
a
whole
one
to
himself
and
to
mostly
every
one
,
this
one
then
be
different
from
the
one
I
be
next
go
to
be
describe
in
be
a
completely
slowly
react
completely
sensitive
one
.




this
one
that
I
be
now
describe
be
of
a
kind
of
one
that
be
very
many
of
they
quite
successful
in
live
.
this
be
now
a
description
of
several
of
they
.
this
be
a
kind
of
resist
dependent
independent
man
and
woman
.




these
have
it
in
they
mostly
to
make
every
one
feel
it
about
they
that
they
be
very
strong
one
in
living
,
they
have
solidity
in
they
,
they
be
like
wood
or
iron
and
have
a
solid
being
in
they
and
every
one
know
they
be
certain
that
they
be
good
one
and
they
be
independent
and
intelligent
and
loyal
and
not
timeserve
and
yet
always
they
be
succeed
in
living
succeed
in
loving
,
a
little
arrogant
but
not
unpleasant
to
mostly
every
one
know
they
,
very
successfully
know
successful
people
in
their
living
though
not
seek
to
know
such
one
,
it
just
come
to
they
.
some
of
such
one
be
not
completely
successful
in
living
,
some
of
such
one
have
a
pride
that
be
a
little
more
sensitive
than
the
be
really
in
they
,
some
have
a
romantic
imagination
that
be
too
active
for
the
being
in
they
but
mostly
this
kind
of
they
be
very
successful
in
living
and
this
be
to
be
now
a
little
more
description
of
this
kind
of
they
.




resist
be
in
they
be
as
it
be
solid
and
firm
and
hard
but
never
aggressive
be
in
they
.
it
be
not
profoundly
sensitive
in
they
,
it
be
as
it
be
with
wood
when
in
a
tree
it
be
live
and
then
when
it
be
completely
useful
as
a
piece
of
wood
to
be
use
for
work
into
a
shape
for
use
and
it
be
a
solid
thing
then
,
an
honest
thing
then
,
a
thing
to
be
adapt
for
good
using
,
a
solid
reliable
thing
then
,
a
completely
exist
thing
then
,
a
thing
sensitive
in
the
sense
that
it
repay
good
handling
but
not
a
thing
sensitive
in
the
sense
that
a
tree
live
have
live
grow
being
be
a
sensitive
thing
.
these
then
this
kind
of
resist
man
and
woman
who
I
be
now
describe
have
this
in
they
and
they
have
it
in
they
some
of
they
so
completely
this
be
in
they
that
they
be
to
many
know
they
completely
strong
man
,
completely
geniuse
in
live
without
any
of
the
weakness
in
they
that
geniuse
most
generally
have
in
they
,
that
man
successful
in
live
most
generally
have
in
they
.
these
man
be
very
interesting
,
I
know
now
five
of
such
of
they
and
only
one
of
these
five
of
they
be
not
really
a
successful
one
and
that
one
have
a
pride
in
he
and
a
romantic
imagination
in
he
that
be
too
sensitive
for
the
solid
dead
wood
be
in
he
.
this
kind
of
they
of
man
be
very
interesting
to
I
in
the
being
in
they
,
they
be
very
pleasant
companion
mostly
always
all
of
they
loyal
,
reliable
,
delicate
in
their
feeling
,
honest
,
earnest
,
never
toady
,
decently
prudent
and
decently
courageous
in
living
,
always
give
to
every
one
a
conviction
that
they
be
a
very
strong
one
and
they
be
mostly
always
succeed
very
well
in
anything
that
be
a
life
work
to
they
and
though
they
be
laborious
in
their
working
they
be
really
pretty
quick
and
graceful
in
their
work
generally
although
strength
be
the
quality
in
they
that
seem
strong
in
they
but
really
strength
in
they
be
the
solidity
of
block
wood
,
bar
iron
in
they
really
then
these
in
their
living
can
be
completely
adapt
to
their
living
,
these
then
can
be
completely
succeed
in
living
,
these
then
can
have
sentimental
feeling
,
and
pride
in
they
and
romantic
imagination
but
really
this
can
not
at
the
bottom
of
they
disturb
they
they
be
completely
solid
they
can
be
completely
adapt
to
live
.
I
will
come
back
again
and
again
to
describe
this
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
I
will
come
back
again
and
again
to
every
kind
there
be
of
man
and
woman
.
these
then
that
I
have
be
describe
have
a
lack
in
they
,
they
be
complete
enough
in
living
,
they
be
each
one
completely
different
from
every
other
one
,
they
be
themselves
inside
they
but
in
a
true
sense
they
have
not
in
they
individual
being
,
they
be
the
very
cream
of
schoolman
the
very
good
thing
there
can
be
of
any
one
follow
a
master
and
work
with
he
.
they
be
individual
to
he
,
they
be
themselves
completely
inside
they
to
themselves
in
they
.
these
then
be
very
good
man
mostly
,
loyal
and
earnest
and
efficient
and
successful
in
live
.
they
be
solidly
learn
and
solidly
resist
to
be
win
.
their
work
in
its
result
be
very
often
a
quick
and
graceful
and
a
little
a
dull
thing
.
they
be
sensitive
and
strong
and
active
to
mostly
every
one
have
to
do
with
they
.
they
interest
I
very
much
,
mostly
unless
I
be
a
very
sad
one
every
one
be
to
I
very
interesting
.
sometime
certainly
I
will
tell
more
and
then
again
some
other
time
I
will
know
more
and
then
sometime
I
will
tell
more
and
so
on
and
so
on
of
this
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
I
be
altogether
a
discouraged
one
.
I
be
just
now
altogether
a
discouraged
one
.
I
be
go
on
describe
man
and
woman
.




I
know
one
,
he
be
of
the
resist
kind
in
man
and
woman
and
he
be
completely
an
instrument
be
he
be
so
completely
that
in
a
sense
he
have
no
volition
though
to
very
many
know
he
he
be
almost
a
crazy
one
in
live
out
idea
he
have
in
he
.
I
know
this
one
,
he
have
it
in
he
to
have
vibratingly
sensitive
resist
being
,
that
be
all
he
and
always
when
he
wish
to
do
any
working
he
must
put
himself
quiescently
ready
so
that
something
will
play
on
he
,
some
influence
something
and
then
it
vibrate
through
he
and
he
make
something
do
some
work
and
not
even
really
make
himself
a
quiescent
being
be
volition
in
he
,
it
be
simply
a
shutting
off
from
himself
by
an
almost
senseless
feeling
of
resist
any
other
thing
,
it
be
not
choice
in
he
of
something
and
volition
certainly
be
the
act
of
choose
.
this
one
as
I
be
say
and
I
know
very
many
who
know
he
this
one
as
I
be
say
be
to
very
many
an
obstinate
exaggerated
self
direct
completely
self
-
direct
one
and
this
one
be
completely
an
instrument
nature
,
this
one
be
like
a
violin
a
completely
vibrate
thing
to
anything
that
really
can
effect
he
.
this
one
,
I
know
this
one
very
well
in
his
living
,
this
one
in
his
loving
be
not
love
as
mostly
man
and
woman
be
do
who
love
the
attack
kind
of
they
if
they
be
resist
kind
in
they
,
the
resist
if
they
be
of
the
attack
kind
of
they
this
one
as
I
be
say
in
his
loving
be
completely
love
a
resist
one
,
one
like
himself
and
this
be
very
interesting
.
mostly
when
one
need
heighten
of
the
being
in
they
they
get
it
from
those
very
like
they
,
for
love
they
need
those
different
from
they
,
for
courage
and
emulation
and
influence
those
like
they
and
sometimes
some
love
those
like
they
and
these
be
mostly
then
instrument
nature
or
nature
need
pretty
complete
influencing
throughout
their
being
but
this
be
a
very
complicated
question
an
excessively
complicated
question
and
sometime
I
be
go
to
write
a
book
and
it
will
be
a
very
long
one
and
it
will
be
all
full
up
,
completely
fill
up
with
pair
of
they
two
of
they
,
sometimes
three
and
four
and
five
but
mostly
with
two
of
they
,
two
of
man
,
of
woman
,
of
woman
and
man
,
of
man
and
woman
.
now
to
say
just
a
little
more
of
this
one
this
instrument
one
that
I
be
know
pretty
well
now
in
the
living
in
he
.
this
one
be
not
really
succeed
very
well
in
living
,
this
one
would
not
be
succeed
very
well
when
he
be
not
any
long
a
young
man
,
when
he
be
an
old
one
and
have
not
any
long
youthful
beauty
feeling
and
vibration
in
he
and
then
too
he
would
come
to
have
fix
idea
in
he
,
that
would
be
a
natural
thing
for
he
,
and
then
perhaps
later
he
would
come
to
be
a
crazy
one
or
just
one
that
be
fail
in
living
.
some
like
he
not
so
completely
vibrate
have
some
volition
in
they
might
be
successful
in
live
,
some
like
he
have
a
dull
vibration
in
they
and
fairly
stupid
feeling
in
they
and
much
desire
for
good
eating
and
drink
and
sleeping
can
be
successful
enough
in
living
.
I
know
some
of
such
of
they
,
sometime
oh
sometime
,
really
truly
sometime
there
will
be
a
description
a
complete
description
of
every
one
.




now
I
will
be
describe
four
man
,
I
know
they
all
pretty
well
,
two
of
they
the
first
and
the
last
be
fairly
whole
one
inside
they
to
mostly
every
one
,
the
two
other
be
mostly
piece
of
live
to
mostly
every
one
know
they
.




I
know
these
four
pretty
well
then
,
they
be
all
in
a
way
of
the
engulf
kind
of
the
resist
kind
in
man
and
woman
,
the
four
of
they
have
that
in
common
in
every
other
way
they
be
very
different
each
one
of
they
from
the
three
other
of
they
.




the
first
one
have
engulf
be
so
brightly
,
so
gaily
,
so
concentratedly
in
he
that
it
be
a
very
fresh
and
gay
and
juicy
thing
in
he
the
being
in
he
.
he
be
quite
successful
in
live
this
one
,
quite
successful
in
love
and
always
all
his
living
he
have
had
very
much
love
in
he
.
he
have
not
much
real
independence
of
action
this
one
,
he
need
some
one
to
start
he
to
do
everything
except
dancing
and
loving
,
this
come
to
he
from
the
mere
exist
of
woman
in
the
world
around
he
.
in
mostly
everything
else
some
one
start
he
and
he
be
very
gay
then
in
keeping
go
.
when
he
be
a
sad
one
he
do
not
want
to
see
any
one
,
that
happen
sometimes
to
he
,
he
can
not
start
himself
then
,
no
one
be
start
he
then
,
he
be
a
sad
one
then
and
not
succeed
in
living
.
really
he
be
a
very
lively
one
in
living
and
on
the
whole
not
unsuccessful
in
live
.
he
be
completely
sensitive
and
not
at
all
a
bad
one
not
a
bit
a
bad
one
but
not
really
a
very
actively
good
one
he
have
no
initiative
for
take
any
responsibility
on
himself
for
himself
or
for
any
one
.
always
though
he
be
responsible
for
himself
,
live
give
he
that
initiative
and
he
go
on
living
,
sometimes
he
be
a
little
fussy
and
then
he
remember
his
father
be
so
before
he
,
he
would
like
to
be
a
different
person
not
be
like
his
father
in
any
way
and
there
he
be
he
find
himself
be
just
like
his
father
after
all
the
different
kind
of
living
that
he
have
be
have
.
this
one
have
a
genuinely
sensitive
being
,
this
one
be
not
a
selfish
one
,
self
-
seeking
,
this
one
be
not
apparently
engulf
and
yet
really
this
one
be
completely
of
the
engulf
resist
kind
of
they
,
this
one
have
this
be
in
he
that
be
certain
.
it
be
gay
and
sparkle
in
he
it
be
well
concentrated
in
he
,
it
be
an
engulf
resist
being
that
be
certain
.
the
second
one
,
I
know
this
one
from
the
history
of
he
from
letter
he
have
write
,
this
one
have
engulf
murky
be
as
hopeful
and
yet
as
a
weak
thing
in
he
.
he
need
so
much
stimulating
that
after
he
be
not
any
long
a
very
young
one
he
could
not
get
enough
of
it
to
keep
go
,
he
never
engulf
anything
really
in
his
living
not
himself
,
not
any
one
not
any
woman
not
any
man
,
but
he
be
always
hopeful
that
sometime
he
would
do
this
thing
,
hope
be
always
there
in
he
,
when
he
be
a
very
young
one
he
be
vigorous
in
aspire
,
later
he
be
not
vigorous
in
anything
but
always
hopeful
and
always
of
the
engulf
resist
kind
of
they
though
never
really
engulf
or
resist
anything
.
this
be
the
being
in
he
,
he
be
not
an
unattractive
one
,
sometime
there
will
be
more
history
of
he
write
of
his
loving
and
of
his
not
support
himself
by
work
and
of
his
despairing
and
of
his
always
hope
.
this
be
enough
of
he
just
now
,
alright
then
.
this
one
the
third
of
these
four
of
they
I
know
very
well
indeed
now
and
it
take
I
a
very
long
time
to
know
he
but
that
be
not
what
I
be
now
tell
.
this
one
be
of
the
engulf
murkily
resist
kind
of
they
but
he
mostly
be
too
ambitious
and
have
too
much
vanity
in
he
and
be
too
self
-
sacrifice
for
any
one
to
know
it
of
he
.
he
be
really
truly
such
a
one
,
that
be
certain
.
he
have
very
much
vanity
and
self
-
sacrifice
and
affection
and
ambition
in
he
and
only
slowly
it
come
out

very
well
be
a
piece
of
be
not
a
very
completely
whole
one
.
sometime
there
will
be
a
complete
history
of
this
one
.




the
fourth
one
of
these
four
of
they
that
all
have
it
in
they
to
have
murky
engulfing
resist
being
be
very
little
to
I
a
lovely
one
.
he
be
very
really
a
lovely
one
to
his
wife
and
she
be
old
than
he
be
and
he
really
be
not
a
bad
one
not
a
good
one
not
a
bad
one
,
he
be
not
a
very
lovely
one
to
most
of
those
he
come
to
know
in
living
.
every
one
be
to
I
sometime
a
little
a
lovely
one
,
that
be
pretty
nearly
certain
.




this
one
be
of
the
engulf
murky
resist
kind
of
they
but
engulf
be
in
he
the
swallowing
of
very
little
thing
,
he
never
have
it
in
he
to
do
any
large
swallowing
,
he
never
be
really
engulf
a
woman
he
be
engulf
,
she
need
to
thrust
herself
inside
he
and
so
he
a
little
be
do
swallowing
and
often
he
have
it
in
he
to
be
want
to
do
to
be
be
do
engulfing
but
he
never
really
know
it
in
he
,
he
be
of
the
murky
resist
engulfing
kind
of
they
but
he
have
it
in
he
only
really
as
nibbling
.
to
himself
he
be
a
very
noble
one
,
to
himself
he
be
almost
a
heroic
one
,
to
himself
he
be
completely
a
good
man
,
completely
entirely
a
good
one
with
not
any
mean
way
in
he
and
this
really
be
a
very
natural
thing
see
that
murky
resist
engulfing
being
be
a
nibble
swallowing
thing
in
he
,
this
could
not
be
himself
to
himself
inside
he
,
that
be
certain
,
and
so
to
himself
inside
he
he
be
a
completely
good
one
almost
a
heroic
one
.
if
any
one
if
his
sister
-
inlaw
say
to
he
but
you
nibble
and
swallow
that
thing
that
be
not
a
noble
thing
to
be
do
,
he
would
be
say
,
I
be
a
good
one
my
wife
know
that
every
one
know
that
and
if
I
do
that
thing
it
be
the
right
thing
for
I
to
be
do
.
he
be
not
a
bad
man
this
one
,
he
be
to
himself
completely
almost
heroically
a
good
one
,
to
his
wife
who
be
never
quite
completely
engulf
by
he
she
want
to
be
completely
engulf
by
he
feel
he
to
be
completely
entirely
a
very
lovely
one
,
to
his
wife
he
be
completely
entirely
a
good
one
as
he
be
to
himself
completely
inside
he
.
this
be
enough
now
of
this
one
,
he
be
to
mostly
every
one
a
complete
enough
one
,
this
will
be
now
some
description
of
some
other
man
and
woman
.




one
have
in
he
very
thickly
in
he
murky
resist
engulfing
be
often
threaten
he
would
kill
himself
and
he
sometimes
make
a
poem
before
he
be
ready
to
kill
himself
because
he
could
not
have
in
live
what
he
need
to
completely
content
he
.
this
be
now
a
very
little
description
of
this
one
.
this
one
be
quite
an
interesting
one
,
this
one
be
rather
strong
in
his
living
in
his
be
this
one
be
fairly
successful
in
live
.
this
one
as
a
very
young
one
be
not
a
very
adroit
one
,
be
rather
reckless
and
give
to
have
thing
happen
to
he
,
have
courage
in
he
,
be
a
pretty
hard
one
to
manage
,
be
quite
a
funny
one
.
he
be
when
he
be
a
young
one
a
reckless
one
,
quite
in
almost
a
foolish
way
a
daring
one
and
in
a
way
very
many
like
he
very
well
then
and
not
any
one
then
could
in
any
kind
of
a
way
manage
he
.
when
he
be
a
little
old
then
he
be
quite
affectionate
with
his
brother
and
his
father
,
his
mother
be
less
interesting
to
he
,
his
brother
be
very
fond
of
he
,
his
brother
be
old
,
his
father
like
to
hear
he
say
funny
thing
then
,
and
then
when
he
be
a
little
old
again
this
one
not
yet
any
more
than
quite
a
young
man
he
be
quite
a
stingy
one
,
a
very
prudent
one
,
a
very
openly
suspicious
one
,
quite
popular
with
man
,
not
very
interesting
to
woman
,
quite
devoted
to
his
brother
,
quite
cold
in
his
relation
to
any
one
have
any
need
of
he
,
completely
without
enthusiasm
,
quite
openly
suspicious
as
I
be
say
,
very
prudent
in
his
business
living
and
quite
a
good
business
man
,
and
as
I
be
say
completely
certain
that
he
should
take
care
of
himself
completely
that
not
any
one
would
do
this
thing
for
he
.
this
be
the
being
in
he
and
as
I
be
say
it
be
interesting
.
when
he
be
quite
a
young
man
he
decide
on
marry
and
then
when
his
mother
try
to
interfere
with
he
he
tell
the
people
that
his
mother
be
a
bad
one
and
he
tell
she
that
be
had
write
a
poem
and
now
he
would
kill
himself
and
she
believe
he
.
this
one
as
I
be
say
be
openly
a
suspicious
one
,
openly
a
man
think
only
of
his
own
well
be
,
he
be
quite
a
funny
one
,
he
be
very
popular
with
man
,
he
be
not
very
interesting
to
woman
but
they
mostly
do
not
at
all
dislike
he
,
he
have
be
when
he
be
a
young
one
quite
reckless
and
quite
daring
,
he
always
have
all
his
live
very
affectionate
way
in
he
,
he
always
be
certain
that
he
would
be
master
in
any
house
which
be
his
own
house
completely
master
of
it
and
always
he
be
a
pleasant
and
quite
a
funny
fellow
and
he
could
be
openly
flattering
and
openly
suspicious
and
he
be
both
all
of
his
living
and
always
he
be
very
funny
to
every
one
,
very
amusing
,
as
I
be
say
he
be
always
pretty
popular
with
man
and
not
at
all
unpopular
with
woman
.
he
have
his
passionate
resist
engulfing
be
in
he
quite
alive
and
completely
in
between
aggression
and
resist
,
he
be
not
attack
with
it
,
he
be
not
resist
with
it
,
it
never
be
do
one
thing
or
the
other
thing
neither
aggressive
in
it
or
resist
in
it
,
he
have
all
the
quality
of
it
of
his
kind
of
be
,
they
be
all
complete
alive
and
live
in
he
,
they
be
so
to
speak
not
in
motion
,
this
as
I
be
understand
be
the
being
in
he
,
he
have
almost
not
any
really
stupid
be
in
he
,
he
be
completely
his
own
being
and
this
be
completely
alive
,
completely
not
move
in
he
.
this
be
the
way
I
be
now
understand
this
one
,
it
be
very
certain
that
I
must
sometime
completely
be
understand
this
one
for
I
be
constantly
now
feel
think
about
know
certain
one
in
a
way
connect
with
this
one
and
it
be
important
to
I
that
I
sometime
understand
they
,
it
be
important
to
I
very
important
indeed
to
I
that
I
sometime
understand
every
one
,
I
be
always
keep
on
want
to
do
this
thing
mostly
all
the
time
,
certainly
pretty
nearly
all
the
time
,
yes
always
somewhere
in
I
that
be
certain
,
always
somewhere
in
I
,
mostly
all
through
I
I
be
hope
that
sometime
I
will
be
understand
every
one
every
kind
there
be
of
man
and
woman
know
,
feeling
,
completely
realise
they
,
each
one
,
every
one
,
and
sometime
I
certainly
be
hope
to
be
completely
understand
several
I
be
know
that
be
a
kind
of
they
connect
in
kind
with
the
kind
of
which
I
have
just
be
a
little
describe
one
.
I
be
then
certainly
go
on
with
my
hoping
.
I
will
now
go
on
with
my
description
of
a
considerable
number
of
man
and
woman
,
some
man
,
some
woman
,
all
of
the
resist
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
this
one
of
whom
I
be
now
go
to
be
give
a
very
little
description
be
not
completely
of
the
engulf
kind
of
the
resist
kind
of
they
,
he
be
a
murky
passionate
resist
one
but
not
a
really
engulf
one
,
he
be
as
near
to
be
an
engulf
one
as
one
can
be
without
be
one
.
he
be
as
near
an
engulf
kind
as
one
can
be
who
be
not
it
at
all
but
be
completely
disturb
in
love
so
that
it
be
really
in
he
that
in
a
way
he
be
not
an
engulf
kind
of
a
one
.
this
one
then
in
a
way
be
connect
with
Mr.
Hissen
the
grandfather
of
the
Hersland
child
in
his
kind
of
be
,
this
one
have
in
he
religion
,
very
completely
in
he
but
he
be
not
a
complete
one
,
he
be
not
complete
inside
he
completely
all
that
there
be
of
religion
in
he
,
he
be
lose
in
love
,
lose
in
religion
,
not
completely
a
lost
one
but
sometimes
quite
completely
a
lost
one
,
have
to
be
afraid
inside
he
to
be
rescue
by
some
one
from
the
quite
completely
lose
condition
of
he
.
this
one
be
not
then
a
very
complete
one
inside
he
,
that
be
natural
from
the
being
in
he
.
this
one
like
some
other
like
he
lose
himself
from
inside
he
by
love
feeling
by
religion
in
he
,
this
one
then
do
not
do
this
completely
in
he
,
he
be
a
little
all
himself
inside
he
and
so
then
this
one
all
his
living
be
a
very
incomplete
one
,
always
then
he
be
not
succeed
very
well
in
living
,
mostly
then
some
one
master
he
enough
so
that
he
do
not
completely
fail
in
live
completely
lose
himself
out
from
he
and
he
too
a
little
help
with
this
be
with
the
being
in
he
that
be
in
he
that
make
he
a
little
the
complete
thing
in
religion
in
himself
inside
he
.
this
one
then
in
a
way
in
loving
,
in
religion
,
lose
the
feeling
after
the
emotion
,
must
then
begin
again
and
this
be
a
natural
thing
from
the
nature
of
he
,
he
be
not
at
all
engulf
,
he
be
as
near
to
it
as
any
one
can
be
who
completely
entirely
be
not
it
.
I
be
find
this
description
very
interesting
.
I
be
understand
more
and
more
now
the
being
in
he
.
this
be
all
that
I
will
now
be
write
of
he
.
he
be
quite
an
elegant
one
quite
a
graceful
one
in
his
expression
,
in
his
daily
living
,
when
he
be
a
young
one
he
be
quite
completely
an
idealist
then
,
always
he
have
religion
and
love
in
he
.
this
be
all
I
be
now
go
to
be
say
about
he
.




I
have
know
several
of
a
kind

then
be
as

be
say
one
kind
of
the
engulf
resist
kind
of
they
,
they
be
completely
then
engulf
resist
some
of
such
of
they
and
the
thing
they
be
completely
engulfingly
resistingly

they
have
vanity
and
elegance
so
completely
in
they
that
they
have
not
any
pride
in
they
they
do
not
need
to
have
pride
in
they
to
protect
they
to
themselves
inside
they
from
anything
.
they
have
vanity
completely
in
they
,
some
of
they
have
some
engulf
passion
in
they
some
have
very
little
engulf
passion
in
they
,
such
of
they
have
not
any
affection
really
in
they
,
such
of
they
mostly
be
not
think
about
feel
in
they
anything
of
itself
in
they
,
they
have
elegance
of
be
,
they
have
complete
vanity
inside
they
,
they
have
completely
in
they
the
realisation
of
every
one
who
be
a
distinguished
one
,
of
themselves
as
have
distinction
in
they
.
some
of
such
of
they
be
judge
every
one
by
the
intelligence
in
they
,
all
of
such
of
they
,
be
always
judge
every
one
,
they
must
always
be
judge
every
one
such
a
one
,
all
the
being
in
they
be
the
learning
by
they
the
distinction
they
must
by
the
being
in
they
be
seize
.
they
have
not
in
they
such
of
they
the
feeling
for
a
thing
itself
,
they
have
not
love
for
anything
itself
,
they
have
in
they
the
needing
of
seize
distinction
,
they
have
in
they
a
complete
need
of
judge
for
they
must
always
be
judge
every
one
as
to
whether
that
one
have
distinction
in
she
or
in
he
,
by
judge
they
can
decide
then
about
this
thing
about
every
one
,
they
can
not
have
the
feeling
for
the
thing
that
any
one
by
love
that
thing
have
come
to
have
distinction
in
she
or
in
he
,
they
have
in
they
only
the
need
in
they
of
judge
whether
some
one
have
come
to
have
distinction
and
always
such
a
one
have
complete
vanity
in
be
,
they
have
not
any
need
of
any
pride
inside
they
to
protect
themselves
inside
they
and
so
then
,
such
a
one
,
as
I
be
say
such
a
one
be
complete
seizing
judge
every
one
for
distinction
.
they
have
then
such
one
the
instinct
for
realise
distinction
,
for
judge
people
and
thing
that
merit
distinction
,
they
have
not
these
then
most
completely
not
the
emotion
of
the
thing
that
give
to
people
distinction
.
consequently
for
they
,
learn
be
to
teach
themselves
or
have
some
one
teach
they
to
recognise
and
realise
the
thing
that
those
people
realise
who
have
achieve
distinction
and
that
can
only
be
do
by
such
of
they
by
their
learning
to
realise
detail
in
thinking
and
feeling
,
so
that
these
judge
some
one
as
a
distinguished
one
can
enter
into
that
one
's
distinction
by
realise
what
that
one
judge
to
be
distinguish
by
they
be
think
and
feeling
.
these
have
then
to
learn
carefully
what
it
be
they
have
seize
and
be
seize
,
these
can
then
go
on
successfully
live
,
always
these
be
judge
,
mostly
these
be
completely
seize
what
they
be
need
.
I
be
hope
always
hope
to
be
make
a
complete
history
of
all
man
and
woman
completely
,
completely
and
more
completely
of
they
,
these
then
that
I
have
be
just
describe
be
connect
quite
closely
connected
all
of
they
with
the
kind
that
Alfred
Hersland
be
of
man
and
woman
.
these
I
have
be
describe
be
very
clearly
in
I
,
pretty
nearly
completely
clearly
in
I
and
I
be
pretty
nearly
completely
understand
they
and
some
of
they
certainly
be
of
such
a
kind
of
they
I
will
be
describe
again
and
again
.
I
still
be
go
to
be
describe
a
considerable
number
of
kind
of
man
and
woman
and
some
now
be
not
very
engulfing
of
the
resist
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
of
some
of
these
that
I
be
now
go
to
be
describe
I
be
go
to
be
describe
inquisitiveness
in
they
.
inquisitiveness
in
man
and
woman
be
very
interesting
.
some
have
very
much
of
this
in
they
,
some
of
these
I
be
go
to
be
describe
have
it
almost
as
complete
be
in
they
the
amount
of
inquisitiveness
in
they
,
and
the
meaning
of
inquisitiveness
in
they
.
I
be
now
go
to
be
describe
a
considerable
number
of
man
and
inquisitiveness
and
loving
and
affection
in
they
and
slowness
and
succeed
and
fail
in
their
living
be
very
important
in
they
in
the
understanding
of
they
.
there
will
be
then
now
a
very
considerable
number
more
of
man
and
woman
with
resist
be
in
they
that
I
will
be
like
to
be
describe
.
to
begin
again
now
with
diminish
this
considerable
number
.
I
be
begin
now
again
.




curiosity
and
suspicion
these
two
thing
be
often
very
interesting
,
this
one
that
I
be
now
begin
describe
have
these
very
completely
in
he
,
and
always
then
this
one
have
these
more
simply
in
he
than
any
one
know
he
be
realise
,
he
have
inquisitiveness
in
he
for
the
mere
satisfaction
of
ask
and
know
,
he
have
suspicion
in
he
because
suspicious
feeling
be
a
pleasant
feeling
in
he
,
he
use
inquisitiveness
and
suspicion
in
living
,
that
be
certain
,
no
one
know
he
could
deny
that
of
he
,
but
often
he
be
not
use
such
thing
,
he
be
just
inquire
,
he
be
just
ask
because
his
attention
be
catch
and
he
like
to
know
everything
and
he
like
ask
and
often
suspicion
be
in
he
because
suspicion
be
an
easy
way
to
be
feel
for
he
about
everything
and
a
very
pleasant
feeling
to
have
inside
he
.
this
one
be
of
the
resist
slightly
engulf
kind
in
man
and
woman
,
resist
and
engulfing
be
equally
in
he
.
in
many
I
have
be
describe
engulfing
be
strong
than
resist
,
in
this
one
resist
and
engulfing
be
pretty
nearly
equally
divide
in
he
,
he
be
thick
but
not
too
thick
not
too
dry
in
his
being
,
he
could
take
complete
impression
from
everything
he
be
learn
,
he
be
always
ask
,
he
be
continually
suspecting
,
he
be
quite
successful
in
live
.
this
be
now
to
be
a
little
a
description
of
the
question
he
be
always
ask
,
of
the
suspicion
always
in
he
.




some
man
and
woman
be
inquisitive
about
everything
,
they
be
always
ask
,
if
they
see
any
one
with
anything
they
ask
what
be
that
thing
,
what
be
it
you
be
carry
,
what
be
you
go
to
be
do
with
that
thing
,
why
have
you
that
,
thing
,
where
do
you
get
that
thing
,
how
long
will
you
have
that
thing
,
there
be
very
many
man
and
woman
who
want
to
know
about
anything
about
everything
,
I
be
such
a
one
,
I
certainly
be
such
a
one
.
a
very
great
many
like
to
know
a
good
many
thing
,
a
great
many
be
always
ask
question
of
every
one
,
a
great
many
be
to
very
many
do
this
with
intention
,
a
great
many
have
intention
in
their
asking
,
a
great
many
just
have
their
attention
catch
by
anything
and
then
they
ask
the
question
.
some
when
they
be
hear
any
one
talk
be
immediately
listen
,
many
would
like
to
know
what
be
in
letter
other
be
write
and
receive
,
a
great
many
quite
honest
one
be
always
want
to
know
everything
,
a
great
many
man
and
woman
have
a
good
deal
suspicion
in
they
about
other
and
this
have
in
they
not
any
very
precise
meaning
.
a
great
many
be
like
to
know
thing
but
do
not
do
much
asking
,
a
great
many
have
not
any
such
a
feeling
.
a
great
many
have
a
very
great
deal
of
suspiciousness
in
they
,
a
great
many
have
almost
not
any
of
this
be
in
they
.
this
one
that
I
be
now
describe
be
one
who
be
always
ask
and
mostly
always
every
one
be
wonder
what
be
this
one
meaning
by
the
question
he
be
ask
and
often
later
this
one
would
perhaps
be
use
information
he
have
have
from
ask
question
but
ask
question
in
he
be
not
a
thing
in
he
that
come
from
want
to
be
use
some
time
information
he
be
gather
,
very
often
ask
question
in
he
be
simply
from
a
catelling
of
his
attention
by
something
.
once
this
one
ask
some
one
he
be
visit
,
just
suddenly,—and
this
door
here
do
that
lead
into
the
hall
or
directly
out
into
the
garden,—and
that
be
all
he
say
then
about
this
thing
and
afterwards
every
one
be
think
he
would
be
use
this
against
they
but
really
then
this
one
be
wonder
do
the
door
lead
to
the
hall
or
directly
to
a
garden
.
if
such
a
one
,
one
have
this
kind
of
a
way
be
of
the
resist
engulfing
type
and
fairly
successful
in
living
and
slow
and
sudden
and
quite
suspicious
of
every
one
,
almost
certainly
then
every
one
will
think
it
to
be
true
of
such
a
one
that
this
one
always
be
ask
question
for
purpose
of
win
,
perhaps
of
cheat
,
certainly
for
some
distant
manoeuvering
.
this
be
very
common
.
there
be
very
many
have
in
they
rather
engulf
rather
resist
being
who
be
slow
and
sudden
,
who
be
a
little
absent
when
any
one
be
ask
they
anything
,
who
be
suspicious
and
quite
trust
,
who
be
often
ask
question
for
in
their
being
be
in
slow
action
and
always
more
or
less
move
they
have
it
that
their
attention
be
always
a
little
wandering
wait
for
something
inside
they
to
do
something
and
so
then
these
of
they
be
very
busy
have
their
attention
catch
by
anything
and
ask
question
about
everything
and
very
often
every
one
know
such
of
they
be
very
suspicious
of
they
and
mostly
these
then
too
have
constant
suspicion
in
they
as
constant
as
the
questioning
in
they
.
this
be
very
common
then
with
this
kind
of
be
.
I
be
not
yet
through
with
my
description
of
this
kind
of
resist
engulf
man
and
woman
.
a
great
many
man
and
woman
have
very
much
suspicion
in
they
of
everything
of
every
one
.
a

.
a
great
many
have
this
in
they
from
the
beginning
of
live
in
they
.
a
great
many
very
many
of
the
resisting
,
dependent
independent
very
earthy
man
and
woman
have
complete
suspicion
,
little
steady
suspicion
of
everything
of
every
one
always
in
they
.
they
do
not
have
it
from
experience
in
they
they
have
it
in
they
as
a
natural
thing
,
they
have
it
in
they
like
a
child
walk
and
certain
that
every
step
they
be
go
to
be
tumble
.
this
be
very
common
,
very
many
man
very
many
woman
very
many
having
resist
be
in
they
have
it
in
they
to
be
suspicious
always
of
every
one
of
everything
.
this
be
in
they
very
often
when
they
be
quite
kindly
quite
trust
,
very
many
then
have
resist
be
have
it
to
have
very
naturally
in
they
always
in
they
always
steadily
in
they
from
their
beginning
that
they
be
suspicious
of
every
one
of
everything
,
always
suspicious
always
steadily
suspicious
inside
they
,
this
one
then
that
I
be
describe
have
suspicion
always
in
he
,
there
will
be
now
a
description
of
several
of
this
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
I
be
now
go
on
with
my
description
of
one
,
who
be
naturally
a
completely
suspicious
one
.




many
having
resist
be
have
it
in
they
all
their
living
when
they
be
begin
and
then
on
to
their
ending
have
it
to
have
suspicion
always
naturally
in
they
and
this
be
a
natural
thing
for
they
to
have
in
they
because
they
having
resist
be
have
it
in
they
to
be
know
that
always
some
one
be
do
attack
.
resist
be
in
they
be
in
meaning
that
always
some
one
some
where
be
attack
,
resist
being
be
in
they
in
some
of
they
,
in
very
many
man
in
very
many
woman
as
have
in
they
completely
naturally
always
very
much
suspicion
.
very
many
man
and
woman
have
in
they
completely
all
their
live
very
complete
suspicious
feeling
very
many
man
and
woman
with
resist
being
.
very
many
man
and
woman
with
attack
be
have
suspicion
in
they
completely
in
they
,
sometime
I
will
be
tell
very
much
of
they
.
very
many
man
and
woman
have
hardly
any
kind
of
suspicious
feeling
ever
in
they
.
there
be
very
many
way
of
have
suspicious
feel
many
kind
of
way
many
degree
of
such
feeling
,
now
I
be
give
a
not
very
long
description
of
one
have
in
he
very
complete
suspicious
feeling
,
very
much
suspicious
feeling
about
man
,
very
much
very
complete
suspicious
feeling
about
woman
and
this
one
be
quite
a
successful
one
in
living
and
this
one
have
very
much
inquisitive
feeling
in
he
and
this
one
be
pretty
completely
resist
in
his
be
pretty
completely
engulf
in
his
being
and
always
very
many
feel
it
about
he
that
every
bit
of
ask
in
he
and
every
bit
of
suspicion
in
he
be
really
deep
wisdom
in
he
and
always
then
he
have
completely
resist
be
in
he
completely
engulf
be
in
he
,
complete
suspicion
in
he
,
complete
inquisitiveness
inside
he
,
and
always
then
he
have
enthusiasm
and
very
much
feeling
about
something
and
always
he
be
ask
about
everything
and
always
he
be
have
suspicious
feeling
in
he
and
altogether
he
be
sufficiently
a
wise
one
,
and
very
often
he
be
just
ask
because
he
see
something
and
very
often
he
be
just
suspecting
because
he
have
resist
be
in
he
.
this
be
one
then
that
be
to
I
a
completely
interesting
one
.
every
one
be
to
I
a
completely
interesting
one
,
this
one
be
to
I
very
completely
an
interesting
one
.
I
like
feel
the
being
in
this
one
,
sometime
yes
certainly
sometime
I
will
be
tell
all
the
feeling
I
have
in
the
complete
be
in
this
one
.
as
I
be
say
suspicious
feeling
be
very
interesting
,
very
very
interesting
.
sometime
later
I
will
tell
very
much
about
one
kind
of
they
of
the
resist
kind
of
they
that
have
it
in
they
to
have
suspicious
feeling
as
a
completely
interesting
thing
in
they
.
I
hope
I
will
not
be
begin
now
to
tell
about
this
kind
of
they
.
perhaps
I
will
tell
a
little
about
such
of
they
in
among
this
considerable
number
of
man
and
woman
of
the
resist
kind
of
they
I
be
just
now
describe
.
I
really
do
not
want
to
begin
now
about
they
.
I
will
not
begin
now
about
they
that
be
certain
.
I
will
completely
understand
they
later
and
will
be
tell
then
about
they
.
I
certainly
will
not
write
anything
now
about
they
.
that
be
now
certain
.
I
have
be
write
now
about
a
considerable
number
of
the
considerable
number
I
be
now
describe
of
the
resist
kind
of
they
.
I
will
now
begin
a
pretty
short
description
of
another
one
of
they
.
that
be
to
be
a
little
description
of
one
have
rich
resist
being
and
be
a
little
too
quick
perhaps
quite
a
little
too
quick
in
ripen
.
this
one
have
in
he
quite
,
some
inquisitiveness
in
he
,
not
any
suspicion
in
he
.
this
be
to
be
now
quite
a
short
description
of
he
.




this
one
then
as
I
be
say
be
of
the
resist
kind
of
they
,
that
be
to
say
resist
be
the
way
of
win
in
he
,
that
be
to
say
this
one
be
in
a
way
slow
in
react
,
that
be
to
say
this
one
in
a
way
be
need
to
own
those
this
one
need
for
loving
,
this
be
all
true
and
this
be
all
not
true
of
this
one
and
this
one
be
completely
of
resist
being
,
this
one
be
all
make
completely
all
of
only
resist
be
.
this
one
then
really
be
very
early
a
completely
highly
develop
one
,
this
one
be
very
flow
in
the
completely
create
power
this
one
have
inside
he
,
this
one
be
a
quite
inquisitive
one
,
this
one
have
hardly
any
suspiciousness
in
natural
ordinary
daily
live
in
he
,
this
one
be
really
not
own
the
one
this
one
need
for
his
loving
.
this
one
as
I
be
say
be
of
the
resist
kind
of
they
,
not
of
the
engulf
kind
of
they
,
of
completely
sensitively
resist
being
and
the
resist
being
and
sensitive
being
be
pretty
nearly
equal
in
this
one
,
it
be
pretty
nearly
as
sensitive
as
resist
but
not
quite
completely
so
in
this
one
it
be
a
little
more
sensitive
than
resist
and
so
this
one
be
quick
in
develop
,
early
in
flowering
and
this
one
be
always
try
to
be
a
slow
one
and
this
one
really
never
be
in
live
a
really
slow
one
.
this
one
be
as
I
be
say
not
a
suspicious
one
,
resist
being
be
not
strongly
enough
in
he
as
protect
to
give
to
he
a
suspicious
feeling
toward
everything
and
every
one
.
this
one
be
not
really
own
the
one
this
one
need
for
his
loving
.
this
one
could
only
own
one
this
one
need
for
love
by
getting
rid
of
the
one
this
one
need
for
love
and
then
this
one
would
not
be
have
the
one
this
one
need
for
love
and
then
where
be
this
one
,
he
be
where
he
need
the
one
he
need
for
love
and
take
she
back
again
make
he
then
lose
the
power
of
own
this
one
,
the
only
way
he
could
own
this
one
be
by
getting
rid
of
this
one
or
by
secretly
let
some
other
one
love
he
,
in
this
way
then
this
one
to
himself
inside
he
could
own
the
one
he
need
for
love
.
he
really
could
own
the
one
he
need
for
love
by
send
she
away
from
he
,
he
then
do
not
have
near
he
the
one
he
need
for
loving
,
to
himself
inside
he
then
he
could
own
that
one
by
let
,
by
make
some
other
one
love
he
and
mostly
then
he
dream
of
this
thing
,
he
do
this
thing
.
this
be
now
a
clear
complete
description
of
one
have
resist
being
.




this
be
now
to
be
a
description
of
another
one
have
resist
being
,
not
engulf
resist
being
,
just
resist
be
,
this
one
be
a
very
nice
one
,
a
very
pleasant
gentle
,
sensitive
,
fairly
resisting
,
sometimes
angrily
resist
one
,
this
one
have
some
suspicion
in
she
in
living
,
this
one
could
have
very
often
an
injured
feeling
,
this
one
have
quite
a
good
deal
of
inquisitive
feeling
in
she
,
this
one
need
to
own
to
a
considerable
degree
those
this
one
need
for
loving
,
this
one
have
child
and
child
be
to
this
one
a
piece
of
her
cut
off
from
she
that
be
as
it
be
equal
to
she
and
she
be
as
they
be
,
the
same
in
living
,
thinking
,
feeling
and
be
.
this
one
as
I
be
say
be
a
gentle
,
often
injure
,
fairly
angrily
resist
one
,
quite
inquisitive
,
with
enough
suspicious
feeling
to
be
defend
other
one
when
it
be
not
at
all
her
business
to
be
interfere
and
so
this
one
a
very
nice
a
completely
in
a
way
honest
one
could
do
something
that
be
not
a
pretty
thing
for
this
one
to
be
do
.
this
be
what
this
one
do
once
in
her
living
.




this
one
that
I
have
be
describe
have
not
real
suspicious
feeling
,
this
one
be
of
the
resist
kind
of
they
but
this
one
have
very
much
more
sensitiveness
than
resist
being
and
resist
being
be
in
this
one
not
a
kind
of
thing
to
make
of
this
one
really
a
suspicious
one
.
this
be
in
this
one
resist
be
in
this
one
be
in
this
one
a
sense
of
really
be
gently
minute
by
minute
in
living
and
so
this
one
when
this
one
be
add
up
anything
would
always
be
add
it
by
one
and
one
and
one
.
this
one
have
it
to
be
very
careful
in
living
and
always
this
one
would
be
count
everything
by
one
and
one
and
one
.
count
everything
this
one
be
spend
by
one
and
one
and
one
and
one
and
one
and
one
be
in
this
one
resist
being
be
in
this
one
recognition
of
real
exist
of
everything
.
this
one
could
have
very
much
injure
feeling
,
this
one
could
have
injure
feeling
very
often
could
have
it
for
herself
for
other
one
for
any
one
and
this
one
sometimes
be
very
mixed
up
in
do
anything
by
injure
feeling
for
one
and
not
for
another
one
and
for
that
other
one
then
and
for
this
one
herself
this
one
inside
this
one
then
and
this
one
then
be
sufficiently
complicate
by
injure
feeling
inside
this
one
and
injure
feeling
be
the
only
complicated
thing
in
the
being
and
in
the
living
of
this
one
.
this
one
be
as
I
be
say
a
very
gentle
a
very
sensitive
one
,
this
one
be
a
resist
one
,
this
one
be
not
at
all
an
engulf
one
,
this
one
from
the
mixing
of
a
little
softly
resist
being
and
very
much
gentle
and
sensitive
being
have
in
this
one
suspicion
only
as
injure
feeling
.
some
have
this
kind
of
be
and
have
sensitiveness
not
delicately
and
sensitively
in
they
and
resist
slightly
engulf
in
they
be
completely
suspicious
and
completely
injure
always
in
their
living
and
these
very
often
have
it
in
they
to
have
be
persecute
as
a
mania
in
they
.
there
be
very
many
have
such
be
in
they
,
later
I
will
be
tell
a
few
little
thing
that
sometimes
be
happen
in
live
in
the
living
of
this
kind
of
man
this
kind
of
woman
.
as
I
be
say
this
one
I
be
now
just
a
little
describe
be
not
at
all
not
even
a
little
bit
an
engulf
one
,
this
one
be
a
softly
resist
one
a
really
earthy
one
really
feel
always
in
live
that
exist
anything
exist
be
really
there
in
being
and
always
this
one
be
do
all
the
counting
this
one
ever
be
do
by
count
one
and
then
one
and
then
one
and
then
one
.
this
one
as
I
be
say
have
not
really
suspicious
being
,
this
one
as
I
be
say
have
much
and
quite
often
very
warmly
really
injure
feeling
,
for
herself
in
herself
,
for
some
other
one
,
for
any
other
one
and
this
injure
feeling
be
in
the
being
of
this
one
the
only
complication
.
once
some
one
,
a
young
cousin
,
this
one
I
be
describe
be
then
come
to
the
beginning
of
the
middle
living
in
this
one
,
once
a
young
cousin
tell
this
one
,
the
cousin
be
very
fond
of
this
one
,
that
the
cousin
never
want
to
be
eat
dinner
at
the
house
of
another
one
another
cousin
of
this
one
,
that
he
like
very
much
indeed
be
with
his
cousin
but
he
do
not
like
it
at
all
for
a
place
to
be
dine
,
this
be
then
all
that
be
say
just
then
.
later
then
the
first
cousin
the
one
that
say
this
to
the
one
I
have
be
describe
,
ask
this
cousin
who
have
just
come
to
be
engage
to
be
marry
then
to
come
and
take
dinner
with
he
.
this
one
then
the
cousin
ask
to
dine
by
the
other
cousin
of
the
one
I
be
describe
happen
to
mention
to
the
one
I
be
describe
that
he
be
go
to
be
dine
next
week
with
this
cousin
.
this
one
I
be
now
describe
have
then
completely
inside
this
one
an
injured
feeling
for
this
one
that
be
go
to
be
dine
with
the
other
one
that
this
one
should
be
go
to
be
dine
with
the
other
one
when
the
other
one
would
not
dine
with
that
one
because
it
be
not
a
pleasant
thing
and
so
this
one
I
be
describe
tell
the
one
go
to
be
dine
with
the
other
one
what
that
one
have
say
about
dining
with
he
.
then
of
course
this
one
would
not
dine
with
the
other
one
.
and
all
this
come
from
there
be
in
this
one
I
be
describe
a
soft
resisting
,
a
gentle
sensitive
be
with
not
any
suspiciousness
in
be
and
not
any
engulfing
and
not
any
egotism
so
that
this
one
have
to
have
in
this
one
that
everything
that
could
be
aggression
or
suspicion
or
worldliness
in
living
or
individual
feeling
be
in
this
one
injure
feeling
,
a
very
little
angry
and
a
very
much
hurt
feeling
and
so
this
one
have
injure
feeling
quite
often
and
very
much
for
this
one
,
for
some
other
one
,
for
any
other
one
.




I
will
describe
now
very
little
a
very
different
kind
of
one
from
that
one
I
have
be
just
describe
.
there
will
not
be
then
very
many
more
of
they
of
the
considerable
number
leave
then
.
there
will
perhaps
then
still
be
leave
about
six
of
they
,
six
kind
of
they
and
perhaps
there
will
be
add
a
few
more
to
make
another
generalisation
but
really
there
have
be
already
do
a
considerable
part
of
the
considerable
number
of
the
resist
kind
of
they
that
I
be
now
describe
.
this
one
then
be
quite
a
different
kind
of
a
one
from
the
last
one
I
be
describe
.
this
one
as
a
whole
one
be
like
a
cannon
-
ball
lie
on
a
bag
of
cotton
,
the
cannon
-
ball
lie
on
a
cotton
bag
as
a
complete
thing
be
the
whole
of
this
one
.
this
be
in
a
way
a
description
of
this
one
,
there
will
be
now
a
very
little
more
description
of
this
one
.




child
be
always
think
be
very
often
think
that
their
mother
be
very
lovely
look
and
that
be
very
often
because
mostly
the
child
be
always
close
up
to
the
mother
close
to
she
when
the
child
be
look
and
mostly
be
close
like
that
as
a
habitual
thing
be
to
find
that
one
a
lovely
thing
a
lovely
look
one
.




this
one
that
I
be
say
be
a
whole
one
which
be
like
a
cannon
-
ball
rest
on
a
bag
of
cotton
be
the
cotton
part
find
the
cannon
-
ball
lovely
look
be
always
so
close
to
that
thing
and
the
cannon
-
ball
be
find
the
cotton
lovely
look
that
be
so
closely
always
to
that
thing
.
to
explain
then
.
this
one
then
be
one
have
solid
enough
dull
not
very
lively
,
not
lively
at
all
fairly
dry
resist
bottom
,
a
bottom
that
might
have
be
engulf
if
it
have
be
a
lively
dark
wet
thing
,
but
this
be
not
true
of
it
then
at
all
that
it
be
engulf
,
it
be
entirely
not
engulf
.
as
I
be
say
many
have
engulf
being
and
not
have
resist
be
enough
in
they
be
very
aspiring
and
this
one
then
have
aspiration
like
what
might
have
be
engulf
in
the
bottom
be
the
bottom
being
which
be
not
at
all
engulf
.
some
of
this
kind
of
they
have
it
as
a
bottom
be
something
that
be
more
nearly
engulf
and
these
then
have
more
active
aspiration
as
ambition
,
these
have
then
more
nearly
some
power
of
very
nearly
engulf
something
but
this
one
be
as
little
engulfing
as
such
a
kind
of
they
can
be
in
living
,
just
as
amiable
and
ideal
in
aspiration
and
aspiration
in
this
one
as
I
be
say
be
like
the
cannon
-
ball
rest
on
the
bag
of
cotton
,
it
be
completely
beautiful
always
to
all
that
cotton
and
this
one
be
always
live
near
light
and
beauty
near
to
the
aspiration
,
the
cannon
-
ball
and
this
one
be
then
as
I
be
say
amiable
in
intention
and
clear
and
large
word
and
hesitate
in
expression
.
this
one
be
an
interesting
enough
one
.
I
be
know
quite
well
three
of
these
of
they
,
one
be
more
nearly
engulf
,
one
have
of
he
the
very
large
size
in
bag
of
cotton
,
one
and
this
be
the
one
I
be
realise
in
now
describe
be
a
little
skimp
in
the
cotton
foundation
.
this
be
not
a
funny
description
,
I
be
not
certain
I
should
say
anything
of
the
cannon
-
ball
and
the
cotton
,
I
be
almost
certain
I
would
not
say
anything
in
this
description
about
the
cannon
-
ball
and
the
cotton
,
it
be
not
in
I
a
natural
way
of
conceive
any
one
,
some
one
conceive
this
one
as
a
cannon
-
ball
rest
on
a
bag
of
cotton
,
I
use
that
in
my
description
,
this
be
not
to
I
a
natural
way
of
talk
,
I
have
be
use
it
here
as
I
be
say
.
now
I
will
begin
describe
another
one
and
that
will
be
leave
only
a
few
more
to
be
describe
of
the
considerable
number
of
they
that
I
have
be
describe
of
the
resist
kind
of
they
.
this
one
that
I
be
now
begin
describe
be
of
the
resisting
and
sensitive
and
suspicious
kind
of
they
and
now
I
will
be
tell
a
few
story
about
such
of
they
.
it
be
very
hard
with
some
to
be
realise
what
kind
they
be
this
kind
of
they
when
they
be
quite
old
one
.
it
be
a
very
difficult
thing
to
be
realise
of
some
kind
of
they
one
have
be
know
before
the
beginning
of
their
middle
living
what
they
be
as
old
one
,
these
in
living
.
when
one
be
oneself
a
fairly
old
one
,
one
will
be
know
a
little
more
perhaps
of
this
thing
,
one
be
know
a
little
of
something
of
this
thing
from
old
relation
one
be
know
and
one
know
all
the
family
of
these
then
be
perhaps
a
little
know
what
these
be
as
young
one
in
living
.
these
that
I
be
now
describe
be
a
kind
of
they
that
when
they
be
old
one
no
one
be
pay
much
attention
to
they
.
they
have
then
as
old
one
the
same
being
in
they
I
be
now
describe
,
they
be
mostly
not
any
too
successfully
live
all
their
living
,
they
have
when
they
be
old
one
the
same
being
in
they
,
mostly
then
not
very
many
then
be
pay
much
attention
to
they
then
,
these
when
they
be
old
one
in
living
,
these
that
I
be
now
describe
.




these
then
that
I
be
now
describe
be
a
kind
of
they
that
have
sensitiveness
that
be
complete
suspicion
in
they
,
these
be
of
the
kind
of
they
that
be
themselves
completely
important
to
themselves
inside
they
,
they
have
resistance
in
they
much
less
than
sensitiveness
as
suspicion
in
they
.
suspicion
in
these
of
they
come
out
of
the
sensitiveness
of
they
before
the
sensitiveness
in
they
give
to
they
inside
they
really
an
emotion
and
so
in
these
in
living
suspicion
be
as
it
be
the
whole
of
they
,
the
complete
emotion
always
in
they
.
this
sensitiveness
in
they
that
be
in
they
a
suspicion
before
it
be
an
emotion
in
they
from
anything
be
always
every
moment
in
such
of
they
.
that
these
have
it
in
they
that
sensitiveness
make
for
they
suspicion
before
they
have
from
anything
a
complete
emotion
be
the
reason
that
these
mostly
be
not
very
successful
in
live
,
they
be
a
little
successful
many
of
they
and
when
they
be
old
one
or
old
one
,
no
one
,
not
any
one
be
pay
much
attention
to
they
.
these
then
in
a
way
be
not
really
earthy
,
not
really
resist
,
not
at
all
engulf
,
these
then
in
a
way
be
not
certain
that
dead
be
dead
,
that
thing
really
be
exist
,
these
can
have
superstition
and
religion
and
prudence
and
fear
and
almost
a
crazy
kind
of
thinking
in
they
.
this
be
now
some
story
about
some
of
they
.




I
feel
it
and
I
brood
over
it
and
it
come
then
very
simply
from
I
,
do
you
see
how
simply
it
come
out
of
I
,
you
see
,
I
feel
it
and
I
think
about
it
and
then
I
know
it
and
I
know
then
it
be
a
simple
thing
,
why
be
you
always
say
then
it
be
a
complicated
one
when
really
it
be
a
very
simple
one
this
thing
,
do
you
see
now
it
be
a
very
simple
thing
this
thing
,
do
you
see
that
this
be
a
simple
thing
like
everything
why
then
should
you
make
of
it
a
complicated
thing
when
it
be
a
simple
thing
,
do
you
see
now
that
it
be
a
simple
thing
this
thing
,
why
do
you
make
everything
a
complicated
thing
,
do
you
see
,
this
be
a
simple
thing
,
everything
be
a
simple
thing
,
you
make
everything
a
complicated
thing
when
everything
be
a
simple
thing
,
do
you
see
,
it
be
a
simple
thing
,
you
say
it
be
a
complicated
thing
,
do
you
see
,
everything
be
a
simple
thing
that
be
certain
,
do
you
see
,
that
be
certain
.
very
many
be
always
say
this
thing
,
it
be
very
common
,
to
be
certain
,
to
be
really
certain
that
some
one
be
really
feel
think
see
that
that
one
be
really
feel
think
see
what
that
one
really
be
see
feel
thinking
be
certainly
a
quite
rare
thing
.
mostly
then
it
be
a
difficult
thing
,
a
patient
solemn
thing
to
be
really
certain
that
any
one
be
really
feel
see
thinking
believe
what
that
one
in
the
way
that
one
really
be
feel
think
see
believing
be
feel
think
see
believe
anything
.
these
then
I
be
now
describe
who
be
completely
for
themselves
suspicious
one
,
who
have
it
in
they
to
have
emotion
in
they
become
suspicion
before
it
be
a
real
emotion
of
anything
for
anything
about
anything
in
they
,
these
have
it
completely
to
be
certain
that
every
one
be
do
feeling
see
the
thing
that
one
be
feel
do
see
believe
when
such
a
one
be
not
agree
with
they
,
when
such
a
one
be
feel
think
believe
do
anything
that
such
a
one
be
do
that
thing
for
a
mean
or
wicked
or
jealous
or
stupid
or
obstinate
or
cursed
or
religious
reason
,
it
be
not
a
real
feeling
believe
see
realise
,
that
this
one
have
suspicion
in
he
be
certain
.
one
of
such
a
kind
of
one
once
like
very
well
some
one
and
then
that
one
forget
to
give
this
one
five
cent
that
this
one
have
pay
for
that
one
and
then
this
one
hate
that
one
,
have
no
trust
in
that
one
for
this
one
be
certain
that
that
one
know
that
this
one
be
too
sensitive
to
be
ask
do
not
think
it
necessary
to
pay
that
one
,
he
never
could
believe
that
any
one
forget
such
a
thing
.
this
be
an
extreme
thing
of
a
way
of
feeling
that
be
common
to
all
of
these
of
they
.
another
one
once
be
always
certain
that
some
one
who
one
time
tell
he
that
he
would
sometime
later
be
successful
in
teaching
mean
it
that
he
would
not
be
successful
in
painting
and
that
this
be
because
that
one
be
jealous
of
this
one
although
that
one
have
just
meet
this
one
.
this
one
be
certain
that
every
one
sometime
would
do
a
mean
thing
to
he
and
always
each
one
to
he
sometime
do
this
thing
.
once
one
say
to
he
I
hope
you
will
be
successful
in
the
city
where
you
be
go
to
earn
your
living
.
that
mean
that
you
think
my
way
of
work
rotten
,
you
know
very
well
no
one
make
a
living
there
be
do
good
work
to
your
thinking
,
it
would
be
a
well
thing
to
say
what
you
be
think
straight
out
,
say
this
one
.
one
of
such
a
kind
of
they
be
always
ask
and
always
get
and
always
he
be
certain
that
every
one
be
do
the
thing
they
be
do
because
they
want
to
make
of
he
a
poor
thing
and
some
of
such
of
they
be
always
have
difficulty
with
partner
and
other
and
any
one
and
then
as
I
be
say
when
they
be
old
one
not
any
one
pay
very
much
attention
to
they
.
these
be
some
and
more
,
or
less
like
they
be
very
many
a
very
great
many
always
live
who
have
it
in
they
that
anything
to
they
make
an
emotion
that
be
suspicion
before
it
be
real
emotion
in
they
.




in
some
connect
with
they
,
sensitiveness
that
in
these
I
have
be
just
describe
turn
into
suspicion
before
it
be
sensation
or
emotion
about
a
person
,
a
thing
do
,
or
anything
,
in
these
turn
into
cleverness
in
they
or
self
-
protection
in
the
sense
of
do
nothing
and
break
all
engagement
and
give
up
all
obligation
.
in
some
it
turn
before
it
be
really
a
sensation
into
a
sensual
passion
.
this
be
all
very
interesting
surely
to
any
one
really
believe
really
be
certain
completely
certain
that
different
one
be
different
in
kind
from
other
kind
of
they
be
really
different
in
experience
.
this
be
in
a
way
a
very
difficult
thing
to
really
truly
believe
in
one
,
that
some
one
really
have
a
completely
different
kind
of
a
way
of
feel
a
thing
from
another
one
.
mostly
every
one
in
practical
living
need
only
to
be
completely
realise
their
own
experiencing
and
then
need
only
to
be
realise
other
one
experience
enough
to
be
use
they
,
the
one
experience
.
it
be
a
very
difficult
thing
to
really
believe
it
of
another
one
what
the
other
one
be
really
feel
,
it
be
such
a
very
long
learn
anybody
must
be
have
to
be
really
to
be
actually
believe
this
thing
.
I
do
this
thing
.
I
be
a
rare
one
,
I
know
this
always
more
in
living
,
I
know
always
more
in
live
that
other
one
be
really
believe
what
they
be
believe
,
feel
,
what
they
be
feel
,
think
,
what
they
be
think
,
always
more
and
more
in
live
I
know
I
be
a
rare
one
.
there
be
not
very
many
have
this
very
completely
really
in
they
.




to
go
on
now
then
describe
a
little
more
some
of
these
I
have
be
last
mentioning
.
some
of
these
be
have
their
sensitiveness
making
of
they
clever
,
or
self
-
protect
,
or
sexually
want
anything
,
without
have
really
emotion
from
the
thing
from
the
sensitiveness
in
they
.
these
be
of
the
resist
kind
of
they
and
might
to
some
seem
to
be
engulf
but
they
be
not
really
resist
or
engulf
.
Sensitiveness
turn
into
suspicion
,
cleverness
,
self
-
protection
,
sexual
action
before
it
come
as
an
emotion
and
these
mostly
then
never
have
sensitiveness
in
they
lead
to
emotion
by
reaction
to
a
person
or
thing
or
action
.
these
then
be
interesting
.
to
be
tell
then
now
a
little
more
of
some
of
they
.




these
then
all
of
they
have
it
in
they
that
everything
turn
inside
they
to
suspicion
,
to
cleverness
,
to
self
-
protection
,
to
sexual
emotion
,
to
sensibility
of
a
kind
that
be
a
thing
that
be
call
sentimental
,
before
it
come
to
produce
emotion
from
the
thing
about
the
thing
in
relation
to
the
thing
itself
inside
they
.
there
be
one
,
I
know
this
one
quite
very
well
once
and
last
week
again
I
be
see
this
one
and
now
I
be
quite
a
good
deal
understand
this
one
,
this
be
one
and
in
this
one
everything
be
in
this
one
sensibility
of
a
sentimental
kind
,
this
be
in
this
one
not
very
much
as
suspicion
as
I
be
say
it
be
in
some
,
and
in
this
one
everything
,
nothing
have
any
meaning
except
as
arouse
a
feeling
of
sentimental
sensibility
that
be
the
same
thing
whatever
be
the
thing
that
come
to
this
one
as
touch
this
one
.
this
one
be
pretty
completely
to
every
one
completely
socially
one
and
this
be
quite
a
common
thing
.
sometime
a
history
of
she
and
her
two
mother
and
her
sister
will
be
write
and
I
have
be
tell
that
it
will
be
write
to
several
of
they
.
she
be
as
I
be
say
completely
such
a
one
and
as
a
young
one
be
sharp
and
interesting
and
then
she
be
a
married
one
and
then
she
be
large
and
dull
.
this
be
after
she
succeed
fairly
at
the
beginning
of
her
middle
living
in
come
to
be
a
married
one
.
she
have
not
then
any
reaction
at
all
in
live
for
she
be
then
in
her
married
living
live
with
bottom
be
react
and
there
be
no
bottom
be
in
she
,
live
,
at
all
in
she
then
and
every
one
say
it
be
such
a
surprising
thing
that
she
should
be
then
so
completely
a
submissive
and
indifferent
and
inefficient
and
a
little
a
timid
one
then
when
she
have
be
before
she
be
a
married
one
so
altogether
an
emotional
and
dark
,
expressive
and
clever
one
but
it
be
just
this
thing
that
I
be
say
that
I
be
now
pretty
well
understanding
that
make
it
a
completely
a
natural
thing
,
she
have
not
ever
have
anything
that
do
not
turn
to
sensibility
before
it
reach
she
in
she
and
when
she
be
a
tired
one
and
married
and
fat
then
there
be
not
this
then
.
she
be
an
interesting
one
,
really
she
be
a
very
interesting
one
,
she
be
quite
a
pretty
ugly
one
now
but
not
in
any
way
now
an
active
one
as
now
I
be
completely
realise
.
it
be
an
interesting
history
the
history
of
all
of
this
kind
of
they
.
it
be
a
very
interesting
thing
the
history
of
this
one
.
the
complete
family
living
of
this
one
be
a
thing
I
could
make
a
remarkably
interesting
thing
to
any
one
,
that
be
certain
.
I
have
be
tell
that
to
this
one
.
this
one
do
not
like
very
much
to
hear
I
say
that
thing
,
it
be
a
certain
thing
that
it
be
an
interesting
thing
to
I
and
I
could
tell
it
so
to
every
one
,
I
have
be
tell
it
to
this
one
that
I
can
make
it
a
completely
interesting
thing
.
this
one
be
not
like
it
very
well
then
.
sometime
I
will
be
feel
completely
the
telling
of
it
and
then
I
will
be
tell
it
,
I
have
tell
this
one
that
I
will
tell
it
then
.
this
one
will
not
know
then
it
be
this
one
.
that
be
the
very
nice
thing
in
this
writing
.
sometime
I
will
tell
everything
,
everything
.
mostly
I
do
tell
anything
.




one
of
this
kind
of
they
I
have
be
describe
have
it
that
everything
be
in
she
as
cleverness
,
or
self
-
protection
from
any
stimulation
,
never
an
emotion
about
a
thing
.
this
one
would
,
if
she
could
,
have
real
emotion
but
it
never
be
even
a
little
bit
in
she
of
herself
,
inside
she
.
sometimes
it
be
,
a
moment
,
a
real
feeling
in
she
,
something
from
something
,
when
it
be
make
to
be
in
she
by
some
one
by
force
hold
she
from
have
it
turn
into
cleverness
,
suspicion
,
sentimental
believing
,
selfprotection
and
so
give
it
a
chance
to
sink
into
she
so
that
she
have
a
reaction
to
it
really
in
she
.
this
have
a
few
time
happen
to
she
.
this
one
be
always
feel
that
some
one
should
do
this
for
she
.
hold
she
from
be
her
way
in
she
so
that
emotion
can
be
in
she
have
be
do
for
she
.
she
never
can
do
this
for
herself
,
ever
.
she
be
in
her
feel
certain
that
every
one
in
this
way
should
be
do
for
she
.
she
be
all
her
living
need
that
some
one
do
this
thing
.
she
have
it
in
she
as
a
feeling
that
the
world
owe
it
to
she
to
do
this
for
she
.
she
have
not
ever
any
really
grateful
feeling
,
she
have
only
the
emotion
that
some
one
win
in
she
for
she
.
it
be
an
interesting
game
to
play
in
she
and
very
many
do
it
for
she
.
then
they
lose
the
power
and
she
have
to
have
another
.
she
do
not
know
that
she
be
certain
that
the
world
owe
this
to
she
.




this
one
then
would
have
it
in
she
to
be
certain
that
to
be
dead
be
not
to
be
at
all
really
a
dead
one
,
this
be
what
this
one
want
to
have
in
she
as
realisation
,
as
emotion
,
this
conviction
be
what
this
one
be
very
certain
the
world
owe
she
.
this
be
what
this
one
want
that
she
should
have
in
she
,
have
as
emotion
inside
she
,
this
emotion
in
she
be
what
every
one
know
should
do
for
she
inside
she
.
very
many
come
to
know
she
try
to
give
it
to
she
,
always
she
be
want
to
have
this
inside
she
,
the
conviction
,
the
emotion
that
to
be
dead
be
not
to
be
really
a
dead
one
.
this
be
the
history
of
the
living
in
she
.
she
have
in
she
as
I
be
say
to
have
it
that
nothing
give
to
she
really
an
emotion
about
that
thing
.
every
thing
touch
she
arouse
in
her
suspicion
,
cleverness
and
self
-
protection
.
she
want
to
have
conviction
and
emotion
that
to
be
dead
be
not
to
be
really
truly
a
dead
one
.
she
want
this
in
she
,
this
realisation
and
emotion
,
in
she
,
and
then
too
she
would
be
certain
,
she
know
then
she
would
then
be
really
certain
completely
certain
that
every
one
be
a
very
much
well
one
than
each
one
really
be
in
living
.
she
be
certain
,
pretty
nearly
certain
that
if
she
be
really
completely
certain
that
she
be
really
know
that
to
be
dead
be
not
to
be
at
all
a
really
dead
one
she
would
then
be
know
that
every
one
live
be
really
a
very
much
well
one
than
each
one
really
be
live
and
this
would
be
a
very
pleasant
feeling
for
she
to
be
have
.
always
then
she
be
need
to
be
completely
certain
that
she
be
really
know
that
to
be
dead
be
not
to
be
really
at
all
a
dead
one
and
always
she
be
unconsciously
feel
that
the
world
owe
she
owe
it
to
she
to
give
she
this
realisation
.
this
be
a
history
of
she
.
perhaps
she
never
come
really
to
have
it
in
she
,
perhaps
she
come
to
have
it
a
little
in
she
,
always
some
one
be
work
in
she
for
she
,
this
be
a
history
of
she
.
this
be
an
amusing
thing
,
this
history
of
this
one
.
sometime
a
very
detailed
history
of
this
one
will
be
an
amusing
thing
to
be
write
,
to
be
read
.
now
I
will
not
tell
any
more
detail
of
this
one
.
some
as
I
be
say
have
it
in
they
to
have
this
kind
of
reaction
I
have
be
describe
as
sexual
emotion
and
one
such
a
one
that
I
be
know
be
quite
an
interesting
one
,
quite
an
extraordinary
one
and
sometime
I
will
tell
some
of
the
exciting
thing
in
her
living
but
not
now
,
now
I
be
go
on
describe
three
more
kind
of
resist
being
.
these
I
have
be
describe
be
resist
be
in
the
sense
that
they
would
be
resist
if
they
have
any
real
emotion
in
they
about
anything
but
really
they
have
not
that
in
they
and
resist
be
in
they
be
a
thing
in
they
one
be
know
in
they
from
resemblance
between
they
and
those
really
resist
in
living
.
enough
of
this
kind
of
they
then
now
as
I
be
say
,
I
will
begin
again
some
time
with
they
,
that
be
almost
certain
.




I
be
now
go
to
give
very
little
description
of
three
other
kind
in
resist
being
and
then
perhaps
a
few
more
will
be
add
themselves
in
but
I
be
hope
that
not
very
many
will
be
add
themselves
then
because
I
will
be
want
to
be
go
on
write
the
history
of
Alfred
Hersland
which
will
certainly
be
more
interesting
now
that
every
one
know
so
very
much
more
of
resist
,
of
resist
engulfing
be
in
man
and
woman
.




this
one
I
be
begin
describe
be
a
little
connected
on
with
these
I
have
be
just
describe
and
be
a
little
connected
on
with
the
next
one
I
will
be
describe
which
be
to
be
the
kind
of
resist
be
who
be
continually
attack
.
this
one
then
be
not
an
easy
one
to
be
describe
,
I
will
begin
a
little
slowly
now
to
be
think
and
then
I
will
do
a
little
a
very
little
writing
.
to
commence
now
with
my
thinking
.
I
be
think
now
of
this
one
.




this
one
be
of
the
resist
kind
in
man
and
woman
,
might
have
be
of
the
engulf
kind
of
they
,
be
not
at
all
of
the
engulf
kind
of
they
be
only
a
resist
one
,
have
a
feeling
of
be
an
engulf
kind
of
they
which
make
this
one
have
very
much
emotion
of
dominate
with
stern
action
.
this
one
be
of
the
resist
kind
in
man
and
woman
,
this
one
have
a
little
,
have
quite
a
good
deal
,
have
very
often
,
have
in
a
way
always
the
emotion
of
dominate
by
engulf
,
this
make
this
one
in
she
inside
she
in
her
feeling
and
often
in
she
talk
melodramatic
in
description
,
really
this
one
be
resist
,
quite
nicely
,
quite
successfully
a
resist
one
,
not
at
all
really
an
engulf
one
,
quite
a
good
deal
an
engulf
one
to
herself
inside
she
in
her
feeling
.
feel
herself
to
be
be
an
engulf
one
give
to
this
one
melodramatic
sensation
of
be
an
important
one
,
this
one
be
quite
a
bit
an
important
one
in
live
by
the
resist
being
that
be
really
win
be
in
she
.
a
little
with
an
animal
or
with
her
child
she
be
a
little
to
herself
then
and
a
little
to
they
an
engulf
one
,
really
she
be
not
at
all
an
engulf
one
,
she
be
certainly
completely
a
resist
one
.
as
I
be
say
be
to
herself
inside
she
an
engulf
one
give
to
her
melodrama
of
herself
to
herself
inside
she
,
melodrama
in
herself
to
herself
inside
she
in
she
live
with
other
one
,
really
there
be
not
melodrama
in
her
live
mostly
in
she
,
a
little
with
a
little
child
or
an
animal
around
she
,
really
not
at
all
in
live
in
she
.
she
have
from
this
melodrama
,
in
she
later
,
a
history
inside
she
of
the
past
live
in
she
and
this
be
of
she
as
a
completely
dominatingly
engulf
be
in
her
living
.
this
one
then
certainly
be
in
live
simply
a
resist
sensitive
fairly
of
the
resist
sensitive
being
,
dependent
as
dependent
independent
one
have
it
to
be
dependent
in
they
,
not
at
all
in
bottom
be
an
engulf
one
.
this
one
then
be
connect
with
the
group
I
have
be
describe
by
this
conception
she
have
of
her
own
being
but
she
be
different
from
these
I
have
be
describe
for
she
have
not
the
being
in
she
of
be
something
from
sensitiveness
in
she
as
these
have
it
really
in
they
.
in
she
it
be
melodrama
.
she
be
really
steadily
win
resist
sensitive
bottom
dependent
independent
being
.
this
one
be
connect
with
the
one
I
will
now
be
describe
because
this
one
make
out
of
this
being
she
have
in
she
a
little
to
herself
and
to
very
little
one
near
she
a
kind
of
attack
being
,
of
dominate
by
stern
attacking
and
this
be
from
the
,
to
herself
,
engulf
be
in
she
.
really
this
one
be
not
really
at
all
an
engulf
one
.
really
this
one
I
have
be
just
describe
be
not
so
completely
clearly
in
my
feeling
as
I
would
have
they
I
be
describe
.
it
be
there
,
but
not
so
absolutely
there
as
a
realisation
,
that
I
can
be
content
with
own
what
I
be
know
.
I
will
not
then
say
now
any
more
about
this
one
.
I
will
now
say
a
little
about
another
one
,
one
who
be
of
the
resist
kind
of
they
,
not
at
all
of
the
engulf
kind
of
they
,
one
who
be
to
herself
and
to
every
one
always
an
attack
one
.
this
one
be
attack
the
way
a
boy
be
when
he
be
throw
into
water
and
be
scared
then
and
every
kind
of
way
be
hit
the
water
so
as
to
keep
the
water
from
drown
he
.
such
a
boy
make
very
much
splashing
.
this
be
the
kind
of
attack
this
one
have
in
her
living
,
this
one
be
so
scared
she
be
always
hit
out
in
every
direction
,
this
one
have
little
moment
of
know
she
be
a
timid
one
,
mostly
she
be
certain
she
be
a
very
attack
successfully
attack
one
.




this
resist
one
be
very
often
,
and
mostly
always
,
brag
,
be
very
often
certain
that
to
be
the
one
that
one
be
in
living
be
to
be
one
quick
and
poignant
in
emotion
and
quick
in
vigorous
attacking
.
this
one
be
this
to
a
considerable
number
see
this
one
do
living
,
know
this
one
all
her
living
.
this
one
be
this
,
be
an
attack
one
to
mostly
every
one
see
this
one
do
all
the
living
in
this
one
.
in
a
way
as
I
be
say
it
be
true
of
this
one
.
a
boy
think
he
be
drown
be
hit
the
water
every
kind
of
way
to
keep
it
from
drown
he
and
as
I
be
say
he
be
make
very
much
splashing
.
resist
then
be
the
being
in
this
one
,
hit
in
every
direction
be
the
living
in
this
one
,
brag
always
that
this
one
be
do
more
hitting
than
any
other
one
be
always
in
this
one
,
engulf
be
not
at
all
in
this
one
.
this
one
know
sometimes
that
she
be
really
a
timid
one
.
this
one
be
not
win
by
resist
,
not
by
sensitive
dependent
being
,
because
this
one
be
always
hit
away
make
a
whirlwind
around
this
one
so
that
not
anything
could
come
near
this
one
to
attack
this
one
.
this
one
be
not
really
a
successful
one
in
inner
living
,
not
in
loving
,
not
in
win
permanently
any
one
,
not
in
win
permanently
with
work
,
resist
be
the
way
of
win
for
this
one
and
this
one
be
not
ever
in
live
really
resist
to
anything
,
this
one
be
always
hit
in
every
direction
,
this
one
be
really
a
slow
one
,
this
one
be
to
herself
a
very
quick
one
,
this
one
be
hit
in
a
quick
enough
fashion
but
she
be
not
hit
anything
she
be
attack
,
hit
in
every
direction
one
must
sometimes
hit
something
,
this
one
sometimes
hit
something
,
to
this
one
she
be
always
hit
something
,
to
a
good
many
know
this
one
she
be
always
hit
something
.
this
one
be
very
certain
in
a
foolish
way
of
be
timid
and
always
hit
out
at
anything
that
she
have
really
intuition
,
that
she
be
really
certain
that
to
be
dead
be
not
to
be
at
all
,
why
not
a
bit
,
a
dead
one
.
this
one
be
tell
this
very
often
.
this
one
be
tell
this
in
a
way
once
to
several
listening
.
this
one
be
a
very
common
type
of
resist
being
and
I
know
very
many
of
this
kind
of
they
and
all
of
they
be
certain
of
themselves
to
be
certainly
know
whether
to
be
dead
be
to
be
or
not
to
be
a
really
dead
one
.
that
be
complete
attack
,
by
they
.
this
one
be
tell
of
the
way
this
one
be
certain
.
this
one
be
tell
that
she
be
certain
some
one
be
a
bad
one
.
she
know
it
she
be
certain
,
she
know
it
by
intuition
,
she
know
it
by
her
feeling
,
she
know
it
because
she
know
that
to
be
dead
be
not
to
be
at
all
,
not
the
least
bit
a
really
dead
one
.
this
one
as
I
be
say
be
completely
a
resist
one
but
this
one
never
be
really
resist
,
this
one
be
,
even
she
herself
know
that
a
little
,
a
timid
one
,
she
know
she
be
afraid
always
with
a
man
.
this
one
be
a
very
typical
one
of
the
resist
kind
who
be
always
attack
and
attack
be
not
at
all
the
way
to
win
for
they
.
these
then
be
incessant
in
attack
,
they
be
never
at
all
rest
from
attack
,
mostly
they
know
that
they
be
not
win
in
loving
,
mostly
they
think
they
can
be
certain
that
to
be
dead
be
to
be
or
be
not
to
be
a
dead
one
,
they
be
mostly
always
not
really
win
in
love
.
this
one
that
I
be
describe
be
not
ever
win
in
loving
,
this
one
be
certain
that
this
one
have
a
feeling
that
be
certain
about
be
a
dead
one
be
to
be
not
a
dead
one
.
this
one
be
certain
of
the
intuition
this
one
have
of
every
one
.
this
be
really
in
this
one
from
the
dependent
being
in
this
one
and
the
stupid
attack
in
this
one
.
this
be
the
way
this
one
tell
of
one
complete
intuition
.




there
be
a
whole
series
of
this
kind
of
they
that
I
know
in
living
.
I
see
yesterday
afternoon
two
of
they
together
and
one
of
these
two
of
they
do
not
do
very
much
attack
and
she
be
successful
in
love
and
she
be
very
dependent
and
very
independent
in
the
way
dependent
independent
kind
of
they
have
it
in
they
to
be
win
.
I
know
once
very
well
another
one
of
this
kind
of
they
who
be
always
do
considerable
attacking
and
always
do
very
much
bragging
and
always
want
to
be
think
inside
in
this
one
and
tell
it
to
every
one
when
this
one
hear
mention
anything
do
that
this
one
be
do
everything
quick
and
strong
and
far
and
short
and
slow
and
happy
and
sad
and
weak
and
complete
and
every
other
kind
of
more
or
less
that
any
one
can
conceive
of
anything
,
than
any
one
.
but
always
this
one
be
really
solidly
winningly
resistingly
dependently
independently
live
.
this
one
have
it
as
a
simple
conviction
that
this
one
could
do
everything
,
this
one
do
mostly
everything
,
this
one
be
certain
that
to
be
dead
be
to
be
a
dead
one
,
attack
be
almost
in
this
one
not
a
stupid
thing
but
it
be
in
this
one
stupid
be
because
after
all
this
one
be
completely
a
resist
one
and
dependent
independent
be
the
being
in
this
one
.
this
one
have
dependent
and
independent
being
so
well
balanced
in
her
living
that
almost
attack
and
bragging
be
not
stupid
be
in
this
one
but
really
it
be
stupid
be
in
this
one
in
the
final
meaning
of
the
being
in
this
one
because
this
one
really
be
win
in
love
and
living
and
work
by
resist
being
and
all
the
attacking
be
in
this
one
be
hit
to
keep
away
attack
from
come
and
be
not
really
the
natural
way
of
win
fighting
as
an
attacking
and
so
then
this
one
be
of
this
kind
of
they
I
be
describe
but
this
one
be
completely
and
entirely
an
efficient
one
.
the
other
one
that
I
have
begin
describe
the
one
that
be
the
first
one
of
this
kind
of
they
that
I
mention
in
my
writing
,
be
always
splashing
always
hit
in
every
direction
,
be
in
a
way
quite
a
competent
one
but
really
be
a
timid
one
,
be
one
not
successful
in
loving
,
be
one
that
as
a
poor
one
would
not
have
be
successful
as
a
whole
in
living
,
be
not
successful
as
this
one
think
this
one
inside
this
one
to
be
a
successful
one
but
be
to
very
many
know
this
one
a
very
,
a
strikingly
successful
one
.
really
this
one
be
not
a
successful
one
in
loving
and
that
be
interesting
.
this
one
have
two
kind
of
way
of
have
stupid
being
,
one
be
as
timid
being
,
one
be
as
attack
be
.
of
the
attacking
being
I
have
be
give
a
description
.
of
the
timid
being
I
have
give
only
a
very
little
description
.
as
I
be
say
this
one
have
it
to
think
that
this
one
be
certain
that
to
be
dead
be
not
to
be
at
all
a
dead
one
.
this
be
a
comfort
to
all
the
stupid
being
in
this
one
to
all
the
dependent
being
in
this
one
.
this
be
a
comfort
to
the
stupid
being
in
this
one
,
to
the
timidity
and
to
the
attack
feeling
and
act
always
in
this
one
.
intuition
,
feel
this
one
have
intuition
be
stupid
be
in
this
one
.
this
one
be
not
at
all
in
many
way
a
stupid
one
.
this
one
be
a
stupid
one
when
between
timidity
and
universal
attack
this
one
have
intuition
.
"
yes
I
can
always
tell
what
any
one
be
,
what
a
man
be
,
what
a
woman
be
,
what
a
child
be
,
what
a
very
little
child
be
,
"
say
this
one
.
"
I
be
very
certain
in
my
feeling
,
just
listen
.
once
I
meet
a
man
,
I
know
this
man
be
just
the
kind
of
a
man
I
know
he
be
,
I
be
certain
when
I
see
he
,
every
time
I
see
he
I
be
certain
,
once
he
come
into
this
house
and
I
shake
hand
with
he
,
I
be
more
than
ever
certain
that
this
man
be
the
kind
of
a
man
I
have
think
he
.
I
do
n't
see
he
very
often
,
I
would
never
meet
he
if
I
could
avoid
he
,
I
never
make
a
mistake
about
a
person
about
a
man
or
a
woman
or
about
child
when
I
have
an
intuition
.
"
this
one
as
I
be
say
have
stupid
be
from
a
timid
feeling
,
completely
a
timid
feeling
,
from
be
quite
the
dependent
kind
of
the
dependent
independent
kind
of
they
and
from
the
attack
acting
,
attack
living
that
be
always
to
this
one
and
to
every
one
all
the
living
in
this
one
.
this
one
like
the
feeling
of
be
certain
that
to
be
dead
be
not
to
be
at
all
a
dead
one
,
this
be
very
satisfying
to
the
timid
feeling
and
the
attacking
be
in
this
one
,
this
be
stupid
be
in
this
one
,
this
one
be
not
wise
in
love
or
in
religion
,
this
one
be
quite
efficient
in
every
day
live
,
this
one
to
very
many
be
quite
a
successful
one
,
to
very
many
a
brilliantly
successful
one
.
this
be
all
I
will
be
write
now
about
this
one
,
this
be
not
enough
really
about
this
one
,
I
ought
to
be
write
very
much
more
about
this
kind
of
they
,
all
I
think
about
this
kind
of
they
be
inside
I
quite
sure
,
quite
certain
,
I
do
not
yet
think
all
that
can
be
think
or
feel
about
this
kind
of
they
,
I
do
think
and
feel
more
about
this
kind
of
they
than
I
have
just
write
.
I
have
not
just
now
a
very
patient
feeling
about
write
about
this
kind
of
they
.
I
want
to
be
have
soon
a
completely
patient
feeling
in
write
the
description
of
all
resist
being
,
of
all
resist
engulfing
being
,
in
write
the
history
of
Alfred
Hersland
.
I
will
now
write
one
more
description
and
will
so
be
end
just
now
the
considerable
number
of
resist
one
I
have
be
describe
.
I
will
then
go
on
to
a
little
generalising
and
then
to
patiently
feel
in
I
the
history
of
Alfred
Hersland
and
all
resist
engulf
being
.




when
I
have
not
be
right
there
must
be
something
wrong
.
every
one
say
to
I
I
be
always
certain
I
be
right
about
everything
and
I
must
be
certain
of
that
thing
because
otherwise
there
be
something
wrong
and
that
be
a
wearying
,
wear
thing
and
then
I
must
be
begin
learn
everything
.




I
have
be
very
glad
to
have
be
wrong
.
it
be
sometimes
a
very
hard
thing
to
win
myself
to
having
be
wrong
about
something
.
I
do
a
great
deal
of
suffering
.




I
have
be
glad
to
have
be
wrong
and
I
have
feel
certain
that
this
be
make
I
a
really
joyous
wise
one
.
I
have
be
very
sad
to
have
to
bring
myself
to
be
certain
that
I
have
be
wrong
about
something
.
this
be
now
a
little
more
history
of
I
and
the
kind
of
suffering
I
can
have
in
I
.
this
be
a
little
a
description
of
the
suffering
I
do
have
in
I
.




when
I
have
not
be
right
there
must
be
something
wrong
.
that
be
what
I
say
to
myself
inside
I
.
that
be
what
some
one
sometimes
say
to
I
.
this
have
be
say
to
I
.
this
I
do
say
to
myself
inside
I
.
when
I
have
not
be
right
there
must
be
something
wrong
.




this
be
in
a
way
the
meaning
of
all
live
in
I
.
this
be
the
way
I
have
suffer
in
I
.
when
I
have
not
be
right
there
must
be
something
wrong
.
I
have
be
very
glad
to
have
be
wrong
.
it
be
sometimes
a
very
wear
thing
to
have
be
wrong
about
something
.




I
have
it
in
I
in
be
that
I
be
resist
in
be
,
I
be
fairly
slow
in
action
and
in
feeling
,
if
I
be
not
slow
in
acting
and
in
feeling
and
in
listen
I
be
not
certain
that
I
myself
be
do
that
act
listening
feeling
,
I
would
be
think
something
be
happen
,
it
would
be
over
and
I
would
not
be
realise
that
I
myself
be
listen
,
feeling
,
act
.
when
I
be
very
slow
in
listen
feeling
thinking
realise
then
I
can
still
need
to
have
it
that
I
be
still
to
be
slow
in
do
anything
.
when
I
have
not
be
right
there
must
be
something
wrong
.
I
may
then
perhaps
be
quick
in
listen
feeling
realise
,
I
must
then
be
slow
in
conclude
.
I
have
very
much
wisdom
.
I
want
sometime
to
be
completely
understand
every
one
so
that
sometime
I
will
be
right
about
every
one
.
and
now
I
be
not
know
anything
at
all
really
of
the
feeling
any
one
have
in
they
when
they
be
between
fourteen
and
eighteen
.
I
certainly
will
be
need
to
know
this
thing
.
I
know
now
I
do
not
know
at
all
the
feeling
in
such
of
they
,
those
be
at
that
time
of
living
,
I
can
not
then
really
be
right
about
every
one
yet
,
that
be
certain
.
when
I
have
not
be
right
there
must
be
something
wrong
.
I
know
that
very
well
in
I
.
some
one
say
I
feel
that
in
I
.
I
certainly
do
feel
that
in
I
.
I
be
hope
sometime
to
be
right
about
every
one
,
about
everything
.
I
do
.
I
certainly
do
hope
this
thing
.
that
be
to
say
I
want
to
realise
every
one
,
I
want
to
write
a
history
of
every
one
.
sometime
I
want
to
be
right
about
every
one
.
perhaps
I
be
right
now
about
some
.
perhaps
I
be
right
now
about
a
good
many
man
and
woman
who
be
and
be
and
will
be
live
.
perhaps
I
be
right
about
almost
all
of
they
.
certainly
when
I
be
not
right
something
be
wrong
and
I
must
know
it
in
I
,
in
they
then
.
I
want
to
write
a
history
of
every
one
.
sometime
I
want
to
be
right
about
every
one
.
perhaps
I
be
right
now
about
some
.
certainly
I
be
right
now
about
a
very
great
many
man
and
woman
about
the
being
in
they
.
certainly
I
be
right
now
in
my
realising
of
a
very
considerable
number
of
they
,
of
man
and
woman
who
be
and
be
and
will
be
live
,
of
a
very
considerable
number
of
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
sometime
I
want
to
be
right
about
every
one
,
I
want
to
realise
every
one
.
sometime
I
want
to
write
the
history
of
every
one
.
always
when
I
be
not
right
something
be
wrong
.
certainly
I
be
right
about
a
very
great
many
,
that
be
certain
.
sometime
I
want
to
be
right
about
every
one
.
I
want
to
be
completely
realise
every
one
sometime
.
this
be
what
I
be
want
.
sometimes
I
be
very
glad
to
have
be
wrong
.
sometimes
it
be
a
very
wear
thing
bring
my
feeling
to
the
realisation
that
I
have
be
wrong
about
something
.
sometimes
it
be
such
a
tempting
thing
to
let
it
go
that
I
have
,
be
right
about
something
.
I
want
sometime
to
be
right
about
every
one
.
I
want
sometime
to
write
a
history
of
every
one
,
of
every
kind
there
be
in
man
and
woman
.
it
would
be
such
a
satisfaction
always
to
be
right
about
every
one
,
such
a
certain
,
active
feeling
in
I
.
I
want
sometime
to
be
sure
when
I
know
something
that
I
be
completely
right
in
my
certain
feeling
.
sometime
I
want
to
be
completely
certain
.
I
be
one
that
in
this
way
be
want
to
be
completely
certain
,
be
want
to
be
right
in
be
completely
certain
and
in
this
way
only
in
I
can
it
come
to
be
in
I
that
to
be
dead
be
not
to
be
a
dead
one
.
really
to
be
just
dead
be
to
be
to
I
a
really
dead
one
.
to
be
completely
right
,
completely
certain
be
to
be
in
I
universal
in
my
feeling
,
to
be
like
the
earth
complete
and
fructifying
.
this
be
do
talk
.
I
will
now
begin
again
.
I
really
be
want
to
be
sometime
right
about
every
one
.
I
be
want
sometime
to
tell
about
secrecy
in
those
have
in
they
resist
being
,
sometime
later
in
the
history
of
Alfred
Hersland
I
will
be
discuss
this
thing
.




I
have
now
describe
the
considerable
number
of
kind
of
the
resist
kind
of
they
that
I
be
go
to
be
describe
and
I
have
now
finish
do
this
thing
.
I
will
now
be
add
a
very
few
not
only
of
the
resist
kind
of
they
but
of
both
resist
and
attack
one
to
make
another
generalisation
but
really
there
have
be
already
do
the
considerable
number
of
the
resist
kind
of
they
in
man
and
woman
that
I
be
go
to
be
describe
.
these
few
little
addition
be
now
just
for
finish
and
to
be
a
little
commence
explain
relation
between
kind
that
be
resist
and
kind
that
be
attack
and
kind
that
be
kind
in
man
and
woman
.




Lena
,
Maria
and
Hetty
and
other
that
I
be
not
now
name
adapt
their
loving
to
any
one
who
be
interesting
.
they
then
want
,
not
to
own
they
,
not
to
influence
they
,
but
to
feel
power
in
themselves
through
they
,
to
know
inside
they
that
they
be
know
by
know
they
the
thing
the
one
who
be
interesting
be
know
.
these
end
up
very
often
by
marry
a
man
very
popular
with
man
who
only
like
they
out
of
all
woman
,
who
can
only
be
own
by
they
,
of
all
woman
.
some
be
possess
by
a
passionate
desire
for
the
thing
the
interesting
person
be
realise
and
such
one
be
a
little
different
from
these
other
.
some
want
distinction
for
themselves
and
so
they
be
different
.
some
,
Hortense
and
Martha
be
such
of
they
,
care
enough
about
the
man
they
be
love
be
interesting
to
need
to
love
one
have
genius
,
these
two
have
more
real
personal
passion
,
more
found
courage
in
they
than
Lena
or
Maria
or
Hetty
.
some
want
to
do
the
thing
itself
as
if
they
themselves
could
do
the
thing
that
make
the
distinguished
one
a
distinguished
one
even
if
they
know
they
can
not
do
this
thing
to
make
of
themselves
in
it
a
distinguished
one
.
some
of
such
of
they
do
not
know
that
they
begin
to
do
that
thing
from
love
a
distinguished
one
and
some
of
such
of
they
be
so
stubborn
in
do
that
thing
that
they
can
not
learn
about
that
thing
from
the
one
they
be
adapt
themselves
to
,
the
distinguished
one
.




I
be
think
.
I
be
not
yet
certain
.
every
kind
I
have
be
describe
of
the
resist
kind
of
man
and
woman
can
be
find
with
a
different
action
in
the
attack
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
I
be
think
.
I
have
now
describe
a
kind
of
they
and
I
know
some
of
they
and
some
of
they
I
have
know
in
love
,
know
very
well
in
loving
and
some
be
of
the
attacking
and
some
of
the
resist
kind
of
they
and
I
have
be
describe
they
together
so
that
any
one
can
see
why
I
be
think
that
there
be
attack
kind
correlative
to
the
resist
kind
I
have
be
describe
.




Lena
and
Maria
be
of
the
resist
and
Hetty
and
Hortense
and
Martha
be
of
the
attack
kind
of
they
and
all
of
these
have
a
way
of
love
that
in
a
way
be
common
to
all
of
they
,
a
way
of
adapt
their
loving
to
any
one
who
be
interesting
to
feel
power
in
themselves
through
they
.
but
all
of
this
be
one
thing
and
now
be
in
Alfred
Hersland
be
something
.
I
have
be
describe
a
considerable
number
of
man
and
woman
have
resist
be
in
they
.
Alfred
Hersland
have
resist
engulfing
be
in
he
.
having
be
understand
so
many
having
resist
be
in
they
make
it
more
certain
that
I
be
understand
the
being
in
Alfred
Hersland
.




Alfred
Hersland
have
resist
be
somewhat
engulf
resist
be
in
he
.
he
have
not
anything
at
all
of
the
attack
kind
of
be
in
he
.
he
be
all
of
engulf
resist
being
.
Alfred
have
it
in
he
to
have
his
being
in
he
so
that
it
be
a
little
passionate
in
he
,
not
very
affectionate
in
he
,
not
so
as
to
be
very
good
in
he
,
not
really
ever
very
bad
in
he
,
sometimes
as
aspiration
in
he
,
more
or
less
as
ambition
in
he
,
sometimes
as
virtuous
and
didactic
in
he
.
the
kind
of
be
he
have
in
he
be
of
a
kind
of
be
that
in
some
have
it
in
they
make
of
they
be
devout
in
religion
,
quite
aspire
in
their
living
,
quite
ambitious
for
succeed
,
make
of
they
mystic
in
religion
so
as
to
let
themselves
be
absorb
all
exist
,
some
of
they
have
this
kind
of
be
in
they
have
religion
in
they
.
some
have
this
kind
of
be
in
they
be
meek
enough
in
living
and
yet
a
little
dominating
in
family
living
and
some
of
such
of
they
need
to
have
as
a
wife
to
they
some
one
very
vibratingly
exist
to
give
to
they
enough
stimulation
to
make
they
keep
really
alive
inside
they
.
all
these
then
be
of
the
resist
the
dependent
independent
kind
of
they
.
some
of
they
have
the
being
in
they
inside
and
some
of
these
then
be
try
to
engulf
every
one
near
they
to
be
lose
inside
they
,
to
be
swallow
by
they
and
some
of
they
be
not
interested
in
very
many
person
near
they
but
some
of
they
they
need
to
have
engulf
by
they
and
so
then
Alfred
Hersland
be
of
the
kind
of
they
the
resist
dependent
independent
kind
of
they
,
the
kind
that
own
those
they
need
for
loving
.
many
of
such
of
they
do
not
really
in
their
living
need
any
one
for
love
.
Alfred
Hersland
to
my
feeling
have
be
in
he
as
piece
only
of
be
.
this
be
now
to
be
more
history
of
he
.
he
be
of
the
resist
engulfing
kind
of
they
,
his
being
be
a
little
passionate
,
not
very
affectionate
,
not
so
very
good
,
not
really
so
very
bad
in
he
,
somewhat
as
aspiration
in
he
,
a
good
deal
as
ambition
in
he
,
possibly
as
religion
in
he
,
certainly
as
weakness
in
he
,
not
altogether
as
successful
in
he
.
he
have
his
being
in
he
and
to
very
many
be
be
not
complete
in
he
.
he
be
not
a
very
strong
one
,
he
be
not
altogether
a
weak
one
.
this
be
now
to
be
completely
a
history
of
he
and
the
living
he
have
all
together
in
he
.




very
many
never
learn
anything
from
the
experience
with
themselves
they
have
in
living
.
very
many
be
never
at
all
learn
anything
with
the
experience
they
be
have
of
themselves
in
their
living
.
very
many
be
always
expect
out
of
themselves
what
they
could
have
certainly
be
learn
that
they
would
not
ever
be
succeed
in
do
.
very
many
be
not
all
their
living
learn
anything
from
the
experience
they
have
with
themselves
in
their
living
.
this
be
very
common
.
Alfred
Hersland
in
a
way
be
such
a
one
.
all
the
Hersland
man
in
a
way
be
such
one
in
their
being
,
Mr.
David
Hersland
in
his
living
,
Alfred
and
David
Hersland
in
their
living
.
Alfred
Hersland
be
in
a
way
such
a
one
.
this
be
now
to
be
a
complete
history
of
he
.




there
be
always
,
perhaps
there
be
always
something
in
what
every
one
say
about
any
one
.
in
some
way
anything
,
everything
any
one
,
every
one
say
about
any
one
be
a
true
thing
.
each
one
say
something
about
some
one
and
that
one
say
something
say
a
number
of
thing
sometime
about
herself
or
himself
and
everything
any
one
,
anything
any
one
say
about
that
one
anything
that
one
say
about
that
one
everything
that
one
say
about
that
one
be
in
a
way
a
true
thing
.
always
then
sometime
there
be
a
complete
history
of
some
one
,
sometime
there
will
be
a
complete
history
of
Julia
Dehning
.
sometime
there

description
of
the
living
in
Alfred
Hersland
and
of
the
people
Alfred
Hersland
come
to
know
in
living
,
and
now
I
be
feel
a
complete
realisation
of
the
difference
between
affection
and
passion
and
soon
there
will
be
a
description
of
Alfred
Hersland
know
the
man
who
be
a
musician
and
of
Alfred
Hersland
know
the
woman
who
be
the
sister
of
the
first
governess
the
Herslands
have
had
live
with
they
in
the
ten
acre
place
in
Gossols
.
these
two
be
a
little
important
to
he
in
his
early
living
as
I
have
already
be
say
.
I
be
very
interested
just
now
in
the
difference
between
passion
and
affection
and
I
will
now
tell
about
a
man
and
then
I
will
describe
the
musician
Alfred
Hersland
come
to
know
in
his
early
living
a
Mr.
Arragon
who
be
really
foreign
.




I
be
always
more
and
more
realise
that
some
be
piece
of
be
always
in
living
and
some
be
not
such
piece
of
be
in
their
whole
living
.
later
then
I
will
be
describe
be
in
Alfred
Hersland
and
all
the
living
he
have
in
he
.
just
now
as
I
be
say
I
find
it
that
I
be
write
about
a
man
who
have
inspire
affection
in
he
for
beautiful
thing
in
living
and
this
one
be
a
puzzle
to
I
and
then
I
know
it
of
he
that
it
be
inspire
affection
not
passion
he
have
in
he
.
Arragon
have
passion
that
be
not
poignant
in
he
but
it
be
passion
,
this
one
that
be
now
strongly
in
my
feeling
be
one
having
inspire
affection
and
not
at
all
any
passion
in
he
.
this
one
in
his
young
living
to
the
beginning
of
his
middle
living
be
to
very
many
know
he
,
to
himself
always
inside
he
one
have
really
passion
about
beauty
in
living
.
this
one
have
then
inspire
affection
not
passion
in
he
but
inspire
affection
be
so
freshly
poignantly
in
he
and
his
intellect
could
use
it
so
well
for
he
that
to
himself
then
and
to
every
one
then
he
have
real
creation
of
passionately
understand
beautiful
thing
in
living
.
More
and
more
then
this
one
in
his
middle
living
be
not
any
long
create
his
realisation
of
beauty
in
living
,
this
one
be
then
live
on
the
approximation
other
make
for
he
of
everything
this
one
wish
to
have
beautiful
around
he
and
for
live
.
this
one
then
never
could
make
for
himself
the
beautiful
luxury
he
be
need
.
inspire
affection
for
beauty
in
he
awake
in
other
the
need
of
create
as
nearly
as
these
could
do
what
this
one
need
as
beauty
in
living
.
this
one
could
not
create
his
own
taste
in
luxury
in
living
,
he
could
not
create
his
own
taste
for
a
woman
.
a
woman
,
everything
in
his
living
create
itself
to
approximate
,
to
the
taste
this
one
would
have
create
if
this
one
could
have
create
the
thing
this
one
want
to
have
to
arouse
in
he
inspire
affection
.
this
one
then
after
begin
his
middle
living
never
create
anything
,
never
in
his
living
do
this
one
create
love
not
for
beautiful
thing
not
for
a
woman
,
this
one
have
inspire
affection
in
he
and
to
himself
and
to
every
one
it
be
passion
,
it
never
be
passion
in
he
and
more
it
come
out
in
he
as
more
and
more
in
live
this
one
need
that
other
one
by
their
creating
approximate
to
what
his
taste
would
have
be
if
he
have
have
passion
instead
of
affection
for
luxury
and
beauty
in
living
and
so
this
one
more
and
more
be
decline
because
this
one
come
more
and
more
to
have
affection
for
thing
other
create
to
be
what
this
one
would
have
want
to
have
in
live
if
this
one
could
have
create
what
this
one
be
need
to
have
to
arouse
he
to
inspire
affection
and
this
be
a
history
of
this
one
.
now
this
one
as
I
be
say
have
not
passion
in
he
,
not
for
beauty
not
for
a
woman
not
for
anything
,
but
this
one
have
inspire
affection
and
it
be
an
interesting
thing
that
this
one
have
as
a
woman
who
choose
herself
for
he
one
who
be
as
this
one
be
of
the
attack
type
in
man
and
woman
,
this
be
an
interesting
thing
.
I
be
very
happy
in
realise
this
thing
.
I
be
hope
that
this
be
really
the
complete
history
of
this
one
.




Arragon
who
be
a
tittle
important
in
the
living
of
Alfred
Hersland
be
different
from
this
one
I
have
be
just
describe
.
Arragon
have
passion
in
he
but
it
be
not
poignant
in
he
but
brilliant
and
emotional
and
sentimental
.
I
will
now
begin
a
description
of
his
being
and
of
what
Alfred
Hersland
live
through
with
he
.
later
then
I
will
be

teacher
and
the
kind
she
be
in
man
and
woman
.
now
to
begin
again
with
the
musician
.




I
find
it
very
interesting
to
know
the
difference
between
affection
and
passion
,
I
will
now
just
a
little
describe
a
kind
of
they
have
passion
of
which
Arragon
the
musician
who
come
to
know
Alfred
Hersland
when
Alfred
be
just
begin
be
a
man
inside
he
be
one
.
I
know
three
very
well
of
this
kind
of
they
and
very
many
more
or
less
connect
with
this
kind
of
they
.
all
these
I
be
now
describe
,
the
one
I
have
just
be
describe
be
of
the
attack
kind
in
man
,
the
independent
dependent
kind
of
they
.
these
then
that
I
be
now
describe
all
have
really
passion
in
they
passion
that
make
they
create
or
feel
in
themselves
create
feeling
of
something
of
very
much
in
live
.
to
begin
then
.
Alfred
Hersland
be
of
the
resist
engulfing
kind
of
they
,
these
I
be
now
describe
be
of
the
passionate
create
seize
attack
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
there
be
many
kind
of
way
of
be
of
the
attack
kind
in
man
and
woman
that
be
certain
.
I
be
already
realise
a
considerable
number
of
they
.
I
be
realise
pretty
completely
realise
a
very
considerable
number
of
way
of
have
resist
be
in
they
and
I
have
be
already
describe
,
very
well
describe
some
of
those
I
be
always
now
realise
.
I
be
realise
now
some
of
the
attack
kind
of
they
.
there
be
many
kind
of
they
and
I
be
realise
some
of
the
kind
of
they
.
I
have
be
realise
Mr.
Henry
Dehning
and
Martha
Hersland
and
Redfern
and
I
be
say
that
Cora
Dounor
be
of
this
kind
of
they
but
I
be
think
in
that
I
be
mistaken
I
be
think
Cora
Dounor
be
certainly
of
the
resist
kind
of
they
.
there
be
almost
border
case
that
be
certain
I
be
realise
some
of
that
kind
of
they
and
I
will
be
describe
that
in
describe
the
sister
of
the
first
governess
the
Herslands
have
had
live
with
they
.
now
I
be
describe
a
musician
Arragon
who
be
a
man
have
in
he
as
I
be
say
passion
but
this
be
not
poignant
in
he
although
to
himself
and
to
mostly
every
one
it
be
poignant
in
he
because
he
have
so
much
weakness
and
sensitiveness
and
romance
in
he
.
this
one
then
be
of
the
attack
kind
of
they
as
I
be
say
.
I
be
remember
that
I
mean
by
attack
be
those
have
it
in
they
that
emotion
be
poignant
like
sensation
,
that
use
and
purpose
and
organisation
and
synthesise
and
imagine
and
everything
in
relation
be
as
true
in
they
in
begin
as
the
thing
be
exist
.
the
resist
kind
of
they
have
it
in
they
that
a
thing
be
exist
be
more
real
to
they
than
use
or
purpose
or
meaning
in
anything
,
the
attack
kind
of
they
have
it
in
they
that
emotion
be
as
poignant
as
sensation
and
use
and
purpose
and
meaning
and
relation
as
primary
as
exist
.
Mr.
Hersland
be
of
the
attack
kind
in
man
and
woman
,
so
be
Redfern
as
I
be
say
so
be
Martha
Redfern
,
so
be
the
one
I
have
be
just
describe
as
affectionate
and
never
passionate
in
living
and
now
I
be
describe
this
be
in
another
one
in
Mr.
Arragon
a
musician
and
I
will
tell
quite
a
little
now
about
he
and
Alfred
Hersland
like
he
very
much
when
Alfred
be
come
to
be
a
young
man
as
I
have
several
time
be
say
.
Arragon
have
attack
passion
in
he
but
as
I
be
say
it
be
not
very
poignant
in
he
.
in
Redfern
it
be
poignant
but
not
rich
enough
to
sustain
he
,
in
Mr.
Hersland
it
be
poignant
and
rich
but
not
steady
in
he
,
in
the
one
I
have
be
just
describe
it
be
as
affection
and
not
passion
and
in
Arragon
and
it
make
he
a
pretty
good
musician
,
it
be
rich
but
not
poignant
in
he
and
he
make
up
for
it
in
he
by
weakness
and
sensibility
and
feel
himself
to
be
a
really
great
one
and
by
have
moment
of
really
inspire
feeling
when
almost
he
make
it
in
himself
by
love
by
weakness
by
talk
to
be
poignant
inside
he
.




this
kind
then
of
which
Arragon
be
one
be
quite
common
.
every
kind
of
be
be
quite
common
.
that
be
certain
.
there
be
very
many
always
exist
of
each
one
of
all
the
kind
there
be
in
be
.
that
be
certain
.
anyway
it
would
be
certain
but
it
be
certain
to
I
because
I
be
more
and
more
realise
I
know
a
considerable
number
of
each
kind
I
be
ever
know
.
More
and
more
in
live
I
come
to
know
enough
of
each
kind
of
they
to
make
group
of
they
.
sometime
I
will
be
able
to
make
a
diagram
.
I
have
already
make
several
diagram
.
I
will
sometime
make
a
complete
diagram
and
that
will
be
a
very
long
book
that
will
tell
all
about
each
kind
there
be
of
man
and
woman
.
but
just
now
I
be
think
of
this
one
kind
of
they
,
the
kind
of
which
Arragon
be
one
.




this
kind
of
they
as
I
have
be
say
be
those
have
in
they
attack
passion
.
as
I
be
say
I
know
just
now
pretty
well
three
of
they
.
I
know
too
this
one
that
I
be
now
describe
,
that
make
then
four
of
they
.
in
a
way
as
I
be
say
Redfern
be
one
of
such
of
they
.
there
be
some
connect
with
this
kind
of
they
that
have
this
be
in
they
passionate
attack
as
highly
suggestible
emotion
in
they
.
that
be
one
kind
of
they
,
sometime
there
will
be
much
description
of
such
of
they
.
some
be
connect
with
this
kind
of
they
that
have
it
in
they
to
be
so
stupidly
in
they
that
it
really
make
of
they
that
all
their
life
they
be
obstinately
resist
everything
,
these
be
connect
with
Mrs.
Redfern
,
these
be
connect
with
Julia
Dehning
,
these
can
sometimes
sometime
in
their
living
get
an
impression
but
mostly
all
of
their
living
they
be
obstinately
resist
lose
their
attack
passion
.
there
will
sometime
necessarily
be
very
much
description
of
they
.
then
there
be
some
who
have
attack
passion
so
sensitively
so
delicately
in
they
that
mostly
they
be
delicately
vibrate
and
only
sometime
be
the
thing
go
fast
enough
in
they
to
make
such
of
they
really
attack
.
some
of
such
of
they
be
very
lovely
one
in
all
their
feeling
live
,
sometime
there
will
be
a
long
description
of
a
lovely
one
.
these
then
will
be
lead
to
a
whole
group
have
in
they
flavor
realise
as
complete
exist
and
sometime
I
will
tell
so
very
much
about
such
a
kind
of
they
.
and
then
there
be
the
group
that
do
not
have
it
at
all
as
passion
but
as
affection
as
I
be
say
.
and
then
there
be
some
that
be
steadily
press
in
attack
,
some
who
perhaps
in
their
living
be
always
really
win
.
then
there
be
some
in
whom
passion
be
emotion
before
it
can
be
act
as
passion
and
all
these
group
be
of
course
extremely
interesting
.
now
I
be
describe
one
group
of
this
group
of
they
who
have
it
in
they
to
have
attack
passion
in
they
and
some
have
it
in
they
poignantly
and
they
be
weak
in
living
,
and
some
have
it
poignantly
and
their
nature
be
not
abundant
in
they
and
some
have
it
in
they
poignantly
and
they
be
rich
in
beginning
and
they
be
always
all
their
living
in
beginning
and
some
have
it
poignantly
in
they
and
be
rich
in
be
and
be
rich
in
develop
in
be
and
in
living
and
some
have
it
poignantly
in
they
and
nothing
be
good
enough
to
hold
they
and
some
have
it
poignantly
in
they
and
they
be
not
strong
enough
to
keep
anything
and
some
be
practical
with
it
and
some
be
not
at
all
practical
not
even
sensible
with
it
and
some
do
not
have
it
poignantly
in
they
and
this
musician
Alfred
Hersland
know
in
his
young
living
be
one
of
such
of
they
.




I
like
think
about
kind
of
they
in
man
and
woman
.
I
like
feel
man
and
woman
each
one
as
of
one
kind
of
they
and
that
I
can
that
sometime
I
will
know
other
like
they
.
it
make
it
to
I
a
very
pleasant
world
for
live
.
it
make
it
simple
to
be
certain
that
each
one
every
one
have
their
own
being
in
they
that
each
one
every
one
be
of
a
kind
in
man
and
woman
and
that
always
there
be
exist
very
many
of
each
of
these
kind
of
they
.
this
be
a
pleasant
thing
for
I
to
have
as
certain
in
I
.
I
know
then
there
can
be
a
history
of
each
one
and
of
all
kind
all
the
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
this
be
a
pleasant
feeling
,
this
be
comfort
to
I
just
now
when
I
be
think
of
every
one
always
grow
old
and
then
die
,
now
when
I
be
think
about
each
one
be
sometime
a
sick
one
each
one
be
sometime
a
dead
one
.
this
give
to
I
then
a
pleasant
feeling
know
kind
in
man
and
woman
now
when
I
be
think
that
sometime
each
one
will
be
an
old
one
and
then
each
one
will
be
a
dead
one
.
I
can
understand
that
know
there
be
kind
in
man
and
woman
would
not
be
a
comfort
to
every
one
.
I
can
understand
this
thing
.
I
have
it
in
I
as
a
very
pleasant
feeling
that
always
there
be
kind
in
man
and
woman
and
always
there
be
very
many
exist
of
each
kind
of
they
.
I
have
it
in
I
then
as
I
be
say
this
thing
as
a
very
pleasant
feeling
as
a
pleasant
complete
feeling
,
as
a
completely
content
feeling
and
I
be
know
sometime
each
one
will
be
a
dead
one
and
I
be
know
each
one
have
their
own
being
in
they
and
I
be
know
each
one
be
one
of
a
kind
in
man
and
woman
and
as
I
be
say
I
be
have
a
pleasant
completely
complete
feeling
and
always
then
it
be
a
comfortable
and
calming
thing
this
be
certain
that
each
one
be
one
of
a
kind
of
they
in
man
and
woman
and
that
there
be
always
very
many
of
each
kind
exist
,
that
each
one
have
their
own
being
in
they
be
then
completely
interesting
,
that
each
one
sometime
be
to
be
a
dead
one
be
then
not
discourage
,
and
so
then
I
be
have
a
completely
pleasant
and
complete
feeling
,
I
who
be
completely
certain
that
each
one
be
of
a
kind
in
man
and
woman
,
I
who
be
always
almost
always
know
several
of
each
kind
of
they
I
come
to
know
in
living
,
I
who
be
expect
sometime
perhaps
to
be
know
all
there
ever
can
be
,
be
or
be
or
will
be
of
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
I
have
then
even
with
sombre
certain
feeling
that
each
one
be
always
an
old
one
and
sometime
a
dead
one
I
have
then
know
each
one
be
of
one
kind
in
man
and
woman
I
have
then
a
pleasant
feeling
,
a
content
a
complete
feeling
as
I
have
be
say
.
I
have
a
quiet
sombre
feeling
I
have
not
so
much
an
afraid
feeling
in
be
live
now
when
I
be
certain
,
and
I
be
know
they
,
that
there
be
a
number
of
kind
in
man
and
woman
,
not
such
a
great
number
of
they
,
quite
a
number
of
they
.
each
one
be
themselves
inside
they
,
each
one
every
one
be
of
a
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
this
be
to
I
a
completely
satisfying
thing
.
I
be
begin
again
now
to
describe
one
kind
of
they
,
one
of
one
kind
in
man
and
woman
.




this
musician
,
whom
as
I
be
say
Alfred
Hersland
know
in
his
young
living
be
of
the
sensitive
passionate
attack
kind
in
man
and
woman
but
passion
be
not
really
poignant
in
he
,
sensitiveness
be
very
spread
out
in
he
,
to
himself
and
to
mostly
every
one
passion
be
poignant
in
he
and
he
could
be
ruin
himself
by
love
but
passion
be
not
poignant
in
he
and
in
a
way
this
make
he
a
very
good
musician
,
sensitiveness
be
in
he
and
not
concentration
and
this
be
a
kind
of
they
that
to
very
many
know
they
be
those
who
be
not
successful
because
of
passion
and
of
weakness
in
they
.
mostly
those
of
this
kind
of
they
who
have
passion
as
poignant
in
they
they
have
a
different
way
of
not
succeed
,
they
do
not
come
so
nearly
to
succeed
,
they
do
not
appear
again
when
they
have
go
down
with
the
sensitive
passionate
weakness
in
they
,
they
have
less
power
of
recuperation
.
some
of
these
succeed
very
well
in
living
,
there
certainly
be
some
of
every
kind
there
be
in
man
and
woman
who
succeed
very
well
in
living
,
very
many
of
this
kind
of
they
come
very
nearly
to
completely
succeed
,
very
many
of
they
have
very
much
weakness
,
I
be
get
a
little
diffused
about
they
,
I
have
several
in
I
all
at
once
and
they
be
crowd
and
they
be
come
out
as
a
facile
mix
and
I
be
begin
again
now
with
each
one
of
they
.




very
many
of
this
kind
as
I
have
be
say
have
not
passion
poignantly
in
they
,
very
many
of
this
kind
of
they
have
passion
very
poignantly
in
they
,
all
of
this
kind
of
they
be
very
sensitive
in
be
,
they
be
all
of
the
sensitive
passionate
attack
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
two
of
those
who
be
and
be
crowd
in
I
just
now
be
of
the
kind
of
they
not
have
the
passion
poignantly
in
they
.
three
of
those
that
be
crowd
each
other
in
I
of
this
kind
of
they
be
of
the
poignant
kind
in
passion
of
this
kind
of
they
.
I
will
go
on
a
little
with
these
poignant
kind
of
they
and
then
I
will
go
on
with
Arragon
the
musician
who
have
not
passion
as
poignant
in
he
.




to
begin
then
again
.
to
begin
with
those
have
passion
poignantly
in
they
of
the
sensitive
passionate
attack
kind
in
man
and
woman
,
the
sensitive
passionate
attack
independent
dependent
kind
in
man
and
woman
.




this
one
that
I
be
now
think
about
describe
have
passion
poignantly
in
he
that
be
certain
.
he
have
the
conviction
of
be
always
completely
create
everything
in
his
living
.
he
have
passion
poignantly
in
he
that
be
certain
,
he
be
create
some
part
of
his
living
,
he
certainly
be
not
in
any
way
completely
create
all
the
living
he
have
in
he
.
very
often
he
be
certain
that
he
would
be
create
everything
in
his
living
if
there
be
not
so
many
thing
to
make
he
nervous
to
disturb
he
.
mostly
to
himself
he
certainly
could
be
create
everything
in
his
living
.
he
certainly
do
create
something
of
his
living
,
he
certainly
have
passion
poignantly
in
he
.
as
I
be
say
to
himself
he
be
completely
create
all
his
living
,
not
that
to
himself
he
really
be
create
all
his
living
for
always
and
that
he
be
always
feel
he
have
very
much
to
make
a
nervous
restless
person
of
he
,
but
certainly
he
be
to
himself
a
being
that
could
be
create
everything
in
all
his
living
.
passion
be
poignantly
in
he
that
be
certain
,
he
do
create
something
in
his
living
that
be
certain
,
more
and
more
in
his
living
he
be
have
nervousness
in
he
and
not
create
everything
in
his
living
in
the
way
that
to
himself
it
be
certain
he
could
be
create
everything
in
all
his
living
.
always
more
and
more
then
it
be
right
for
he
to
be
seize
create
everything
he
could
be
seize
create
in
his
living
.
More
and
more
then
he
have
this
in
he
,
always
all
his
living
he
certainly
be
create
something
of
his
living
,
always
lie
be
certain
he
could
be
create
everything
in
all
of
his
living
,
always
he
have
nervousness
in
he
and
this
be
to
he
that
thing
be
interfere
to
keep
he
back
from
create
everything
in
his
living
and
so
more
and
more
he
would
be
seize
create
anything
and
so
more
and
more
to
every
one
he
be
such
a
one
and
more
and
to
himself
,
always
to
himself
he
be
one
who
should
be
create
everything
in
all
his
living
.
this
be
then
a
complete
history
of
he
.
passion
be
certainly
poignantly
in
he
,
he
certainly
be
not
ever
create
everything
in
his
living
,
he
be
to
himself
one
who
certainly
could
be
create
everything
in
all
his
living
,
he
be
then
one
who
always
more
and
more
in
his
living
would
be
seize
create
anything
.
this
then
be
a
complete
history
of
one
,
a
very
complete
history
of
one
and
I
be
understand
this
complete
history
of
this
one
.
every
one
have
their
own
being
in
they
,
every
one
be
of
a
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
only
a
very
little
sometimes
this
be
not
an
important
thing
inside
I
to
I
.
sometimes
it
be
not
an
important
thing
inside
I
,
sometimes
it
be
a
little
a
dreary
thing
,
make
of
everything
that
there
be
not
anything
inspirit
to
be
a
live
one
.
sometimes
it
be
a
little
this
way
in
I
but
mostly
always
it
be
an
important
thing
inside
I
that
every
one
be
their
own
self
inside
they
,
that
every
one
be
of
a
kind
of
man
and
woman
.
always
to
I
,

sombre
thing
in
living

sometime
later
in
the
history
of
David
Hersland

will
be
very

I
have
very
often
a
very
pleasant
feeling
,
I
have
sometimes
a
very
sombre
feeling
.
I
have
just
now
a
good
deal
a
quite
sombre
feeling
.
I
be
begin
now
again
tell
,
feeling
,
be
certain
of
the
kind
of
be
there
be
in
one
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
always
each
one
be
to
I
completely
their
own
self
inside
they
,
I
have
never
a

always
kind
be
connect
with
other

.
sometimes
I
want
to
be
describe
lot
and
lot
of
kind
in
man
and
woman
,
I
want
to

on
and
on
and
describe
one
and
then
another
one
and
then
connection
between
they
and
then
perhaps
I
be
mistaken
and
I
be
hurry
and
crowd
and
then
I
be
not
certain
and
then
I
be
wonder
perhaps
it
be
not
completely
an
important
thing
,
perhaps
not
anything
be
inspirit
in
living
,
but
always
in
I
really
I
be
certain
that
it
be
an
important
thing
in
I
and
I
be
tell
that
each
one
have
always
their
own
being
in
they
that
every
one
be
one
of
a
kind
in
man
and
woman
,
mostly
then
this
in
I
be
important
feeling
,
mostly
this
be
in
I
pleasant
and
exciting
,
sometimes
there
be
in
every
sombre
feeling
,
always
there
be
in
I
that
it
be
interesting
that
each
one
be
themself
inside
they
that
each
one
be
of
a
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
mostly
always
I
be
important
with
this
thing
.




I
be
important
with
this
thing
.
there
be
a
kind
of
they
then
of
the
attack
kind
of
they
that
I
have
be
describe
.
these
have
sensitive
passion
in
they
.
in
some
it
be
a
very
poignant
thing
in
they
,
in
some
it
be
not
such
a
poignant
thing
.
I
have
describe
one
in
whom
it
be
a
poignant
thing
.
in
some
in
whom
it
be
a
poignant
thing
it
be
religion
in
they
,
in
some
it
be
deny
in
they
,
in
some
it
be
aspiration
and
these
be
disappointed
idealist
in
living
but
this
be
not
what
I
be
tell
,
I
be
describe
now
a
musician
,
one
have
a
very
good
concentrate
intelligence
in
he
,
a
spread
out
vibrate
sensitiveness
in
he
,
an
aspiration
to
be
religious
and
exalt
in
all
feeling
,
a
wanting
to
be
always
love
,
a
succeeding
in
be
very
often
very
complicated
in
much
loving
,
a
success
in
living
and
then
a
good
deal
of
fail
and
then
a
very
great
deal
of
fail
and
then
not
altogether
fail
.
as
I
be
say
passionate
be
be
not
poignant
in
he
,
he
have
a
very
great
deal
of
it
in
he
,
he
be
a
good
musician
,
he
be
a
foreign
one
,
he
be
in
Gossols
and
then
he
be
not
altogether
fail
not
altogether
succeed
,
there
he
be
live
,
he
be
to
very
many
know
he
an
adventurer
in
living
,
really
he
be
one
not
have
passion
as
very
poignant
in
he
but
have
in
he
a
good
deal
of
it
in
he
of
this
non
-
poignant
passion
,
a
very
great
deal
of
sensitiveness
and
aspiration
in
do
much
love
and
perhaps
have
religion
,
not
so
very
much
aspiration
for
succeed
or
fail
.
Alfred

beginning
of
the
ending
of
his
young
living
.
this
one
be
then
a
little
important
to
he
,
not
very
important
to

,
not
any

be
very
important
to
he
then
,
he
be
slowly
grow
up
then
and
he
have
his
being
in
he
and
he
have
it
as
be
that
at
that
time
in
his
living
not
any
one
be
very
important
to
he
,
this
friend
and
teacher
be
as
important
as
any
one
be
then
to
Alfred
,
he
be
a
little
important
to
he
,
I
be
remember
very
well
now
the
being
in
Alfred
Hersland
.
Alfred
Hersland
have
it
in
he
that
he
be
then
live
the
living
of
people
near

living
of
Mr.
Arragon
and
do
everything
he
do
that
he
could
do
with
he
.
Alfred
be
as
I
be
say
of
the
resist
engulfing
kind
of
they
have
in
he
very
much
aspire
in
living
,
have
in
he
a
fair
amount
of
passion
in
living
,
have
in
he
a
very
considerable
feeling
for
distinction
and
elegance
and
beauty
and
richness
in
live
have
in
he
very
considerably
at
time
violent
feeling
in
he
of
want
to
be
do
with
every
one
he
be
know
what
they
be
do
that
he
want
to
be
do
with
they
.
he
have
then
very
much
pleasing
feeling
in
do
with
he
what
Arragon
be
do
in
living
,
as
I
be
say
Alfred
Hersland
really
have
musical
feeling
and
musical
understanding
in
he
,
he
never
have
it
at
all
in
he
that
he
want
to
be
a
musician
.
as
I
be
say
Mr.
Arragon
be
a
little
but
be
not
very
important
to
Alfred
Hersland
inside
he
,
not
any
one
could
be
then
really
important
to
Alfred
Hersland
inside
he
then
,
Alfred
have
his
be
inside
he
then
,
Alfred
be
of
a
kind
in
man
and
woman
,
that
be
all
the
history
of
Alfred
Hersland
then
and
he
be
live
the
living
of
those
near
he
and
he
be
do
everything
he
be
do
in
his
living
with
those
he
be
then
know
and
he
be
then
do
everything
they
be
then
do
in
their
living
.
he
be
as
I
say
before
in
a
way
then
of
the
feeling
of
his
natural
rich
american
living
but
really
always
he
be
live
the
living
and
do
everything
that
they
be
do
of
those
near
he
.
he
be
as
I
be
say
of
the
engulf
resist
kind
in
man
and
woman
and
he
have
in
he
a
fair
amount
of
passion
in
living
and
always
then
he
be
live
,
he
be
do
everything
those
near
he
be
do
in
living
.
Mr.
Arragon
be
at
one
time
very
much
with
he
.
he
be
a
little
important
as
important
as
any
one
to
Alfred
Hersland
then
.
not
any
one
be
or
could
be
really
important
to
Alfred
Hersland
then
.
Alfred
be
of
the
engulf
resist
kind
in
man
and
woman
,
not
very
strongly
really
resist
,
not
very
strongly
really
engulf
,
quite
very
strongly
aspiring
,
quite
strongly
feel
distinction
and
elegance
and
beauty
in
living
and
richness
as
I
be
say
,
quite
often
angry
in
resolve
and
very
angry
in
begin
do
what
every
one
near
he
be
do
in
live
.
he
have
his
own
being
then
,
he
be
of
a
kind
in
man
and
woman
.




he
be
very
pleasant
to
himself
in
be
with
Arragon
and
he
like
it
very
well
and
it
be
a
rich
feeling
in
he
that
Mr.
Arragon
be
have
he
with
he
in
do
his
living
.
not
anything
be
completely
important
to
Alfred
Hersland
then
.




I
be
not
content
,
I
have
not
have
it
come
out
without
press
the
description
of
Mr.
Arragon
the
musician
.
it
should
come
out
of
I
without
press
without
any
straining
in
I
to
be
press
,
I
can
be
do
thinking
to
be
help
,
I
should
not
be
do
any
press
and
any
straining
,
I
have
be
do
a
little
it
have
not
come
to
be
a
complete
thing
simply
come
,
it
be
to
be
then
to
rebegin
to
come
out
from
I
.
always
each
thing
must
come
out
completely
from
I
leave
I
inside
I
just
then
gently
empty
,
so
pleasantly
and
weakly
gently
empty
,
that
be
a
happy
way
to
have
it
come
out
of
I
each
one
that
be
make
itself
in
I
,
that
be
the
only
way
it
can
come
to
be
content
for
I
in
I
,
it
can
come
out
fairly
quickly
very
slowly
with
a
burst
or
gently
,
any
way
it
feel
a
need
of
come
out
of
I
,
but
be
out
of
I
I
must
be
very
pleasantly
most
gently
,
often
weakly
empty
,
this
one
then
Mr.
Arragon
be
not
so
happily
then
out
of
I
,
he
be
then
still
there
inside
I
,
I
will
let
he
come
again
when
he
be
more
completely
ready
,
of
the
kind
he
be
in
living
that
have
come
out
very
pleasantly
from
inside
I
,
his
own
be
in
I
have
not
come
out
to
be
out
of
I
so
satisfactorily
.
sometime
then
he
may
be
well
do
,
to
begin
again
then
the
being
and
the
live
Alfred
Hersland
have
in
he
.
some
be
a
very
long
time
puzzle
to
I
,
this
one
the
musician
Mr.
Arragon
be
not
a
puzzle
to
I
,
he
be
quite
completely
in
I
,
and
all
of
it
be
understand
inside
I
,
pretty
well
understand
by
I
inside
I
,
it
be
the
come
out
of
I
that
have
not
be
satisfactory
.
it
have
come
out
of
I
as
little
piece
never
make
a
complete
one
,
I
will
be
a
little
slow
and
then
it
will
come
well
do
,
I
hope
I
be
certain
of
this
thing
.
I
be
not
wait
,
I
be
forget
so
that
this
one
can
come
when
this
one
can
come
as
a
satisfactory
one
without
my
disturbing
this
one
by
any
impatience
about
this
one
.
I
have
be
describe
very
many
man
and
very
many
woman
many
of
the
resist
,
some
of
the
attack
kind
of
they
,
as
I
have
often
be
say
there
be
many
kind
of
mix
a
bottom
attack
break
through
resist
nature
in
the
same
one
,
press
through
resist
nature
in
the
same
one
,
act
separately
with
resist
be
in
the
same
one
and
resist
be
in
the
bottom
do
all
kind
of
twisted
complication
with
attack
be
in
the
same
one
.
there
be
very
many
kind
of
mixing
,
I
have
describe
some
of
they
,
and
then
there
be
some
and
these
be
certainly
very
difficult
one
in
whom
the
character
of
the
being
be
completely
oppositely
act
and
there
be
border
line
case
where
the
one
be
almost
the
other
kind
of
a
one
.
and
sometimes
then
I
think
it
be
all
foolishness
this
I
be
write
and
thinking
and
feeling
and
have
as
important
being
and
then
I
give
in
to
not
think
or
feeling
or
be
an
important
one
and
then
I
see
it
again
and
I
be
simply
certain
and
I
be
naturally
think
,
feel
each
one
as
a
kind
of
a
one
in
the
way
I
have
be
tell
and
I
be
then
again
a
completely
important
one
.
Alfred
Hersland
in
his
living
know
a
number
of
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
I
be
begin
now
very
regularly
again
the
history
of
the
living
and
the
being
in
he
.
Alfred
Hersland
as
I
have
certainly
be
realise
be
of
the
resist
more
or
less
engulf
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
as
I
be
say
those
have
in
they
resist
being
be
those
have
in
they
realisation
of
thing
as
exist
as
more
in
they
than
as
thing
have
relation
.
those
have
in
they
resist
be
have
not
emotion
in
they
have
really
poignancy
in
they
like
sensation
.
this
be
then
a
thing
to
be
now
completely
believe
.
those
have
in
they
resist
as
their
complete
way
of
be
in
live
be
those
have
in
they
as
I
be
say
earthy
be
in
the
way
of
really
be
certain
that
everything
that
each
thing
be
really
an
exist
thing
,
these
have
it
in
they
that
completely
in
they
exist
be
the
thing
they
know
inside
they
that
everything
each
thing
really
be
really
exist
.
as
I
have
,
say
often
there
be
many
variation
in
this
thing
and
there
be
those
have
this
being
who
come
from
the
way
of
have
this
be
in
they
to
be
certain
that
not
anything
be
really
exist
and
all
that
be
complication
and
I
have
be
tell
I
will
never
be
end
my
telling
of
all
these
kind
of
way
of
be
but
again
and
again
I
be
certain
that
the
resist
kind
in
man
and
woman
have
it
in
they
to
be
certain
as
a
bottom
being
that
really
each
thing
be
exist
.
now
some
as
I
be
say
of
the
resist
kind
of
they
be
of
an
engulf
kind
and
these
too
be
certain
that
each
thing
they
be
engulf
be
really
a
thing
really
exist
.
these
then
too
have
it
that
sensation
be
in
they
more
poignant
than
emotion
,
that
a
thing
exist
be
near
knowledge
in
they
than
thing
be
in
relation
.
the
attack
kind
in
man
and
woman
be
just
the
other
way
as
I
have
say
and
I
will
be
say
.
the
resist
kind
in
man
and
woman
be
such
then
,
they
have
complete
realisation
naturally
in
they
that
thing
that
each
thing
be
really
exist
.
now
see
what
be
true
in
they
.
they
have
this
in
they
,
they
have
curiosity
and
imagination
base
in
they
on
the
real
realisation
in
they
that
each
thing
be
exist
.
yes
.
in
a
kind
of
they
of
which
Alfred
Hersland
be
one
this
be
not
solid
in
they
although
the
be
in
they
be
this
kind
of
be
in
they
.
this
realisation
of
thing
be
exist
be
in
such
of
they
but
these
be
comparatively
intermittently
resist
and
engulf
their
curiosity
and
imagination
be
sometimes
quite
often
disconnect
with
the
realisation
that
thing
that
each
thing
be
really
exist
.
these
can
have
it
in
they
to
be
aspire
without
be
then
found
in
they
on
a
realisation
that
each
thing
be
exist
,
these
then
can
have
engulf
passion
in
they
that
do
not
really
seize
the
thing
they
could
be
realise
as
really
exist
.
these
then
come
to
be
quite
considerably
in
their
living
that
they
be
a
part
of
a
being
.
curiosity
can
in
such
of
they
turn
into
cleverness
in
live
for
it
be
not
then
base
in
they
on
the
realisation
that
each
thing
be
really
exist
.




this
be
be
in
Alfred
Hersland
.
he
like
be
with
Arragon
,
he
have
really
musical
realisation
in
he
then
and
always
he
could
have
it
in
he
.
he
like
be
with
Arragon
,
like
realise
music
with
he
,
he
have
also
very
much
then
in
he
a
pleased
feeling
of
be
do
everything
in
live
with
Arragon
that
Arragon
be
do
then
in
his
living
.
mostly
Alfred
Hersland
do
what
he
do
in
his
living
,
do
with
they
what
other
do
in
their
living
as
be
something
he
be
then
do
but
there
be
in
he
with
Arragon
a
little
more
important
and
pleasant
feeling
of
himself
to
himself
inside
he
by
do
with
he
with
Arragon
what
Arragon
be
do
then
in
living
.
Alfred
be
begin
then
a
little
too
to
pass
this
on
to
his
brother
and
his
sister
,
this
be
the
beginning
of
be
a
little
aspire
and
also
a
little
be
a
head
of
family
live
in
his
being
.
he
have
really
then
some
realisation
of
musical
meaning
,
he
do
then
everything
he
be
then
do
with
Arragon
and
he
be
do
then
pretty
nearly
everything
Arragon
be
then
do
in
living
.
this
then
be
the
beginning
the
little
beginning
of
middle
living
in
Alfred
Hersland
.
as
I
be
say
Arragon
be
not
then
very
important
in
Alfred
Hersland
,
he
himself
inside
he
not
really
yet
in
be
be
really
the
only
important
thing
inside
he
in
Alfred
Hersland
could
be
the
only
important
thing
really
inside
he
.
in
a
way
Alfred
be
not
one
really
to
be
deeply
influence
by
anything
and
that
be
a
natural
thing
in
he
.
in
his
middle
middle
living
he
be
really
more
effected
by
some
,
all
his
early
middle
living
,
all
his
young
living
he
certainly
have
none
to
be
really
important
to
he
in
he
or
for
he
,
he
be
different
inside
he
at
different
time
in
this
living
,
sometimes
more
sometimes
less
to
himself
inside
he
in
he
,
but
always
then
he
have
his
being
in
he
and
always
then
in
a
way
the
whole
of
he
be
part
of
be
,
and
always
then
he
be
do
everything
he
be
do
with
those
live
near
he
and
mostly
he
be
do
everything
they
be
do
in
living
,
and
sometimes
he
be
quite
sometimes
not
so
much
important
to
himself
inside
he
,
and
always
in
a
way
he
be
never
in
be
in
live
cut
off
really
from
rich
american
living
.
he
know
at
this
time
as
I
be
say
Olga
who
be
Ida
the
sister
of
the
first
governess
the
Herslands
have
had
live
with
they
,
Ida
be
then
a
school
-
teacher
,
Alfred
laugh
at
she
,
he
like
she
,
Arragon
like
she
,
there
be
not
much
history
of
this
like
for
she
.
sometimes
Alfred
see
a
good
deal
of
she
,
once
he
write
she
a
real
love
letter
.
she
be
in
a
way
angry
then
and
tell
he
he
be
not
a
good
man
and
should
not
come
to
see
she
.
Arragon
think
there
would
be
some
history
of
a
feeling
in
himself
for
she
,
he
find
out
for
himself
and
from
what
Alfred
tell
he
about
himself
and
she
that
there
be
not
be
really
a
history
in
either
one
of
they
know
she
.
she
be
in
a
way
a
queer
one
to
mostly
every
one
know
she
that
there
be
not
a
history
in
any
one
be
know
she
.
I
will
try
now
to
describe
she
.




I
be
have
a
glimmering
of
understand
two
,
one
a
man
and
one
a
woman
and
they
be
very
different
from
each
other
and
with
they
be
very
many
and
a
considerable
number
of
they
have
be
silly
one
almost
without
any
meaning
in
be
almost
not
be
themselves
inside
they
to
my
feeling
,
be
such
very
silly
one
as
to
I
almost
not
to
be
exist
,
be
like
funny
thing
in
dream
and
now
they
be
to
I
connect
with
some
who
I
be
really
understand
then
have
flavor
of
something
as
be
a
complete
thing
to
they
.
how
can
there
be
exist
a
flavor
when
there
be
nothing
to
have
the
flavor
,
that
be
foolishness
in
talk
,
there
be
many
who
be
often
all
their
living
thinking
they
be
be
this
thing
.
these
be
a
kind
of
they
,
I
will
tell
about
they
.
now
I
be
think
of
some
who
be
not
to
themselves
exist
in
a
flavor
they
be
not
to
themselves
exist
in
a
way
as
something
they
be
realise
,
they
have
be
to
I
very
often
so
disconcert
,
they
be
silly
one
to
my
feeling
,
they
be
not
silly
one
to
most
every
one
know
they
,
I
be
see
a
little
now
perhaps
that
they
be
exist
.




these
then
I
be
describe
,
I
will
keep
only
those
just
now
in
my
feeling
those
have
in
they
one
kind
of
be
not
a
mixture
in
they
.
I
be
describe
the
being
in
Alfred
Hersland
that
make
of
he
to
I
to
very
many
know
he
a
part
of
a
being
.
he
have
in
he
only
one
kind
of
be
but
as
I
be
tell
piece
of
it
get
separate
off
from
other
piece
of
it
by
not
be
completely
acting
,
flavor
,
reaction
,
by
-
product
get
disconnect
and
keep
on
go
in
he
and
thing
get
all
disarrange
in
he
so
that
this
one
be
a
part
of
a
one
in
living
,
the
bottom
in
he
resist
and
engulfing
be
not
rich
or
thick
or
solid
or
ample
or
active
enough
in
act
to
make
a
complete
being
in
my
feeling
in
he
,
and
always
then
that
be
there
as
be
in
he
.
these
that
to
I
in
their
living
be
silly
one
not
have
any
exist
not
from
do
silly
thing
but
from
there
not
be
any
connection
between
what
they
be
see
and
do
and
feel
and
say
and
always
it
all
go
on
at
once
and
keep
on
be
all
the
being
in
they
;
these
then
be
like
this
to
I
now
,
they
be
in
a
way
of
the
flavor
group
which
group
as
I
be
say
have
it
in
they
to
be
believe
that
flavor
be
exist
without
anything
to
be
make
a
flavor
without
anything
be
a
flavored
thing
.
these
then
that
I
be
now
describe
who
be
vague
and
silly
one
often
to
my
feel
pleasant
one
often
to
my
feeling
,
astonishing
often
to
my
feeling
,
disconcert
often
to
my
feeling
,
these
then
live
but
they
do
not
make
themselves
important
to
themselves
in
it
.
those
one
I
have
be
understand
be
to
themselves
important
in
the
flavor
living
they
be
feel
in
they
and
these
then
I
come
to
understand
by
realise
the
bottom
being
in
each
one
of
they
and
sometime
I
will
be
give
a
very
interesting
description
of
many
kind
of
these
kind
of
they
who
be
to
themselves
live
a
flavor
life
in
living
,
be
to
themselves
only
a
flavor
in
their
being
,
I
have
an
interesting
collection
of
these
kind
of
they
and
the
be
in
they
and
passion
and
affection
in
they
and
the
kind
of
flavor
they
be
to
themselves
in
themselves
and
the
kind
of
flavor
they
be
to
every
one
to
some
one
know
they
but
all
that
very
interesting
collection
I
know
in
my
living
I
will
not
be
just
now
describe
,
very
likely
I
will
not
describe
they
for
some
time
yet
as
I
be
like
to
think
of
describe
they
.
these
then
these
other
I
have
commence
now
describe
be
in
a
way
connect
with
these
these
I
have
commence
now
describe
who
be
so
vague
and
disconnected
and
puzzle
and
be
say
and
feel
and
do
and
see
all
at
once
and
there
be
not
any
connection
any
one
can
be
see
and
it
be
not
in
they
as
it
be
in
some
that
bottom
be
in
they
be
so
slow
in
act
that
other
thing
in
they
be
make
confusion
and
bottom
be
never
arrive
in
they
to
be
do
anything
,
no
these
be
different
from
these
,
everything
in
these
be
go
at
the
same
rate
in
they
only
the
action
be
so
vaguely
in
they
that
thing
in
they
do
not
keep
in
connection
and
these
then
be
not
to
themselves
inside
they
in
the
way
of
make
themselves
to
themselves
inside
they
to
be
themselves
in
they
.
these
then
live
in
a
life
but
they
do
not
make
themselves
important
to
themselves
in
it
.
one
be
at
bottom
a
fairly
dull
not
too
stupid
,
fairly
solemn
,
unthinking
,
believe
,
lethargic
,
not
completely
non
-
poignant
resist
person
,
and
this
one
be
actively
live
do
all
little
thing
stubbornly
because
it
be
pleasant
tasting
and
lively
do
pleasant
live
in
a
vigorous
interesting
fairly
delicately
sensitive
constant
state
of
appreciation
.
the
other
one
the
woman
be
a
practical
,
anarchistic
,
attack
,
servant
girl
person
not
feel
any
difference
between
be
a
dirty
one
or
a
clean
one
have
ugly
thing
or
nice
one
in
anything
near
this
one
,
have
a
need
for
seize
everything
to
use
in
a
servant
girl
fashion
and
always
this
one
be
live
a
life
of
independently
love
beauty
in
live
have
justness
in
appreciation
and
need
a
delicate
flavor
in
love
and
not
keep
anything
that
do
not
want
to
be
keep
by
this
one
.
these
two
then
to
themselves
be
not
really
important
inside
they
from
either
be
in
they
,
they
be
really
actively
live
what
I
be
call
the
flavor
live
and
passively
live
the
other
living
.
Olga
who
be
Ida
whom
Alfred
Hersland
and
Arragon
know
once
as
I
be
say
be
in
a
way
like
these
only
live
in
she
be
a
very
much
more
exciting
occupation
to
herself
and
to
a
good
many
a
little
know
she
in
her
living
.
she
be
a
stupid
resist
,
stagnant
,
dull
fairly
sensible
one
in
bottom
being
and
this
being
be
so
stagnant
in
she
it
be
very
hard
ever
to
be
really
certain
whether
she
be
of
the
resist
or
attack
kind
of
they
but
really
she
be
of
the
resist
kind
of
they
.
this
be
as
I
be
say
be
stagnant
be
in
she
and
as
vapor
there
be
in
she
a
nervous
almost
crazy
kind
of
ask
every
one
to
be
a
lover
to
she
and
this
be
in
she
and
she
be
a
substantially
pretty
good
-
hearted
honest
round
one
and
so
not
any
one
can
understand
that
there
be
never
any
history
in
any
man
ever
know
she
when
she
be
always
so
constantly
ask
every
one
to
they
to
be
a
lover
and
to
keep
on
make
love
to
she
and
she
be
always
then
go
on
with
they
.
this
be
live
in
she
,
this
be
be
in
she
.
to
herself
she
be
not
live
really
in
either
way
of
her
living
,
she
be
really
live
both
of
they
and
to
herself
inside
she
she
be
never
certain
that
she
be
live
in
either
one
of
they
,
in
the
two
of
they
.
the
one
she
be
actively
live
the
nervous
sexual
asking
to
be
object
of
all
love
,
the
other
one
she
be
passively
live
.
this
then
be
the
being
and
the
living
in
Ida
and
so
then
there
be
not
any
history
in
the
knowing
of
she
in
Mr.
Arragon
,
in
Alfred
Hersland
.
a
good
many
who
be
young
laugh
a
good
deal
about
she
,
many
do
not
believe
that
any
one
could
ever
think
they
could
want
to
have
she
and
really
there
be
never
any
history
in
any
one
be
know
she
really
,
and
she
be
a
little
confusing
to
herself
sometimes
then
and
very
much
a
puzzle
to
very
many
other
then
.
this
be
all
I
know
now
about
she
.




this
then
be
certain
that
not
any
one
really
be
very
important
in
the
living
of
Alfred
Hersland
in
his
young
living
.
as
I
be
say
he
know
a
good
many
then
,
he
be
do
with
they
what
he
be
do
then
in
his
living
,
he
know
a
good
many
then
and
he
be
do
in
his
living
with
they
what
they
be
do
in
their
living
then
.
I
have
describe
some
of
they
.
as
I
be
say
the
family
of
Madeleine
Wyman
be
sometimes
try
to
be
pleasant
with
he
.
the
mother
Mrs.
Wyman
could
flatter
he
but
she
do
not
really
flatter
he
and
that
be
not
an
unpleasant
thing
to
his
feeling
but
he
do
not
for
that
want
to
see
she
again
.
sometimes
he
be
quite
a
little
with
Madeleine
Wyman
's
brother
and
her
young
sister
but
not
enough
to
be
different
really
in
he
from
know
any
other
one
in
his
living
.
the
old
Wyman
daughter
could
be
pleasant
to
he
by
take
an
interest
in
he
but
that
be
only
in
he
as
make
a
little
less
flattering
what
her
mother
have
leave
on
he
.
really
there
be
not
any
use
now
remember
more
about
they
for
he
.
this
be
all
young
living
in
Alfred
Hersland
this
I
have
be
describe
.
there
be
more
young
living
,
of
course
there
be
a
good
deal
more
young
live
in
he
.
there
be
young
live
in
he
,
there
be
his
be
inside
he
,
he
live
the
living
of
those
he
be
then
know
and
soon
then
he
go
to
Bridgepoint
to
begin
his
middle
living
.
he
go
there
and
then
he
come
to
make
a
living
and
to
marry
Julia
Dehning
and
to
know
a
fair
number
of
man
and
woman
.




the
Hissen
relative
be
glad
to
see
he
,
it
be
very
pleasant
for
they
to
see
one
of
their

be
exist
,
really
exist
.
they
be
pleasant
cheerful
quickly
curious
and
always

little
doubt
and
it
be
pleasant
for
they
to
see
Alfred
and
to
feel
he
and
to
ask
he
how
his
mother
be

to
hear
he
and
to
see
that
though
he

to
hear

be
very
pleasant
to
some
who
have
be

,
not
at
all
pleasant
to
some

have
not
be
live
in
Gossols
,
not
at
all
pleasant
to
some
who
have
be
live
all
their
living
in
Gossols
,
it
be
very
pleasant
feeling
in
Alfred
as
I
have
be
say
.




this
be
a
comforting
thing
in
be
a
great
author
inside
one
that
always
even
with
much
lonely
feeling
and
much
sighing
in
one
and
even
with
not
pleasantness
inside
any
one
just
then
when
it
be
a
very
sombre
burden
then
that
one
be
begin
have
come
say
that
pleasant
living
be
a
pleasant
thing
and
to
be
explain
how
some
be
like
pleasant
living
.
not
every
one
be
like
pleasant
living
.
alfre
as
I
be
say
when
he
first
come
to
Bridgepoint
living
be
like
it
very
much
that
he
be
then
in
pleasant
living
and
then
he
be
a
little
being
in
love
and
that
be
then
almost
still
pleasant
live
even
though
the
Hersland
aunt
with
whom
he
be
live
be
try
to
be
interfere
and
be
just
a
little
breaking
into
for
he
the
pleasantness
of
pleasant
living
he
be
have
then
.
the
Hissens
be
a
little
interfere
then
,
be
sometimes
having
hurt
or
angry
feeling
,
but
that
be
for
he
then
not
a
part
of
not
pleasant
living
.
certainly
for
quite
some
time
Bridgepoint
living
be
for
he
pleasant
living
.
he
have
some
loving
in
he
then
,
he
have
some
tender
feeling
in
he
then
,
he
be
like
music
very
well
then
,
he
have
pleasant
live
in
he
then
,
he
have
aspire
in
he
then
but
it
be
not
yet
then
come
to
be
in
he
as
something
that
be
to
be
an
active
thing
in
he
to
make
live
for
he
in
he
.
it
be
quite
sometime
later
then
that
he
meet
.
Julia
Dehning
.




Alfred
of
course
in
his
feeling
love
be
feel
it
differently
in
he
at
Bridgepoint
than
he
have
feel
love
when
he
be
in
Gossols
.
mostly
until
he
meet
Julia
Dehning
he
be
not
very
seriously
feel
love
,
that
be
really
true
though
of
he
,
in
Bridgepoint
before
he
meet
Julia
Dehning
,
the
second
year
that
he
be
live
in
Bridgepoint
and
study
he
be
really
feel
love
in
he
,
he
want
then
to
quit
study
and
earn
a
living
in
a
business
so
that
he
could
then
soon
be
marry
and
this
be
very
troublesome
then
to
his
Hersland
aunt
with
whom
he
be
then
stay
who
be
not
willing
that
he
should
be

then
to
marry
and
then
Alfred
's
mother
come
to
see
he
and
she
be
suppose

little
more
of
begin
middle
living
in
Alfred
Hersland
in
his
first
begin
Bridgepoint
living
.




he
know
a
number
then
in
these
day
of
his
early
bridgepoint
living
but
mostly
not
any
of
they
be
later
in
his
living
,
those
who
be
later
in
his
living
be
some
that
I
will
be
later
describe
.
in
the
beginning
live
he
be
interesting
to
some
as
realise
musical
meaning
,
and
mostly
then
he
be
pleasantly
young
and
quite
tall
and
always
give
romantically
scientifically
restrain
superior
information
and
play
the
violin
not
very
well
but
always
able
then
to
be
direct
the
one
play
with
he
.
there
be
then
woman
and
man
who
like
he
,
not
enough
to
make
it
very
different
in
he
from
those
he
have
be
love
in
his
early
living
,
but
he
be
a
little
old
now
and
soon
he
be
quite
a
good
deal
old
and
he
have
be
really
love
then
and
he
have
be
assist
in
not
love
by
his
aunt
Hilda
Hissen
who
do
this
very
nicely
for
he
to
herself
then
and
to
he
and
he
be
ready
then
soon
to
be
one
who
be
one
to
be
impressive
to
Julia
Dehning
as
I
be
very
long
ago
say
.
this
then
be
the
beginning
of
middle
living
in
Alfred
Hersland
.
David
Hersland
his
brother
come
to
Bridgepoint
then
,
he
find
some
letter
that
Alfred
have
forget
that
the
girl
have
write
to
he
and
David
make
fun
of
Alfred
then
and
soon
then
Alfred
be
love
Julia
Dehning
and
this
be
to
David
as
to
Alfred
too
a
serious
thing
this
living
and
then
this
marrying
by
Alfred
of
Julia
Dehning
.
this
be
then
the
complete
beginning
of
middle
living
in
Alfred
Hersland
.




I
wish
every
one
know
every
one
and
like
have
I
tell
they
about
the
being
that
each
one
have
in
they
about
the
kind
of
one
each
one
be
of
man
and
woman
.
it
would
be
a
very
complete
thing
in
my
feeling
to
be
have
complete
list
of
every
body
ever
live
and
to
be
realise
each
one
and
to
be
make
diagram
of
they
and
list
of
they
and
explain
the
being
in
each
one
and
the
relation
of
that
be
to
other
being
in
other
man
and
other
woman
and
to
go
on
then
explain
and
realise
and
know
the
complete
be
in
each
one
and
all
the
kind
there
be
in
man
and
woman
.
not
many
find
it
interesting
this
way
I
be
realise
every
one
,
not
any
I
be
just
now
hear
,
and
it
be
so
completely
an
important
thing
,
it
be
a
complete
thing
in
understanding
,
I
be
go
on
writing
,
I
be
go
on
now
with
a
description
of
all
whom
Alfred
Hersland
come
to
know
in
his
living
.
mostly
no
one
will
be
want
to
listen
.
I
be
certain
.
I
be
important
inside
I
and
not
any
one
really
be
listen
to
I
.
I
be
wish
every
one
know
every
one
and
want
to
have
I
make
diagram
of
all
the
kind
there
be
of
man
and
woman
and
the
place
in
this
diagram
of
each
one
.
it
would
be
very
content
to
I
and
I
be
now
not
begin
again
but
go
on
with
my
explaining
and
describe
and
realise
and
know
and
be
certain
.




I
see
so
many
who
I
be
very
certain
will
not
be
at
all
interested
in
my
be
certain
that
each
one
be
himself
inside
he
,
that
each
one
be
of
a
kind
in
man
and
woman
,
that
I
can
make
a
diagram
now
include
a
very
considerable
number
of
kind
in
man
and
woman
and
that
sometime
I
will
be
able
to
explain
the
being
in
each
one
and
make
a
scheme
of
relation
in
kind
of
be
with
each
one
have
in
they
the
way
of
eat
,
think
,
feeling
,
working
,
drink
,
love
,
begin
and
end
,
feel
thing
as
be
exist
of
their
kind
of
be
,
with
sensitiveness
and
suddenesse
and
impatient
and
patient
and
dependent
and
independent
being
of
their
kind
of
they
and
succeed
and
fail
of
their
kind
of
they
and
I
will
be
able
to
make
group
of
they
and
it
will
be
such
an
interesting
and
such
an
important
thing
in
my
feeling
,
in
my
being
,
and
I
will
be
make
group
of
they
of
each
kind
of
they
with
some
of
each
kind
of
they
succeed
some
fail
some
in
between
succeed
and
fail
,
some
have
more
of
something
of
their
kind
of
they
in
they
than
other
thing
of
their
kind
of
they
and
each
one
then
I
be
ever
know
come
sometime
then
to
be
such
a
clear
one
to
my
feeling
and
I
could
want
to
have
every
one
know
every
one
so
that
each
one
could
see
the
meaning
of
my
explanation
and
always
I
be
certain
that
so
very
many
I
be
always
know
be
not
want
to
completely
listen
to
I
in
my
explaining
and
many
be
not
understand
that
they
must
be
hear
I
completely
and
they
be
not
do
this
thing
and
here
I
be
and
I
be
certain
,
at
least
I
be
mostly
always
certain
and
yet
always
I
be
of
the
dependent
independent
kind
of
they
and
always
in
I
there
be
quite
a
good
deal
always
of
dependent
despairing
and
always
I
be
know
and
always
I
will
be
know
always
now
I
be
certain
that
mostly
those
I
be
know
do
not
want
,
can
not
be
completely
listen
and
it
be
such
a
complete
being
in
I
and
I
be
important
that
be
certain
and
here
I
be
full
up
now
with
know
that
mostly
those
to
whom
I
be
explain
be
not
completely
hear
.
Alfred
Hersland
be
in
Bridgepoint
do
in
the
beginning
very
pleasant
living
.
he
be
not
remember
then
very
much
of
his
Gossols
live
,
and
then
he
be
not
remember
very
much
his
pleasant
tender
feeling
in
the
pleasant
living
he
have
in
he
with
the
Hissen
man
and
woman
and
young
man
and
woman
and
the
young
man
and
woman
that
know
the
young
Hissen
man
and
woman
.
he
always
have
a
little
remembering
in
he
of
want
to
be
marry
the
one
he
do
not
marry
then
and
always
he
remember
his
aunt
the
aunt
who
have
marry
a
Hissen
man
,
who
have
slowly
show
he
that
this
one
whom
he
want
then
to
be
marry
be
not
one
to
have
he
.
he
remember
this
very
well
,
he
do
not
remember
much
about
the
Hersland
aunt
who
interfere
with
he
.
Alfred
Hersland
be
a
little
not
very
good
at
remembering
but
he
remember
more
or
less
about
want
to
have
marry
one
then
although
he
never
later
want
that
,
he
have
marry
this
one
.
he
do
want
for
quite
some
time
very
completely
certainly
to
marry
this
one
and
this
one
certainly
then
want
to
be
married
to
he
but
he
do
not
marry
this
one
.




when
Alfred
Hersland
come
first
to
know
Julia
Dehning
he
be
not
remember
any
long
very
much
in
he
any
of
the
early
Bridgepoint
living
that
he
have
have
in
he
.
he
be
remember
as
I
be
say
sometimes
then
that
he
have
really
want
to
marry
one
and
he
remember
then
that
he
have
be
live
in
Gossols
when
he
have
be
a
very
young
one
.
this
be
mostly
all
his
remembering
then
.
he
be
then
not
really
know
any
he
have
be
know
when
he
be
begin
Bridgepoint
living
.
his
Hersland
aunt
be
then
connect
with
he
.
she
know
Mrs.
Dehning
.
the
Hissens
be
not
then
connect
in
he
with
he
,
not
that
he
have
ever
have
any
quarrel
with
they
but
always
in
live
in
mostly
every
one
there
be
a
keeping
go
that
keep
make
different
one
come
to
be
connect
in
they
with
they
and
now
then
as
I
be
say
Alfred
Hersland
be
come
to
know
Julia
Dehning
.
as
I
be
say
there
be
not
then
in
he
really
any
family
Gossols
live
,
really
not
any
Hissen
Bridgepoint
live
.
the
loving
that
I
say
he
have
in
he
when
he
want
to
be
marry
and
earn
a
living
in
some
business
so
he
could
be
marry
without
wait
that
last
about
two
year
before
it
be
completely
end
in
he
and
then
there
be
about
a
year
and
a
half
in
he
and
then
he
come
to
know
Julia
Dehning
.




there
be
then
resist
and
attack
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
Alfred
Hersland
be
of
the
resist
kind
of
they
,
Julia
Dehning
of
the
attack
kind
of
they
.
the
resist
kind
as
I
have
be
say
and
having
not
be
yet
complete
in
tell
,
the
resist
kind
of
they
be
naturally
and
ultimately
completely
certain
that
thing
have
really
ordinarily
materially
exist
being
,
they
be
exist
,
they
be
in
relation
,
they
have
quality
as
beauty
and
smell
and
use
and
perhaps
purpose
and
perhaps
many
other
kind
of
meaning
but
always
then
for
the
resist
kind
of
they
they
be
really
exist
,
have
exist
like
any
dirt
in
any
field
or
in
any
road
or
any
place
or
any
garden
.
these
then
be
of
the
resist
kind
of
they
and
these
then
have
the
way
of
think
and
feel
eat
,
drink
and
loving
and
curiosity
and
obstinacy
and
beginning
and
end
and
be
dead
and
be
live
and
work
and
rest
and
hope
and
not
hope
for
anything
in
a
way
characteristic
of
this
resist
kind
of
they
.
now
this
be
certainly
true
of
they
and
at
the
same
time
what
with
engulf
be
in
they
and
misplace
part
in
they
and
attenuation
in
they
and
delicacy
in
they
in
be
so
that
they
be
reverse
and
dependent
timid
be
in
they
and
aspire
be
in
they
,
the
being
in
they
get
so
complicated
in
they
sometimes
too
when
they
have
dramatic
being
in
they
and
aggressive
selfdefensive
be
in
they
,
all
this
can
so
confuse
kind
of
be
in
they
that
even
when
they
have
not
any
attack
be
in
they
as
a
good
many
have
it
in
they
it
be
very
perplexing
even
to
I
when
I
have
be
look
such
a
very
long
time
at
one
of
they
.
for
instance
there
be
a
kind
of
they
that
be
really
completely
certain
that
to
be
dead
be
not
to
be
really
a
dead
one
,
that
nothing
be
really
exist
,
these
be
certain
that
nothing
be
exist
except
everything
,
they
be
completely
certain
that
everything
be
exist
,
they
be
of
the
resist
kind
of
they
they
must
be
certain
that
thing
be
exist
,
and
they
make
everything
exist
and
so
lose
out
of
exist
anything
.
they
lose
themselves
and
everything
in
be
certain
that
everything
be
really
exist
completely
simply
exist
,
that
be
resist
be
haying
mysticism
,
this
be
quite
common
.
this
be
a
very
complete
religious
kind
of
being
and
these
be
of
the
resist
kind
of
they
.
I
be
just
mention
this
thing
to
show
that
resist
being
can
be
very
confusing
to
be
understand
.




those
have
in
they
attack
be
the
attack
kind
of
they
can
have
mysticism
in
they
that
be
very
certain
.
sometime
I
will
tell
all
I
ever
can
know
about
these
thing
.
those
have
attack
be
as
mysticism
lose
themselves
in
attack
complete
emotion
,
anybody
can
see
how
different
this
be
from
the
way
resist
kind
of
they
have
mysticism
in
they
.
the
attack
kind
in
man
and
woman
feel
and
need
and
see
and
use
relation
between
thing
as
come
to
they
as
ultimately
realisation
more
completely
even
than
thing
be
exist
.
these
then
can
have
as
I
be
fond
of
say
but
be
now
a
little
tired
of
repeat
emotion
have
poignancy
like
a
sensation
.
this
be
the
characteristic
then
of
attack
being
,
that
be
in
relation
be
more
completely
to
they
of
thing
than
thing
be
exist
.
this
make
they
attack
as
anybody
can
see
by
understanding
.
this
be
attack
be
then
.
Julia
Dehning
be
of
the
attack
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
this
be
now
to
be
a
history
of
Julia
Dehning
and
those
Julia
know
in
living
and
of
she
marry
Alfred
Hersland
and
of
every
thing
.










7
.


some
have
very
pleasant
living
when
they
be
very
young
man
and
woman
,
some
have
anything
but
pleasant
live
in
they
then
.
very
many
have
quite
pleasant
live
in
they
then
and
when
they
be
write
it
then
in
diary
and
letter
to
themselves
and
other
there
be
not
very
much
pleasant
live
in
they
then
.
it
be
a
pretty
difficult
thing
to
be
remember
,
in
a
way
ever
to
be
certain
about
whether
one
be
have
,
have
be
have
pleasant
living
.
it
be
quite
a
difficult
thing
to
know
it
in
they
to
know
it
of
they
quite
young
man
and
quite
young
woman
whether
they
be
whether
they
be
have
pleasant
live
a
very
considerable
number
of
very
young
man
and
woman
be
not
have
very
pleasant
live
in
they
.
it
be
very
difficult
to
know
it
inside
in
one
in
remembering
or
in
live
whether
one
be
have
then
pleasant
living
.
pleasant
living
be
a
very
difficult
thing
about
which
to
be
certain
.
a
great
many
be
think
that
mostly
every
one
be
have
pleasant
enough
living
,
a
great
many
be
think
that
not
any
one
be
really
have
pleasant
living
,
a
great
many
be
think
that
some
be
have
pleasant
living
.
a
good
many
be
think
every
one
should
have
pleasant
live
in
they
.
a
certain
number
be
think
every
one
could
have
pleasant
live
in
they
,
I
find
it
quite
puzzle
to
be
certain
about
any
one
whether
they
be
have
pleasant
live
in
they
.
as
I
be
say
Alfred
Hersland
in
his
early
Bridgepoint
living
have
quite
completely
pleasant
living
.
I
be
almost
certain
.
later
then
living
be
exciting
and
interesting
and
gay
and
varied
and
absorb
and
perplexing
and
sometimes
disconcert
and
sometimes
uneasy
in
he
but
it
be
never
again
I
be
think
quite
so
pleasant
in
he
.
perhaps
it
be
pleasant
in
he
in
his
later
living
,
it
be
very
hard
to
be
certain
about
any
one
about
pleasant
live
in
they
,
a
very
difficult
thing
indeed
to
be
certain
about
this
in
any
one
at
any
time
in
the
living
any
one
have
in
they
.
certainly
his
early
Bridgepoint
living
be
pleasant
in
he
.
this
be
quite
reasonably
certain
.
later
he
be
not
remember
this
early
pleasant
Bridgepoint
living
.
it
be
not
important
in
he
.
really
nothing
be
important
in
he
until
his
first
loving
.
he
have
always
have
his
own
being
in
he
,
that
in
a
way
be
important
inside
he
,
not
anything
be
really
important
to
he
until
he
want
to
stop
study
to
be
marry
.
it
be
his
wanting
to
stop
study
to
be
marry
and
his
then
slowly
not
want
that
this
one
should
have
he
that
be
important
to
he
.
he
soon
be
forget
his
love
this
one
,
he
never
be
really
forget
having
be
want
stop
study
and
begin
work
at
anything
so
that
he
could
be
marry
then
.
he
never
really
forget
stop
want
to
be
married
to
this
one
.
not
that
that
be
really
very
exciting
but
it
be
important
to
he
,
more
important
than
anything
that
he
ever
have
have
in
his
living
.
later
then
he
be
old
and
be
begin
to
know
Julia
Dehning
.




he
always
have
his
own
being
in
he
,
he
be
always
himself
inside
he
.
this
always
be
in
he
.
sometimes
he
be
himself
to
himself
inside
he
,
sometimes
he
be
not
so
much
himself
to
himself
inside
he
.
mostly
everything
any
one
say
about
any
one
,
that
one
say
about
that
one
in
a
way
be
a
true
thing
.




he
always
be
himself
inside
he
.
he
be
not
ever
really
know
what
could
and
what
could
not
come
out
of
he
.
very
many
be
not
ever
really
know
what
will
and
what
will
not
come
out
of
they
.
each
one
be
himself
inside
he
,
be
herself
inside
she
that
be
certain
.
very
many
be
not
know
what
be
in
they
to
really
come
out
of
they
.
very
many
be
not
ever
come
to
know
of
they
what
be
in
they
to
come
out
of
they
,
many
who
in
a
way
do
know
something
of
the
being
that
be
they
.
this
be
a
peculiar
thing
.
watching
carefully
repeat
in
each
one
,
one
can
come
then
to
know
of
each
one
what
be
in
they
each
one
to
come
out
of
they
,
many
man
can
be
certain
of
themselves
that
something
else
will
not
then
come
out
of
they
,
some
one
else
can
be
certain
about
they
that
not
any
really
different
thing
,
different
way
of
do
anything
will
come
out
of
they
,
these
can
not
ever
come
to
be
really
realise
of
themselves
inside
they
that
something
more
completely
so
that
it
be
different
will
not
be
come
out
of
they
.
this
be
very
common
.




he
be
himself
inside
he
,
of
course
he
be
,
all
his
living
.
always
he
be
not
realise
that
not
any
really
different
thing
could
come
out
from
he
.
you
see
one
have
to
be
very
careful
about
be
certain
what
be
be
in
any
one
.
a
great
many
be
certain
about
what
be
be
in
some
one
and
although
they
may
not
be
altogether
wrong
about
that
one
they
mostly
always
be
not
realise
all
the
being
come
out
of
each
one
.
you
have
certainly
to
be
very
fond
of
wait
,
very
fond
of
realise
each
repeat
,
very
fond
of
understand
each
one
be
always
really
repeat
,
very
fond
of
wait
to
be
hear
,
see
,
feel
a
great
deal
of
repeat
out
of
each
one
to
be
at
all
ready
to
be
realise
the
complete
be
in
each
one
,
to
be
realise
what
will
not
be
come
out
of
some
one
.
mostly
each
one
be
repeat
but
mostly
each
one
be
not
realise
their
own
thing
as
repeat
in
they
.
it
be
a
queer
thing
to
I
who
be
really
entirely
love
repeat
that
mostly
not
any
one
be
see
feeling
hear
themselves
as
do
repeat
.
perhaps
it
would
not
be
pleasant
to
most
of
they
,
indeed
very
many
of
they
be
quite
certain
they
do
not
at
all
love
repeat
.
so
then
a
very
great
many
never
can
come
to
be
realise
what
can
and
what
really
can
not
come
out
of
they
.
as
I
be
say
one
must
be
very
fond
indeed
of
wait
,
of
hearing
,
see
,
feel
repeat
to
be
really
certain
about
any
one
what
can
and
what
can
really
not
come
out
of
they
.
sometimes
one
can
be
fairly
quickly
certain
about
some
one
and
sometimes
it
take
quite
a
considerable
time
to
be
really
certain
but
always
it
be
quite
well
to
be
wait
a
considerable
time
to
be
really
certain
from
realise
the
repeat
come
out
of
some
one
,
what
can
and
what
can
not
come
out
of
that
one
.
as
I
be
say
very
many
a
very
great
many
be
always
begin
have
a
completely
new
thing
come
out
of
they
to
themselves
inside
they
or
wait
to
have
something
come
so
completely
out
of
they
that
it
be
really
in
that
quality
of
be
a
complete
thing
to
be
a
new
thing
to
be
come
out
of
they
,
and
this
be
very
common
.
it
be
really
extraordinary
that
all
the
repeat
come
out
of
they
all
their
living
be
not
discourage
but
then
mostly
not
any
one
be
really
love
be
repeat
and
so
each
one
can
never
be
really
certain
about
what
can
and
what
really
can
not
come
out
of
they
.
each
one
have
their
own
being
in
they
,
each
one
be
of
a
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
Alfred
Hersland
as
I
be
say
have
his
own
being
in
he
,
he
be
not
to
himself
all
his
living
repeating
,
that
be
not
quite
true
of
he
,
he
be
to
himself
a
good
deal
repeat
all
his
living
,
mostly
every
one
be
to
themselves
a
good
deal
repeat
all
their
living
but
not
really
completely
repeat
,
not
repeat
so
that
they
can
sometime
quite
soon
even
be
considerably
certain
what
can
and
what
can
not
really
come
out
of
they
.
some
be
quite
certain
,
quite
a
number
be
quite
certain
,
a
very
great
number
be
never
really
inside
they
certain
.
and
mostly
not
any
of
they
be
to
themselves
all
their
living
always
repeat
,
some
be
of
course
to
themselves
all
their
living
repeating
,
but
mostly
not
very
many
be
to
themselves
love
repeat
of
themselves
all
their
living
.
so
then
very
many
be
live
,
very

all
the
being
in
each
one
over
and
over
again

such
a
lovely
thing
for
I
to
be

mostly
every
one
be
tell
that
they
do
not
love

,
they
do
not
think
it
at
all

lovely
thing
,

their
whole
be
always
all
the
time
in
living
,
something
will
soon
be
come
out
of
they
to
show
every
one
what
more
be
there
be
in
they
.
and
here
I
be
almost
all
alone
in
really
completely
love
repeat
,
love
it
that
each
one
all
his
living
be
repeat
all
his
being
.
I
be
now
completely
realise
all
the
be
Alfred
have
in
he
,
I
will
now
tell
how
in
repeat
it
all
come
out
of
he
.
and
always
too
now
I
will
be
begin
describe
Julia
Dehning
.




every
one
be
always
know
the
reason
why
they
themselves
be
fail
in
succeed
.
each
one
be
know
certainly
each
time
why
he
be
not
succeed
in
living
.
each
one
be
always
know
why
she
be
succeed
in
fail
.
mostly
not
any
one
have
much
of
such
a
feeling
about
other
one
why
they
be
fail
to
be
succeed
.
always
each
one
be
repeat
in
tell
each
time
the
reason
for
not
then
succeed
.
mostly
as
one
gets
use
to
hear
it
from
any
one
they
get
a
little
tired
of
that
one
.
each
one
then
have
their
own
steady
complete
reason
for
each
time
of
not
succeed
.
very
many
as
I
be
say
be
not
learn
about
themselves
in
live
.
they
be
not
learn
about
themselves
from
themselves
in
their
living
.
the
reason
for
not
succeed
come
out
each
time
freshly
from
they
;
to
very
many
then
that
one
be
always
go
on
repeat
;
that
one
then
be
always
make
a
bright
find
a
discovering
of
the
reason
that
one
be
not
that
time
succeed
,
that
one
be
always
fresh
in
discover
what
be
to
every
other
one
then
an
inevitable
repeat
not
have
really
any
meaning
.
it
be
a
thing
a
great
many
be
not
do
,
learn
about
themselves
from
themselves
in
their
living
.
it
be
very
satisfying
to
very
many
who
be
live
who
be
live
who
will
be
live
that
there
be
reason
always
then
explain
each
fail
in
succeed
.
as
I
be
say
Mr.
Hersland
's
child
tell
it
to
he
later
when
they
be
a
little
tired
of
the
impatient
be
always
in
he
and
when
they
be
then
not
any
long
at
all
afraid
of
his
do
anything
to
scare
they
.
he
do
not
then
really
hear
they
,
he
be
always
fresh
then
as
he
always
have
be
in
discover
a
reason
for
each
failing
of
succeed
.
mostly
of
every
one
each
one
find
it
of
they
that
they
be
repeat
discover
a
reason
for
each
fail
.
to
themselves
each
one
it
be
a
specific
thing
each
reason
each
time
of
fail
to
be
succeed
,
to
mostly
every
other
one
sometime
the
reason
each
one
be
give
for
each
time
of
fail
be
repeat
a
completely
feeble
one
.
as
I
be
say
there
be
quite
a
number
always
live
,
quite
a
majority
in
man
and
woman
who
be
not
learn
themselves
in
fail
,
from
themselves
in
their
living
.
I
be
now
realise
Alfred
Hersland
to
himself
inside
he
.
Alfred
Hersland
in
a
way
be
not
fail
in
his
living
in
a
way
be
not
succeed
in
his
living
.
Alfred
Hersland
be
not
really
learn
anything
from
his
being
in
his
living
but
then
really
that
be
not
an
important
matter
in
he
,
Alfred
Hersland
be
not
really
a
learn
kind
in
living
.
he
learn
something
that
be
certain
,
mostly
he
be
aspire
in
living
,
mostly
he
be
not
succeed
,
mostly
he
be
not
fail
in
living
.
repeat
and
repeat
and
repeat
and
beginning
and
end
and
be
a
young
one
and
then
an
old
one
and
then
an
old
one
and
then
not
any
long
one
one
;
I
be
sometimes
inside
and
sometimes
include
this
realising
.
the
relation
of
content
and
reflection
,
the
relation
of
be
and
live
,
the
relation
of
learning
and
stupid
being
,
this
be
in
I
in
my
feeling
,
certainly
in
I
now
and
I
will
be
now
do
expect
.




Alfred

be
not
successful
together
in
their
married

now
a
complete
history
of

.




love
be
a
thing
a
great
many
be
do
.
Marrying
be
a
thing
a
great
many
be
do
.
there
be
very
many
degree
of
have
love
in
man
and
woman
.
love
be
a
thing
each
one
be
sometime
do
in
a
way
natural
to
they
to
be
do
.
just
at
first
I
be
think
about
six
or
seven
who
be
do
love
.
Alfred
Hersland
and
Julia
Dehning
be
do
love
and
be
marry
.
I
could
give
description
of
list
of
man
and
woman
who
be
sometime
do
loving
.
I
have
just
be
explain
to
one
how
one
I
be
know
just
now
be
do
love
.
I
be
feel
very
much
just
now
how
two
I
be
know
be
feel
in
be
love
.
I
be
let
myself
go
into
Alfred
Hersland
and
Julia
Dehning
and
the
love
being
they
have
in
they
when
they
come
to
be
think
of
marry
.
I
will
tell
now
a
little
about
love
.




it
be
a
simple
thing
for
very
many
man
and
woman
for
some
of
their
living
,
for
very
many
man
and
woman
for
a
good
part
of
their
living
,
for
a
good
many
man
and
woman
for
all
their
living
to
be
believe
,
to
be
certain
that
each
one
be
really
a
quite
nice
one
,
every
one
be
a
nice
one
.
this
be
really
very
very
common
.
in
a
way
it
be
a
natural
way
of
feeling
for
after
all
for
very
many
woman
and
for
very
many
man
it
be
not
a
reasonable
thing
that
any
one
they
can
come
to
be
know
could
be
not
a
nice
one
.
it
be
such
a
very
simple
thing
really
to
be
certain
that
each
one
in
a
way
be
a
nice
one
,
perhaps
one
can
be
certain
of
a
way
of
love
that
one
have
that
be
not
a
nice
way
of
have
love
and
yet
really
one
can
not
be
really
believe
it
in
the
way
of
know
that
that
one
be
not
a
nice
one
.
yes
it
be
true
the
way
of
love
in
that
one
be
not
a
nice
one
but
then
that
one
be
a
nice
one
and
any
one
have
that
way
of
love
be
not
a
nice
one
and
very
many
be
then
completely
content
in
they
that
all
this
be
a
true
thing
,
that
that
way
of
love
be
one
make
that
one
not
a
nice
one
,
that
that
one
be
a
nice
one
,
that
that
one
have
the
way
of
love
that
not
any
nice
one
can
have
in
they
and
very
many
find
it
inside
they
completely
satisfying
to
be
completely
certain
of
these
three
thing
be
all
true
of
some
one
they
be
know
.
this
be
quite
simply
common
.
I
have
be
hear
some
one
say
this
again
and
again
and
I
have
be
explain
the
kind
of
love
be
the
one
have
in
she
that
make
that
one
not
a
nice
one
and
it
all
be
completely
satisfying
.
and
it
be
quite
an
easy
natural
way
of
feeling
in
very
many
woman
in
very
many
man
this
way
of
feel
about
man
and
woman
.
some
man
and
some
woman
have
very
much
suspicion
in
they
about
mostly
every
one
and
these
can
have
in
they
do
have
in
they
these
simple
way
of
be
certain
of
niceness
and
not
niceness
and
not
possibly
niceness
and
quite
niceness
all
in
one
.
there
be
some
who
be
really
completely
certain
that
each
one
be
a
nice
one
,
sometimes
such
a
one
be
really
certain
that
some
be
really
not
at
all
nice
one
and
some
then
have
confusion
in
they
for
they
can
never
come
to
be
really
understand
how
any
one
can
come
to
be
really
not
a
nice
one
.
think
every
one
really
quite
a
nice
one
be
really
quite
common
.
this
be
a
very
important
thing
in
a
way
in
have
love
feeling
and
now
I
will
be
describe
a
little
some
love
feeling
some
I
have
be
just
know
have
in
they
.
I
will
be
describe
just
now
some
love
so
as
to
be
realise
the
relation
of
feel
each
one
,
some
one
,
a
nice
one
to
feel
love
for
each
one
,
for
some
one
.
this
will
bring
I
on
then
to
describe
Alfred
Hersland
Julia
dehne
love
and
marry
.




there
be
one
that
be
certainly
a
nice
one
.
this
one
be
certainly
a
very
nice
one
.
I
be
know
this
one
.
I
have
be
explain
this
one
to
some
one
who
be
and
be
and
will
be
certain
that
this
one
be
a
nice
one
and
be
certain
that
this
one
have
a
way
of
loving
that
be
not
a
way
a
nice
one
could
have
love
in
they
.
this
one
then
be
really
seriously
a
nice
one
.
this
one
be
certainly
a
nice
one
.
this
one
have
a
way
of
love
that
not

nice
one
could
have
in
they
.
this
one
be
certainly
a
very
completely
nice
one
.




mostly
those
who
be
complete
one
in
living
have
it
in
they
that
content
be
at
least
as
full
as
think
,
realise
,
questioning
,
love
,
dream
,
talk
,
aspiration
,
beginning
,

full
in

very
many
have
it
that

the
thing
in
one
that
may
come
and
may
not
come
to
be
love
feeling
in
that
one
be
sometimes
concentrated
,
sometimes
very
diffused
in
they
,
sometimes
in
lump
in
they
and
sometimes
in
different
way
in
they
.
sometime
I
will
be
describe
pretty
completely
way
of
loving
,

of
like

,
and
thing
to
eat
different

be
like
be
to
I
quite
concentratedly
exciting
.
now
then
I
be
describe
a
little
and
pretty
feebly
in
a
good
deal
of
confusion
a
little
about
way
of
have
love
feeling
.
as
I
be
say
the
one
I
be
now
describe
have
not
have
love
to
come
out
of
this
one
as
really
feel
want
to
be
love
.
this
one
as
I
be
say
be
a
nice
one
.
I
know
now
a
fair
amount
about
feel
love
,
quite
a
good
deal
now
,
of
that
some
be
now
quite
certain
.
I
will
tell
now
a
little
more
about
one
.
this
one
as
I
be
say
be
quite
well
known
for
be
a
very
nice
one
,
a
very
nice
one
in
dressing
,
in
get
ready
every
day
for
living
,
in
be
an
engaged
one
who
be
not
yet
a
married
one
.
this
one
then
be
quite
know
by
be
a
very
nice
one
,
a
quite
delicately
nice
one
.
this
one
as
I
be
say
be
see
everything
not
nice
one
be
do
when
she
be
walk
or
travel
.
she
be
a
little
vacant
in
a
way
,
this
one
.
she
have
as
I
be
say
be
that
be
make
up
by
add
little
pellet
together
which
be
never
mingle
.
each
little
pellet
have
part
of
see
everything
not
nice
one
be
do
.
be
make
up
of
little
pellet
make
this
one
a
delicately
nice
one
,
an
engaged
one
who
be
not
a
married
one
.
when
this
one
make
joke
about
love
,
about
not
be
a
nice
one
and
this
one
do
this
quite
often
,
it
be
do
with
that
part
of
each
pellet
that
be
always
see
whenever
this
one
be
travel
or
walk
what
not
nice
one
be
do
.
this
one
as
I
be
say
be
really
quite
certainty
a
recognise
delicately
nice
one
.
this
one
be
certainly
convincingly
a
quite
completely
delicately
nice
one
.




love
be
,
I
be
fill
just
now
quite
full
of
love
be
in
myself
and
in
a
number
of
man
and
woman
.
love
be
to
I
just
now
an
interesting
,
a
delightful
a
quite
completely
realise
thing
.
I
have
love
be
in
I
more
than
I
know
I
could
have
in
I
.
it
be
a
surprising
thing
to
find
it
so
completely
in
I
.
I
be
realise
love
be
in
quite
a
number
now
of
man
and
woman
,
completely
realise
for
they
,
completely
realise
in
they
love
be
.
I
be
love
just
now
beautiful
loving
,
I
be
love
nice
loving
,
I
be
love
just
now
every
kind
of
love
.
I
be
realise
just
now
very
much
and
quite
some
kind
of
loving
.
I
be
think
now
that
it
be
a
difficult
thing
to
be
know
without
very
careful
waiting
and
then
a
little
more
waiting
besides
the
waiting
that
be
pretty
nearly
enough
wait
how
much
any
one
be
,
what
kind
there
be
in
any
one
of
love
.
a
very
great
many
have
very
many
prejudice
concern
love
,
more
perhaps
even
than
about
drink
and
eat
.
this
be
very
common
.
not
very
many
be
very
well
pleased
with
other
people
's
way
in
have
love
in
they
.
some
be
very
much
pleased
with
some
way
of
have
love
and
not
with
other
way
of
have
love
.
some
be
want
people
to
be
very
nice
in
have
love
be
in
they
.
some
be
pretty
well
ready
to
let
most
people
do
the
kind
of
love
they
have
naturally
in
they
but
be
not
ready
to
let
all
people
do
the
love
the
way
love
naturally
come
to
be
in
they
.
a
very
considerable
number
of
man
and
woman
have
different
way
of
have
love
in
they
.
I
have
different
way
of
have
love
feeling
in
I
I
be
certain
;
I
be
love
just
now
very
much
all
love
.
I
be
realise
just
now
with
lightness
and
delight
and
conviction
and
acquiescing
and
curious
feeling
all
the
way
anybody
can
be
have
love
feeling
.
I
have
always
all
along
be
tell
a
little
about
way
of
love
in
different
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
I
will
tell
now
a
little
more
about
specific
loving
in
some
specific
man
and
woman
.




some
be
never
really
know
how
much
or
how
little
they
can
be
love
.
some
be
never
really
know
how
much
they
be
love
.
they
be
look
at
some
one
they
be
love
and
they
be
think
they
be
not
really
completely
love
they
could
very
easily
be
forget
the
one
they
be
love
,
and
then
they
be
completely
full
up
then
with
loving
,
and
they
never
at
any
time
can
be
realise
that
really
they
be
love
more
or
may
be
less
than
they
be
think
they
be
love
.
I
can
understand
this
thing
,
I
can
not
really
ever
be
really
realise
that
I
can
really
be
have
really
love
feeling
.
this
be
perhaps
more
common
in
the
resisting
than
in
the
attack
kind
in
man
,
at
least
it
would
be
a
very
natural
thing
if
it
be
a
common
thing
with
those
have
resist
be
as
their
way
of
have
love
feeling
.
there
be
then
kind
in
man
and
woman
and
each
kind
have
a
way
of
love
that
in
a
way
be
common
to
each
one
of
that
kind
of
they
.
as
I
be
say
,
now
as
I
be
say
some
know
very
well
the
complete
feeling
of
be
a
love
one
inside
they
.
it
be
a
very
wonderful
thing
when
one
be
not
certain
with
love
to
be
see
some
one
completely
certain
in
have
completely
quiver
,
complete
love
feeling
,
to
be
all
love
and
certain
that
they
be
really
all
love
.
there
be
then
attack
and
resist
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
there
be
sensitive
attacking
,
and
tremble
attacking
,
and
quiver
attacking
,
and
obstinate
attack
,
and
rush
attack
,
and
pierce
attack
,
and
cowardly
attack
,
and
withdraw
attack
,
and
steady
attack
,
and
enthusiastic
attacking
,
and
mystic
attacking
that
be
attack
to
lose
itself
in
complete
emotion
,
and
narrow
attacking
that
be
destroy
everything
that
be
not
to
be
there
as
an
object
to
be
attack
to
exaltation
,
and
ambitious
attack
,
and
sullen
attacking
,
and
quick
attacking
,
and
plan
attacking
,
and
necessary
attacking
,
and
sudden
and
intermittent
attacking
,
and
confused
attacking
,
and
dutiful
attack
,
and
troubled
attacking
,
and
slow
attacking
,
and
stupid
attack
,
and
wobble
attack
and
then
there
be
engulf
resist
and
simple
resisting
and
vacant
resisting
and
surface
resist
and
yield
resisting
and
stubborn
resisting
and
solemn
resist
and
earnest
resist
and
seductive
resisting
and
fiery
resisting
and
intermittent
resisting
and
attack
resist
,
and
confuse
resist
and
dull
resist
,
and
emphatic
resisting
and
sympathetic
resisting
,
and
fearful
resist
,
and
very
timid
resist
and
trickly
resist
and
suspicious
resist
,
and
embrace
resist
and
in
short
there
be
very
many
kind
of
way
of
have
love
feeling
in
man
and
in
woman
.
as
I
be
say
some
be
not
ever
really
certain
they
be
really
love
and
they
be
look
at
one
they
be
love
and
they
be
think
they
could
easily
be
forget
that
one
any
one
they
be
love
,
that
not
any
one
be
really
love
by
they
,
that
they
be
really
not
have
love
feeling
that
be
real
ever
in
they
and
such
then
be
wonder
,
and
adore
one
really
have
certain
loving
feeling
.
it
be
a
very
wonderful
thing
to
such
a
one
,
one
not
be
certain
that
some
one
can
have
complete
energy
complete
certainty
in
loving
,
that
some
one
can
have
emotion
to
have
poignancy
like
a
sensation
.
such
a
one
,
one
never
really
believe
that
the
feeling
in
they
be
really
love
feeling
can
perhaps
come
to
believe
it
of
themselves
by
experience
that
always
they
be
spontaneously
act
as
if
they
be
completely
loving
,
and
repeat
in
they
of
such
action
sometimes
do
convince
such
a
one
.
they
know
they
be
love
because
they
be
do
what
some
one
who
be
love
would
naturally
be
do
and
this
gradually
bring
conviction
to
they
.
some
turn
it
then
into
a
sentimental
feeling
so
as
not
to
lose
it
out
of
they
,
a
few
keep
it
as
really
need
to
be
constantly
repeat
to
keep
they
in
their
conviction
.
this
then
have
be
a
description
of
some
love
.




as
I
be
say
a
great
many
have
prejudice
about
people
be
love
.
some
say
alright
all
but
one
way
of
loving
,
another
say
alright
all
but
another
way
of
loving
,
some
say
not
very
many
kind
of
loving
be
right
love
,
some
say
all
way
of
love
be
really
way
of
have
love
feeling
.
I
like
love
.
I
like
mostly
all
the
way
any
one
can
have
of
have
love
feeling
in
they
.
slowly
it
have
come
to
be
in
I
that
any
way
of
be
a
love
one
be
interesting
and
not
unpleasant
to
I
.
that
come
very
slowly
to
be
in
I
.
I
like
love
then
as
I
be
say
.
I
will
tell
now
then
a
little
more
about
love
in
woman
and
in
man
.




sometimes
it
be
very
puzzling
that
so
many
be
certain
that
they
be
really
love
some
one
.
sometimes
I
be
wonder
about
how
they
can
be
so
very
certain
.
and
then
they
have
so
many
way
of
think
out
the
loving
in
they
.
and
then
they
have
way
of
begin
love
and
way
of
end
love
very
many
man
and
very
many
woman
and
way
of
marry
and
not
marry
that
certainly
be
puzzle
and
believe
that
they
can
and
can
not
bear
to
be
love
and
not
live
,
they
can
and
can
not
be
learn
love
,
and
way
of
be
brave
and
be
cowardly
with
loving
and
with
those
that
they
be
love
that
be
very
complicate
.
sometimes
some
one
who
be
always
ready
to
be
fight
and
ready
to
kill
and
be
kill
by
any
one
when
he
think
it
right
for
he
to
be
an
angry
one
sometimes
then
such
a
one
be
really
want
to
be
completely
dominate
in
loving
,
be
an
attack
one
get
frightened
and
have
a
feeling
of
loathing
when
one
who
be
not
any
long
love
he
though
he
be
still
love
that
one
threaten
to
really
injure
he
.
how
should
that
one
know
that
the
other
one
be
not
any
long
love
be
so
afraid
when
the
other
one
threaten
to
really
injure
he
.
be
it
that
until
then
he
could
never
,
he
be
an
attack
one
,
could
never
really
realise
that
the
other
one
be
not
love
he
.
why
should
a
courageous
one
be
afraid
when
one
who
have
once
love
he
threaten
to
hurt
he
when
he
would
not
be
afraid
early
or
later
of
that
one
.
be
it
vanity
or
the
bitter
feeling
of
be
really
an
abandon
one
lonely
and
suffer
because
some
one
be
really
positively
not
love
that
one
.
I
think
it
be
in
mostly
every
one
,
in
certainly
a
good
many
woman
and
man
a
kind
of
the
last
one
leave
on
earth
all
alone
feel
when
they
be
realise
even
when
they
be
not
any
long
love
that
one
that
some
one
really
truly
completely
actually
do
not
any
long
love
they
.
but
all
this
be
just
something
that
be
happen
.
now
I
be
tell
a
little
more
about
love
.
Alfred
Hersland
and
Julia
Dehning
come
to
have
some
love
feeling
and
then
they
come
to
marry
.
I
be
begin
again
a
history
of
they
.




I
be
see
one
to
-
day
who
remind
I
very
much
of
another
one
I
have
see
do
very
much
love
and
both
of
these
certainly
be
in
a
way
in
living
that
be
a
natural
way
to
feel
about
the
being
,
the
acting
and
the
living
in
they
.
these
be
in
a
way
quite
different
one
these
two
in
their
complete
living
I
be
certain
but
they
both
be
of
the
resist
kind
in
man
and
woman
be
and
be
and
will
be
so
completely
on
fire
always
every
minute
in
exist
that
they
be
not
really
ever
resist
anything
and
being
of
the
resist
not
of
the
attack
kind
of
man
and
woman
the
fire
of
it
be
burn
any
one
besides
be
just
burn
be
burn
that
one
by
accident
of
conflagration
,
be
burn
themselves
by
accident
of
be
themselves
in
a
fire
that
be
burn
.
I
know
just
now
two
of
such
of
they
,
one
of
such
of
they
I
know
quite
well
in
all
love
,
the
other
one
I
be
just
see
sit
,
stand
,
run
,
look
,
a
little
in
talk
,
breathing
and
I
will
not
be
see
any
more
in
living
,
I
have
not
be
see
any
more
in
living
.
the
loving
in
such
of
they
be
naturally
from
the
being
of
they
what
any
one
understand
now
the
being
in
such
can
be
realise
.
all
the
one
in
between
these
and
engulf
one
,
between
these
and
completely
resisting
one
be
exist
.
I
have
see
quite
a
number
of
they
.
I
be
see
these
day
very
many
kind
of
man
and
woman
.
sometimes
now
I
be
tired
out
and
irritated
and
not
at
all
amiable
about
they
because
they
be
not
some
of
they
like
any
other
one
I
have
be
know
.
sometimes
then
now
I
have
a
very
irritable
feeling
in
look
and
sometimes
some
one
these
day
and
I
be
look
steadily
at
they
be
very
completely
illuminate
a
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
I
be
these
day
see
man
and
woman
.
I
be
these
day
look
and
look
and
look
at
they
and
then
I
be
all
wear
out
and
irritated
by
be
weary
with
seeing
and
not
see
be
in
they
.
I
see
a
very
considerable
number
just
now
of
man
and
woman
.
I
be
weary
and
not
weary
with
my
learning
always
more
and
more
and
then
not
be
really
ever
certain
.
I
be
a
happy
one
,
that
be
quite
reasonably
certain
.
I
be
quite
a
very
happy
person
.
I
be
quite
completely
a
very
happy
person
see
very
many
man
and
woman
.




I
be
listen
just
now
to
many
woman
love
one
,
a
resist
one
who
be
not
burn
.
this
one
certainly
be
not
burn
,
not
burn
himself
or
any
one
by
conflagration
.
this
be
one
of
the
resist
kind
of
they
I
have
be
describe
not
have
any
weakness
in
he
and
all
the
romantic
strength
of
intelligent
and
active
genius
to
very
many
know
he
.
this
give
in
he
some
appearance
of
burn
to
some
.
one
have
as
I
be
say
be
like
wood
cut
and
excellent
and
hard
and
sometimes
make
into
shape
very
fanciful
and
delicate
and
perhaps
symbolic
but
always
be
solid
wood
cut
and
not
sensitive
to
be
a
weak
thing
by
be
a
thing
have
sap
flow
.
this
one
then
as
I
be
say
be
always
be
one
have
many
love
he
,
insist
upon
love
he
,
cling
adoring
,
follow
,
need
he
.
he
be
have
very
many
kind
of
woman
always
love
he
.
he
be
a
very
nice
man
really
in
his
loving
.
he
be
sentimental
a
little
and
solid
and
firm
and
gentle
and
complete
in
love
and
not
any
long
love
.




sometime
I
will
describe
very
many
who
be
love
in
their
living
.
I
have
now
describe
some
,
and
I
be
feel
very
many
love
everywhere
in
living
.
I
be
feel
a
very
great
many
man
and
woman
,
I
be
feel
a
very
great
many
man
and
woman
do
loving
.
More
and
more
I
will
be
satisfied
with
every
kind
there
be
in
man
and
woman
of
be
,
do
love
.
now
I
be
really
begin
again
about
be
in
Alfred
Hersland
and
in
Julia
Dehning
.




Alfred
Hersland
as
almost
any
one
can
tell
now
by
remembering
be
of
the
resist
engulfing
kind
in
man
and
woman
,
not
a
very
complete
one
in
be
,
fairly
aspire
in
be
and
in
living
,
not
really
fail
not
really
succeed
in
the
whole
of
the
living
in
he
,
not
completely
certain
that
to
be
dead
be
to
be
really
a
dead
one
,
not
quite
completely
entirely
utterly
certain
that
to
be
dead
be
not
to
be
really
a
dead
one
.
Julia
Dehning
I
be
just
begin
describe
.
Julia
Dehning
be
of
the
attack
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
Julia
Dehning
be
of
the
kind
of
attack
kind
who
mostly
be
spend
their
living
resist
be
at
bottom
change
in
their
way
of
do
any
attacking
.
they
be
attack
with
some
excitement
everything
to
mostly
every
one
see
they
,
really
they
be
resist
all
their
living
any
change
in
their
feeling
of
attack
.
in
a
way
then
at
bottom
they
be
mostly
all
their
living
not
have
any
stimulation
.
mostly
to
every
one
they
be
excitedly
every
minute
be
stimulate
by
something
.
I
be
go
to
tell
a
good
deal
now
about
attack
be
.
I
be
begin
prepare
myself
now
to
be
courageous
to
do
this
thing
.
I
be
feel
a
little
weak
now
in
courageous
feeling
as
be
quite
common
in
my
living
.
I
be
remember
and
remember
attacking
being
.
I
be
a
little
realise
this
thing
.
I
be
begin
again
now
remember
realise
attack
be
in
man
and
woman
,
in
Julia
Dehning
.




Hopefulness
be
to
I
very
interesting
.
any
one
expect
anything
to
be
come
out
of
they
,
be
fairly
certain
in
be
a
hopeful
one
be
to
I
fairly
interesting
.
there
have
be
in
I
feel
very
nearly
to
be
a
completely
miserable
one
in
have
another
one
fairly
certain
of
have
something
come
from
they
,
of
be
fairly
completely
a
hopeful
one
.
there
be
very
hopeful
one
have
resist
being
or
engulf
resist
be
in
they
,
there
be
hopeful
one
have
attack
be
.
I
will
now
soon
be
describe
hopeful
be
in
man
and
woman
have
attack
be
in
they
.
I
have
be
pretty
miserable
sometimes
see
they
,
hear
they
,
feel
they
.
I
have
be
quite
very
miserable
hearing
,
feel
and
see
some
,
some
be
have
complete
hopefulness
of
enthusiastic
or
excited
or
passionate
attack
being
.
I
have
not
have
a
miserable
feeling
from
see
or
hear
or
feel
attack
hopeful
one
who
be
completely
fight
one
or
push
one
or
win
one
in
living
.
I
have
not
be
miserable
about
they
,
not
at
all
,
I
have
not
be
miserable
for
they
the
excited
or
enthusiastic
or
passionate
one
,
not
at
all
,
I
have
be
a
miserable
one
because
I
have
be
always
a
little
pretty
nearly
certain
that
I
would
be
end
fail
and
every
one
enthusiastic
or
passionate
or
sensitive
or
excited
in
attack
would
then
make
I
a
jealous
one
,
a
miserable
one
have
a
sad
and
sombre
feeling
,
be
certain
that
to
be
dead
be
to
be
really
a
dead
one
and
that
I
pretty
nearly
certainly
would
be
always
be
near
and
more
nearly
a
completely
dead
one
.
I
have
very
much
such
be
in
I
and
I
be
a
sad
resist
depressed
jealous
one
then
and
now
I
be
tell
this
thing
.




attack
being
and
resist
be
have
each
their
way
of
have
hopeful
feeling
.
some
have
very
much
hopeful
feeling
,
some
have
less
,
some
have
none
,
some
have
pretty
nearly
none
,
some
not
any
at
all
really
hopeful
feeling
.
each
one
have
their
own
way
of
have
in
they
certain
feeling
,
hopeful
feeling
.
I
be
love
to
know
every
one
have
or
not
have
hopeful
feeling
in
they
,
certain
feeling
in
they
.
I
be
want
to
know
every
one
who
ever
be
or
be
or
will
be
live
,
all
the
being
in
each
one
of
they
,
all
the
kind
there
be
of
man
and
woman
,
all
the
way
each
one
have
anything
ever
in
they
everything
they
ever
have
in
they
in
they
.




it
be
certainly
a
very
queer
thing
to
be
certain
sometime
about
some
one
that
they
have
be
all
their
living
that
kind
of
one
in
their
being
.
it
be
certainly
a
most
queer
feeling
of
dream
that
one
have
in
one
when
one
be
certain
about
some
one
of
the
being
in
they
and
then
be
remember
the
being
in
that
one
that
be
in
that
one
when
one
be
not
really
know
that
one
very
well
but
still
quite
well
.
it
be
a
very
queer
feeling
of
dream
that
one
have
then
.
it
come
then
sharply
to
one
then
to
be
decide
whether
one
be
really
then
ever
certain
about
anything
,
any
one
.
and
yet
I
certainly
be
certain
that
sometime
I
be
really
completely
know
some
one
and
very
often
I
have
in
I
a
queer
feeling
like
dream
.
it
be
then
a
curious
thing
in
feel
to
be
come
to
learn
to
know
very
completely
any
one
.
I
have
come
to
know
very
completely
now
,
pretty
nearly
completely
now
Julia
Dehning
and
I
be
now
begin
to
tell
all
the
being
in
Julia
Dehning
as
I
have
be
learn
to
be
realise
the
being
in
Julia
Dehning
.
Julia
Dehning
be
of
the
attack
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
I
have
mention
this
thing
.
Julia

be
of
one
kind
of
the
attack
kind
in

little
about

will
slowly
quite
slowly
I
be
hope
be
tell
the
complete
history
of
Julia
Dehning
,
I
will
slowly
certainly
fairly
slowly
be
describe
all
the
being
of
Julia
Dehning
,
I
will
be
always
tell
a
very
good
deal
about
attack
be
in
man
and
woman
.
I
will
be
tell

good
deal
about
hope
and
love
and
like
to
be
a
cold
or
a
hot
one
in
the
attack
kind
in
man
and
woman

I
will
be
always
somehow
manage
to
be

living
,
of
pretty
nearly
every
one
who
come
to
know
they
or
to
know
about
they
.
I
be
remember
always
that
each
one
be
repeat
always
all
their
being
,
I
be
remember
that
very
often
I
be
very
much
not
know
what
they
be
say
to
other
one
,
what
they
be
feel
,
how
they
be
not
feel
and
do
what
I
be
think
and
hear
they
be
say
and
do
,
I
be
remember
that
very
often
they
be
have
be
in
they
and
I
be
supply
in
they
in
my
feeling
what
they
certainly
have
not
be
have
in
they
.
in
short
I
be
remember
and
I
be
a
little
melancholy
with
it
in
I
now
I
be
quite
certain
.
I
would
so
be
content
with
know
everything
.
I
be
give
now
a
history
of
Alfred
Hersland
and
Julia
Dehning
.
it
be
puzzle
that
each
one
have
have
be
in
they
and
have
be
repeat
the
whole
being
of
they
and
I
have
not
be
hear
see
feel
all
the
being
in
they
.
yes
it
be
certainly
true
of
they
of
very
many
man
and
very
many
woman
I
have
not
be
hear
more
than
a
part
of
the
repeat
come
out
of
they
.
they
be
each
one
always
repeat
all
the
being
in
they
.
I
be
certain
.
I
be
hear
always
very
much
repeat
come
out
of
each
one
I
be
ever
know
.
I
be
not
hear
anywhere
nearly
all
the
repeat
come
out
of
they
each
one
I
be
ever
know
.
I
be
always
hear
,
see
,
feel
repeat
come
out
of
each
one
I
be
ever
know
.
I
be
know
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
I
be
not
hear
a
wonderful
amount
of
repeating
always
come
,
I
be
now
quite
certain
.
I
could
be
so
happy
know
everything
.
I
could
be
enjoy
so
much
have
curious
feeling
about
every
one
if
always
more
and
more
I
could
certainly
be
hear
,
feel
see
all
every
bit
of
repeat
come
in
any
way
out
of
every
one
.
I
be
enjoy
have
curious
feeling
about
every
one
,
I
like
every
bit
of
repeat
I
be
hear
,
I
get
an
awful
sinking
feeling
when
I
find
out
by
an
accidental
hearing
,
feel
,
see
repeat
from
some
one
what
I
have
not
be
hear
,
feel
,
see
as
repeat
in
this
one
and
then
I
be
say
if
it
have
not
be
for
this
little
accidental
thing
I
would
not
have
know
this
repeat
in
this
one
and
it
be
so
easy
not
to
have
such
an
accidental
happening
.
alas
,
I
say
then
,
alas
,
I
will
perhaps
not
really
ever
be
know
all
the
repeat
come
out
of
each
one
.
I
know
some
of
the
repeat
come
out
of
Alfred
Hersland
and
Julia
Dehning
and
some
other
whom
they
know
and
some
other
who
know
they
and
I
will
now
be
describe
what
I
be
desolately
feel
be
all
be
in
they
.
I
be
desolate
because
I
be
not
certainly
hear
all
repeat
,
I
be
almost
sulking
.
I
be
begin
now
to
go
on
with
my
history
of
the
Dehning
family
and
of
Julia
Dehning
and
of
she
marrying
and
of
the
Hersland
family
and
of
Alfred
Hersland
and
of
every
one
they
any
of
they
come
to
know
in
their
living
.
to
begin
again
then
from
pretty
nearly
the
beginning
.
I
be
remember
everything
I
have
be
tell
.
I
be
always
love
all
repeat
.
I
be
realise
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
I
be
realise
Alfred
Hersland
and
Julia
Dehning
.
that
be
I
be
certainly
somewhere
near
to
a
fairly
complete
realisation
of
they
and
of
some
whom
they
know
each
one
and
who
come
to
know
they
either
of
they
.
I
be
a
little
tired
now
with
all
this
begin
again
.
I
be
hope
that
I
be
go
on
again
.

always
steadily
to
be
attack
.

very
often
not

.
he
be
a

of
a
large
fortune
out

have
their
own
being
in
they
,
all
together
they
have
a
family
live
in

.




Mr.
Dehning
be
quite
a
good
man
,
a
good
business
man
,
a
good
enough
citizen
,
a
good
husband
to
his
wife
and
a
good
enough
father
to
his
child
.
he
be
quite
a
careful
and
generous
and
kindly
man
and
always
could
be
fairly
make
by
his
wife
to
do
what
she
would
have
he
,
he
be
also
fairly
ready
to
listen
to
his
child
when
they
want
anything
in
their
living
.
he
be
as
I
be
say
quite
a
good
man
,
a
quite
good
man
in
business
living
,
a
quite
good
man
quite
entirely
a
good
man
in
his
family
,
in
his
daily
living
.
he
come
to
be
an
old
man
and
be
then
a
little
shrink
then
from
outside
he
.
his
wife
be
sick
then
,
a
good
deal
in
take
care
of
he
,
keep
he
from
eat
what
be
not
good
for
he
,
keep
he
then
from
smoking
which
be
then
bad
for
he
,
keep
he
then
from
any
excitement
of
business
living
which
be
then
a
thing
the
doctor
have
quite
forbid
to
he
.
later
then
she
be
a
sick
one
and
while
he
be
shrink
some
away
from
the
outside
of
he
,
she
die
from
too
much
come
to
be
inside
she
for
her
living
.
she
leave
he
then
wish
he
have
be
the
one
to
be
the
dead
one
for
the
sake
of
the
child
.
she
know
he
certainly
would
be
need
something
to
fill
he
,
something
to
warm
he
now
he
would
be
shrink
away
a
little
from
the
outside
of
he
.
not
any
man
certainly
not
the
man
she
have
know
all
her
living
could
not
be
manage
to
be
marry
by
a
woman
and
then
there
would
be
trouble
with
money
and
her
child
and
it
would
have
be
well
that
he
have
be
the
first
one
to
be
the
dead
one
and
then
she
would
have
be
hand
the
money
over
very
entirely
to
the
child
.
she
be
the
first
one
to
be
a
dead
one
as
I
be
say
and
he
do
not
as
a
matter
of
fact
marry
any
one
but
it
be
it
be
surely
certain
a
little
struggle
for
his
child
with
a
sister
-
in
-
law
and
some
one
else
to
help
he
to
keep
he
from
marry
.
all
this
will
be
tell
later
in
the
history
of
George
Dehning
and
Hortense
Dehning
and
Julia
Dehning
.




as
I
be
say
the
Dehning

I
be
a
little
not
ready
yet
to

all
be
there
be
or
be
or
will
be
in
Julia
Dehning
.
it
be
a
very
difficult
thing
to
believe
that
any
one
have
see
everything
in
anything
and
that
one
have
just
glance
at
that
thing
and
you
have
have
to
be
look
very
long
at
that
thing
.
some
one
have
just
glance
at
a
book
and
you
have
read
that
book
and
the
other
one
know
everything
in
that
book
,
in

one
be
a
quick
one
and
you
be
a
slow
one
,
it
be
a
very
difficult
thing
to
really
find
it
convince
that
that

really
be
read
that
book
in
such
a
quick
glancing

thing
in
the
book
that
be
certain
,
to
mostly
every
one

a
slow
one
or
a
quick
one
in
detail
of
daily
living
be
an
astonishing
thing
,
a
thing
very
difficult
to
be
realise
a
thing
to
be
believe
because
of
its
be
a
thing
every
little
minute
be
prove
,
a
thing
that
always
be
a
little
not
a
real
thing
like
see
any
slight
of
hand
perform
.
it
be
a
very
difficult
thing
be
really
certain
of
anything

be
do
in
any
kind
of
a
way

more
in

really
never
believe
feeling
thinking
.




Mr.

very
likely
when
he
be
a
young

and
then
when
he
be
begin
middle
living
be
one
who
sometimes
be
tell
what
a

live
the

should
be

.
he
be
a

have
playfulness
in

,
he
need
his

he
by
attack
,
he
need
to

be
always

very
good
deal
such
a
feeling
.
I
certainly
be

I
will
sometime
begin

I

and
just
now
I
be
see
each

.
I
be
of
the
resist
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
I
be
not
very
certain
I
be
like
it
that
I
be
begin
a
realise
a
quite
new
way
to
I
of
feel
live
.
as
I
be
say
it
be
not
a
natural
thing
to
I
to
be
realise
way
of
feeling
live
.
it
be
a
natural
thing
to
I
to
be
realise
in
each

some
being
,
a
good
deal
of
be
,
sometimes
all
the
being
they
have
or
can
have
or
do
have
in
they
.
to
I
way
of
feeling
live
be
different
in
some
have
in
they
almost
quite
completely
the
same
way
of
be
.
as
I
be
say
the
Dehnings
have
in
they
very
rich
right
american
living
.
that
be
then
one
way
of
feeling
live
.
as
I
be
say
I
have
all
my
life
not
naturally
be
learn
realise
way
of
feeling
live
.
I
be
now
be
teach
by
some
one
that
some
have
a
way
of
feeling
live
that
I
have
not
ever
be

although
it
be
to
I
upsetting
learn
anything

very
much
that
to
I
be
upsetting
as
be
not
to
I
a

be
learn
.
if
it
be
to
I
completely
a
not
natural
thing
to
be
learn
I
certainly
be
end
with
not
having
be
learn
that
thing
,
I
will
be
know
sometime
whether
it
be
not
a
completely
not
natural
thing
for
I
to
be
learn
to
be
realise
,
way
of
feeling
live
with
different
kind
of

see
in
each
one
thing
that
be
interesting
in

not
certainly
easily
natural
for
I
to
be
observe
,

this
be
lead
to

then
they
come
to
be
dead
one

be
.
this
be
in

.
this
be
now
to
be
some
history
of
she
.




live
have
meaning
to
any
one
do
living
,
be
live
,
this
be
a
thing
very
many
be
feel
,
be
certain

some
way
live
have
in
they
for
they
really
mean
.
Mrs.
Dehning
be
say
when
trouble
come
to
they
she
could
not
really
understand
it
that
any
one
having
be
so
reasonably
charitable
to
every
one
should
have
it
that
thing
should
happen
to
their
child
but
always
then
she
would
go
on
be
a
good
woman
because
she
be
always
certain
to
do
this
thing
,
so
she
be
say
.
and
later
then
when
her
child
be
not
think
about
she
be
in
she
in
live
she
do
not
then
see
any
reason
why
she
should
go
on
think
about
what
it
be
,
all
that
she
could
do
for
they
and
with
their
father
for
they
but
certainly
she
would
be
go
on
do
everything

she
always
be
a
little
certain
she
would
go

child
be
young
man
,
some
like
their
child
be
young
woman
.
Julia
Dehning
like
her
child
as
little
baby
which
be
surprising
to
very
many
who
know
Julia
dehne
quite
well
in
her
living
,
know
quite
well
her
being
.
she
like
child
all
their
living
,
she
use
all
energy
to
learn
everything
,
she
like
they
completely
as
be
little
baby
and
this
in
a
way
be
surprising
,
not
really
surprising
perhaps
but
all
the
same
somewhat
surprising
.
some
woman
then
be
of
the
attack
kind
in
living
,
some
be
of
the
resist
kind
in
living
.
Julia
Dehning
be
of
the
attack
kind
in
living
.
I
have
say
sometime
that
it
be
the
resist
kind
that
need
to
own
those
they
need
for
loving
.
now
many
of
the
attack
kind
of
they
need
to
own
those
they
need
for
love
but
they
need
to
own
they
by
attack
they
to
hold
they
,
attack
they
to
seize
they
and
they
can
be
do
this
completely
with
a
little
baby
be
with
they
.
some
resist
one
be
completely
love
child
when
they
be
little
baby
because
then
they
be
completely
own
they
by
possession
,
by
the
baby
being
of
they
to
they
some
of
they
.
some
of
the
attack
kind
of
they
be
of
the
dependent
kind
of
they
like
the
little
baby
as
then
they
be
together
dependent
one
be
together
completely
a
dependent
being
.
Julia
Dehning
be
of
the
independent
dependent
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
sometime
much
later
I
will
tell
something
of
woman
and
child
with
they
.
now
I
will
only
tell
about
Julia
dehne
love
and
marrying
and
what
some
know
her
thought
of
she
as
she
be
then
be
.




it
be
a
very
difficult
thing
to
really
let
one
's
self
be
certain
that
they
be
not
sorry
when
every
one
be
think
they
should
be
sorry
,
that
they
be
not
glad
when
every
one
be
think
that
they
be
go
to
be
a
glad
one
,
that
they
be
not
like
to
be
do
something
for
some
one
they
be
love
when
that
one
be
think
they
be
glad
to
do
that
thing
,
that
they
be
not
pleased
to
see
some
one
when
it
be
a
natural
thing
for
they
in
their
living
to
be
glad
to
see
such
a
one
,
that
they
be
not
move
by
some
one
be
suffer
when
they
be
reasonably
tender
-
hearted
should
be
move
then
,
that
they
be
not
remember
their
own
little
need
when
it
be
not
a
decent
time
for
they
to
be
mention
they
.
it
be
a
very
difficult
thing
,
some
from
superstition
,
fear
something
bad
will
happen
if
they
let
themselves
know
that
they
be
what
not
any
one
not
have
bad
thing
go
to
be
happen
to
they
would
be
in
feeling
,
some
from
natural
conviction
that
they
be
feel
always
what
be
right
for
they
to
be
feel
,
some
from
the
sentimental
feeling
that
it
be
such
a
nice
feeling
feel
the
right
way
in
living
,
some
from
not
be
really
certain
that
to
be
a
dead
one
be
to
be
really
entirely
a
dead
one
,
some
from
be
quite
certain
that
to
be
a
dead
one
be
to
be
not
at
all
a
dead
one
,
some
from
have
a
fear
in
they
that
then
something
will
happen
badly
to
some
one
,
some
from
generous
loving
,
some
from
enthusiasm
,
some
from
be
really
that
kind
of
a
one
one
have
some
such
feeling
,
it
be
a
very
difficult
thing
to
very
many
in
live
to
let
themselves
be
say
feel
think
what
they
be
think
feeling
say
when
something
happen
to
they
happen
to
some
one
.
I
be
say
this
long
thing
because
I
be
feel
that
this
be
a
necessary
thing
to
be
realise
in
learn
know
any
one
and
yet
it
do
very
much
happen
that
one
be
have
very
really
much
more
feel
the
way
any
one
naturally
be
suppose
they
be
have
about
anything
about
everything
than
they
themselves
be
think
they
be
have
.
I
have
be
learn
in
my
living
all
the
being
in
many
man
and
many
woman
,
in
Julia
Dehning
.
I
be
always
want
to
be
realise
the
whole
be
in
each
one
of
they
,
by
feeling
,
by
think
,
by
know
by
talk
,
by
remember
.
I
be
go
to
be
tell
very
soon
now
what
very
many
feel
in
know
Julia
Dehning
,
what
Julia
Dehning
feel
in
living
,
what
be
what
kind
of
be
Julia
Dehning
be
inside
she
.




as
I
be
say
she
be
of
the
attacking
,
the
independent
dependent
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
as
I
be
say
she
be
all
through
her
living
resist
have
any
change
in
she
be
one
do
one
way
of
attack
.
as
I
be
say
she
have
in
a
way
not
really
a
lack
of
successful
living
,
really
though
she
have
not
really
sense
for
living
.
that
be
what
any
one
now
certainly
can
be
realise
.
each
one
be
certainly
like
some
one
,
have
something
in
they
of
the
father
and
the
mother
of
they

living
.
Julia
have
not
really
sense
for
living
.
Julia
then
be
a
young
woman
.
this
be
now
to
be
a
description
of
Julia
Dehning
,
of
what
other
be
feel
in
Julia
Dehning
.




some
be
know
in
live
by
their
feeling
that
they
be
like
something
.
some
be
not
know
by
their
feeling
what
thing
they
be
like
.
some
have
so
very
much
feeling
that
the
feeling
cover
anything
to
like
,
some
have
so
much
excitement
in
live
that
that
thing
cover
everything
.
some
can
need
everything
for
anything
can
be
food
to
they
.
very
many
,
quite
a
number
be
live
and
not
tell
by
their
feeling
what
they
be
like
.
a
good
many
be
live
and
be
tell
by
their
feeling
what
they
be
like
.
as
I
be
say
Julia
Dehning
come
to
the
marrying
of
Alfred
Hersland
.
this
be
the
way
they
come
to
be
love
,
the
way
I
have
tell
once
,
the
way
I
be
now
tell
.
some
like
very
much
the
being
and
the
living
in
Julia
Dehning
,
some
do
not
like
at
all
the
being
and
the
living
in
Julia
Dehning
;
to
some
it
be
,
the
living
and
the
being
in
Julia
Dehning
,
not
a
pleasant
not
an
unpleasant
thing
.
Julia
Dehning
be
not
a
harsh
one
in
attack
without
win
as
her
mother
be
in
her
feeling
.
Julia
be
a
stupid
one
in
resist
any
change
in
she
being
as
attack
.
Julia
be
a
crude
one
then
and
in
such
a
way
a
stupid
one
but
not
really
a
harsh
one
.
she
be
one
to
herself
and
to
every
one
have
complete
courage
for
living
.
really
as
I
be
say
she
have
not
really
sense
for
living
and
so
really
then
she
have
not
really
courage
for
living
,
she
have
completely
courage
for
resist
any
change
in
she
be
in
her
way
attack
,
not
really
complete
courage
for
this
thing
,
she
be
of
the
independent
dependent
kind
of
they
.




I
be
feel
attack
kind
a
little
harshly
just
now
in
I
,
I
be
now
begin
again
to
have
in
I
complete
feeling
of
attack
be
in
man
and
woman
.




attacking
kind
be
often
very
sweet
one
to
very
many
,
poignantly
sweet
one
and
generous
one
in
living
.
attack
kind
often
have
it
in
they
to
be
as
bad
,
as
harsh
,
as
crude
as
they
feel
in
they
to
any
one
because
they
know
in
live
they
be
generous
one
need
to
be
attack
some
one
to
have
they
love
they
.
I
know
this
as
certain
.
this
give
to
they
the
right
to
be
harsh
or
crude
or
eager
as
they
have
it
in
they
that
they
have
it
in
they
for
live
that
they
be
generous
in
emotion
,
as
they
certainly
be
,
in
poignant
feeling
,
the
need
of
attack
to
win
what
they
be
need
for
live
.
those
having
resist
be
have
it
in
they
very
often
to
be
afraid
if
they
be
too
completely
resist
not
any
one
will
attack
they
enough
to
win
they
and
they
be
uneasy
then
in
they
.
this
be
certainly
not
true
of
all
attack
and
all
resist
,
these
thing
I
have
be
say
of
attack
kind
in
man
and
woman
of
resist
kind
in
man
and
woman
,
it
be
true
of
quite
a
number
of
they
.
so
then
many
of
the
attack
kind
in
man
and
woman
feel
it
in
they
as
a
completely
natural
thing
to
be
as
harsh
as
crude
as
active
as
eager
in
attack
as
they
feel
it
to
have
it
in
they
.
many
of
the
resist
kind
in
man
and
woman
have
it
to
be
very
dubious
about
the
do
all
the
resist
they
have
in
they
to
be
do
.
many
have
attack
being
have
sweetness
and
courage
in
attack
,
and
harshness
and
crudeness
and
eagerness
in
attack
.
I
be
now
think
about
man
and
woman
have
it
in
they
to
be
certain
they
be
right
in
living
.




as
I
be
say
some
know
Julia
dehne
like
completely
the
being
and
the
living
she
have
all
her
living
,
some
do
not
like
it
at
all
,
some
like
it
well
enough
as
I
be
say
.
some
like
it
and
then
like
it
well
enough
and
then
do
not
like
it
.
some
like
it
very
much
and
then
like
it
well
enough
.
some
as
I
be
say
do
not
like
it
.




to
mostly
every
one
Julia
have
complete
courage
for
living
.
slowly
some
come
to
understanding
that
really
she
have
not
sense
for
living
,
that
she
have
almost
complete
courage
for
not
change
any
kind
of
attack
be
she
have
in
living
.
she
have
real
courage
in
she
,
that
be
certain
.
she
have
sweetness
in
she
that
be
certain
.
she
have
stupid
be
in
she
that
be
certain
.




I
will
tell
now
more
about
attack
being
,
about
enthusiasm
,
about
be
certain
in
living
,
about
what
other
one
be
feel
,
think
,
say
.




I
know
Julia
Dehning
.
certainly
I
know
Julia
Dehning
.
yes
of
course

the
end
of
her
beginning
live
,
at
the
beginning
of
her
middle
living
,
at
the
middle
of
her
middle
living
.
I
know

in
her

as
a
kind
of
a
one
,
as
one
of
a
kind
in

.

that
she
be
a
really
live
one
.
I
know
Julia
dehne
be
certain
in
be
live
.
yes
I
do
know
Julia
Dehning
.
I
certainly
can
say
I
do
know
Julia
Dehning
.
Julia
Dehning
be
one
have
be
in
she
all
her
living
and
be
quite
an
important
one
in
living
.
Julia
Dehning
come
to
marry
Alfred
Hersland
,
that
be
certain
.
Julia
Dehning
be
one
always
be
one
have
completely
courage
for
live
in
be
one
having
completely
live
be
in
resist
be
one
having
change
from
sensitiveness
in
way
of
attack
,
in
having
change
from
hearing
,
see
,
feel
anything
in
the
attacking
be
in
she
.




I
be
remember
,
really
I
never
do
forget
one
have
be
in
she
,
attack
be
in
she
and
always
to
every
one
this
one
be
one
not
have
attack
in
she
but
resist
be
in
she
because
this
one
have
this
be
in
she
as
be
so
like
,
soft
not
set
jelly
in
she
that
this
one
be
one
by
her
skin
cut
she
off
from
any
other
one
and
this
one
have
attack
being
that
never
do
more
than
just
wobble
in
she
and
any
one
move
at
she
be
stick
in
this
be
in
she
and
so
she
be
to
every
one
a
resist
one
but
really
this
one
be
of
the
attack
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
now
I
be
tell
how
Martha
Hersland
have
attack
being
that
be
in
her
indeterminate
nervous
excitement
inside
she
.
now
I
be
tell
of
Julia
dehne
that
she
be
one
having
complete
resist
to
any
change
in
she
attacking
,
as
stubbornness
then
to
mostly
every
one
realise
this
in
she
in
her
living
,
and
be
one
not
have
really
sense
for
living
,
one
have
really
courage
always
in
living
,
be
one
that
need
everything
for
anything
can
feed
she
and
now
I
certainly
understand
the
relation
in
be
between
she
and
these
two
I
have
be
just
rehearse
as
be
and
I
be
certainly
certain
I
be
certainly
know
be
in
Julia
Dehning
.




I
wish
every
one
be
feel
be
the
way
I
be
tell
it
now
in
my
writing
and
that
not
any
one
could
understand
it
without
hear
I
tell
it
as
I
be
now
do
.
I
could
like
that
very
well
I
think
now
when
I
be
not
remember
listening
,
when
I
be
not
remember
love
everything
,
love
be
and
repeat
in
even
one
.
I
think
it
would
be
so
very
nice
if
every
one
know
how
completely
it
be
a
necessary
thing
to
realise
be
the
way
I
be
realise
be
,
and
then
I
be
explain
this
thing
,
and
then
I
be
be
one
really
explain
everything
.
I
really
do
like
be
in
every
one
and
so
I
be
very
happy
even
with
not
every
one
really
realise
the
important
thing
that
I
can
explain
be
in
every
one
,
with
hardly
any
one
realise
this
thing
.
I
be
tell
now
the
history
of
the
living
in
Julia
Dehning
,
a
description
of
the
being
in
Julia
Dehning
,
and
what
I
know
of
she
being
,
what
many
know
of
be
in
she
in
her
living
.




I
be
think
about
how
any
one
feel
anything
,
learn
anything
.
I
be
think
about
Julia
Dehning
.
I
be
think
about
dependent
and
independent
being
,
dependent
independent
,
independent
dependent
being
.




I
be
think
about
attack
be
.
I
be
think
about
how
the
attack
kind
in
man
and
woman
react
to
anything
,
I
be
think
about
the
way
they
have
sensitiveness
in
they
.
I
be
think
about
how
I
be
go
to
be
tell
about
the
being
in
they
,
the
attack
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
I
have
be
describe
some
of
the
attack
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
I
must
now
I
be
think
tell
about
be
in
some
more
of
they
.




I
be
know
very
well
,
I
be
know
very
many
man
and
woman
have
attack
be
in
they
,
independent
dependent
being
.
I
be
feel
some
of
they
.
I
be
realise
many
of
they
.
now
I
have
it
as
something
I
be
do
,
describe
be
in
the
independent
dependent
kind
,
the
attack
kind
in
man
and
woman
.




sensitiveness
to
anything
,
to
something
in
any
kind
or
the
attack
kind
in
man
and
woman
,
the
independent
dependent
kind
in
man
and
woman
be
something
I
be
now
begin
describe
.
I
know
certainly
in
daily
living
sensitiveness
in
the
attack
kind
in
man
and
woman
in
independent
dependent
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
I
can
certainly
know
what
I
be
mean
by
sensitiveness
in
they
,
I
be
now
begin
give
what
be
in
I
as
realise
sensitiveness
in
being
and
independent
dependent
kind
in
man
and
woman
.




Sensitiveness
be
in
man
and
woman
of
the
independent
dependent
kind
in
man
and
woman
,
in
those
have
it
that
they
can
have
it
in
they
that
reaction
be
complete
and
poignant
and
quick
in
they
so
that
they
can
have
emotion
as
poignant
in
they
as
a
sensation
.
this
be
in
a
way
the
foundation
of
my
explanation
.
I
be
begin
again
tell
everything
.




how
have
any
one
sensitiveness
in
live
?
they
have
it
in
they
as
their
way
of
be
.
now
let
I
see
,
I
who
be
realise
now
sensitive
be
in
the
attack
kind
of
they
,
let
I
see
if
I
can
say
this
thing
now
in
the
time
I
be
live
.
each
one
I
have
be
know
have
attack
being
,
have
their
kind
of
sensitiveness
in
they
be
remain
in
my
feeling
,
they
be
crowd
now
in
my
feeling
,
they
all
have
it
in
they
to
have
sensitive
being
of
the
attack
kind
of
be
of
the
independent
dependent
kind
of
be
in
they
.
they
have
then
sensitive
be
some
of
they
of
independent
kind
of
independent
dependent
being
,
they
have
sensitive
be
in
they
some
of
they
of
dependent
kind
of
the
independent
dependent
kind
of
be
.
some
have
sensitiveness
in
they
that
make
of
they
that
they
be
to
themselves
and
to
every
one
possess
by
each
one
ever
come
near
to
they
.
some
have
with
this
kind
of
sensitiveness
in
they
emotion
,
some
passion
,
some
practical
desiring
,
some
fear
,
some
depression
,
some
exaltation
,
these
then
be
such
have
it
in
they
that
they
be
completely
and
always
respond
to
any
one
come
near
to
they
in
the
way
of
sensitiveness
of
complete
reaction
of
realisation
of
the
being
of
some
one
be
near
they
.
some
as
I
be
say
have
this
with
passion
,
some
with
emotion
,
some
with
intention
,
some
with
desperation
,
some
with
much
lying
,
some
with
conviction
,
some
with
religion
,
many
with
feeling
of
know
everything
come
to
be
happen
,
some
have
it
thickly
in
they
,
some
thinly
in
they
,
some
with
much
independent
attacking
,
some
with
almost
not
any
attack
,
some
with
gladness
in
they
,
some
with
the
desire
of
be
an
important
one
in
living
.
these
then
have
it
in
they
that
sensitiveness
be
complete
and
always
in
they
to
everything
come
near
they
,
it
may
be
thick
or
thin
,
or
stupid
or
dull
or
timid
or
aggressive
in
they
,
or
fairly
intelligent
in
they
.
these
be
then
many
of
they
very
full
of
want
always
have
new
thing
in
religion
.
these
be
very
often
have
it
in
they
to
be
very
interesting
to
quite
a
number
know
they
,
some
be
very
sweet
with
this
thing
,
some
be
very
gentle
with
this
thing
,
some
be
want
to
make
money
,
or
position
or
win
something
for
some
one
with
this
thing
.
mostly
these
then
be
not
really
succeed
in
living
.
some
have
with
this
thing
sense
for
live
in
they
,
mostly
they
have
not
in
they
most
of
such
of
they
very
much
sense
for
live
in
they
.
these
then
be
not
those
have
sensitiveness
in
they
to
mystic
religion
as
be
really
in
they
.
those
want
to
have
mystic
religion
in
they
those
of
the
attack
kind
of
they
be
those
have
it
in
they
to
be
attack
complete
emotion
to
be
in
that
thing
.
such
have
it
in
they
to
have
complete
sensitiveness
in
they
to
something
they
be
realise
as
a
complete
thing
to
be
attack
by
a
complete
effort
of
be
in
that
thing
by
the
attacking
by
they
of
that
thing
.
such
as
these
have
it
in
they
mostly
not
to
have
poignant
passion
in
they
but
complete
attack
in
they
and
very
many
of
they
have
not
attack
in
they
only
for
religion
,
they
have
it
for
pure
reason
,
for
pure
affection
,
for
much
succeed
in
living
,
and
mostly
these
then
too
very
many
of
they
though
be
very
successful
indeed
in
living
have
not
really
in
they
much
sense
for
living
.
I
know
a
whole
lot
of
these
in
living
.
I
hope
I
will
be
see
that
I
be
rightly
realise
the
being
in
they
and
that
it
be
as
I
have
be
describe
and
as
I
will
be
go
on
sometime
describe
.




now
there
be
some
have
attack
be
in
they
have
sensitiveness
in
they
as
passion
in
they
and
these
can
have
it
in
they
to
be
successful
,
to
be
fail
in
living
,
to
be
wise
or
foolish
in
living
,
to
have
sense
for
living
,
to
have
not
too
much
sense
for
living
,
to
have
much
,
to
have
little
sensitiveness
in
they
,
to
have
it
thinly
,
thickly
,
intermittently
in
they
,
to
be
use
it
in
every
way
in
living
,
to
have
it
very
delicately
in
they
,
to
have
it
fairly
coarsely
in
they
,
but
mostly
these
have
it
in
they
although
they
may
be
succeed
although
they
may
be
fail
,
be
not
really
without
some
sense
for
live
in
they
.
they
can
be
anything
,
some
practical
,
some
religious
,
some
earnest
,
some
careless
,
some
ambitious
,
some
critical
,
some
very
weak
in
living
,
some
very
intermittent
in
do
anything
,
all
have
passion
in
they
as
sensitive
being
.




then
there
be
some
have
attack
be
as
sensitive
being
as
emotion
in
they
,
these
can
be
quite
melancholy
often
in
living
,
these
can
be
quite
aggressive
in
living
and
to
every
one
can
be
content
and
energetic
in
living
,
and
self
-
satisfying
and
these
can
have
it
in
they
that
they
have
trouble
in
have
it
as
be
that
sensitiveness
be
in
they
as
emotion
,
they
can
have
it
that
they
have
not
in
they
any
power
of
resist
when
they
have
it
not
in
they
to
be
practical
in
live
.
I
know
now
some
of
such
of
they
.
I
will
certainly
sometime
tell
more
of
such
of
they
.
two
of
such
of
they
be
just
now
in
my
feeling
every
minute
in
my
living
.




then
there
be
some
have
attack
being
that
have
sensitiveness
in
they
as
be
really
excitement
inside
but
mostly
these
then
do
not
have
it
in
they
to
have
sensitiveness
really
in
they
.
perhaps
they
have
spot
of
sensitiveness
in
they
,
time
for
sensitiveness
in
they
.




now
I
will
begin
tell
a
little
about
how
some
come
to
learn
or
not
learn
in
living
.
always
I
be
tell
of
the
attack
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
always
now

good
description

way
of

be
of
course
a
natural
thing
as
any

sensitiveness
in
they
and
I
be
not

.




I
have

,
I
have
be
hear
about

and
I
be
not
realise
of
they
the
way

be
in
they
.
I
have
not
be
love
any
of
this
kind
in
man
and
woman
,
I
would
like

,
of
this
kind
in
man
and
woman
,
I
would
like
to
be
know
certainly
the
way
sensitiveness
be
in
they
in
this
kind
of
the
attack
kind

and
man
.
I
be
feel
some
one
of
this
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
I
know
some
thing
of
the
character
in
they
,
something
of
the
way
they
do
some
thing
in
living
,
but
they
be
a
kind
of
they
that
be
really
different
from
these
kind
I
have
be
describe
.
I
will
not
now
be
tell
my
trouble
to
every
one
.
it
be
enough
that
I
have
be
say
that
I
be
not
understand
all
the
way
sensitiveness
be
in
the
attack
kind
in
man
and
woman
.




I
be
realise
some
sensitiveness
in
some
who
have
attack
be
in
they
.
soon
I
will
tell
complete
history
of
each
one
having
sensitive
be
in
they
.
that
will
certainly
be
help
to
make
a
long
book
interesting
.
I
could
tell
it
very
completely
now
of
some
.
I
will
not
just
now
be
begin
this
thing
.
I
be
certainly
now
write
a
history
of
be
in
Julia
dehne
be
live
.
as
I
be
say
some
have
attack
be
in
they
,
have
independent
dependent
be
in
they
have
it
in
they
to
have
sensitiveness
in
they
as
passion
in
they
.
I
be
tell
about
one
have
attack
be
and
have
it
as
wobble
,
have
it
as
be
in
this
one
as
a
soft
jelly
mass
making
of
this
one
an
individual
one
by
the
skin
of
this
one
separate
this
one
from
any
other
one
.
I
have
be
tell
about
attack
be
in
Martha
Hersland
,
in
Mr.
David
Hersland
in
Redfern
.
I
have
be
tell
something
of
attack
be
in
some
other
because
I
be
tell
then
about
such
other
one
.
I
be
remember
pretty
completely
everything
I
have
be
tell
.
I
be
always
think
I
be
not
remember
what
I
be
go
to
be
tell
what
I
have
be
tell
but
really
I
be
remember
pretty
well
what
I
have
be
tell
,
what
I
be
tell
,
what
I
be
go
to
be
tell
.
now
I
be
tell
about
some
way
of
have
sensitiveness
and
learn
in
some
having
attack
being
,
independent
dependent
be
in
they
.




Julia
Dehning
as
I
have
be
say
be
always
resist
change
the
attack
way
she
have
have
,
be
have
,
would
be
have
all
her
living
.
as
I
be
say
she
have
not
really
then
sense
for
living
.
as
I
be
say
she
be
not
really
an
unsuccessful
one
in
living
.
as
I
be
say
Mrs.
Dehning
be
stupid
in
attack
when
she
be
attack
and
not
for
any
winning
.
this
be
in
she
always
in
her
daily
living
.
as
I
be
say
Mrs.
Dehning
have
some
sense
for
living
.
as
I
be
say
she
be
an
important
enough
one
in
daily
living
.




there
be
very
many
who
be
want
to
be
learn
in
their
living
.
some
as
I
have
be
say
of
Julia
Dehning
be
want
anything
because
they
be
feel
that
anything
can
feed
they
.
some
something
like
Julia
Dehning
can
feel
have
teaching
,
some
something
like
Julia
Dehning
can
feel
a
little
the
thing
some
one
have
be
teach
they
,
some
something
like
Julia
Dehning
can
be
feel
give
teaching
,
some
something
like
Julia
Dehning
be
every
minute
feeling
teach
to
they
feel
teach
from
they
,
either
feel
teaching
be
give
to
they
or
be
give
by
they
,
always
then
feel
teaching
,
always
then
feel
teaching
be
give
,
this
be
very
common
with
many
have
in
they
not
really
any
sensitiveness
to
the
teaching
itself
that
have
be
give
,
that
they
be
give
.
to
begin
again
.
there
be
many
have
sensitiveness
in
they
to
some
one
teaching
,
to
there
be
one
teach
some
one
,
to
their
teaching
some
one
and
have
in
they
the
very
least
possible
sensitiveness
to
the
teaching
that
be
be
teach
then
.
this
be
very
common
.
some
have
not
any
in
they
sensitiveness
to
the
thing
teach
by
any
one
and
these
have
it
in
they
to
have
really
sensitiveness
to
there
be
teaching
do
to
they
,
by
they
,
to
some
one
,
by
some
one
.
now
this
be
certainly
quite
common
and
this
be
bring
this
writing
always
near
to
Julia
Dehning
.
as
I
be
say
Julia
need
anything
because
in
her
feeling
in
she
be
everything
could
be
feed
she
in
living
.
now
as
I
be
say
Julia
have
be
that
be
one
resist
,
be
stupid
in
resist
anything
that
could
be
touch
she
in
relation
to
she
always
be
in
her
way
persist
in
attack
.
really
then
Julia
have
not
in
she
any
way
of
learn
anything
.
really
she
have
it
in
she
that
she
be
be
an
excited
one
in
seize
everything
,
seize
anything
to
learn
that
thing
and
always
then
she
have
it
in
she
be
that
she
be
a
stupid
one
in
not
be
able
to
not
be
a
resist
one
in
a
stubborn
way
to
anything
teach
she
in
any
way
to
be
an
attack
one
.
this
then
be
be
in
she
and
as
any
one
can
see
it
would
make
of
her
one
not
having
really
sense
for
living
,
one
having
not
necessarily
fail
in
living
,
one
be
one
interesting
to
some
,
one
be
one
certainly
in
a
way
have
courage
in
living
.
as
I
be
say
she
be
of
the
attacking
,
of
the
independent
dependent
kind
in
woman
and
man
.
she
have
dependent
be
in
she
of
the
independent
dependent
kind
of
be
but
this
really
be
in
she
only
when
rarely
it
do
happen
to
she
some
one
do
tell
she
she
have
not
really
any
way
of
learn
in
she
.
then
she
have
it
in
she
as
the
dependent
independent
dependent
attack
kind
in
woman
and
man
have
it
in
they
,
she
have
it
in
she
to
be
certain
that
not
the
last
end
of
a
bad
thing
could
happen
to
she
and
then
surely
some
one
do
have
it
to
be
certain
that
she
certainly
could
learn
something
and
so
then
she
have
it
in
she
this
not
as
a
religion
but
she
have
in
she
then
the
certain
feeling
of
right
conviction
.
and
see
then
every
one
read
this
thing
that
this
one
Julia
Dehning
have
conviction
in
she
that
she
be
one
to
be
an
attack
one
resist
any
one
change
any
attack
in
her
being
and
she
be
one
seize
be
one
learning
and
always
then
really
she
could
not
be
learn
anything
.
it
be
a
clear
thing
then
that
she
have
not
in
she
anything
of
religion
.
it
be
certainly
a
clear
thing
this
thing
that
she
do
not
have
in
she
with
dependent
independent
dependent
be
in
she
anything
in
she
of
religion
,
she
could
and
do
and
would
have
and
mostly
must
have
conviction
,
she
must
be
have
the
sensation
of
certain
feeling
to
be
go
on
attack
,
have
courage
really
in
all
of
her
living
.
she
be
completely
then
a
stupid
one
in
be
a
resist
one
resist
any
change
in
she
be
in
a
way
an
attack
one
have
courage
in
living
.
she
have
then
certainly
not
sense
for
living
.
she
be
then
certainly
in
live
not
one
fail
in
living
.
she
be
one
seize
be
one
learn
anything
,
learn
everything
,
she
be
one
feeling
be
one
need
anything
,
need
everything
because
not
anything
be
teach
anything
in
her
being
.
she
be
one
seize
anything
that
be
teach
because
she
be
one
have
it
in
her
feeling
that
everything
be
feed
she
in
living
.
she
have
courage
in
living
,
she
have
not
sense
for
living
,
she
have
dependent
be
in
her
being
of
the
independent
dependent
kind
as
I
have
be
say
,
she
be
not
really
fail
not
really
succeed
in
living
.
she
be
one
quite
interesting
to
some
,
quite
unpleasant
to
some
,
quite
irritate
to
some
,
quite
stimulating
to
some
,
quite
stupid
to
some
,
quite
unusually
bright
to
some
,
quite
loving
and
pathetic
to
some
,
quite
cold
and
self
-
seek
to
some
,
entirely
generous
and
courageous
to
some
,
quite
fail
in
really
attack
to
some
,
quite
entirely
honest
to
some
,
quite
fail
in
be
honest
in
know
that
sometimes
she
be
lie
to
some
,
quite
earnest
and
sensitive
to
teach
to
some
,
quite
impenetrable
to

,
quite
completely
obstinate
to
some
,
quite
nervous
and
fairly
excited
to
every
one
.
this
be
to
be
now
a
history
of
live
in
she
,
of
be
in
she
,
of
what
each
one
know
she
feel
in
she
,
what
those

feel
about

,
how
one
can
come
to
know
any
one
,
of
be
in
every
one
.




this
then
be
certain
,
feel
that
there
be
and
be
and
will
be
teach
be
give
always
every
day
to
some

be
very
much
in
very
many
moral
feeling
,
completely
moral
feeling
,
completely
moral
conviction
.
this
be
very
often
in
very
many
not
have
any

in
they
for
anything
any

Julia
Dehning
as
I
be
say
be
completely
need
feeling
that
always
in
all
daily
living
teaching
be
be
give
by
some
one
by
a
good
many
of
mostly
everything
.
she
be
need
learn
learn
everything
for
anything
could
be
a
food
to
she
that
she
could
have
as
learn
.
she
have
then
certainly
from
this
thing
completely
a
moral
conviction
.
she
do
this
need
learn
from
be
one
need
to
be
go
on

.
this
be
in
very
many
woman
in
very
many
man
,
in
pretty
nearly
ever
so
many
woman
and

.
teach
then
be
exist

in
moral
being
in
very
many
pretty
nearly
a
very
great
many

.




some
be
feel
each
thing
they
be
like
and
be
not
learn
anything
in
living
.
some
of
these
have
religion
in
they
,
some
of
these
have
themselves
inside
they
to
they
as
all
be
in
they
,
some
of
such
of
they
be
completely
love
some
one
.
many
be
feel
everything
in
living
be
not
learn
anything
in
living
,
I
know
very
well
one
of
these
in
my
living
and
this
one
have
complete
feeling
of
each
thing
and
this
one
be
delicately
vibrate
and
completely
love
something
and
not
have
any
religion
,
not
any
moral
feeling
,
not
any
interest
,
in
any
opinion
.
I
know
by
read
and
by
hearing
of
two
have
it
in
they
that
they
be
completely
feel
everything
,
each
thing
and
be
not
learn
anything
in
living
.
these
have
religion
in
they
,
these
be
certain
that
the
have
so
much
feeling
in
they
with
each
thing
be
mean
that
they
be
realise
that
a
god
be
love
they
.
I
know
one
and
that
one
be
in
a
way
like
Julia
Dehning
and
this
one
be
feel
each
thing
in
living
and
not
learn
anything
and
always
have
a
conviction
that
it
be
a
necessary
thing
that
this
one
be
learn
everything
so
that
this
one
can
be
have
meaning
in
living
and
this
one
have
moral
conviction
.
this
one
need
it
that
every
one
be
learn
everything
.
I
know
one
who
be
in
living
live
in
her
being
and
completely
live
with
her
being
and
this
one
be
feel
everything
and
not
learn
anything
in
living
and
this
one
be
need
feel
everything
in
living
and
not
learn
anything
in
live
to
make
it
for
herself
a
complete
thing
that
she
be
live
with
her
being
.
some
who
be
feel
everything
feel
anything
in
living
have
a
little
a
very
little
power
of
realise
each
thing
they
be
feel
,
these
could
learn
something
in
live
if
each
thing
be
not
succeed
another
thing
.
some
of
these
can
come
to
learn
something
in
living
.
some
can
learn
something
in
their
living
,
Julia
dehne
in
a
way
be
not
such
a
one
.
these
I
have
just
be
describe
be
some
with
attack
be
in
they
who
be
not
learn
,
not
succeed
,
not
necessarily
tail
in
live
,
some
of
such
of
they
be
quite
important
to
a
number
know
they
in
live
.
they
be
not
really
important
in
live
.
they
have
not
really
sense
for
living
.
I
be
go
now
again
to
commence
my
regular
description
of
be
in
Julia
Dehning
,
of
Dehning
family
live
,
of
Julia
's
meeting
and
marrying
and
love
and
not
learn
,
and
not
endure
Alfred
Hersland
,
and
of
her
complete
living
.
I
be
begin
again
,
not
from
the
beginning
this
time
that
be
certain
.




the
Dehning
family
as
I
be
say
be
live
quite
completely
pleasantly
very
rich
right
american
living
.
they
be
live
this
in
a
free
way
,
in
a
quite
generous
way
,
in
a
completely
pleasant
way
in
a
fairly
energetic
way
,
in
a
quite
successful
way
,
in
a
fairly
gay
way
,
in
a
quite
spirited
way
,
in
a
fairly
peaceful
way
,
in
not
an
ambitious
way
,
in
a
quite
fairly
simple
way
,
in
a
quite
thoroughly
completely
easily
pleasant
fairly
happy
reasonably
content
and
content
way
.
family
living
be
a
thing
a
family
in
a
way
be
realise
.
sometimes
a
family
be
not
at
all
realise
that
thing
.
mostly
a
family
be
in
a
way
know
the
kind
of
family
live
they
have
in
they
.
sometimes
it
be
a
queer
thing
to
have
they
tell
family
live
.
sometimes
it
be
a
very
funny
thing
when
some
be
explain
a
family
live
,
sometimes
it
be
a
foolish
thing
,
sometimes
an
irritating
thing
,
very
often
a
quite
tedious
thing
.
family
living
be
a
peculiar
thing
because
not
any
one
,
mostly
,
be
decide
family
living
and
always
each
one
be
himself
or
herself
inside
she
or
he
and
family
living
be
in
a
way
a
combination
that
in
a
way
be
not
come
from
any
one
.
sometimes
it
be
come
from
some
one
,
sometimes
it
be
a
combination
thing
,
sometimes
it
just
happen
to
be
exist
.
as
I
be
say
the
Dehnings
have
family
live
in
they
that
be
not
really
express
Mr.
Dehning
or
Mrs.
Dehning
or
in
a
way
the
two
together
nor
in
a
way
the
three
child
.
really
one
know
each
one
of
they
would
be
think
family
living
would
have
be
a
different
thing
in
they
from
what
it
really
be
in
they
.
really
I
suppose
certainly
it
be
a
combination
of
be
in
Mr.
Dehning
and
Mrs.
Dehning
and
the
three
child
.




family
living
be
a
pleasant
thing
when
each
one
like
to
be
hear
some
telling
about
what
each
one
like
to
be
do
in
living
.
family
live
when
not
any
one
be
like
to
be
listen
to
what
another
one
be
like
in
living
be
not
at
all
a
pleasant
thing
.
it
be
a
very
difficult
thing
,
for
very
many
,
to
keep
on
be
one
like
to
be
hear
about
what
another
one
in
the
family
be
like
in
living
.
so
then
family
living
come
to
be
not
any
long
exist
and
sometimes
then
it
be
a
very
troublesome
thing
.
in
the
Dehning
family
living
they
keep
on
all
of
they
for
a
really
very
longtime
of
living
be
ready
to
be
listen
to
what
each
one
like
in
living
,
need
in
living
,
have
in
living
.
dehne
family
live
as
I
be
say
be
quite
completely
a
long
time
a
quite
pleasant
thing
.
Julia
be
not
really
perhaps
listen
enough
to
Mrs.
Dehning
have
live
to
make
it
later
a
completely
pleasant
living
but
Julia
be
listen
to
all
the
other
one
and
all
the
other
one
could
listen
to
all
the
other
one
tell
about
live
in
they
and
so
really
dehne
family
living
be
really
pretty
nearly
a
completely
pleasant
thing
.




it
certainly
be
quite
entirely
a
difficult
thing
to
keep
on
a
long
time
with
several
living
in
a
house
together
,
a
family
to
go
on
really
listen
to
what
each
one
be
tell
,
to
what
each
one
be
need
,
have
for
live
.
each
one
can
find
it
a
more
or
a
less
difficult
thing
.
mostly
each
one
sometime
commence
to
be
do
less
of
this
thing
in
family
live
as
they
come
to
be
in
middle
living
.
as
I
be
say
Mr.
Dehning
like
it
in
he
to
be
listen
to
any
one
want
to
be
do
anything
.
he
be
a
completely
good
man
in
family
live
,
in
do
all
live
he
have
in
he
.
each
one
of
the
Dehning
family
be
quite
good
for
Dehning
family
live
.




as
I
be
say
Mr.
Dehning
like
it
inside
he
that
he
be
ready
to
be
listen
to
any
one
want
to
do
something
.
this
be
in
a
way
pleasant
being
of
important
feeling
in
he
.
Mrs.
Dehning
be
not
listen
when
Julia
be
marry
Alfred
Hersland
.
in
a
way
though
she
be
listen
.
later
George
and
Hortense
Dehning
be
feel
very
much
listen
inside
they
.
Julia
Dehning
be
not
then
make
Dehning
family
live
,
she
be
a
little
then
lead
to
her
mother
's
feeling
who
be
one
have
it
in
her
feeling
that
she
be
one
lead
in
attack
.
not
that
really
in
a
way
either
Mrs.
Dehning
or
Julia
Dehning
be
make
family
live
,
or
really
lead
Dehning
family
live
,
they
really
each
one
,
Mrs.
Dehning
early
,
Julia
Dehning
later
,
be
give
their
own
feeling
of
be
one
need
succeed
in
have
something
in
live
as
a
stamp
on
Dehning
family
live
.
they
be
neither
of
they
one
have
a
needing
of
attack
for
win
,
they
neither
of
they
have
really
much
ambition
in
they
,
they
really
have
it
in
they
to
be
need
to
be
succeed
in
have
something
that
would
be
for
they
a
stamping
by
they
of
dehne
family
live
.
each
one
of
they
have
in
they
their
own
being
of
which
I
have
be
already
give
some
description
.
Mrs.
Dehning
have
some
sense
for
living
,
Julia
Dehning
have
not
really
sense
for

each
one
of
they

quite
important
as
live

.
the
Dehning
family

Dehning
and
Alfred
Hersland

,
I
be
describe
this
thing
.




Mr.
Dehning
be
one
learn
in
live
.
really
he
be
not
one
come
to
have
more
and
more
sense
for
living
.
he
have
certainly
in
his
early
and
middle
living
very
much
sense
for
living
,
he
always
all
his

in
the
beginning
of
the
ending
of
middle
,
live
in
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Dehning
.
Mrs.
Dehning
have
sense
for
living
,
neither
more
nor
less
all
of
her
living
,
Mrs.
Dehning
could
be
learn
in
live
.
Mr.
Dehning
be
a
little
come
to
be
in
he
an
important
one
from
be
one
listen
to
any
one
want
to
be
do
anything
.
Julia
begin
she
live
by
attack
to
be
marry
Alfred
Hersland
attack
in
family
live
.
as
I
be
say
Julia
be
one
not
really
win
,
she
be
really
do
what
she
be
feel
she
be
need
to
be
go
on
be
one
living
.
she
be
really
then
keep
on
be
in
family
live
although
she
be
attack
to
be
live
in
marry
Alfred
Hersland
.
that
be
history
of
live
in
she
,
that
will
be
always
what
I
be
tell
of
be
in
she
be
live
.




Julia
have
not
the
emotion
of
ambition
,
she
have
not
ambition
in
she
as
emotion
,
she
have
it
in
she
,
ambition
,
as
attack
and
not
for
win
,
she
have
some
intention
of
ambition
,
not
very
much
but
some
,
she
have
ambition
in
be
one
resist
any
change
in
attack
be
in
she
.
Alfred
Hersland
have
ambition
in
emotion
,
he
have
ambition
in
intention
,
he
have
not
so
much
ambition
in
be
one
have
resist
engulfing
being
.
it
be
a
thing
that
be
very
interesting
that
those
have
in
they
that
ambition
be
not
as
emotion
in
they
have
it
that
to
very
many
know
they
they
be
very
sweet
in
living
,
very
careless
in
living
,
very
unworldly
in
living
,
very
unselfish
in
living
.
some
of
such
of
they
have
ambition
in
they
as
Julia
Dehning
have
as
I
be
say
.
it
be
in
a
way
a
nice
thing
to
be
one
not
have
ambition
as
emotion
for
these
then
know
this
thing
of
they
can
be
do
what
they
be
need
in
living
and
always
they
do
not
need
to
be
hold
back
or
ashamed
in
they
because
they
be
not
really
self
-
seek
to
any
one
,
know
it
in
they
that
ambition
be
not
an
emotion
in
they
.
Alfred
Hersland
have
ambition
as
emotion
in
he
,
he
have
ambition
as
intention
in
he
,
he
have
not
ambition
as
act
as
resist
engulfing
be
in
he
and
so
then
he
be
in
a
way
fail
in
living
.
he
be
not
completely
fail
in
living
.
Julia
Dehning
and
Alfred
Hersland
come
to
know
each
other
and
come
to
be
marry
and
to
live
together
and
this
be
to
be
now
a
history
of
the
living
in
they
.
Julia
be
all
her
live
in
a
way
of
dehne
family
live
.
as
I
be
say
Mrs.
Dehning
,
Julia
Dehning
be
of
Dehning
family
live
.
they
be
not
really
make
Dehning
family
live
any
more
than
any
one
in
the
Dehning
family
live
.
they
be
in
a
way
always
put
on
themselves
a
stamp
that
be
in
a
way
from
their
own
being
in
be
a
part
of
Dehning
family
live
.
in
a
way
they
be
a
little
more
exciting
in
be
stamp
in
themselves
for
themselves
a
way
of
be
part
of
Dehning
family
live
,
a
little
more
exciting
than
Mr.
Dehning
or
George
or
Hortense
Dehning
.
really
as
I
be
say
of
they
they
be
not
actually
very
exciting
,
really
then
,
as
Mrs.
Dehning
be
not
really
exciting
in
harsh
attack
as
she
have
not
then
feel
of
be
win
she
be
not
then
win
anything
,
she
be
one
in
any
feeling
and
Julia
dehne
who
as
I
be
say
have
not
really
sense
for
living
be
not
win
in
be
one
resist
any
change
in
she
be
in
one
way
in
attack
living
,
in
not
learn
anything
in
living
.
so
then
really
not
any
one
of
the
Dehning
family
be
really
exciting
,
they
be
each
one
of
they
reasonably
important
in
living
,
they
be
really
not
at
all
exciting
.
the
Dehning
family
each
one
be
certain
as
be
much
more
exciting
.
the
Dehning
family
be
live
very
well
very
rich
american
living
.
this
be
to
be
now
more
history
of
each
one
of
they
.




the
Dehning
family
living
be
successful
living
for
all
of
they
,
all
five
of
they
,
the
Dehning
family
living
be
a
successful
,
generous
,
pleasant
,
reasonably
important
very
rich
american
living
.
quite
generous
,
quite
pleasant
,
quite
reasonably
a
successful
very
rich
right
american
living
,
almost
a
completely
american
living
,
always
fairly
excited
,
sometimes
fairly
profoundly
agitated
,
mostly
always
fairly
pleasant
fairly
generous
,
very
completely
each
one
have
anything
they
could
be
need
,
quite
simple
in
emotion
,
country
house
and
city
living
.




it
be
a
reasonably
important
living
,
the
Dehning
family
live
,
each
one
of
they
be
reasonably
important
each
one
of
they
in
their
living
.
as
I
be
save
they
be
mostly
all
of
they
fairly
excited
with
living
,
all
of
they
certainly
live
in
living
,
as
I
be
just
say
not
really
so
very
exciting
in
be
.
there
be
to
be
more
description
of
they
.




it
be
very
hard
for
any
one
to
tell
in
any
other
one
how
much
that
one
be
love
another
one
.
it
be
very
difficult
to
tell
it
about
any
one
how
much
love
they
can
have
they
do
have
in
they
.
it
be
difficult
to
know
of
any
one
what
kind
of
loving
they
have
in
they
,
certainly
it
be
difficult
to
know
that
in
any
one
,
it
certainly
be
very
difficult
to
tell
it
of
any
one
at
any
time
how
much
of
their
loving
they
have
in
they
,
they
can
have
in
they
,
how
much
love
there
be
in
they
of
their
kind
of
love
for
any
one
.




Alfred
Hersland
and
Julia
Dehning
come
together
,
they
certainly
come
to
marry
.
it
be
very
difficult
to
tell
in
either
of
they
how
much
of
their
kind
of
love
they
have
then
in
they
for
the
other
of
the
two
of
they
.




Julia
Dehning
as
I
have
be
say
be
of
the
attack
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
Alfred
Hersland
as
I
have
be
say
again
and
again
be
of
the
engulf
resist
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
Julia
Dehning
certainly
could
have
some
love
in
she
for
some
one
,
Julia
be
in
Dehning
family
live
,
she
be
certainly
one
to
have
some
love
in
she
for
some
in
living
,
she
certainly
be
have
love
in
she
then
for
Alfred
Hersland
.
Alfred
Hersland
as
I
be
say
have
not
really
any
living
that
be
important
to
he
until
he
come
to
love
one
and
want
to
stop
study
so
that
he
could
immediately
marry
that
one
and
then
a
little
later
he
do
not
want
to
be
love
.
that
be
the
first
thing
important
to
he
in
live
as
I
be
say
.
he
have
aspire
be
in
he
as
I
be
say
of
he
.
he
come
to
love
and
marry
Julia
Dehning
.
he
have
love
in
he
for
she
then
,
in
a
way
he
always
have
some
loving
in
he
for
some
one
.
they
both
then
Julia
Dehning
and
Alfred
Hersland
have
it
in
they
to
have
some
loving
for
some
one
,
for
the
other
one
,
for
some
,
in
they
.




Mrs.
Dehning
as
I
be
say
have
some
sense
for
living
.
Julia
be
important
enough
in
living
,
be
not
really
fail
in
living
,
be
really
quite
important
as
live
,
be
really
one
very
courageously
completely
live
her
living
,
be
fairly
attack
,
be
one
not
have
really
sense
for
living
.
do
Alfred
Hersland
have
sense
for
living
,
any
sense
for
living
,
I
be
not
quite
certain
,
I
think
he
have
a
little
sense
for
living
,
not
so
much
as
he
be
one
be
stupid
in
aspiration
,
in
ambition
,
as
he
be
an
engulfing
resist
one
not
really
resist
,
not
really
engulf
,
but
perhaps
he
have
a
very
little
bit
of
sense
for
living
,
else
he
probably
would
have
be
completely
fail
in
living
,
a
little
sense
for
living
come
to
be
in
a
way
in
he
and
then
he
be
again
a
love
one
and
then
he
be
fail
but
not
really
completely
fail
in
living
.
he
be
then
even
almost
succeed
in
living
.




Julia
Dehning
and
Alfred
Hersland
then
when
they
be
marry
each
other
do
certainly
have
love
in
they
each
one
of
they
for
the
other
one
.
I
have
already
tell
about
their
come
to
be
need
to
have
each
other
for
live
and
love
.
they
do
certainly
come
to
marry
.
they
do
certainly
succeed
in
not
succeed
in
their
married
living
.
this
be
to
be
now
some
description
of
love
be
in
each
one
of
the
two
of
they
and
of
their
marrying
and
of
their
married
living
.
the
description
of
the
love
being
in
Julia
Dehning
and
then
in
Alfred
Hersland
and
the
relation
in
Julia
of
she
be
love
to
family
living
,
the
love
be
in
Julia
and
the
stupid
be
in
she
and
the
family
live
to
she
,
and
then
more
love
be
in
she
.




it
be
very
difficult
in
quarrel
to
be
certain
in
either
one
what
the
other
one
be
remember
.
it
be
very
often
astonishing
to
each
one
quarrel
to
find
out
what
the
other
one
be
remember
for
quarrel
.
mostly
in
quarrel
not
any
one
be
find
out
what
the
other
one
be
remember
for
quarrel
,
what
the
other
one
be
remember
from
quarrel
.




I
have
be
tell
something
about
live
in
man
and
woman
have
resist
be
in
they
,
have
engulf
resist
be
in
they
.
some
of
such
of
they
have
quite
a
good
deal
of
love
in
they
,
some
of
such
of
they
have
more
loving
in
they
than
they
can
feel
in
they
some
have
less
love
in
they
than
they
be
believe
they
have
in
they
,
not
have
it
in
they
to
have
emotion
poignant
like
a
sensation
as
those
have
attack
being
have
it
in
they
.
some
have
resist
be
having
attack
in
they
to
keep
themselves
from
have
to
be
resist
be
very
dependent
of
the
dependent
independent
kind
of
they
say
they
be
have
very
much
loving
,
they
may
have
very
much
love
in
they
,
say
they
have
very
little
love
in
they
,
they
may
have
very
little
love
in
they
.
those
have
engulf
being
may
have
very
much
,
a
little
or
quite
some
love
in
they
.
these
sometimes
have
very
much
more
loving
feeling
in
they
than
at
other
time
in
their
living
,
some
of
they
.
these
may
tell
that
they
have
very
much
loving
feeling
in
they
with
conviction
,
they
may
tell
that
they
have
little
love
feeling
in
they
with
conviction
.




those
have
attack
have
it
as
I
be
say
to
have
emotion
have
in
they
the
poignancy
of
a
sensation
.
some
have
attack
be
can
certainly
have
this
very
dully
in
they
.
many
can
have
it
in
they
that
they
be
tell
about
have
it
very
much
in
they
,
some
of
such
of
they
have
it
very
much
in
they
and
some
of
such
of
they
just
have
it
some
in
they
.
some
of
the
attack
kind
of
they
can
be
very
excited
about
tell
it
about
themselves
,
sometimes
very
often
,
and
some
of
such
of
they
certainly
have
it
very
lively
in
they
,
some
have
it
quite
deaden
in
they
.
some
can
have
very
much
emotion
in
tell
about
it
to
themselves
and
every
one
and
they
have
quite
a
great
deal
of
it
really
in
they
,
some
have
it
very
much
in
they
in
tell
of
it
and
it
be
in
they
that
they
have
it
really
in
they
,
yes
they
certainly
have
it
really
in
they
only
it
do
not
make
they
do
what
they
think
it
will
,
it
do
,
it
do
make
they
do
in
living
.
some
have
a
great
deal
of
it
in
they
but
it
be
not
active
in
they
but
I
will
not
tell
all
the
way
I
can
think
of
that
those
having
attack
be
have
emotion
in
they
.
some
as
I
be
say
of
the
attack
kind
in
man
and
woman
be
very
much
excited
always
in
be
,
in
live
in
any
living
,
in
be
one
be
live
.
some
of
such
of
they
have
very
much
emotion
in
they
,
some
not
so
much
,
some
quite
a
bit
,
some
really
very
little
in
they
.
some
of
such
of
they
have
it
in
they
that
they
be
not
have
emotion
with
the
excitement
of
be
in
live
in
they
,
they
have
emotion
in
they
.
some
be
all
their
living
,
some
of
such
as
these
I
be
describe
,
some
be
all
their
living
having
be
have
really
one
fairly
large
emotion
and
be
resist
any
change
in
they
of
this
emotion
in
they
and
be
very
excited
in
live
from
be
excited
one
and
stubborn
one
in
living
.
some
of
such
of
they
have
sense
for
living
,
some
of
such
of
they
have
not
sense
for
living
.
some
of
such
be
very
stupid
one
in
be
,
some
of
such
of
they
be
quite
sensitive
in
be
.
Julia
Dehning
be
of
the
kind
have
one
emotion
all
her
living
and
not
be
ever
change
,
and
be
stubborn
in
resist
and
excited
in
be
live
,
and
not
sensitive
in
be
and
not
have
sense
for
living
.
this
be
to
be
now
more
description
of
love
and
marry
and
quarrelling
and
family
living
.
when
some
one
having
be
feel
all
their
live
one
way
of
feeling
living
come
to
be
feel
in
they
another
way
of
feeling
live
,
that
be
disturb
to
they
.
sometimes
then
one
be
from
that
time
on
a
more
or
less
sick
one
.
sometimes
some
one
like
this
in
they
.
sometimes
they
do
not
like
it
in
they
.
sometimes
some
one
have
all
their
living
be
do
something
and
have
for
do
that
thing
excited
feeling
in
they
and
then
some
one
do
that
thing
for
they
with
not
any
excitement
in
that
one
and
then
the
other
one
be
leave
with
not
any
excited
feeling
and
that
be
sometimes
a
pleasant
thing
and
sometimes
a
completely
distressing
thing
.
some
never
can
lose
excitement
out
of
they
not
with
any
one
be
show
they
.
Julia
Dehning
always
have
an
excited
way
of
be
need
anything
and
as
I
be
say
she
have
really
love
be
all
her
living
and
as
I
be
say
that
be
not
exciting
in
she
really
,
not
very
exciting
and
always
she
be
stubbornly
resist
be
any
different
in
attack
by
her
being
.




Julia
and
Alfred
and
Dehning
family
live
and
love
and
learning
and
quarrel
.
some
know
of
themselves
in
their
dressing
,
in
their
daily
living
in
everything
what
they
be
and
what
they
be
want
from
every
one
,
from
any
one
.
some
know
what
they
be
want
but
they
do
not
have
it
in
they
in
their
daily
living
,
in
their
dressing
to
show
it
to
any
one
.
some
can
show
it
while
they
be
with
some
who
have
the
same
being
in
they
and
then
later
when
they
be
leave
alone
can
not
really
be
remember
what
it
be
they
want
to
be
to
show
to
any
one
,
to
every
one
.
some
know
what
they
want
to
be
and
can
build
it
up
by
little
piece
and
do
again
and
again
.
some
know
what
they
be
and
see
it
as
a
complete
thing
and
make
that
thing
in
daily
living
.
some
know
what
they
be
and
be
always
cut
and
fitting
and
fitting
and
cut
and
painting
and
sometime
they
come
to
be
that
thing
in
dressing
and
daily
living
and
then
they
can
lose
that
thing
.
some
can
not
see
the
thing
they
be
in
daily
living
and
in
dressing
nor
what
they
want
to
be
in
daily
living
and
in
dressing
.
some
see
what
they
want
to
be
in
daily
living
and
in
dressing
and
then
they
be
a
little
less
than
that
thing
so
that
they
will
not
be
queer
to
any
one
.
some
have
really
the
feeling
of
invent
themselves
in
daily
living
and
in
dressing
,
some
be
really
do
this
thing
,
some
be
feel
themselves
do
this
thing
.
I
will
tell
more
about
this
thing
.
Julia
Dehning
as
I
be
say
be
all
her
live
after
she
be
herself
to
herself
in
living
want
to
be
create
live
in
learn
everything
in
daily
living
,
furnishing
,
dress
-
making
,
decoration
,
clean
herself
and
everything
,
rest
,
reading
,
be
a
good
one
,
be
a
useful
one
.
she
be
do
this
then
and
she
come
to
love
Alfred
Hersland
.
she
be
do
this
thing
,
she
be
as
I
be
say
one
not
have
really
any
way
of
feeling
in
learn
.
she
come
to
love
and
marry
Alfred
Hersland
.
she
have
love
be
in
she
,
she
have
Dehning
family
live
in
her
feeling
.




one
know
what
effect
that
one
want
to
produce
to
that
one
,
to
any
one
,
in
that
one
exist
,
in
the
daily
living
that
one
have
for
living
.
that
one
do
not
feel
that
one
as
a
finished
thing
,
that
one
work
from
something
that
one
be
know
pretty
quickly
to
something
that
one
have
be
not
really
know
and
then
that
come
to
be
to
that
one
a
know
thing
and
then
that
one
stick
there
in
that
thing
.
that
one
do
not
want
to
be
conspicuous
in
living
but
do
want
to
be
intelligent
and
elegant
.
this
then
be
a
personal
ideal
,
that
that
that
one
have
for
daily
living
and
so
this
one
have
feeling
of
be
always
create
all
the
daily
living
,
the
being
in
that
one
,
really
that
one
be
go
from
something
that
one
have
be
know
to
something
that
one
have
not
quite
be
certainly
know
and
stick
there
in
that
thing
.




another
one
need
to
be
for
live
what
that
one
be
certain
any
one
like
that
one
be
in
being
and
in
living
.
that
one
can
be
that
in
live
when
there
be
other
realise
what
that
one
be
that
kind
of
a
one
be
in
living
,
when
other
be
that
kind
in
living
be
with
that
one
in
daily
living
.
this
one
need
these
then
for
be
what
this
one
be
certain
any
one
be
like
this
one
be
in
daily
living
.
this
one
when
this
one
be
not
be
keep
in
live
being
by
other
be
what
this
one
be
certain
this
one
be
be
in
living
,
by
other
be
certain
that
this
one
be
in
live
what
this
one
be
certain
any
one
like
this
one
be
in
living
,
lose
the
grasp
really
on
what
be
what
this
one
be
certain
any
one
like
this
one
be
in
daily
living
.
another
one
never
lose
realise
what
it
be
that
this
one
be
certain
be
be
in
this
one
and
always
this
one
be
build
it
up
by
little
piece
.
this
one
never
come
to
be
a
completer
one
.
very
often
this
one
be
a
vague
and
stupid
one
and
not
really
be
in
live
and
so
then
always
this
one
keep
a
little
pile
by
always
add
to
make
this
one
what
this
one
be
certain
from
what
this
one
and
every
one
expect
of
this
one
this
one
be
in
daily
living
.
some
see
themselves
as
a
whole
one
and
they
cut
and
add
boldly
to
make
themselves
the
whole
one
.
some
slowly
possess
it
,
some
never
know
what
it
be
and
never
possess
it
,
some
only
know
what
be
not
it
when
they
see
themselves
not
it
in
daily
living
.
Julia
Dehning
be
one
have
certainly
a
needing
of
be
learn
everything
.
Julia
be
in
a
way
not
feel
in
learn
anything
.
Julia
have
love
be
in
she
that
be
certain
.
she
be
certain
of
have
honesty
for
live
as
every
one
have
dehne
family
living
have
in
they
.
she
be
certain
of
have
courage
for
living
.
this
thing
she
have
in
she
in
daily
living
,
this
she
could
not
ever
have
in
she
as
develop
.
it
be
in
she
that
be
certain
,
she
have
attack
be
in
she
that
be
this
thing
in
she
,
she
have
attack
be
in
she
that
be
be
need
learn
anything
.
she
have
it
in
she
to
be
completely
stubbornly
actively
passively
resist
any
changing
of
the
attacking
be
in
she
,
she
have
then
not
really
sense
for

little
feeling
be

do
her
daily
live
in
living
.
she
have
really
passion
in
she
but
not
enough
to
make
it
right
that
she
should
have
so
much
stubbornness
in
she
of
not
change
she
attack
,
not
enough
to
make
it
right
that
she
should
be
such
a
nervous
one
in
daily
living
,
should
be
one
so
excited
in

really
she
be
not
learn
anything
in
living
,
really
she
could
never
have
the
last
courage
of
know
that
sometime
she
be
not
honest
in
living
,
really
she
be
need
love
and
support
in
Dehning
family
live
.
really
then
it
could
only
come
to
any
one
as
a
slow
thing
to
be
realise
that
she
have
not
complete
courage
in
be
one
living
,
that
she
have
not
sense
for
living
.
so
then
she
could
have
it
really
in
she
that
it
be
sweet
and
generous
and
aspire
for
she
to
be
as
harsh
as
crude
as
active
as
eager
in
attack
as
she
could
have
strength
for
it
in
her
being
.
and
this
be
right
for
she
to
herself
and
to
mostly
any
one
feeling
love
be
in
she
.
this
be
true
of
very
many
have
attack
be
in
they
and
poignant
and
generous
love
be
in
they
as
complete
be
for
they
.
this
then
be
not
stupid
be
in
she
,
stupid
be
in
she
be
resist
have
any
change
in
the
attacking
being
of
she
,
have
not
any
sensitiveness
of
be
in
she
from
more
living
in
she
.
this
make
of
her
one
not
learn
anything
in
living
,
have
real
then
not
sense
for
living
.
I
will
tell
more
gradually
about
this
thing
.




Alfred
Hersland
have
ambition
in
he
,
Julia
Dehning
have
ambition
.
not
either
one
or
the
other
of
they
as
I
be
say
be
really
fail
in
living
,
be
really
succeed
,
have
really
sense
for
living
,
be
really
defeat
by
live
.




Alfred
Hersland
have
aspiration
in
living
,
have
an
aspiration
to
be
succeed
.
Julia
Dehning
have
aspiration
in
living
,
have
aspiration
in
be
one
learning
and
to
be
then
completely
live
.
Alfred
Hersland
have
fail
in
he
have
fail
to
be
one
succeed
in
something
,
Julia
Dehning
be
then
one
not
succeed
in
be
,
be
one
not
really
learn
anything
for
live
.
it
be
then
right
that
they
should
have
come
to
be
two
love
one
another
and
then
come
to
marry
and
then
come
to
be
not
succeed
in
married
living
.
some
have
it
right
for
they
to
be
love
and
marry
and
succeed
in
married
living
,
some
have
it
right
from
the
being
in
they
to
be
love
each
other
and
marrying
and
not
succeed
then
in
having
marry
live
in
they
for
those
two
of
they
together
then
.
some
have
it
to
be
right
for
they
from
the
being
in
they
to
be
love
one
another
then
and
not
then
to
be
marry
.
some
who
be
love
one
another
do
not
have
it
really
that
it
be
right
from
the
being
in
they
that
they
be
love
for
each
other
then
.
and
then
it
be
right
from
be
in
some
one
that
that
one
should
love
some
one
,
should
not
love
some
one
,
should
be
love
by
some
one
,
should
not
be
love
by
some
one
.
anyway
it
certainly
be
alright
from
the
being
in
they
that
Alfred
Hersland
and
Julia
Dehning
should
come
to
be
love
one
another
and
marrying
and
not
succeed
in
their
married
living
.




they
be
marry
then
and
they
do
not
succeed
in
their
married
living
together
then
.
they
be
each
one
of
they
not
really
succeed
not
really
fail
in
their
living
.




really
it
be
a
very
difficult
thing
in
live
for
some
to
be
certain
that
they
be
believe
in
loving
,
that
they
be
believe
in
be
honest
in
living
,
that
they
be
believe
in
any
one
be
a
good
one
.
it
be
so
terribly
mix
up
and
how
do
one
know
live
,
love
,
think
,
honest
being
,
feeling
,
goodness
in
living
,
and
yet
one
be
do
thinking
,
living
,
love
,
honest
action
,
goodness
in
living
,
and
some
one
else
be
be
a
good
one
,
an
honest
one
,
a
love
one
,
a
thinking
one
,
a
feeling
one
and
always
then
one
be
know
everything
in
one
and
one
be
not
believe
what
one
be
know
inside
they
and
one
be
know
what
be
go
on
in
they
and
one
be
not
believe
that
thing
and
how
then
be
one
really
certain
that
love
and
feeling
and
thinking
and
goodness
and
honesty
be
in
they
and
how
be
one
not
certain
and
what
be
then
the
satisfaction
of
having
be
of
be
of
go
to
be
be
a
live
one
and
that
one
be
not
certain
that
love
that
think
that
honesty
that
goodness
be
something
in
they
and
that
one
be
not
then
certain
.

.
I
be
go
to
be
certain
of
this

,
and
why
not

of
this
thing
.
I
be
go
now
to
be
describe
honesty
and
goodness
and
loving
and
think
and
live
in
Julia
Dehning
and
Alfred
Hersland
.




to
some
it
be
an
encouraging
thing
a
very
encouraging
thing
that
mostly
every
one
have
plenty
of
courage
in
they
for
daily
living
.
to
some
it
be
a
wonderful
thing
that
not
everything
scare
every
one
.
it
be
so
easy
for
some
to
be
scare
by
mostly
everything
,
by
every
little
bit
of
daily
living
,
it
be
a
very
fine
thing
,
a
fine
fine
thing
for
such
of
they
to
be
really
certain
that
not
everybody
be
scared
by
everything
.
very
often
some
be
live
a
long
time
in
living
believe
that
every
one
be
really
scared
by
everything
.
some
be
not
ever
really
believe
that
any
one
be
scare
by
everything
.
as
I
be
say
it

.
I
have
say
that
this
be
to
be
a
description
of
be
in
Julia
Dehning
and
Alfred
Hersland
,
I
be
remember
this
thing
,
that
be
certain
.




Mr.
Dehning
soon
come
to
think
that
Alfred
Hersland
be
not
an
honest
man
.
Julia
Hersland
soon
come
to
be
certain
that
Alfred
Hersland
be
not
an
honest
one
.
Mr.
Dehning
be
an
honest
enough
man
in
living
.
that
be
certain
.




Julia
Dehning
and
Alfred
Hersland
be
marry
and
commence
be
together
for
all
of
their
daily
living
.
Mr.
Dehning
come
to
think
that
Alfred
Hersland
be
not
an
honest
enough
man
to
have
in
the
Dehning
family
daily
living
.
Julia
Hersland
be
quite
certain
that
Alfred
Hersland
be
not
an
honest
enough
one
for
any
Dehning
family
live
.
the
Dehning
family
be
certainly
quite
honest
one
for
daily
living
.
Alfred
Hersland
certainly
be
not
quite
such
an
honest
one
in
some
of
his
dailyliving
.




it
be
to
some
a
quite
difficult
thing
to
be
certain
that
they
have
love
,
that
they
have
think
,
that
they
have
feeling
,
that
they
have
honest
daily
living
,
that
they
have
goodness
in
they
.
it
be
not
at
all
a
difficult
thing
for
some
to
be
certain
of
themselves
in
living
,
to
be
certain
about
other
one
in
live
whether
they
be
love
,
whether
they
be
feel
,
whether
they
be
honest
one
,
whether
they
be
good
one
,
whether
they
be
think
in
all
of
their
living
.
as
I
be
say
Mr.
Dehning
come
to
be
think
that
Alfred
Hersland
be
not
an
honest
man
enough
for
dehne
family
live
.
as
I
be
say
Julia
Hersland
come
to
be
quite
soon
quite
entirely
certain
that
Alfred
Hersland
be
not
an
honest
enough
one
to
be
have
as
one
have
with
she
all
his
daily
living
.
as
I
be
say
Alfred
Hersland
be
one
really
not
fail
really
not
succeed
in
living
,
he
be
one
have
some
aspiration
for
succeed
in
living
,
he
be
one
have
engulf
resist
be
in
he
,
he
be
one
have
some
love
be
in
he
,
he
be
one
have
some
thinking
in
he
,
he
be
one
certainly
not
go
to
be
honest
enough
in
the
Dehning
family
way
of
living
.




they
all
of
they
have
some
love
feeling
in
they
.
Mr.
Dehning
,
Mrs.
Dehning
,
Julia
Hersland
and
Alfred
Hersland
.
they
each
one
of
they
certainly
could
have
some
love
feeling
in
they
.
they
each
one
of
they
could
have
very
little
loving
feeling
in
they
.
in
live
Dehning
family
live
each
one
have
in
they
some
love
feeling
.
Alfred
Hersland
have
some
love
feeling
in
he
.
the
Dehning
family
live
as
I
say
before
be
very
right
very
rich
american
living
quite
pleasantly
,
quite
generously
,
reasonably
honestly
,
reasonably
lovingly
,
somewhat
urgently
exist
.
Julia
Hersland
in
married
living
be
expect
different
living
from
Dehning
family
live
,
so
she
be
think
,
she
want
a
very
much
more
earnest
and
exciting
american
living
than
the
Dehning
family
living
and
always
then
it
be
certain
that
in
she
she
be
certain
that
she
have
it
in
she
to
be
really
have
dehne
family
live
as
every
one
reasonably
good
one
have
it
to
have
in
they
,
Alfred
Hersland
be
not
really
then
of
Dehning
family
living
,
Julia
be
really
then
always
of
Dehning
family
live
.
Mr.
Dehning
be
then
fairly
slowly
quite
certain
that
Alfred
Hersand
be
not
such
a
reasonably
honest
one
as
Mr.
Dehning
need
for
business
living
.
Julia
Hersland
have
come
fairly
quickly
to
be
certain
that
Alfred
Hersland
be
not
the
kind
of
a
one
she
need
for
fairly
honest
daily
living
,
Alfred
Hersland
be
really
not
fail
then
,
really
not
succeed
then
in
living
,
Alfred
Hersland
have
then
important
feeling
for
be
one
aspire
to
succeed
in
living
.
Alfred
Hersland
have
then
some
love
feeling
in
he
,
that
be
not
then
to
he
in
he
important

come
to
be

that
she
be

have
dehne
family
live
as
beginning
of
all
be

want
to
be
learn

,
need
everything
as
anything
could
feed
she

marry
Alfred
Hersland
he
be
one
to
she
really
do
learning
in

.
always
as
I
be

she
be
not
do
any
learning
for
live
.
as
I
be
say
sometime
she
come
to
be
certain
that
she
be
a
completely
honest
one
for
live
.
this
be
in

all
her

then
as
really
every
bit
of
learn
live
in
her

.
she
be
one
certain
that
she
be
an

she
come
to
be
quite
certain
that
Alfred
Hersland
be
not
honest

.
this
be
in
she
then
sometime
and
always
then
she
be
certain
of
this
thing
all
the
rest
then
of
her
living
and
as
I
be
say
she
be
one
completely
resist
any
change
in
the
attacking
being
that
be
really
live
in
she
.
all
her
live
then
too
she
be
go

succeed
some
,
not
succeed
some
,
more
,
sometime
quite
fail
in
living
.
really
then
as
I
be
say
perhaps
she
have
not
really
at
all
sense
for
living
.
she
marry
Alfred
Hersland
,
she
come
quite
soon
to
be
certain
he

really
for
any
daily

.
she
come
to
be
quite

,
that
dehne

to
be
now
then
again
and
again
history
of
all
of

as
I
be
say
she
have
all

,
the
same

I
remember
the
way
I
have

when
I
be
a

now
when
I
have
it
when
I
be
not
any
long
such
a
young
one
.
Julia
be
not
really
ever
remember
that
she
have
all
her
live
the
same
be
a
tired

,
the
same
be
a
disturbed
one
,
the
same
being
sometimes
not

,
as
daily

.
this
be
be
in
she
to

be
really
then
not

then
Hortense
then
be
live
inside
her
begin
married
living
of
Julia
and
Alfred
Hersland
and
this
be
not
then
an
important
thing
to
any
one
and
only
to
Hortense
for
remembering
.
as
I
be
say
George
Dehning
be
live
in
Dehning
family
live
,
certainly
he
be
live
in
that
living
then
and
so
he
be
live
in
Dehning
family
live
in
the
beginning
married
living
in
Alfred
and
Julia
Hersland
and
that
be
enough
then
about
he
.
to
go
on
then
.
as
I
be
say
once
,
Alfred
Hersland
be
need
something
to
make
he
completely
be
then
one
be
really
live
.
this
be
then
to
be
some
description
of
his
come
not

be
have
,
to
be
have
this
thing
.




Mr.
Dehning
have
all
he
could
be
need
to
be
successful
in
living
.
as
I
be
say
more
and
more
it
be
important
be
in
he
really
to
be
listen
to
any
one
want
to
be
do
anything
.
each
one
have
their
own
way
of
tell
some
other
one
what
they
be
need
for
be
succeed
in
living
.
some
be
stammer
some
when
they
be
tell
this
thing
of
their
need
something
to
be
then
a
successful
one
,
to
some
one
.
some
tell
this
quite
quickly
to
any
one
,
some
tell
it
quite
quickly
but
not
to
any
one
,
some
almost
do
not
tell
this
thing
to
any
one
,
some
seem
to
be
one
not
tell
this
thing
to
any
one
some
of
such
of
they
then
tell
this
thing
quite
completely
to
some
.
each
one
be
himself
be
herself
inside
she
inside
he
in
tell
this
thing
,
in
tell
of
need
something
to
be
make
that
one
a
successful
one
in
living
.
some
be
very
convincing
in
tell
this
thing
,
some
be
not
at
all
convincing
in
tell
this
thing
,
some
be
more
some
be
less
convincing
in
tell
this
thing
,
some
be
convincing
to
some
in
tell
this
thing
,
some
be
not
really
convincing
to
any
one
in
tell
this
thing
,
some
be
convincing
to
mostly
every
one
in
tell
this
thing
.
as
I
be
say
it
be
come
to
be
always
more
important
being
in
Mr.
Dehning
to
be
listen
to
any
one
want
to
be
do
anything
.
Mr.
Dehning
be
everything
he
be
need
for
his
successful
living
.
this
be
certain
.
Mr.
Dehning
be
one
be
quite
successful
in
all
of
his
living
.
Alfred
Hersland
come
to
be
a
little
convincing
to
he
,
not
really
to
the
completeness
of
be
convincing
to
he
in
tell
what
he
would
be
need
to
be
one
quite
successful
in
living
but
then
Alfred
Hersland
be
then
be
of
Dehning
family
live
.
Mr.
Dehning
be
certainly
live
then
be
in
Dehning
family
live
,
he
be
one
have
it
always
more
in
he
as
important
be
listen
to
any
one
want
to
be
do
anything
,
he
be
one
have
quite
altogether
everything
he
be
use
for
quite
completely
successful
living
,
he
be
certainly
one
certain
that
not
any
one
should
be
not
have
something
in
living
they
be
not
then
use
,
certainly
he
have
feel
that
Alfred
Hersland
to
be
succeed
would
have
to
be
use
everything
he
have
for
living
and
so
he
Alfred
Hersland
be
a
little
never
really
convincing
in
be
one
go
to
be
succeed
to
Mr.
Dehning
but
then
Mr.
Dehning
be
in
Dehning
family
live
,
Alfred
Hersland
be
in
Dehning
family
live
,
listen
to
any
one
want
to
be
do
anything
be
always
more
and
more
important
being
in
Mr.
Dehning
,
Mr.
Dehning
come
then
to
enough
then
for
completely
listen
come
then
to
be
convince
by
Alfred
Hersland
's
tell
what
Alfred
Hersland
be
need
for
succeed
in
living
.




Mr.
Dehning
like
very
well
then
hear
any
one
tell
again
and
again
what
any
one
be
need
for
succeed
in
living
.
as
I
be
say
always
more
and
more
it
be
important
being
in
Mr.
Dehning
be
one
listen
to
any
one
tell
about
what
they
be
need
to
be
do
to
be
really
live
in
their
living
.
as
I
be
say
Mr.
Dehning
like
very
well
then
some
repeating
,
Alfred
Hersland
then
be
really
then
repeat
with
pretty
steady
aspiration
that
he
be
need
something
to
be
succeed
in
be
one
living
.




I
be
begin
to
like
conversation
,
I
be
begin
to
like
read
some
thing
about
some
that
I
never
before
find
at
all
interesting
.
I
be
begin
to
like
conversation
,
I
use
not
to
like
converse
at
all
,
and
social
living
,
and
so
go
on
and
on
I
be
need
always
I
be
need
something
to
give
to
I
completely
successful
diversion
to
give
I
enough
stimulation
to
keep
I
completely
go
on
be
one
go
on
live
.
that
be
a
description
of
some
be
in
I
,
this
be
then
some
history
of
I
.
so
then
I
be
begin
now
to
like
conversation
.




as
I
be
say
Alfred
Hersland
be
tell
then
after
he
be
a
married
one
with
a
reasonable
steadiness
in
aspiration
,
with
quite
a
really
complete
enthusiasm
,
with
eagerness
but
not
with
insistence
in
telling
,
with
quite
sufficient
pleasure
in
repeat
,
with
quite
a
great
deal
of
honesty
in
hope
,
he
be
tell
then
what
he
be
need
to
be
one
really
succeed
quite
well
in
living
.
he
be
then
in
Dehning
family
live
.
he
be
then
just
married
to
Julia
Dehning
.




I
be
say
that
I
be
come
to
now
be
interested
in
converse
and
this
be
to
I
now
completeness
in
diversion
which
be
what
I
be
have
to
make
of
I
one
go
to
be
go
on
live
.
I
have
be
have
all
my
living
completeness
in
diversion
and
so
I
have
be
one
all
my
living
be
one
go
to
be
go
on
be
live
.
each
one
then
who
be
not
stop
be
go
on
live
be
one
have
it
in
they
in
some
way
to
be
one
go
on
go
on
be
live
.




Mr.
Dehning
as
I
be
say
be
one
quite
completely
succeed
in
living
,
he
be
one
go
to
be
go
on
in
be
one
be
live
and
always
it
be
more
and
more
important
in
he
in
his
being
that
he
be
listen
when
some
one
be
tell
what
that
one
be
go
to
be
do
in
living
,
be
go
to
be
need
to
be
do
what
that
one
be
go
to
be
do
in
live
.
so
then
it
be
always
in
Mr.
Dehning
that
he
be
listen
to
some
one
tell
what
they
be

be
do
something
.
as
I
be
say
Mr.
Dehning
have
in
he
to
be
really
listen
to
some
one
tell
such
a
thing
to
he
.
as
I
be
say
he
be
not
really
listen
to
Alfred
Hersland
until
Alfred
Hersland
be
really
in
Dehning
family
live
,
then
soon
than
it
be
right
to
he
by
listen
he
be
do
more
than
listen
and
this
be
to
be
now
some
history
of
this
thing
.




anybody
can
understand
that
Mr.
Dehning
be
one
really
listen
to
any

anybody
can
understand
that
this
always
be
in
Mr.
Dehning
and
always
be
more
and
more
important
being
in
he
.
any
one
can
understand
that
really
with
Alfred
Hersland
he
come
not
to
be

really
listen
as

be
in
he

in
Dehning
family
daily
living
,
he
be
in
Dehning
family
live
and
not
bear
to
be
this
thing
and
he
be
one
really
earnest
in
aspire
,
really
honest
in
hope
,
really
enthusiastic
in
believe
,
really
thorough
in
repeat
.
Alfred

then
to
be
begin
.




Alfred
Hersland
come
then
to
be
begin
succeed
in
living
.
this
be
to
be
now
some
history
of
this
thing
.




Julia
be
one
not
really
attack
for
win
,
she
be
one
not
need
to
be
really
live
,
she
be
really
do
what
she
be
feel
she
be
need
to
be
do
if
she
be
to
be
one
really
be
live
in
go
on
live
.
she
be
really
then
all
her
living
keeping
on
be
in
family
live
although
she
be
attack
to
be
go
on
be
live
by
learn
anything
.
that
be
a
history
of
she
.
she
be
certain
then
after
she
be
a
married
one
that
she
be
an
honest
one
in
daily
living
,
that
dehne
family
living
be
honest
enough
for
live
,
she
be
then
always
then
and
always
in
Dehning
family
live
.
she
be
always
then
attack
to
be
learn
as
if
she
could
be
one
go
to
be
really
live
in
be
one
go
to
be
go
on
as
live
.
really
then
she
be
all
her
live
in
Dehning
family
live
.
really
then
as
I
have
be
say
quite
often
she
be
not
attack
to
be
win
,
any
one
can
now
understand
this
thing
.
to
very
many
she
be
one
attack
to
be
win
,
really
then
she
be
in
a
way
like
Mrs.
Dehning
who
too
be
stupid
in
be
one
attack
and
not
for
any
real
winning
of
anything
.




any
one
can
then
now
be
understand
be
in
Julia
Hersland
and
can
be
understanding
then
dehne
family
live
,
and
can
begin
again
now
to
be
get
ready
to
be
understand
be
in
Mr.
Dehning
and
in
Alfred
Hersland
and
how
they
come
to
be
do
with
themselves
and
each
other
what
they
come
to
be
do
.
this
be
a
way
of
say
I
could
be
such
a
very
happy
one
if
every
one
really
be
certain
that
I
be
really
a
very
wise
one
.
I
like
it
that
I
be
feel
that
I
could
be
a
very
happy
one
if
every
one
be
certain
I
be
a
completely
wise
one
.
really
I
like
it
very
well
that
I
be
not
really
certain
,
that
mostly
not
any
one
be
really
certain
.
it
be
a
nicely
disturbing
feeling
,
this
thing
.
I
be
now
completely
realise
be
in
Mr.
Dehning
and
Alfred
Hersland
.




that
thing
that
I
be
say
that
some
have
not
ambition
as
emotion
in
they
and
these
then
be
to
mostly
every
one
not
ambitious
one
in
living
and
some
of
these
have
very
much
ambition
as
really
be
in
they
and
some
have
it
as
intention
and
not
emotion
in
they
and
some
really
do
not
have
it
as
emotion
,
as
intention
,
as
be
in
the
being
in
they
be
really
very
interesting
.
I
can
understand
this
thing
from
having
be
know
some
who
be
one
old
one
be
very
much
liking
,
really
these
have
it
in
they
sometimes
to
be
very
much
need
to
be
succeed
in
live
for
the
being
in
they
and
yet
not
have
ambition
as
emotion
,
as
intention
in
they
really
not
have
at
all
ambition
as
emotion
,
as
intention
in
they
,
make
of
they
then
those
be
very
sweet
in
living
,
be
full
of
sweetness
then
and
light
and
life
to
very
many
know
they
.
some
not
have
any
ambition
as
intention
,
as
emotion
in
they
have
not
any
ambition
in
they
but
these
be
just
be
in
living
,
they
be
really
not
actually
succeed
in
living
.
some
of
such
of
they
be
be
very
completely
well
in
be
live
,
this
be
another
thing
.
now
I
be
think
of
Julia
Hersland
and
Alfred
Hersland
,
now
I
be
think
of
one
have
really
not
ambition
as
emotion
,
almost
not
ambition
as
intention
,
quite
completely
ambition
as
be
,
now
I
be
think
of
one
have
completely
ambition
as
aspiration
,
considerably
and
hopefully
and
even
enthusiastically
and
eagerly
,
ambition
as
intention
,
not
really
ambition
as
be
.
this
be
to
be
a
history
of
Alfred
and
Julia
Hersland
.




Mr.
Dehning
have
come
then
as
I
be
say
to
be
do
differently
than
listen
to
Alfred
Hersland
.
he
give
he
a
good
deal
of
money
as
a
loan
for
Alfred
to
be
really
then
begin
to
be
succeed
in
live
.




Alfred
certainly
do
have
a
very
little
real
sense
for
living
,
else
with
be
one
aspire
in
emotion
,
and
ambitious
in
emotion
and
intention
and
not
ambitious
in
be
and
not
really
succeed
in
be
one
resist
and
not
really
succeed
in
be
one
engulfing
he
would
not
have
be
one
end
live
with
not
be
then
one
having
be
really
completely
fail
.
he
be
not
ever
really
succeed
in
living
.
he
be
one
not
really
learn
anything
very
much
by
having
be
in
living
.
he
be
not
well
in
the
beginning
of
his
middle
living
believe
he
be
begin
to
be
one
go
to
be
really
go
on
succeed
in
living
.
now
I
be
go
on
.
now
go
on
.




succeed
be
to
I
just
now
very
interesting
.
some
be
certainly
succeed
in
living
,
some
be
certainly
not
succeed
in
living
,
some
be
in
between
.
I
have
be
come
just
lately
to
be
understand
more
and
more
the
being
in
each
one
and
the
way
be
in
each
one
make
of
each
one
one
succeed
,
one
not
succeed
,
one
in
between
succeed
and
not
succeed
in
living
,
one
succeed
some
,
one
succeed
sometime
,
one
succeed
sometimes
,
one
not
succeed
at
all
in
living
,
one
not
succeed
quite
often
in
living
,
one
begin
with
succeed
,
one
succeed
and
then
not
with
any
more
succeed
just
keep
on
go
.
I
have
come
more
and
more
to
understand
the
being
in
man
and
woman
in
relation
to
their
succeeding
and
fail
in
living
.
I
have
be
make
group
of
they
group
of
man
and
woman
and
group
the
being
in
they
in
relation
to
ambition
,
to
succeed
,
to
fail
in
they
.
I
have
be
explain
some
man
to
some
and
it
be
certainly
an
interesting
thing
to
be
do
this
thing
.
I
be
hope
sometime
to
write
a
complete
history
of
man
and
woman
,
I
be
begin
to
be
hope
this
thing
again
,
I
be
fill
up
now
so
much
with
learn
so
much
about
man
and
woman
and
feel
so
much
wisdom
in
I
now
inside
I
completely
organise
that
I
be
come
again
to
be
almost
certain
that
I
can
sometime
be
write
the
complete
history
of
every
one
who
ever
be
or
be
or
will
be
live
.
I
will
sometime
be
write
complete
history
of
pair
of
people
who
be
connect
in
living
.
I
be
now
tell
about
some
succeeding
,
some
fail
in
living
.




it
be
very
difficult
in
quarrel
for
either
one
to
be
certain
what
the
other
one
have
then
in
he
that
be
make
he
then
do
quarrel
.
this
be
often
quite
astonishing
this
be
sometimes
quite
entirely
astonishing
that
not
one
quarrel
be
certain
of
what
the
other
one
have
in
she
,
in
he
for
quarrel
.
this
can
be
really
astonishing
when
any
one
later
be
learn
at
all
what
be
then
in
another
one
.
and
then
it
be
such
a
very
difficult
thing
ever
to
believe
the
other
one
when
the
other
one
be
tell
what
be
in
he
for
quarrel
.




it
be
certainly
a
difficult
thing
to
believe
another
one
about
quarrel
in
that
other
one
with
one
.
very
often
then
it
be
not
a
thing
any
one
can
be
do
believe
then
the
other
one
.
sometimes
it
be
a
thing
some
one
can
be
do
believe
the
other
one
.
mostly
then
every
one
come
sometime
more
or
less
in
they
to
quarrel
with
some
other
one
,
with
mostly
every
other
one
sometime
.
a
little
quite
a
little
,
quite
a
good
deal
,
quite
some
,
quite
almost
not
at
all
,
quite
often
,
quite
seldom
,
quite
certainly
,
quite
slowly
,
quite
suddenly
,
quite
gradually
,
certainly
there
be
quite
a
good
deal
in
every
one
of
some
quarrel
with
some
one
,
with
quite
a
number
of
they
that
sometime
for
that
one
be
be
live
with
that
one
in
the
living
that
one
can
have
in
that
one
.
this
then
be
to
be
now
much
description
of
Dehning
and
Hersland
quarrel
.
they
certainly
do
quarrel
some
.




they
certainly
do
quarrel
some
all
of
they
.
they
certainly
do
quarrel
completely
,
some
of
they
.
this
be
to
be
now
some
history
of
all
of
they
.




now
I
be
write
of
be
successful
in
live
,
of
quarrel
in
be
live
.
now
I
be
write
of
have
love
feeling
in
they
some
man
and
some
woman
of

in
live

some
quarrel

of
these
man
and
some
of
these
woman
.

be
to
be
now
more

of
each
one
of
they

any
one

more
description

,
George
Dehning
and
Hortense
Dehning
and
any
one
come
to
know
any
of
they
very
well
in
their
living
.




it
be
a
natural
thing
for
Mr.
Dehning
to
be
certain
that
he
could
convince
any
one
that
Alfred
Hersland
be
what
he
know
he
then
to
be
in
daily
living
.
it
be
a
perfectly
natural
thing
for
Mr.
Dehning
to
be
certain
of
this
thing
,
Mr.
Dehning
do
not
talk
so
very
much
about
this
thing
.
really
he

again
to
Julia
and
Mrs.

this
be
a
natural
thing
for
Mr.
Dehning
to
be
do
then
.
really
he
be
naturally
completely
certain
that
he
could
certainly
convince
every
one
that

have
family
live
.
he
be
certain
that

thing
be
a
right
thing
.
he
never
think
or
say
then
that
Julia
should
have
come
to
be
certain
not
to
want
to
be
married
to
Alfred
.
he
certainly
never
do
say
this
thing
then
,
that
be
he
never
really
certainly
say
this
thing
.

say
quite
often
that
Alfred
Hersland
be
not
honest
enough
for
any
daily
living
.
he
be
quite
certain
of
this
thing
.
any
one
certainly
could
be
convince
of
this
thing
if
there
could
come
any
reason
for
convince
any
one
of
this
thing
.
Mr.

this
thing
when
it
be
right

he
to
be
say
this
thing
.
Mr.

have
completely
natural
feeling
in

about
this
whole
thing

of

.
they
have
each
of

in

.
they
have
ambition
differently
in

.
Mr.
Dehning
have
ambition
in
living
.
Mrs.
Dehning
have
ambition
.
this
be
to
be
now
some
description
of
ambition
,
and
honest
living
,
and
love
being
and
daily
living
and
succeed
and
fail
in
each
one
of
they
.




Alfred
Hersland
then
be
for
Dehning
family
live
,
not
honest
in
daily
living
.
he
be
much
later
when
he
be
work
with
some
man
then
fairly
successful
in
live
.
he
could
be
then
when
work
with
certain
man
quite
a
successful
enough
one
in
living
.
he
have
not
really
sense
for
living
,
he
have
not
really
not
any
sense
for
living
.
he
have
as
I
be
say
not
any
ambition
in
he
from
the
resist
,
from
the
engulfing
be
in
he
.
he
have
a
feeling
from
the
resist
and
engulf
be
in
he
some
feeling
of
succeed
in
living
,
of
feel
something
elegant
in
he
in
live
for
he
.
he
have
then
too
,
from
the
resist
and
engulf
be
in
he
with
this
feeling
of
feel
something
be
quite
elegant
in
he
and
in
living
and
some
feeling
of
succeed
be
an
elegant
thing
in
be
live
,
quite
a
good
deal
of
vanity
for
living
.
as
I
be
say
really
aspiration
and
ambition
be
really
stupid
be
in
he
because
really
he
be
one
not
win
by
be
resist
,
really
not
win
by
be
engulf
.
he
have
aspiration
in
he
,
he
have
ambition
in
he
,
as
I
be
say
he
have
not
really
feel
of
anything
be
important
in
he
until
he
be
love
and
want
to
stop
study
to
marry
that
one
and
then
not
want
to
marry
that
one
.
he
have
not
ambition
and
aspiration
in
he
by
the
being
of
he
.
he
have
aspiration
and
ambition
in
he
,
begin
when
something
be
important
to
he
,
as
something
of
emotion
,
as
certainly
a
good
deal
of
intention
.
so
then
aspiration
and
ambition
as
emotion
be
almost
sentimental
be
in
he
it
be
not
in
he
from
be
one
able
to
be
succeed
able
to
be
win
by
the
being
in
he
,
aspiration
and
ambition
as
intention
be
really
stupid
be
in
he
,
they
be
not
from
be
in
he
but
from
need
to
be
have
what
he
need
to
be
have
to
have
anything
be
important
to
he
which
be
not
from
the
being
in
he
important
to
he
.
he
be
then
certainly
for
Dehning
family
live
not
honest
for
daily
living
and
to
himself
then
he
be
a
man
have
it
in
he
to
have
that
he
be
not
quite
certain
that
to
be
a
dead
one
be
to
be
really
not
a
dead
one
.
he
have
some
love
feeling
in
he
,
he
could
with
not
win
resist
and
engulf
be
have
violent
temper
sometimes
in
he
.
he
be
one
then
to
Dehning
family
live
not
honest
in
daily
living
.
he
be
one
very
much
later
,
and
work
with
some
man
,
not
really
not
successful
in
live
.




certainly
some
be
love
,
some
be
honest
,
some
be
good
one
,
some
be
think
in
living
,
certainly
there
be
some
in
living
have
some
of
thinking
,
love
,
good
being
,
honesty
in
they
.
some
have
certainly
some
of
something
really
in
they
.
certainly
they
have
.




some
have
pretty
honest
live
in
they
always
in
their
daily
living
and
be
like
it
very
well
that
they
have
some
reputation
for
this
thing
.
Mr.
Dehning
really
be
such
a
one
.
some
come
to
be
sometime
completely
certain
that
they
be
completely
honest
one
in
living
and
then
all
their
living
they
be
completely
freely
attack
with
this
thing
.
Julia
Dehning
be
such
a
one
.
she
be
really
not
feel
it
as
be
that
there
be
for
she
a
reputation
of
be
an
honest
one
in
living
,
she
like
it
that
the
Dehning
family
live
,
Mr.
Dehning
,
have
a
complete
reputation
of
honest
living
in
daily
living
,
she
be
an
honest
one
in
daily
living
be
a
thing
when
she
come
to
be
live
with
it
inside
she
completely
in
she
she
could
be
use
all
her
living
for
all
the
attacking
she
be
ever
do
to
be
win
.
Alfred
Hersland
be
not
believe
that
not
every
one
be
think
that
he
be
an
honest
enough
one
for
daily
living
.
he
never
really
be
certain
that
any
one
except
Mr.
Dehning
be
really
believe
that
he
be
not
an
honest
man
for
any
kind
of
daily
living
.
he
never
be
really
certain
that
Julia
could
have
really
be
believe
this
thing
if
she
have
not
be
then
and
all
of
she
live
in
Dehning
family
live
.
Julia
be
certain
of
this
thing
that
Alfred
Hersland
be
not
honest
enough
for
daily
living
when
she
come
to
live
in
married
living
.
she
come
very
quickly
to
be
very
certain
that
to
she
then
she
be
one
live
in
she
be
which
be
one
be
complete
in
honest
living
and
she
be
soon
then
come
to
be
attack
in
all
her
live
with
this
thing
.
Mr.
Dehning
as
I
be
say
be
one
have
completely
in
he
for
he
the
reputation
of
be
one
really
completely
honest
enough
for
any
daily
living
.
Mrs.
Dehning
be
one
honest
enough
for
any
daily
living
,
and
she
have
feeling
of
dehne
family
live
have
a
reputation
for
this
thing
but
the
kind
of
reputation
she
be
always
feel
they
be
have
be
the
kind
one
come
to
be
have
when
one
be
a
dead
one
,
when
one
be
not
any
long
in
living
,
she
be
really
in
live
quite
completely
an
honest
one
.
each
one
then
of
the
four
of
they
Mr.
Dehning
,
Alfred
Hersland
,
Julia
Hersland
and
Mrs.
Dehning
have
a
different
feeling
in
their
have
reputation
of
be
an
honest
enough
one
for
live
.
this
be
then
what
be
happen
.
Mr.
Dehning
have
come
quite
slowly
to
be
certain
that
Alfred
Hersland
be
completely
not
an
honest
enough
man
for
any
honest
enough
daily
living
.
Mr.
Dehning
have
come
quite
slowly
enough
to
be
certain
of
this
thing
.
he
have
as
I
be
saying
never
be
really
certain
that
Alfred
Hersland
be
really
for
he
in
dehne
family
living
and
then
he
be
certain
enough
of
this
thing
to
be
pretty
nearly
completely
listen
to
Alfred
Hersland
tell
about
anything
if
need
to
be
do
to
be
really
live
in
daily
living
and
then
he
be
still
not
quite
entirely
completely
listen
and
he
be
already
then
give
Alfred
Hersland
what
Alfred
Hersland
be
need
to
be
begin
to
be
live
in
daily
live
to
be
begin
to
be
live
to
be
one
succeed
in
living
,
Mr.
Dehning
then
certainly
come
to
be
certain
that
Alfred
Hersland
be
not
honest
enough
for
any
daily
living
and
Alfred
Hersland
be
quite
certain
then
that
Mr.
Dehning
be
completely
in
he
certain
of
this
thing
.
Mr.
Dehning
do
not
see
Alfred
Hersland
any
more
at
all
then
to
speak
at
all
to
he
in
any
daily
living
.
Mr.
Dehning
be
certainly
certain
that
he
could
convince
any
one
that
certainly
Alfred
Hersland
be
not
honest
for
any
daily
living
.
Mr.
Dehning
could
certainly
convince
almost
any
one
of
this
thing
.
Mr.
Dehning
do
certainly
not
just
then
begin
anything
to
convince
any
one
of
this
thing
.




Julia
Hersland
come
very
quickly
to
be
really
certain
that
Alfred
Hersland
be
not
an
honest
one
for
any
daily
living
and
as
I
be
say
she
be
one
have
then
certainly
complete
courage
for
be
one
go
on
be
live
.
she
know
then
as
be
in
she
that
she
be
one
be
honest
always
in
be
one
be
live
,
have
courage
always
for
be
one
go
to
be
go
on
be
live
.
she
be
always
then
need
to
be
one
go
to
be
learn
everything
.
this
have
be
then
a
complete
description
.
she
be
quickly
certain
that
Alfred
Hersland
be
not
honest
for
any
daily
living
.
this
then
be
then
for
Alfred
Hersland
not
a
serious
thing
,
this
be
then
not
in
he
then
as
important
in
he
,
as
be
live
then
in
he
as
be
really
something
really
exciting
.
as
I
be
say
in
a
way
Julia
Hersland
be
not
an
interesting
one
in
be
live
.
she
be
an
interesting
one
in
be
live
to
some
,
that
will
be
again
more
history
of
she
.




Mrs.
Dehning
be
certainly
not
certain
from
any
being
in
she
that
Alfred
Hersland
be
not
honest
enough
for
any
daily
living
.
she
could
and
do
come
to
be
quite
certain
of
this
thing
.
as
I
say
of
she
she
be
completely
an
honest
one
in
be
one
be
live
.
as
I
be
say
she
be
feel
reputation
as
be
as
if
some
one
be
already
a
dead
one
.
as
I
be
say
she
be
one
mostly
attack
harshly
in
living
but
not
for
any
winning
.
as
I
be
say
she
have
sense
for
living
.
as
I
be
say
she
be
always
be
in
her
stupid
be
in
be
one
feel
anything
.
so
then
she
be
not
certain
from
any
being
in
she
be
there
to
she
in
she
that
Alfred
Hersland
be
not
honest
enough
for
any
daily
living
.
she
certainly
come
to
be
certain
of
this
thing
.
so
then
she
be
go
on
talk
to
Allred
Hersland
for
quite
a
long
time
in
daily
living
and
then
it
come
that
to
hear
he
or
to
see
he
or
to
know
of
he
make
she
completely
then
a
nervous
one
.




I
will
be
tell
about
feel
be
in
George
Dehning
and
Hortense
dehne
in
the
history
of
David
Hersland
that
will
certainly
sometime
be
write
.




I
have
give
a
description
of
Alfred
Hersland
and
Julia
Hersland
not
succeed
in
married

not
fail
in
living
,
he
be
fairly
succeed
,
later
when
he
be
work
with
some
other
man
.




this
be
to
be
now
more
history
of
married
living

quite
a
weak
little
one
and
about
this
one
it
be
not
quite
certain
although
Mrs.
Dehning
be
pretty
nearly
certain
that
he
be
quite
a
good
deal
like
the
father
of
he
.
this
one
be
quite
a
weak
little
one
in
commence
but
he
come
to
be
quite
a
strong
enough
little
one
a
little
later
in
his
living
.
he
be
certainly
a
good
deal
like
the
father
of
he
,
Mrs.
Dehning
often
say
this
about
he
but
he
have
it
a
little
in
he
to
be
like
his
young
uncle
George
Dehning
.
Mrs.
Dehning
do
not
say
this
very
often
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Hersland
then
be
live
then
marry
living
as
I
be
say
.




the
Herslands
Alfred
and
Julia
Hersland
do
not
go
on
be
in
married
living
.
it
be
a
natural
thing
as
I
be
say
that
they
should
not
be
succeed
in
married
living
,
the
two
of
they
.
as
I
be
say
Alfred
Hersland
come
later
to
love
another
.
Julia
Hersland
too
come
later
to
love
another
.
each
one
of
they
as
I
be
say
be
not
succeed
be
not
fail
really
in
living
.
I
can
feel
myself
in
myself
go
to
be
be
an
old
one
.
I
can
feel
be
in
some
go
to
be
old
one
in
the
living
of
these
and
I
can
not
feel
be
in
some
when
these
be
go
to
be
begin
to
be
old
one
.
I
can
certainly
more
and
more
feel
old
be
go
to
be
in
man
and
in
woman
in
each
one
.
I
be
begin
a
little
to
feel
young
be
having
be
,
very
young
be
having
be
in
each
one
in
all
woman
and
all
man
.
I
certainly
can
feel
be
old
one
in
a
good
many
now
when
I
be
feel
be
in
they
.
I
like
to
be
feel
they
be
old
one
in
every
little
thing
in
every
piece
of
be
in
they
.
I
can
not
so
well
feel
be
in
they
having
be
very
young
in
they
.
I
be
a
little
beginning
to
feel
this
thing
,
I
be
just
commence
then
in
really
feel
this
thing
.
I
be
feel
again
and
again
in
myself
go
to
be
an
old
one
.
I
do
not
like
this
thing
,
I
certainly
do
like
this
thing
.
I
certainly
do
like
end
be
in
all
man
and
in
all
woman
.
I
certainly
do
not
at
all
like
this
thing
.
I
certainly
have
completely
a
queer
disturb
mix
with
sombre
feeling
in
this
thing
.
I
certainly
do
really
completely
need
feel
certainly
this
thing
in
every
one
that
each
one
be
sometime
end
in
be
live
.
Alfred
Hersland
and
Julia
Hersland
go
on
then
for
sometime
be
live
.
sometime
then
they
go
on
be
live
in
married
living
with
each
other
and
then
they
be
not
and
then
they
have
more
living
in
they
and
then
one
and
then
the
other
one
be
end
in
be
live
.
this
be
then
to
be
all
history
of
they
.
I
will
be
go
on
to
the
ending
in
all
description
of
every
one
,
of
any
one
.
how
can
anything
be
different
from
what
it
be
.
I
do
not
know
any
such
a
thing
.
very
many
be
know
this
.
I
be
not
know
this
thing
.




I
be
not
know
anything
be
different
from
what
it
be
.
very
many
be
know
everything
be
different
from
what
it
be
.
once
this
be
to
I
an
astonishing
thing
.
now
it
be
not
to
I
at
all
an
astonishing
thing
.




I
be
think
now
about
everything
be
what
it
be
,
everything
not
be
what
it
be
,
something
be
what
it
be
,
nothing
be
what
it
be
,
something
not
be
what
it
be
to
some
,
I
be
think
of
this
thing
and
I
be
think
about
sense
for
live
in
man
and
woman
.




I
would
like
to
be
think
about
some
be
practical
in
their
being
and
some
not
be
that
thing
in
their
being
but
I
be
not
just
now
feel
any
understanding
of
this
thing
and
so
I
be
not
think
about
this
thing
.
I
have
be
expect
some
time
to
be
soon
think
about
this
thing
.
I
be
not
as
I
have
just
be
say
think
now
about
this
thing
.
I
be
think
now
as
I
have
be
say
about
something
be
what
it
be
,
not
be
what
it
be
to
some
man
and
some
woman
.
I
be
think
about
every
one
have
it
or
not
have
it
that
something
that
everything
be
what
it
be
,
not
what
it
be
to
they
each
one
of
they
,
that
nothing
be
what
it
be
,
to
some
one
.
I
be
too
think
and
go
soon
now
to
be
tell
very
much
about
sense
for
live
in
man
and
woman
.




those
in
Dehning
daily
living
,
those
in
Hersland
daily
live
each
one
of
they
come
to
know
some
man
and
woman
,
in
be
one
be
live
.
each
one
any
one
have
live
being
have
some
sense
for
living
or
have
not
any
sense
for
live
pretty
nearly
not
any
sense
for
living
.
this
be
to
be
now
some
description
of
sense
for
live
in
man
and
woman
.




some
have
sense
for
live
from
have
realisation
in
they
that
each
thing
they
be
know
be
such
a
thing
as
it
be
to
they
and
really
know
this
in
they
.
each
thing
have
then
to
some
of
such
of
they
the
value
that
thing
have
really
for
any
one
need
that
thing
for
be
one
go
on
live
.
some
be
know
in
they
that
each
thing
they
be
know
in
live
be
the
thing
that
thing
really
be
be
but
they
be
not
feel
that
thing
as
really
value
to
any
one
for
any
one
to
be
go
on
live
.

I
will
be

from
I
in
I
so
that
I
shall
be
soon
tell
all
this
thing
.
I
will
now
go
on
put
everything
a
little
more
away
from
I
in
I
so
that
I
certainly
will
not

I
certainly
can
be
tell
something
.
I
certainly
can
be
tell
this
thing
.




I
be
like
to
be
think
about
sense
for
live
be
in
some
of
each
kind
there
be
in
man
and
in
woman
.
I
be
like
to
be
think
about
make
kind
of
they
in
man
and
woman
in
relation
to
sense
for
live
be
in
they
.
I
be
like
then
as
I
be
say
just
now
to
certainly
be
put
everything
away
so
that
now
I
be
think
kind
this
way
in
man
and
in
woman
.




do
I
know
everything
of
have
sense
in
be
live
,
well
,
I
do
not
think
I
do
,
I
do
not
know
know
everything
about
have
sense
for
living
.
I
have
say
something
about
have
sense
for
living
.
I
be
go
to
be
say
something
about
have
sense
for
living
.
I
have
just
be
be
see
one
certainly
having
have
and
have
and
perhaps
go
to
be
have
sense
for
living
.
it
be
interesting
to
I
to
be
see
this
one
.
I
see
one
have
sense
for
living
but
this
one
be
one
have
sense
for
each
little
piece
of
living
and
this
never
make
in
this
one
sense
for
all
the
living
in
this
one
.
this
one
have
so
much
sense
for
each
little
piece
of
live
this
one
be
do
that
it
be
astonishing
.
this
one
have
not
really
sense
for
live
for
big
piece
of
live
in
he
.
I
see
another
one
and
this
one
have
not
have
much
sense
for
living
but
this
one
have
not
then
at
all
really
need
this
thing
,
this
one
then
have
sense
for
living
and
then
it
be
sense
like
a
good
many
have
it
in
they
a
dull
thing
in
this
one
as
be
like
a
really
married
one
and
then
this
one
have
more
sense
for
living
and
be
a
very
careful
one
and
then
this
one
come
very
early
in
she
live
to
be
a
really
dead
one
and
not
any
one
be
then
remember
love
this
one
as
much
as
one
would
have
think
from
all
the
being
in
this
one
many
would
be
remember
love
this
one
.




I
be
think
now
again
of
three
having
really
succeed
in
living
,
really
sense
for
live
in
they
and
these
have
it
for
a
whole
live
in
they
and
these
do
not
have
it
that
they
be
really
learn
in
be
one
go
on
live
,
these
have
it
in
they
that
at
one
time
they
be
realise
completely
succeed
in
living
and
they
be
then
really
completely
succeed
in
living
,
and
then
they
be
realise
completely
succeed
in
living
and
there
be
more
see
they
and
they
have
more
of
a
building
in
which
they
be
then
live
and
they
be
then
completely
succeed
in
living
,
and
then
they
be
realise
again
succeed
in
living
and
then
they
have
more
again
to
see
they
and
they
have
again
a
big
building
in
which
they
be
then
and
they
be
then
again
completely
succeed
in
living
and
not
any
at
all
be
they
learn
anything
from
having
be
at
all
in
any
living
and
so
on
and
so
on
and
these
then
be
the
most
wonderfully
succeed
one
in
living
and
always
they
have
not
it
at
all
in
they
to
be
learn
at
all
anything
in
be
be
live
.
these
then
be
man
and
woman
succeed
in
living
,
have
sense
for
living
,
certainly
sense
for
win
,
not
any
sense
for
learn
from
having
be
one
be
live
,
not
really
sense
for
feel
be
live
,
certainly
some
sense
for
feel
be
win
,
certainly
sense
for
have
work
under
they
not
any
one
go
to
be
win
,
not
have
any
sense
for
trust
any
one
work
for
they
,
really
sense
for
win
in
living
,
really
sense
for
always
win
a
big
living
,
always
change
to
win
a
big
living
,
always
not
learn
anything
from
be
one
be
live
,
always
then
succeed
for
living
.
I
be
see
three
of
they
.
one
of
they
be
be
one
make
a
big
business
of
something
,
one
of
these
be
make
a
to
be
always
large
to
be
for
he
to
be
in
,
one
of
these
be
one
everybody
be
know
in
every
country
now
that
that
one
be
one
be
live
.




some
as
I
be
say
have
really
sense
for
living
,
there
be
as
many
way
of
have
this
thing
as
there
be
kind
in
man
and
woman
and
I
have
certainly
be
say
that
there
be
quite
a
very
great
many
kind
in
man
and
woman
.




some
be
say
that
they
have
it
that
they
can
by
remember
be
certain
that
each
one
they
be
know
be
sometime
young
one
.
some
be
certain
that
each
one
they
be
know
be
get
to
be
very
old
one
.
some
be
certain
that
each
one
they
be
know
be
not
change
,
they
be
not
very
much
young
one
,
they
be
not
come
now
to
be
very
much
old
one
.
there
be
different
way
of
feel
oneself
and
other
one
as
to
any
one
come
to
be
old
,
having
be
young
one
.
this
and
have
sense
for
living
be
to
I
just
now
very
interesting
.




every
one
be
a
young
one
,
having
be
a
young
one
,
be
an
old
one
,
having
be
an
old
one
,
be
an
old
one
and
having
be
and
go
on
be
an
old
one
,
having
be
and
go
on
be
a
young
one
,
having
be
one
not
an
old
one
not
a
young
one
and
go
on
be
not
a
young
one
not
an
old
one
be
to
I
very
interesting
.
I
can
not
really
get
away
from
this
thing
as
be
everything
there
be
in
any
one
be
one
be
live
.
I
really
can
not
get
myself
away
from
this
thing
.
this
be
any
one
be
live
.




I
really
be
think
that
every
one
be
live
in
be
in
some
way
one
have
sense
for
living
,
in
be
in
some
way
one
be
one
go
on
be
live
.
some
have
come
to
be
not
any
long
live
one
.
perhaps
each
one
ever
live
will
be
come
sometime
to
be
not
any
long
one
be
go
on
live
.
perhaps
each
one
sometime
be
not
any
long
one
be
in
live
.
I
be
certainly
repeat
this
thing
which
be
to
I
something
I
be
certainly
think
be
perhaps
be
in
every
one
.
some
be
change
the
size
in
be
in
they
in
the
living
in
they
.
I
be
see
some
do
this
thing
in
be
one
go
on
be
in
live
.
I
like
see
every
one
and
then
I
very
much
do
not
like
at
all
see
every
one
.
some
have
change
in
size
in
they
inside
they
in
be
in
they
,
some
be
not
change
in
the
size
in
they
in
the
being
of
they
inside
they
.
there
be
one
she
have
be
change
the
size
in
be
inside
she
in
living
and
this
one
be
not
a
young
one
be
not
an
old
one
.
there
be
one
and
this
one
be
almost
an
old
one
be
change
the
size
in
she
in
being
and
this
one
be
really
a
fat
one
and
be
now
quite
entirely
a
thing
one
,
this
one
then
be
one
change
be
in
this
one
and
this
one
be
really
not
a
fat
thin
one
but
really
then
a
really
thin
one
and
then
this
one
be
quite
dull
then
to
any
one
listen
to
be
in
that
one
.
and
some
one
be
a
thin
one
,
that
one
be
not
a
young
one
not
an
old
one
and
this
one
be
a
funny
one
in
be
one
be
in
be
in
he
a
fat
one
.




I
certainly
pretty
nearly
like
be
in
each
one
.
I
do
not
like
listen
too
many
day
one
after
the
other
to
some
.
I
be
now
do
this
thing
.
I
will
then
know
something
.
each
one
always
be
repeat
.
this
be
certain
that
each
one
always
be
repeat
all
the
being
in
that
one
.
this
sometimes
be
quite
a
dull
thing
for
I
when
I
be
listen
,
not
that
each
one
be
repeat
all
the
being
in
they
that
be
never
to
I
a
dull
thing
but
the
thing
they
be
repeat
can
be
to
I
quite
a
dull
thing
.




I
be
still
not
tell
all
I
know
about
sense
for
living
.
perhaps
I
be
not
yet
quite
ready
to
be
tell
everything
about
this
thing
.
this
then
be
go
to
commence
again
be
the
history
of
every
one
and
among
they
of
the
Herslands
and
the
dehning
.




sense
for
succeed
in
living
,
sense
for
feel
be
in
living
,
sense
for
be
one
go
to
be
go
on
be
live
,
these
three
be
different
thing
,
quite
entirely
different
thing
and
some
have
one
have
the
other
,
some
have
almost
none
of
any
of
they
,
some
have
some
of
one
of
they
,
I
be
think
just
now
of
one
have
some
sense
for
succeed
in
living
,
some
sense
for
feel
be
one
be
live
,
not
any
sense
for
be
one
go
to
be
go
on
be
live
.
this
be
one
and
I
be
feel
this
one
.
some
will
be
remember
this
one
,
some
will
not
be
remember
this
one
.
I
be
feel
this
one
.
this
one
be
one
certainly
have
some
sense
for
succeed
in
living
,
be
one
having
certainly
really
sense
for
be
one
feeling
be
live

be
one
having
certainly
having
certainly
never
be
have
any
not
any
sense
for
be
one
go
to
be
go
on
be
live
.
Mrs.
Hersland

Mrs.
Alfred
Hersland
be
one
have
as
I
be
say
sense
for
be
one
go
to
be
go
on
be
live

quite
different
from

be
just
now
describe
.




this
one
I
be
just
now
describe
,
this
one
I
be
just
now
really
feel
be

then
really
have
sense
for
really
succeed
in
living
,
be
one
have
sense
for
really
feel
that
that
one
be
really
be
in
living
,
be
one
be
really
in
living
,
be
one
not
ever
having
be
be
one
go
on
be
live
.
as
I
be
say
any
one
will
not
then
when
this
one
be
not
any
long
be
in
living
,
will
not
be
remember
really
this
one
having
be
be
in
live
.
this
description
then
be
a
description
of
this
one
.
this
one
then
be
one
really
feel
be
in
living
,
really
this
one
be
really
be
this
,
this
thing
,
be
one
really
feel
be
in
living
,
really
feel
all
the
be
this
one
be
be
in
be
live
,
this
one
then
really
be
quite
entirely
in
the
living
this
one
have
in
be
one
be
live
,
feeling
of
all
be
this
one
be
in
be
live
.
be
I
really
then
say
this
thing
that
I
be
now
feel
in
the
being
be
in
this
one
,
that
this
one
be
and
in
a
way
it
be
sometimes
quite
a
completely
bubble
thing
that
this
one
have
sense
for
some
succeed
in
be
one
be
live
,
it
be
sometimes
quite
very
often
entirely
a
thing
that
any
one
really
could
be
remember
that
this
one
be
really
perhaps
have
quite
sense
enough
for
succeed
in
living
and
this
one
certainly
be
then
feel
all
the
be
this
one
be
in
be
one
be
live
.
this
one
be
then
as
I
be
say
not
really
at
all
like
,
quite
different
then
from
the
being
in
Julia
Hersland
.
I
will
tell
now
more
about
both
of
they
.




this
one
be
then
one
I
be
now
know
completely
in
be
one
,
I
be
be
that
one
,
completely
realise
the
being
in
this
one
.
I
really
do
not
think
I
would
be
so
soon
do
this
thing
,
realise
be
in
this
one
,
and
then
I
be
,
I
be
realise
the
being
in
this
one
and
I
like
realise
the
being
in
this
one
,
and
I
will
be
remember
this
one
although
I
be
not
sure
that
I
can
be
certain
to
be
really
realise
remember
this
one
.
I
will
though
certainty
be
remember
this
one
,
yes
I
will
be
remember
this
one
,
really
I
be
certain
of
this
thing
,
I
certainly
will
be
remember
this
one
,
I
be
certain
of
this
thing
.




I
be
feel
now
in
every
one
the
sense
for
be
one
be
in
live
that
each
one
have
in
they
and
the
way
each
one
have
that
sense
in
they
and
the
way
each
one
be
begin
be
one
be
one
succeed
be
one
not
succeed
in
everything
,
be
one
begin
and
go
on
and
end
in
be
one
be
live
.




I
be
feel
very
much
sense
for
live
in
man
and
in
woman
,
in
every
one
I
be
see
do
be
in
living
,
be
one
go
on
be
live
,
I
be
feel
very
much
this
thing
when
I
be
see
one
be
a
young
one
,
when
I
be
see
some
one
be
not
a
very
young
one
,
when
I
be
see
somebody
who
be
quite
certainly
not
a
young
one
,
when
I
be
see
any
one
.




very
many
have
be
here
live
and
talking
and
some
of
they
have
be
very
much
love
some
one
,
and
all
of
they
have
it
in
they
to
have
some
sense
in
be
one
be
live
.
some
of
they
be
not
very
interesting
to
very
many
know
they
in
be
in
the
way
that
one
be
one
have
some
sense
in
be
one
be
live
.
very
many
have
then
be
here
and
be
live
and
be
have
each
one
some
sense
for
living
and
some
of
they
be
quite
successful
one
in
be
live
and
very
many
of
they
be
quite
enough
successful
in
be
live
to
be
go
on
be
those
be
live
in
be
live
.
very
many
then
be
here
and
have
it
in
they
very
many
of
they
to
have
some
sense
in
be
one
be
live
and
very
many
of
they
be
succeed
in
live
so
that
until
their
ending
they
be
those
be
those
go
on
be
live
.
there
be
then
very
many
here
and
mostly
each
one
of
they
of
these
that
be
here
have
it
in
they
to
have
in
they
some
sense
in
be
one
be
live
and
very
many
of
they
be
succeed
in
be
live
,
be
succeed
in
live
so
that
each
one
of
they
of
these
be
those
go
on
be
live
until
there
be
naturally
a
complete
end
to
be
in
they
.
there
be
a
number
here
,
some
of
they
have
be
love
some
one
quite
a
good
deal
in
be
one
have
some
sense
in
be
live
,
in
be
one
be
live
,
in
be
one
succeed
well
enough
in
be
live
to
be
go
on
be
one
be
live
.
there
be
then
often
very
many
here
and
each
one
of
they
,
that
be
certainly
quite
a
number
of
they
,
some
perhaps
not
and
I
be
not
just
now
tell
about
they
,
mostly
then
very
many
of
they
have
it
in
they
to
have
some
sense
in
they
in
be
one
be
live
,
some
of
they
as
I
be
say
quite
a
good
deal
sometimes
be
love
some
one
,
quite
a
number
of
they
as
I
be
say
be
succeed
well
enough
in
be
live
to
be
of
they
and
there
be
very
many
of
they
always
live
a
very
great
many
of
they
always
be
live
who
have
it
to
be
succeed
enough
in
be
live
to
be
of
they
those
who
be
go
to
go
on
be
in
live
until
they
be
not
any
long
be
live
.
this
be
then
sense
in
be
live
in
very
many
who
be
here
very
often
,
this
be
the
way
they
have
sense
in
be
live
in
they
.
as
I
be
say
Julia
Hersland
and
Alfred
Hersland
be
not
such
a
man
and
such
a
woman
.
no
they
be
not
really
of
such
of
they
,
they
be
really
of
such
of
they
they
do
go
on
be
live
,
they
be
not
of
such
of
they
,
in
a
way
they
do
not
go
on
be
live
,
they
be
as
I
be
say
a
little
differently
in
they
each
one
of
they
from
the
other
one
of
they
as
to
sense
for
living
.
as
I
be
say
Julia
Hersland
have
not
really
sense
for
be
one
be
live
,
as
I
be
say
she
have
strength
for
be
one
go
on
be
live
,
as
I
be
say
Alfred
Hersland
be
one
have
some
little
sense
for
be
one
be
live
,
as
I
be
say
he
be
not
ever
really
very
much
live
in
this
thing
in
the
sense
for
be
one
be
live
that
there
be
a
little
in
he
.
as
I
be
say
they
be
both
of
they
nearly
succeed
,
nearly
altogether
fail
in
be
those
be
in
live
.
I
be
not
yet
certain
that
I
be
finish
with
general
tell
about
sense
for
be
in
live
in
man
and
woman
.
I
be
almost
certain
that
I
be
now
really
interested
in
this
thing
.
there
be
then
very
many
here
,
who
have
it
in
they
to
have
some
sense
in
they
in
be
one
be
live
,
some
of
such
of
they
quite
often
be
really
love
some
one
,
very
many
of
they
be
succeed
in
be
one
be
live
well
enough
to
be
one
go
on
in
be
one
be
live
.




there
be
to
-
night
eight
of
they
and
each
one
of
they
have
in
they
some
way
of
not
have
any
sense
for
live
at
all
in
they
.
there
be
eight
of
they
and
each
of
they
have
very
much
of
not
any
of
some
kind
of
sense
for
live
in
they
.
I
be
tell
one
of
they
this
thing
in
tell
this
one
how
he
have
sense
for
live
so
that
he
would
be
completely
succeed
in
be
one
be
live
.
this
one
have
sense
for
live
in
be
one
be
quite
certain
from
experience
that
in
be
live
he
could
be
one
succeed
in
living
,
be
one
have
some
feeling
for
be
one
be
live
.
he
be
then
one
have
certainly
in
he
from
experience
in
be
one
be
live
a
realisation
that
in
be
one
be
live
one
can
be
one
succeed
in
living
.
this
one
have
not
be
in
live
very
penetratingly
make
any
other
one
feel
this
thing
,
this
one
have
certainly
quite
entirely
learn
to
be
realise
that
he
could
be
succeed
in
be
one
be
in
live
.
this
one
be
then
one
having
really
sense
for
be
live
.
this
one
be
one
have
it
in
he
to
certainly
be
succeed
quite
some
in
living
.
this
be
one
then
have
it
in
he
to
be
realise
that
he
can
be
,
that
he
will
very
likely
be
succeed
some
in
living
.
he
be
one
as
I
be
say
have
other
people
know
this
thing
with
he
but
then
it
be
not
an
exciting
thing
,
really
not
to
he
,
really
not
to
any
one
,
he
have
be
learn
this
thing
,
he
have
always
be
quite
certain
that
he
be
work
,
he
be
certainly
one
always
having
be
quite
like
to
be
where
he
would
be
when
he
could
be
learn
to
be
really
realise
that
he
be
certainly
to
be
one
succeed
some
in
be
live
.
I
be
tell
this
one
then
that
this
one
really
have
sense
for
live
in
he
.
it
be
not
at
all
an
exciting
thing
tell
this
to
he
.
I
tell
it
to
he
and
always
then
I
be
certain
that
that
he
have
some
sense
for
living
be
not
at
all
a
thing
to
give
to
he
to
give
to
any
one
enough
excitement
so
that
any
one
could
go
on
tell
he
this
thing
,
tell
he
that
he
have
sense
really
for
live
.




as
I
be
say
there
be
eight
of
they
and
each
one
of
they
have
it
in
they
to
have
in
they
in
a
way
not
any
sense
for
living
,
and
I
have
tell
about
one
of
these
eight
of
they
that
she
have
not
any
sense
for
be
one
go
to
be
go
on
be
one
be
live
.
this
one
then
be
a
dead
one
and
then
this
one
be
move
a
little
then
but
then
that
be
not
really
a
disturbing
thing
,
no
not
to
I
even
,
now
when
I
be
not
any
long
a
quite
young
one
.




there
be
then
eight
of
they
and
one
of
they
have
really
not
really
at
all
any
sense
for
be
one
be
live
,
not
any
sense
at
all
really
for
be
one
ever
have
,
ever
be
,
ever
go
to
be
live
.
this
one
then
certainly
never
have
be
have
,
never
would
have
be
have
,
never
should
have
be
have
any
sense
at
all
in
be
one
be
live
.
this
one
be
one
really
in
a
way
not
fail
in
living
,
this
one
be
one
to
whom
in
a
way
one
would
be
listen
and
then
this
one
be
a
completely
one
not
having
ever
be
have
any
sense
in
be
one
be
live
and
then
not
any
one
be
listen
to
this
one
.
it
would
have
be
an
astonishing
thing
that
any
one
could
be
have
not
any
sense
for
live
as

.
this
one
really
be

be
beautifully
astonishing
.
I
know
this
one
.




there
be
then
eight
of
they
.
one
be
one
have
sense
for
live
in
be
one
not

a
foolish
one
,

a
stupid
one
that
be
a
quite
funny
thing
when
one
be
know
this
one
.




there
be
as
I
be
say
eight
of
they
have
in
they
each
one
of
they
some
way
of
not
have
any
sense
in
be
live
in
they
.
one
of
they
be
one
have
sense
for
be
live
in
he
enough
so
that
he
never
come
to
have
responsibility
which
would
crush
he
.
he
could
have
be
quite
certainly
a
worried
one
but
really
in
his
living
he
be
one
who
be
almost
not
at
all
a
worried
one
.
he
have
then
sense
for
live
in
having
be
in
all
live
certain
to
be
one
who
would
have
be
a
worried
one
if
he
have
not
be
one
not
become
a
worried
one
.
he
be
one
then
have
sense
for
living
,
in
be
one
feeling
be
live
enough
to
have
sense
for
live
so
that
he
do
not
in
live
by
try
for
all
living
become
a
worried
one
.
he
be
quite
entirely
a
really
nice
one
this
one
and
he
have
sense
for
live
to
the
really
live
everything
any
one
could
need
from
he
.
he
be
certainly
quite
entirely
a
complete
one
,
a
very
nice
one
,
a
one
not
having
come
to
be
a
married
one
,
and
he
have
sense
for
be
one
be
live
not
having
come
to
be
a
married
one
,
he
be
one
not
have
sense
for
live
in
be
one
not
need
to
have
be
come
to
be
a
married
one
.
I
can
not
help
mention
it
again
that
he
be
really
a
very
nice
one
to
have
be
go
on
and
not
be
a
worried
one
and
be
a
live
one
,
a
very
nice
one
with
sense
for
living
,
with
not
sense
for
living
.
there
be
another
one
then
the
sixth
one
have
so
much
sense
for
living
and
so
little
sense
for
live
that
it
be
a
sweet
delight
in
this
one
this
thing
to
every
one
,
no
really
not
to
every
one
,
I
can
not
really
say
it
be
a
sweet
delight
this
in
this
one
to
every
one
,
it
be
such
a
thing
certainly
to
some
.
there
be
another
one
having
certainly
sense
in
living
and
certainly
this
one
would
be
have
a
good
deal
of
sense
for
any
living
if
this
one
in
tell
about
sense
for
living
be
not
then
forget
to
be
live
in
have
sense
for
living
.
this
be
enough
about
this
one
.
there
be
another
one
and
that
one
then
make
complete
the
eight
of
they
and
this
one
have
sense
for
living
and
this
one
be
as
big
as
all
the
world
will
be
when
it
be
a
complete
one
,
in
begin
feeling
and
this
one
be
then
complete
the
world
then
be
all
in
he
and
this
one
then
be
then
really
inside
he
be
then
have
really
completely
sense
in
be
live
and
this
one
then
do
not

complete
the
world

make
of
it
a
complete
one
and
this
one

have
still
sense
for
be
live
,

one
then
have
not

in
be
one

be
married
one
,
of
other
one
be
married
one
.




I
be
think
about
some
who
be
live
.
some
of
these
be
married
one
in
living
.
some
of
these
be
not
married
one
in
living
.
I
be
think
about
some
who
be
live
.
some
of
these
certainly
have
not
be
ever
married
one
in
living
,
some
of
these
have
certainly
sometime
be
marry
one
in
their
living
,
some
of
these
certainly
have
be
sometimes
marry
one
in
living
.
I
be
think
about
some
who
be
live
.
I
be
think
about
a
good
many
who
be
live
.
some
who
be
live
be
go
on
be
live
,
some
who
be
live
be
not
go
to
be
go
on
be
live
.
I
be
think
about
a
very
great
many
who
be
live
,
some
of
these
be
like
very
well
be
in
living
,
some
be
not
really
like
it
that
they
be
be
in
live
.
I
be
then
think
very
much
about
a
great
many
who
be
live
.
some
of
these
as
I
have
be
say
have
in
a
way
sense
in
be
in
living
,
some
of
these
as
I
have
be
say
have
in
a
way
not
sense
really
for
be
in
be
live
.
some
of
these
as
I
have
be
say
be
live
just
now
and
I
be
know
they
just
now
when
they
be
do
this
living
,
some
of
they
be
certainly
live
just
now
and
I
be
not
know
they
just
now
do
their
living
.
I
be
then
certainly
just
now
think
about
very
many
man
and
very
many
woman
be
live
.
some
as
I
be
say
,
some
man
and
woman
be
married
one
in
living
and
some
be
not
married
one
in
living
.
some
as
I
be
say
be
married
one
again
and
again
in
their
living
,
some
as
I
be
say
be
not
at
all
ever
married
one
in
their
living
.
some
then
certainly
be
sometimes
married
one
in
their
living
.
be
a
married
one
be
an
interesting
thing
to
I
I
be
certain
.
be
married
one
be
an
interesting
thing
to
some
,
be
not
a
very
interesting
thing
to
some
.
be
a
married
one
be
an
interesting
thing
sometime
to
some
one
and
be
not
an
interesting
thing
sometime
to
that
one
.
be
a
married
one
be
more
be
less
an
interesting
thing
to
some
one
in
the
living
being
in
that
one
.
some
then
be
certainly
sometime
in
their
living
a
married
one
.
some
be
sometime
in
their
living
a
married
one
be
sometime
find
that
thing
an
interesting
thing
in
they
to
they
.
in
a
way
be
a
married
one
be
an
interesting
thing
to
Alfred
Hersland
in
a
way
it
be
not
an
interesting
thing
to
he
.
be
a
married
one
be
in
a
way
a
very
interesting
thing
to
Julia
Hersland
,
in
a
way
it
be
not
a
very
interesting
thing
to
Julia
Hersland
.




I
be
think
just
now
certainly
think
just
now
about
some
man
,
about
some
woman
.
I
certainly
be
just
now
think
about
man
and
about
woman
.
I
certainly
be
just
now
think
about
some
man
,
I
certainly
be
just
now
think
about
some
woman
.
I
be
not
certain
that
I
can
not
very
soon
have
finish
write
a
complete
history
of
all
man
and
all
woman
.
this
be
a
new
feeling
for
I
to
have
in
I
.
this
be
a
new
thing
to
be
inside
I
,
this
that
I
be
not
certain
that
I
will
not
have
very
soon
now
have
bring
to
a
completion
all
the
history
of
all
man
and
all
woman
so
completely
that
not
any
more
ever
can
be
as
a
new
thing
write
.
this
be
a
new
feeling
to
have
in
I
.
I
be
not
really
certain
I
be
go
to
be
like
to
have
this
as
a
thing
to
be
completely
in
I
.
perhaps
I
will
be
certain
I
be
know
completely
everything
of
be
in
man
and
in
woman
.
it
would
be
an
exciting
thing
to
be
certain
really
of
this
thing
having
have
the
complete
history
of
every
one
already
finish
in
writing
.
I
will
not
be
have
it
as
certain
this
thing
,
I
will
go
on
be
one
every
day
tell
about
be
be
in
man
and
in
woman
.
certainly
I
will
be
go
on
be
one
tell
about
be
in
man
and
woman
.
I
be
go
on
be
such
a
one
.




I
be
wonder
whether
each
one
be
an
interesting
thing
in
be
one
be
live
.
I
be
wonder
about
this
thing
.




I
be
know
some
one
want
that
each
one
be
certain
that
everything
be
in
the
world
to
any
one
be
live
.
I
know
another
one
who
be
certain
that
not
very
many
thing
be
in
the
world
to
any
one
be
really
live
.
I
know
some
one
who
ask
question
always
about
these
thing
and
I
be
remember
the
word
that
one
be
use
in
ask
about
everything
in
ask
about
anything
.
that
one
be
wonder
whether
any
one
be
have
anything
in
be
one
be
really
live
.
I
be
wonder
whether
this
one
be
one
really
be
almost
now
a
quite
old
one
.
I
be
wonder
just
now
whether
I
be
not
already
really
understand
all
the
being
there
ever
can
be
in
any
man
and
any
woman
.
I
be
almost
be
certain
that
I
be
understand
all
be
ever
having
be
,
ever
be
,
ever
go
to
be
in
any
man
,
in
any
woman
.
I
be
almost
certain
I
be
understand
just
now
everything
about
be
in
man
and
woman
.




I
be
certain
I
do
not
know
completely
yet
all
the
detail
of
all
the
kind
there
be
of
man
and
woman
.
I
be
almost
certain
I
be
understand
just
now
all
there
be
of
be
in
man
and
in
woman
when
they
be
begin
,
when
they
be
in
middle
living
,
when
they
be
end
.




it
be
quite
certain
that
I
be
realise
just
now
be
be
in
all
man
and
in
all
woman
and
the
way
this
be
in
they
in
each
one
of
they
.
I
be
understand
just
now
very
much
and
I
be
not
just
now
tell
very
much
.
I
will
soon
now
certainly
be
tell
very
much
.
think
about
sense
in
be
in
live
in
man
and
woman
,
think
about
some
being
and
some
not
be
marry
one
in
be
live
have
be
to
I
a
thing
I
have
be
very
completely
enjoy
.
I
be
now
one
know
be
be
in
man
and
in
woman
.




I
be
think
about
some
being
and
some
be
not
married
one
in
be
live
,
I
be
think
about
some
be
completely
not
married
one
in
be
live
,
I
be
think
now
about
every
one
.
I
will
be
tell
just
now
about
be
be
in
every
one
.




it
be
a
funny
thing
to
I
,
a
peculiar
thing
that
each
one
be
not
know
that
living
be
what
be
certainly
in
they
and
each
other
one
be
one
be
one
have
it
in
they
that
they
be
one
be
live
.
I
know
that
each
one
very
often
be
really
forget
this
thing
that
one
be
one
have
it
that
that
one
be
one
have
be
live
as
be
and
that
every
other
one
each
one
be
one
have
be
in
they
of
be
one
be
live
.
mostly
every
one
be
sometime
forget
this
thing
about
that
one
,
about
every
one
.




and
so
then
I
be
know
everything
because
really
I
be
not
ever
forget
this
thing
that
I
be
one
be
one
have
live
in
being
and
that
every
one
be
have
it
in
that
one
that
that
one
be
have
live
be
in
be
that
one
.




I
be
then
one
in
a
way
certainly
one
know
everything
.
some
be
one
in
a
way
know
everything
.
some
be
one
not
in
a
way
know
everything
.
some
be
know
that
some
be
in
a
way
one
know
everything
.
some
be
never
feel
anything
about
any
one
know
everything
.
mostly
every
one
be
sometime
,
be
sometimes
feel
about
some
one
in
a
way
know
everything
.
Alfred
Hersland
be
the
one
then
Julia
Dehning
be
marry
.
she
marry
he
as
one
she
be
marry
.
he
be
one
be
one
she
be
marry
,
she
be
one
be
one
he
be
marry
and
each
one
of
they
be
the
one
the
other
one
be
marry
and
love
then
.
each
one
of
they
be
marry
the
other
one
need
that
one
then
and
love
that
one
then
.
each
one
of
they
then
marry
the
other
one
need
that
one
then
for
love
and
living
and
be
then
be
the
one
they
be
need
to
be
be
in
live
.




Julia
Dehning
marry
Alfred
Hersland
.
they
be
married
and
live
then
not
very
successfully
to
each
of
they
marry
living
.
it
be
certain
that
each
one
of
they
be
need
the
other
one
then
for
be
in
live
what
each
one
of
they
be
need
for
be
in
live
in
they
.
each
one
of
they
be
then
be
in
living
and
be
then
certain
to
be
need
be
in
live
.
each
one
of
they
be
succeed
be
fail
in
living
.
not
either
of
they
have
in
a
way
really
sense
for
live
in
be
live
.
each
one
of
they
in
a
way
would
be
certain
to
be
go
on
be
in
live
.
each
one
of
they
be
go
on
be
in
live
.




Julia
be
one
as
I
be
say
one
need
to
be
one
be
go
on
be
live
.
Julia
be
such
a
one
all
her
living
.
all
her
living
she
be
one
need
to
be
go
on
be
one
be
live
.
all
her
living
she
be
one
as
I
have
be
say
one
need
to
be
one
go
to
be
go
on
be
live
.
so
then
Julia
be
married
to
Alfred
Hersland
.
she
marry
he
and
be
love
he
and
be
certain
then
and
not
by
think
about
this
thing
that
she
be
one
go
to
be
go
on
be
live
.
this
be
be
in
she
then
.
this
be
always
be
in
she
all
her
living
.




Julia
Dehning
then
marry
one
she
be
need
then
for
the
being
in
she
that
be
be
one
who
be
need
to
be
certainly
always
go
on
go
to
be
live
.
this
be
be
in
she
and
she
be
then
not
think
about
this
thing
.
Alfred
Hersland
then
as
I
be
say
be
think
about
be
one
be
aspire
in
be
succeed
in
living
.
they
be
married
one
Julia
and
Alfred
Hersland
.
this
be
to
be
now
more
history
of
some
come
to
know
they
.




it
be
not
such
a
very
difficult
thing
go
on
be
live
as
it
seem
to
be
to
some
thinking
about
this
thing
about
go
on
be
live
.
it
be
quite
an
easy
thing
for
a
great
many
have
live
be
in
they
.
this
be
a
thing
to
surprise
some
that
really
this
thing
be
not
a
difficult
thing
.
to
some
it
be
quite
a
difficult
thing
be
one
go
on
be
live
.
to
very
many
,
for
very
many
it
be
not
at
all
a
very
difficult
,
to
quite
some
it
be
not
the
very
least
bit
a
really
difficult
thing
,
to
be
one
go
on
be
one
be
live
,
be
in
be
live
.




to
some
it
be
quite
a
surprising
thing
that
it
be
not
a
very
difficult
thing
to
very
many
,
be
one
go
on
in
be
one
be
in
living
.
Julia
Hersland
certainly
all
her
living
be
one
be
one
go
on
be
live
,
as
I
be
say
she
be
not
have
it
really
in
she
to
be
from
be
in
her
one
having
really
sense
in
be
to
herself
be
in
living
,
in
have
really
sense
for
live
from
be
in
she
,
from
having
be
in
live
all
her
living
.
she
be
one
certainly
though
go
to
be
all
her
living
go
on
be
live
.
she
be
one
really
not
from
be
in
she
be
one
succeed
in
living
,
succeed
in
be
live
to
she
inside
she
,
she
be
one
certainly
go
to
be
from
be
in
her
one
go
to
be
go
on
be
one
go
to
be
live
all
of
her
living
,
that
be
certain
.
when
she
be
end
she
would
come
of
course
to
be
one
not
any
long
be
in
living
but
that
would
be
simply
that
she
have
come
then
sometime
to
be
a
dead
one
,
not
that
she
have
ever
come
to
be
one
not
go
to
be
go
on
be
one
go
on
be
live
.
really
then
she
be
one
as
I
be
say
need
learn
anything
because
anything
could
be
feed
she
to
be
one
go
to
be
go
on
be
live
and
indeed
then
she
be
one
need
to
be
resist
really
learn
anything
to
be
at
all
change
attack
be
in
she
which
be
in
she
to
make
of
she
be
one
go
to
be
all
her
living
go
on
be
live
.
this
be
in
a
way
a
full
description
of
she
,
there
can
be
more
description
of
she
.
this
will
be
some
more
description
of
she
.




certainly
some
be
in
their
live
married
one
.
certainly
there
be
some
have
it
in
be
that
they
be
one
go
to
be
go
on
be
live
and
these
can
have
it
in
they
to
be
in
live
attack
to
be
win
,
these
can
have
it
in
live
to
be
learn
something
.
some
of
such
of
they
can
have
it
to
be
learn
something
more
and
more
in
living
,
some
can
have
it
in
they
to
be
really
learn
the
same
thing
again
and
again
.
Julia
as
I
be
say
really
be
not
learn
anything
and
this
be
a
nice
thing
to
be
certain
of
in
think
out
be
be
in
Julia
all
her
living
.
Julia
be
then
as
I
be
say
one
need
be
one
have
it
that
she
be
learn
anything
.
she
be
completely
then
when
she
be
do
this
thing
marry
Alfred
Hersland
.
she
like
it
a
little
then
and
then
it
go
on
to
come
to
be
quite
soon
a
beginning
of
a
long
ending
,
a
long
dividing
of
themselves
from
live
with
each
other
any
more
in
be
in
live
.




pride
and
egotism
and
vanity
and
ambition
and
succeed
and
fail
I
like
to
think
about
now
in
each
one
.
I
like

about
pride

interesting
thing
about
each
one
of
they
in
that

it
in
they
that
egotism
in

very
well
the
thing
they
have
some
talent
to
be

.
one
of
these
have
it
in
that
one
to
be
one
have
some
talent
to
be
work

in
something
to
every
one
and
this
one
have
it
in
he
to
have
it
that
for
he
in
he
he
be
one
live
in
be
one
need
to
have
it
that
he
be
one
be
one
have
pride
in
having
be
possibly
begin
something
and
this
one
be
an
unhappy
one
inside
he
when
he
be
a
young
one
and
quite
a
thin
one
and
then
he
be
one
come
to
be
a
rather
heavy
set
one
and
some
think
that
then
he
be
come
to
be
a
quite
happy
one
but
happiness
be
not
then
in
he
.
he
know
this
then
,
his
brother
and
his
sister
all
of
they
be
certain
of
this
thing
then
.
one
of
these
have
it
that
she
have
vanity
completely
in
she
as
egotism
in
she
and
she
have
then
a
pride
in
feel
this
to
be
there
conceal
inside
she
and
egotism
fill
this
one
to
keep
vanity
in
she
with
pride
to
keep
it
from
be
a
trouble
to
she
as
knowledge
to
any
one
of
she
and
this
one
be
one
having
be
go
to
be
and
be
to
herself
and
some
a
distinguished
woman
in
be
one
lead
some
one
only
nobody
be
ever
really
follow
that
one
and
this
one
be
one
really
to
herself
and
to
every
one
one
not
have
it
as
be
to
be
one
go
on
be
live
,
and
this
one
be
die
in
have
slowly
less
and
less
lead
in
she
of
some
one
with
not
any
one
follow
and
this
one
then
would
have
be
listen
while
I
be
tell
she
this
thing
only
just
then
her
mind
certainly
be
wander
and
not
any
one
then
be
follow
this
mind
in
she
be
then
wander
.
this
be
one
I
will
perhaps
not
be
ever
see
again
and
yet
as
she
might
say
perhaps
I
will
,
who
know
certainly
then
that
I
will
not
ever
see
this
one
again
.
there
be
another
one
of
these
that
have
it
in
she
to
be
one
quite
ordinarily
wallow
and
engulf
in
love
and
ordinary
enough
in
be
not
a
very
stupid
one
and
like
a
good
many
in
be
one
give
and
take
and
this
one
have
it
that
egotism
in
she
be
not
have
any
reinforce
for
any
of
this
being
that
be
be
in
she
but
be
in
she
as
be
to
she
that
she
be
one
need
to
be
one
do
everything
any
one
be
need
and
this
one
be
then
an
unhappy
one
and
a
rich
one
and
every
one
be
flatter
this
one
and
every
one
be
quite
certain
that
this
one
would
always
be
live
and
they
would
always
be
flatter
this
one
to
keep
this
one
as
one
go
on
be
live
and
sometime
there
will
be
history
and

write
of
these
woman
and
these
man
.
one
of
this
family
be
really
succeed
in
live
have
it
in
he
that
egotism
in
he
go
to
make
he
into
complete
carry
out
power
in

to
be
a
busy
man

effective
ambition
in

do
have
,
would
have

have
it
be
need
have
ambition
in
be

be
almost
persuade
his
brother
David
that
he
Alfred
have
really
some
love
be
always
in
he
.
he
have
not
sense
for
live
enough
for
have
aspiration
and
ambition
and
be
marry
Julia
Dehning
and
be
persuade
Mr.
Dehning
to
be
almost
believe
that
he
Alfred
Hersland
need
something
that
Mr.
Dehning
could
give
he
to
be
begin
to
be
succeed
in
living
and
be
one
make
Mrs.
dehne
willing
to
have
he
be
pet
by
she
in
Dehning
family
live
and
make
she
later
then
a
very
nervous
one
.
so
then
Alfred
live
and
go
on
living
and
end
one
have
in
he
not
enough
sense
for
live
to
be
one
fail
,
to
be
one
succeed
in
living
.
he
be
one
end
be
in

have
love
feeling
in
he
,
be
a
married

a
thing

not
be
feel

Dehning
family
very
personally
in
they
.




Julia
come
then
later
to
be
really
completely
separate
from
he
,
she
come
then
to
be
go
on
be
live
,
she
might
have
then
come
to
be
marry
some
one
,
she
do
not
then
come
to
be
marry
any
one
,
that
be
in
a
way
an
accidental
thing
,
she
might
have
come
then
to
be
marry
one
,
she
do
not
then

one
,
she
go
on
certainly
be
one
go
on
be
live
,
she
be
succeed
well
enough
then
in
go
on
be
in
living
,
she
have
child
as
I
have
be
say
and
as
I
say
of
they
I
be
not
find
it
to
I
at
all
an
interesting
thing
to
be
tell
just
now
about
living
come
to
be
more
and
more
in
they
.




so
then
there
have
be
write
some
history
of
Julia
and
Alfred
Hersland
,
there
will
be
write
now
a
little
more
detailed
description
of
live
be
in
each
one
of
they
with
the
people
know
each
one
of
they
.




some
be
quite
certain
that
they
have
some
friend
,
some
friend
who
be
strong
than
they
be
to
do
some
thing
but
then
these
be
one
do
the
thing
in
a
way
that
be
not
for
that
thing
a
completely
perfect
way
of
do
that
thing
and
that
one
who
be
not
such
a
strong
one
as
a
friend
of
his
be
in
do
that
thing
be
one
do
that
thing
to
make
that
thing
a
completer
thing
.
in
his
beginning
in
live
important
living
Alfred
Hersland
have
not
at
all
in
he
to
he
such
a
feeling
about
any
other
one
.
later
in
his
living
after
he
be
married
to
Minnie
Hersland
and
she
help
he
with
Pat
Moore
to
tell
he
this
to
be
inside
he
he
could
then
know
a
little
in
he
that
he
have
friend
strong
than
he
be
in
do
something
.
he
never
have
this
really
completely
in
he
but
at
moment
in
his
later
living
he
have
it
almost
completely
inside
,
he
.
only
at
moment
in
his
later
living
as
I
be
say
and
then
not
really
completely
inside
he
but
somewhat
certainly
in
his
later
living
at
moment
then
when
Pat
Moore
be
not
so
intimate
but
still
pretty
intimate
with
he
and
Minnie
Mason
be
married
to
he
he
have
this
pretty
nearly
completely
at
moment
inside
he
that
he
have
friend
,
that
he
certainly
have
a
friend
strong
than
he
at
do
some
thing
for
living
but
that
he
himself
have
it
in
he
to
do
that
thing
and
to
do
it
very
perfectly
very
perfectly
indeed
,
very
completely
indeed
,
very
completely
certainly
completely
and
perfectly
and
he
know
this
at
moment
in
he
and
he
tell
it
to
his
child
who
be
the
child
of
Julia
Hersland
sometimes
when
he
sometimes
for
a
little
time
see
one
of
they
.
he
be
then
one
certainly
not
fail
,
pretty
nearly
really
succeed
then
in
his
later
living
.
Patrick
Moore
in
a
way
admire
he
and
Alfred
Hersland
in
a
way
be
always
all
his
living
know
he
.




Patrick
Moore
be
one
in
a
way
succeed
very
well
in
living
.
there
be
another
one
who
be
know
Alfred
Hersland
some
then
.
Mackinly
Young
be
know
he
then
but
that
be
because
Young
be
know
Moore
a
little
and
be
go
to
be
a
musician
.
then
there
be
James
Flint
who
know
Alfred
Hersland
quite
well
and
then
know
Julia
Hersland
and
then
know
David
Hersland
very
well
and
he
know
Minnie
Mason
very
well
and
Alfred
Hersland
meet
she
then
.
James
Flint
always
more
or
less
all
his
living
know
Moore
and
he
know
David
Hersland
as
long
as
David
be
live
,
not
see
he
very
often
but
always
know
he
.
I
will
begin
now
continue
the
history
of
Alfred
Hersland
and
Julia
Hersland
and
of
some
who
come
to
know
they
.
I
be
beginning
come
to
the
beginning
of
the
ending
of
my
description
of
Alfred
and
Julia
Hersland
.
to
begin
then
.
Mackinly
Young
know
Moore
a
little
.
Young
be
a
musician
,
he
be
certainly
serious
in
that
profession
,
he
certainly
be
serious
in
go
to
be
one
go
to
be
make
something
important
in
musical
composition
.
there
be
very
many
who
be
very
serious
one
in
go
to
be
do
something
in
the
way
of
artistic
creation
.
there
be
very
many
who
be
work
many
hour
every
day
with
serious
intention
.
Young
be
one
who
have
it
in
he
to
be
one
always
steadily
work
,
have
certainly
real
feeling
in
be
one
certainly
seriously
go
to
be
go
to
do
something
that
would
be
certain
to
be
a
good
thing
.
he
be
one
have
as
I
be
say
power
for
steady
working
.
he
be
one
have
certainly
a
sense
for
be
one
certainly
be
live
.
he
be
one
not
continue
in
be
live
be
one
having
certainly
sense
for
be
one
be
live
with
be
one
have
certainly
the
power
to
be
day
after
day
steadily
work
.
he
certainly
have
sense
in
be
one
be
in
living
,
he
certainly
have
sense
for
be
one
feeling
be
in
live
.
this
be
rise
up
slowly
from
the
depth
of
he
and
mostly
then
he
be
every
day
steadily
work
and
this
which
be
really
sense
for
be
in
living
which
be
really
in
he
be
so
slowly
rise
in
he
that
he
be
one
steadily
seriously
earnestly
continuously
working
make
for
he
a
cover
to
he
and
sense
in
be
one
be
really
live
rather
do
not
make
any
more
than
a
touching
of
this
thing
the
cover
of
he
which
be
be
one
completely
seriously
steadily
work
.
let
I
explain
again
.
this
one
then
be
as
I
be
say
a
man
and
his
name
be
Mackinly
Young
.
he
be
a
musician
.
he
be
completely
seriously
work
every
day
in
his
living
.
he
be
certain
that
he
need
to
be
one
to
be
really
live
to
be
one
create
something
in
write
music
that
certainly
would
be
a
thoroughly
good
thing
.
this
one
Mackinly
Young
be
one
have
certainly
a
feeling
of
be
one
really
be
live
,
he
be
one
be
really
in
be
live
,
he
be
one
having
certainly
sense
in
be
live
.
he
be
one
see
with
his
thinking
,
feel
in
his
working
that
everything
he
be
learn
be
really
something
and
each
day
in
his
living
he
be
really
learn
something
.
he
be
one
certain
that
everything
he
be
learn
be
something
he
could
be
use
to
be
do
the
thing
he
seriously
be
certain
he
need
to
be
do
to
be
one
really
be
in
live
.
he
be
one
steadily
learn
more
and
more
and
always
then
when
he
be
compose
the
only
thing
that
be
anything
be
thing
that
really
be
not
anything
,
be
just
suggestion
of
there
be
somewhere
inside
that
one
a
sense
really
in
be
live
.
not
anything
this
one
be
learn
be
come
into
connection
with
the
sense
of
be
one
be
live
that
be
in
this
one
.
it
be
this
way
with
this
one
.
this
one
in
seriously
steadily
daily
work
be
really
a
practical
man
that
be
to
say
each
thing
he
be
learn
be
for
the
doing
of
something
.
he
be
one
always
work
and
really
then
he
could
do
that
thing
he
certainly
have
be
learn
but
then
that
be
not
creation
.
no
certainly
not
,
that
be
not
creation
.
and
yet
sense
for
living
be
in
he
but
it
be
a
thing
to
rise
slowly
in
he
so
slowly
that
it
almost
stop
and
go
so
slowly
like
molasse
very
thick
that
not
anything
he
could
be
learn
could
be
help
he
with
this
thing
.
not
at
all
and
really
then
it
be
some
sense
for
live
he
certainly
have
in
he
but
not
enough
to
be
one
so
seriously
so
earnestly
certain
to
be
win
do
a
really
completely
good
thing
,
not
continuous
enough
in
oozing
to
be
make
sense
for
he
in
all
the
argument
he
be
always
indulge
in
,
just
enough
to
make
he
again
and
again
say
completely
funny
penetrate
thing
,
not
too
penetrate
even
but
thoroughly
interesting
as
funny
thing
but
that
again
not
any
too
often
.
he
be
one
then
who
if
he
be
not
one
melancholy
by
the
nature
in
he
or
too
worrisome
would
certainly
end
up
by
teach
something
and
be
certain
that
the
one
he
be
know
would
never
work
hard
enough
or
be
serious
enough
to
really
do
the
thing
.
however
he
know
Pat
Moore
very
well
and
continue
to
know
he
.
in
a
way
he
really
like
Alfred
Hersland
,
he
never
think
Alfred
would
really
succeed
in
do
anything
,
he
think
Pat
Moore
might
succeed
very
well
in
living
,
he
think
James
Flint
would
succeed
in
living
but
that
be
not
of
any
interest
to
Young
,
he
continue
to
know
Alfred
Hersland
for
some
year
,
he
come
to
know
Minnie
Hersland
and
he
like
she
very
well
and
he
always
come
to
see
the
two
of
they
and
always
he
like
very
much
to
see
Pat
Moore
quite
often
.
Pat
Moore
be
a
very
different
kind
of
a
man
,
this
be
a
description
of
what
he
be
in
be
and
in
living
.
Patrick
Moore
be
not
a
musician
but
he
like
it
that
his
friend
be
good
at
that
thing
.
he
be
in
business
and
in
a
way
be
a
man
completely
succeed
,
except
when
he
be
very
worried
because
he
be
a
poor
man
,
be
a
man
quite
completely
for
the
being
and
the
living
in
he
succeed
in
living
.




Patrick
Moore
be
of
the
resist
kind
of
they
and
his
being
be
alive
and
very
lively
inside
of
he
.
his
being
be
completely
alive
and
quite
lively
inside
he
and
he
be
one
succeed
in
living
except
when
he
be
worry
about
be
a
poor
man
a
very
poor
man
sometime
in
his
living
and
this
be
a
strange
thing
to
be
in
he
to
many
that
know
he
.
this
be
something
that
be
important
in
any
one
come
to
know
he
that
he
be
a
man
succeed
in
living
,
be
alive
inside
he
and
lively
inside
in
he
and
worry
sometime
that
he
be
a
really
poor
man
and
not
worry
any
one
else
with
this
thing
.
he
be
never
a
very
poor
man
but
he
be
very
often
as
be
common
not
a
quite
rich
one
.
he
be
never
a
very
rich
one
,
he
be
when
he
be
at
the
ending
of
his
middle
living
and
to
the
end
of
his
living
then
quite
a
rich
one
.
he
be
marry
then
and
his
wife
be
quite
a
rich
one
.
he
be
one
do
real
estate
business
and
be
one
almost
every
one
be
like
.
as
I
say
of
he
he
have
always
some
admiration
for
Alfred
Hersland
and
he
be
quite
certain
that
Hersland
would
never
be
really
fail
in
living
.
he
have
some
understanding
of
Hersland
not
continue
to
be
live
with
Julia
Hersland
and
love
his
child
.
he
have
feeling
for
Alfred
Hersland
marry
Minnie
Mason
.
he
like
Flint
very
well
and
always
be
ready
to
have
Flint
come
to
see
he
.
he
like
Young
very
well
and
often
he
do
not
for
a
very
long
time
see
he
.
he
admire
Young
for
be
one
so
thoroughly
work
and
work
and
argue
.
he
like
every
one
very
well
and
very
often
as
I
be
say
he
be
worry
about
be
a
poor
man
but
really
he
be
not
ever
trouble
any
one
with
this
thing
.
he
be
as
I
be
say
of
the
resist
kind
in
man
and
woman
and
as
I
be
say
be
be
alive
in
he
always
all
his
living
,
it
be
very
lively
really
inside
he
.
he
be
one
like
some
,
like
a
good
many
,
admire
some
,
admire
a
good
many
,
he
be
one
very
many
be
like
and
he
be
one
really
succeed
in
living
,
he
be
one
have
really
all
his
living
livelily
in
he
sense
for
feel
be
one
be
live
,
he
be
one
as
I
be
say
worry
sometimes
and
for
quite
long
time
about
be
a
poor
man
,
not
about
be
one
fail
in
living
,
that
be
not
be
in
he
,
but
about
be
a
poor
man
,
but
,
as
I
be
say
,
he
be
one
not
really
ever
worry
any
one
with
this
thing
.
I
will
tell
more
now
about
he
and
the
other
one
in
his
be
live
.




I
would
certainly
like
to
be
know
it
of
each
one
just
how
succeed
,
just
how
fail
in
living
come
to
be
in
they
in
live
from
the
being
in
they
.
I
would
certainly
like
to
know
this
of
each
one
who
ever
be
,
who
be
now
live
.
I
certainly
would
like
to
know
it
about
each
one
just
how
the
be
in
they
connect
itself
with
any
one
,
with
anything
,
with
every
one
so
that
that
one
be
succeed
be
fail
in
living
.
I
certainly
can
not
tell
any
one
how
very
much
I
would
like
to
know
this
in
each
one
.
I
be
completely
fill
up
with
want
to
be
completely
certain
about
every
one
about
the
being
in
they
and
the
failing
and
the
succeeding
and
the
succeeding
and
the
fail
they
have
in
they
in
their
living
.
I
look
at
every
one
,
I
read
about
each
one
,
I
think
about
each
one
,
I
listen
to
each
one
,
I
listen
to
about
each
one
,
I
listen
to
any
one
,
I
listen
to
every
one
,
I
look
at
any
one
,
I
look
again
and
again
,
I
listen
again
and
again
and
again
,
I
be
think
very
often
about
each
one
,
I
certainly
would
like
to
know
it
about
every
one
about
the
being
in
they
and
the
way
be
in
they
make
fail
and
succeed
in
they
.
I
be
much
less
interested
in
their
be
good
one
or
bad
one
,
clean
one
or
dirty
one
,
rich
one
or
poor
one
,
well
-
mannered
or
badly
-
mannered
one
,
sick
one
or
well
one
,
I
want
to
know
about
each
one
the
being
in
they
be
in
they
to
make
of
they
one
succeed
,
one
fail
.




that
be
what
I
want
to
know
about
each
one
,
be
in
they
make
of
they
one
succeed
,
one
fail
,
one
succeed
and
fail
,
one
fail
and
succeed
in
be
in
live
.
this
be
what
I
want
to
know
about
each
one
and
I
never
can
know
everything
and
perhaps
I
never
can
know
everything
about
this
thing
.
very
likely
I
can
never
know
everything
about
this
thing
.
that
be
to
I
a
thing
make
of
I
,
one
certain
to
be
one
some
day
certainly
end
.
I
like
live
but
I
be
certain
that
I
can
not
know
everything
and
so
I
know
certainly
that
I
will
be
one
some
day
not
be
any
long
live
.
this
be
not
to
I
now
a
sorrowful
thing
,
this
be
to
I
now
quite
a
certain
thing
.
I
like
be
live
,
I
like
too
be
certain
of
something
,
I
be
certainly
certain
of
something
.




this
be
to
be
now
a
description
of
successful
living
of
not
successful
living
being
in
Pat
Moore
and
Alfred
Hersland
and
Mackinly
Young
and
James
Flint
and
Minnie
Mason
and
David
Hersland
.
I
tell
about
successful
living
about
fail
in
these
now
because
I
want
to
be
tell
about
it
in
every
one
and
I
can
not
just
now
do
that
thing
because
I
do
not
just
now
completely
know
that
thing
.
I
know
a
good
deal
now
about
be
in
man
and
woman
,
about
be
in
some
one
,
in
some
,
in
many
making
in
they
each
one
their
succeeding
,
their
fail
in
be
live
,
in
be
in
living
,
in
be
go
on
be
live
.
I
know
this
now
so
that
I
could
have
it
in
I
to
know
very
much
about
succeed
and
fail
in
man
and
woman
and
yet
I
be
not
certain
I
will
very
soon
be
know
really
very
much
more
about
this
thing
.
I
really
have
not
very
much
hope
in
I
that
soon
I
will
be
know
very
much
more
about
succeed
and
fail
be
in
man
and
woman
.
I
seem
just
now
in
I
to
be
a
little
,
a
good
deal
stop
in
be
learn
about
this
thing
in
man
and
woman
.
if
I
tell
about
be
in
some
man
some
woman
make
for
they
succeed
make
for
they
fail
in
be
live
,
in
be
in
living
,
in
be
go
on
be
in
living
,
in
be
go
on
live
,
perhaps
then
a
little
I
will
be
begin
again
learn
something
of
be
be
in
man
and
woman
make
succeed
and
fail
in
they
.




I
be
get
to
find
it
more
and
more
interesting
be
one
feel
it
in
every
one
the
being
in
they
make
they
to
be
succeed
,
to
be
fail
in
live
.




James
Flint
like
Patrick
Moore
very
well
.
he
admire
he
.
James
Flint
begin
his
beginning
live
as
a
musician
,
he
end
his
begin
middle
living
as
a
manufacturer
of
clothing
.
he
be
a
man
certainly
succeed
in
living
and
yet
not
one
succeed
well
enough
to
be
at
all
startling
.
he
be
one
succeed
in
living
.
he
be
one
certainly
be
live
in
be
in
living
,
certainly
very
solidly
this
thing
and
always
then
he
have
a
quick
way
of
do
thing
in
music
and
manufacturing
that
be
a
little
quick
than
solid
succeed
in
he
and
this
then
keep
he
from
be
one
really
quite
startlingly
be
one
succeed
in
living
.
he
be
one
as
I
be
say
completely
succeed
in
living
,
be
certainly
one
solidly
attack
in
successful
winning
and
always
then
as
I
be
say
he
be
lightly
attack
and
successfully
lightly
attack
quick
then
he
be
solidly
attack
and
this
be
in
he
in
be
a
musician
and
this
be
in
he
in
be
one
manufacturing
clothing
and
this
be
in
he
and
he
be
one
not
be
at
all
in
his
living
an
astonishingly
successful
one
.
as
I
be
say
he
admire
Pat
Moore
and
like
he
very
well
indeed
and
Moore
be
one
certainly
successful
quite
well
in
living
and
be
entirely
alive
inside
he
and
very
lively
inside
he
with
this
live
be
in
he
.
not
any
one
be
close
to
Pat
Moore
in
Moore
be
be
alive
in
be
live
and
Moore
be
succeed
well
enough
in
living
and
not
any
one
be
want
he
to
be
succeed
any
more
than
he
be
succeed
and
he
be
sometimes
worry
a
good
deal
about
go
to
be
a
very
poor
man
but
he
never
worry
any
one
with
this
thing
and
yet
Flint
be
not
quite
entirely
satisfied
with
Moore
be
in
his
own
living
.
James
Flint
certainly
be
satisfied
with
be
be
alive
in
Moore
and
very
lively
in
he
and
Moore
be
one
succeed
in
living
.
Flint
do
not
need
to
have
Moore
succeed
any
more
than
Moore
would
be
succeed
in
living
but
somehow
to
Flint
it
be
as
if
Moore
should
have
be
a
little
more
poignantly
succeed
,
that
be
to
say
he
should
not
be
more
poignant
in
be
,
in
living
,
in
succeed
but
somehow
be
succeed
as
he
Moore
be
succeed
should
have
be
a
more
poignant
thing
to
some
one
,
to
any
one
,
not
to
Moore
,
not
to
Flint
,
not
to
any
woman
,
not
to
any
other
man
,
but
somehow
some
way
to
some
one
.
Flint
then
in
a
way
be
not
completely
satisfied
with
Pat
Moore
.
as
I
be
say
Flint
and
Moore
know
each
other
and
Flint
have
come
to
know
Minnie
Mason
,
Flint
be
a
man
a
good
many
come
to
know
in
living
and
Minnie
Mason
come
to
know
Moore
and
Young
,
and
Hersland
come
to
know
she
and
some
year
later
a
number
of
year
later
Alfred
Hersland
be
married
to
she
.
they
all
come
to
know
David
Hersland
as
be
a
natural
thing
.
now
I
will
give
a
very
short
description
of
Minnie
Mason
and
Minnie
with
each
one
of
they
and
Minnie
Mason
marry
and
marry
to
Alfred
Hersland
.




some
have
sense
for
live
from
have
realisation
in
they
that
each
thing
they
be
know
be
such
a
thing
as
it
be
to
they
and
really
know
this
in
they
.
some
be
know
in
they
that
each
thing
they
be
know
in
live
be
the
thing
that
thing
really
be
live
.




some
have
in
they
completely
the
emotion
of
know
something
be
something
without
feel
in
they
that
any
thing
be
anything
.
this
certainly
can
be
in
man
and
woman
.
there
be
many
way
of
have
sense
for
living
,
sense
of
be
live
in
they
in
man
and
in
woman
.
some
have
completely
the
emotion
of
something
be
what
they
be
need
for
be
one
go
on
be
live
and
some
of
such
of
they
have
not
at
all
in
they
any
feeling
of
any
one
thing
have
it
as
be
the
thing
they
be
need
to
be
have
it
be
to
have
they
be
one
go
on
be
in
living
,
be
in
living
,
be
live
.
some
have
some
of
such
feeling
and
not
any
such
thing
,
not
any
such
feeling
have
any
value
for
they
.




I
be
know
one
who
know
Young
some
and
Flint
a
little
and
hear
of
Moore
and
come
once
to
dine
with
Alfred
and
Minnie
Hersland
and
this
one
be
one
be
certain
that
he
be
one
love
with
intensity
a
powerful
thing
and
this
one
be
one
love
with
intensity
the
emotion
of
feel
a
thing
be
a
powerful
thing
and
so
this
one
be
always
hope
but
really
never
be
one
do
anything
that
give
to
he
satisfaction
.
and
this
be
very
common
.
I
be
not
just
now
like
every
one
,
not
at
all
,
each
one
be
too
completely
herself
,
himself
inside
she
,
inside
he
and
repeat
sometimes
with
some
change
,
sometimes
with
more
emphasizing
,
sometimes
with
a
weakening
feeling
,
sometimes
more
loudly
,
sometimes
more
faintly
the
being
in
that
one
,
and
I
certainly
do
just
now
not
want
to
be
certain
of
this
thing
and
I
be
completely
certain
of
this
thing
and
I
know
now
certainly
there
be
very
many
,
most
every
one
not
want
to
be
certain
inside
they
that
each
one
be
repeat
always
all
the
being
in
they
be
themselves
inside
they
.
I
can
see
just
now
in
I
that
for
very
many
living
this
be
not
at
all
a
romantic
thing
this
know
that
each
one
always
be
repeat
.
I
know
that
mostly
every
one
will
not
ever
be
really
certain
of
this
thing
.
I
,
I
be
always
certain
of
this
thing
,
I
mostly
be
all
solid
in
this
thing
,
that
be
full
up
,
that
be
satisfied
,
that
be
comfortable
,
that
be
interested
,
that
is
noticing
,
that
be
stir
by
this
thing
,
I
will
not
just
now
be
mention
again
this
thing
.




Minnie
Mason
marry
Alfred
Hersland
when
he
be
love
again
in
his
living
and
they
be
succeed
well
enough
in
be
in
married
living
.
they
go
on
be
in
married
living
.
it
interest
they
enough
,
it
interest
some
other
in
the
beginning
,
mostly
it
be
not
so
very
interesting
their

in
married
living
,
their
succeed
well

.
I
be
interested
in

do
love
very
much
and
very
often
.
she
certainly
do
very
much
of
this
thing
.
she
come
to
love

and
be
love
by
that
one
and
to
marry
that
one
and

then
be
almost
then
a
successful
thing
for
the
two
of
they

not
then

.

have
come
then
to
almost
marry
another
one
instead
of
the

and
that
would
have
be
almost
a
successful
thing
in
having
marry

.
she
come
later
as

very
much
and
as
I
be
say

this
thing
very
often
.
in
a
way

.
she
be
then
go
on
know
James
Flint
and
Moore
and
even
Young
then
as
I
be
say
.




Pat
Moore
think
it
certainly
a
very
good
thing
that
Alfred
Hersland
marry
Minnie
Mason
.
he
say
to
every
one

think
it
a
very
good
thing
.

do
think
it
to
be
a
very
good
thing
that
Minnie
Mason
marry
Alfred
Hersland
.
he
know
Minnie
and
he
know
Alfred
and
he
always
go
on
know

and
he
very
often
take
dinner
with

.
Flint
do
not
see
any
of
they
very
often
,
he
sometimes
see
they
.
he
see
Moore
,
and
he
see
Hersland
and
Minnie
Hersland
when
he
come
to
see
they
,
Young
do
not

often
.
he

Mr.
and
Mrs.
Hersland
and
he
do
once
in
a
while
see
Moore
and
once
in
a
while
he
see
James
Flint
.
they
all
think
it
be
a
very
good
thing
that
Hersland
and
Minnie
be
married
and
live
contentedly
in
married
living
and
be
then
succeed
quite
well
in
living
.
Moore
be
quite
certain
that
it
be
a
good
thing
that
Hersland
and
Minnie
be
marry
.




some
be
very
happy
love
some
one
,
some
be
very
happy
then
love
another
one
.
some
one
be
very
happy
in
love
one
,
some
one
be
very
happy
in
love
and
then
be
very
happy
in
love
another
one
.
Minnie
Mason
be
such
a
one
.
it
be
quite
common
to
be
quite
happy
sometime
in
be
love
.
it
be
quite
common
to
be
happy
in
love
one
and
to
be
happy
in
love
another
one
.
this
be
quite
common
.
Minnie
be
quite
happy
in
love
one
and
she
marry
that
one
and
she
be
quite
happy
in
love
another
one
and
she
do
not
marry
that
one
and
she
be
quite
happy
in
marry
another
one
and
she
do
marry
that
one
.
certainly
it
be
quite
right
,
Moore
be
certain
of
this
thing
,
that
any
one
with
the
name
of
Minnie
Mason
should
be
happy
in
love
some
one
.
Minnie
be
happy
in
love
one
and
she
be
happy
in
love
that
one
.
she
marry
that
one
,
she
be
almost
then
succeed
in
married
live
with
that
one
.
she
do
not
keep
on
be
married
to
that
one
,
she
in
a
way
always
be
know
that
one
,
she
in
a
way
always
know
it
as
quite
a
happy
thing
in
she
living
that
this
one
certainly
would
be
do
something
when
she
ask
he
to
be
do
something
.
she
be
very
happy
just
then
when
she
be
marry
this
one
in
love
another
one
and
she
be
never
go
to
be
marry
and
she
never
marry
that
one
and
she
certainly
would
have
be
certainly
almost
succeed
in
married
live
with
that
one
.
she
be
in
a
way
all
her
living
know
this
one
,
she
be
in
a
way
certain
that
this
one
would
be
do
anything
she
would
ask
he
if
she
ever
would
come
to
ask
he
to
do
something
.
she
be
then
later
as
I
be
say
happy
in
love
Hersland
.
she
marry
he
,
she
be
succeed
then
in
married
living
,
he
be
succeed
then
in
living
.
she
be
of
the
resist
kind
of
they
but
resist
be
in
she
constantly
trickle
out
of
she
as
steadily
trickle
attack
,
very
often
she
be
do
very
much
lie
as
I
be
say
.
she
have
really
sense
for
live
as
I
be
say
.
resist
be
came
trickle
out
of
she
,
there
be
a
great
deal
always
trickle
out
of
she
,
it
be
as
attack
be
to
mostly
every
one
know
she
,
as
I
be
say
she
have
sense
for
living
,
as
I
be
say
she
and
Alfred
Hersland
successfully
go
on
live
in
married
living
until
they
come
one
and
then
the
other
of
they
to
be
old
one
and
then
dead
one
.




Minnie
Hersland
have
have
and
in
a
way
have
not
at
all
have
sense
for
be
in
live
.
she
be
not
in
a

interesting
thing
.

their
kind
in
man

that
sometime
some

,
there

some
living
hope
sometime
to
be

that
some
will
be
good
one
in
living
,
there

there
be
some
living
that
be
not
certain
by
their
thinking
that
any
way

but
they
have
it
in
they
to
be
only
able

good
one
,
there
be
all
these
and
then
there
be
as
one
might
say
school
of
each
one
of
these
way
of
be
of
many
be
these
thing
with
not
much
feeling
in
they
of
such
a
thing
to
make
they
be
do
much
living
.
I
will
now
tell
about
Julia
Dehning
and
a
whole
lot
more
of
man
and
woman
.




some
man
be
certainly
sometime
love
a
woman
.
some
woman
be
certainly
sometime
love
some
man
.
some
man
be
sometime
certainly
love
some
woman
.
very
many
man
be
think
the
woman
they
be
love
a
very
wonderful
thing
.
very
many
man
be
sometime
loving
,
each
one
of
they
,
some
one
.
some
of
these
be
not
really
think
the
one
they
be
love
to
be
such
a
wonderful
one
.
many
woman
be
sometimes
in
their
living
love
by
some
man
,
some
be
need
this
for
be
one
to
themselves
be
live
,
some
be
like
such
a
thing
very
well
for
keep
on
be
live
,
some
be
excited
in
this
thing
,
some
be
certain
that
they
be
go
on
live
have
this
thing
,
some
be
always
think
they
be
not
go
on
in
live
have
this
thing
,
and
then
they
be
very
many
the
woman
who
be
as
it
be
school
follow
in
the
feeling
of
some
one
have
a
feeling
in
they
of
have
,
having
have
,
go
to
be
have
some
man
love
they
.
there
be
some
woman
,
quite
some
of
they
who
have
it
as
be
that
they
be
completely
feel
one
thing
when
they
be
feel
that
thing
,
these
then
be
wonderful
one
to
any
one
love
they
,
they
be
eternal
thing
have
it
in
they
to
be
completely
one
thing
,
these
may
be
one
have
any
kind
of
thing
in
feeling
but
each
time
feel
be
in
they
they
be
feel
that
thing
with
the
whole
of
they
and
these
can
then
give
to
any
one
love
they
the
feeling
that
be
one
be
a
thing
not
have
any
beginning
or
any
ending
and
so
then
many
be
in
the
state
of
have
love
for
they
,
by
some
one
of
such
of
they
many
have
it
in
they
then
that
infinite
and
eternal
have
really
mean
.
a
thing
not
begin
and
not
end
be
certainly
continue
,
one
completely
feel
something
be
one
not
having
begin
to
feel
anything
because
to
have
a
beginning
mean
that
there
will
be
accumulation
and
then
gradually
die
away
as
end
and
this
can
not
be
where
a
thing
be
a
complete
thing
.
so
then
many
woman
give
to
the
man
love
they
the
awe
-
inspire
feeling
of
realise
an
eternal
thing
.
and
that
be
very
satisfying
and
so
very
many
man
be
very
much
like
have
this
kind
of
love
give
to
they
.
now
I
be
say
this
be
in
some
woman
,
not
only
in
love
but
in
living
,
they
be
completely
feel
something
.
there
be
a
very
great
many
woman
live
not
at
all
completely
feel
anything
and
they
be
sometimes
love
some
one
and
they
be
sometimes
be
love
by
some
one
.
love
be
a
very
nice
thing
to
very
many
do
that
thing
,
it
be
not
at
all
a
nice
thing
to
very
many
do
that
thing

Julia

and
she

and
she

and
she
know
very
many
other
man
and
woman
,
this
be
certain
.
all
of
these
be
in
some
way
certain
that
each
one
in
live
should
in
a
way
be
do
something
so
that
everything
would
be
a
good
thing
for
some
one
.
so
then
to
give
a
little
description
of
Theodore
Summers
and
Miriam
Cranach
and
James
Cranach
and
William
Beckling
.
and
then
to
give
some
description
of
Julia
Hersland
know
each
one
of
they
.
Theodore
Summers
be
one
certainly
quarrel
so
as
to
make
some
kind
of
man
do
something
so
that
some
should
be
certain
that
they
be
have
for
live
what
they
be
need
.
Theodore
Summers
certainly
be
hotly
quarrel
sometimes
for
this
thing
.




in
a
way
Julia
like
very
much
understand
summer
be
one
quarrel
to
win
something
,
in
a
way
she
want
to
follow
after
he
,
in
a
way
she
certainly
do
not
follow
after
he
.
later
she
do
not
at
all
follow
he
.




summer
be
certainly
in
a
way
to
Julia
for
a
time
complete
in
important
living
of
be
one
certainly
give
it
to
she
to
have
for
live
certainly
learn
something
,
but
he
do
not
give
it
to
she
that
dehne
living
be
certainly
completely
honest
living
because
he
be
not
ever
feel
anything
about
anything
like
any
such
thing
and
so
then
he
be
not
really
important
to
she
.
he
have
completely
energy
in
living
,
he
be
not
one
certainly
go
on
be
live
as
Julia
Hersland
certainly
be
go
to
be
go
on
do
and
so
in
a
way
Summers
be
not
to
Julia
really
completely
in
her
living
,
I
will
tell
a
little
more
a
little
later
about
he
.




Miriam
Cranach
be
really
a
friend
to
Julia
Hersland
and
that
be
an
important
thing
and
that
be
in
a
way
not
at
all
an
important
thing
.
Miriam
be
a
resist
one
really
be
live
in
a
religion
,
a
religion
that
in
a
way
be
completely
certain
to
be
lead
any
one
to
be
certain
that
not
any
one
would
be
a
good
enough
one
to
help
themselves
or
any
one
and
it
do
not
lead
Miriam
to
this
thing
and
it
do
lead
Miriam
to
be
certain
of
this
thing
.
Julia
Hersland
be
certain
that
Miriam
be
completely
an
honest
one
for
daily
living
but
she
be
not
need
Miriam
for
this
thing
,
she
be
not
need
Miriam
for
the
religion
in
Miriam
,
she
be
not
really
need
Miriam
,
she
and
Miriam
be
completely
faithful
friend
in
living
and
this
be
not
important
to
any
one
as
be
inside
in
any
one
and
both
of
they
be
certainly
in
a
way
live
inside
in
they
,
and
this
be
certain
,
and
in
a
way
it
be
a
little
a
strange
thing
and
I
will
tell
sometime
some
more
about
this
thing
.




Julia
Hersland
might
later
have
come
to
marry
William
Beckling
but
William
come
then
to
be
quite
a
sick
man
and
he
have
then
certainly
to
take
care
of
himself
in
living
and
he
would
not
then
marry
any
woman
.
I
will
tell
more
about
he
.
he
be
in
a
way
one
in
a
way
act
as
if
he
be
almost
certain
that
some
one
should
be
a
good
one
for
live
.
this
be
all
now
for
just
begin
a
description
of
live
in
he
.




mostly
all
of
these
whom
Julia
know
then
meet
the
other
she
know
then
but
very
many
do
not
like
some
of
the
other
they
meet
then
.
some
do
like
very
much
some
of
those
they
meet
then
.
some
do
not
come
to
know
any
of
the
other
they
meet
then
.
some
do
come
to
know
some
of
the
other
they
meet
then
.
as
I
be
say
Julia
have
in
a
way
not
come
to
have
any
friend
in
her
personal
living
in
her
young
living
.
this
be
quite
common
.
this
be
quite
astonishing
to
those
who
have
have
friend
personal
to
they
to
their
living
but
it
be
certainly
very
common
,
quite
extraordinarily
common
that
young
woman
and
young
one
and
young
man
and
young
one
have
not
have
any
one
who
be
personally
a
companion
to
they
.
as
I
be
say
this
be
really
extraordinarily
common
.
it
be
also
very
uncommon
as
I
be
say
and
very
many
be
know
.




Julia
Dehning
then
have
in
a
way
in
her
young
living
not
have
really
any
one
personally
a
companion
to
she
then
,
she
be
herself
inside
she
and
give
a
stamp
then
decidedly
to
herself
to
every
one
of
herself
on
Dehning
live
as
be
in
she
be
live
.
she
be
then
be
in
Dehning
family
live
,
that
be
now
certain
.




now
then
to
begin
again
the
long
list
of
those
she
come
to
know
as
Mrs.
Alfred
Hersland
,
some
of
they
she
know
early
,
certainly
William
Beckling
,
a
very
little
Miriam
Cranach
,
quite
well
in
Dehning
family
live
Charles
Kohler
,
she
have
hear
of
Adolph
Herman
and
as
for
the
rest
perhaps
she
have
meet
they
,
know
of
some
one
know
they
,
perhaps
not
,
that
really
be
not
an
important
thing
to
any
one
except
to
I
who
be
interested
in
know
everything
every
little
thing
.
I
will
then
begin
remember
these
thing
.
Julia
Hersland
too
know
David
Hersland
,
she
in
a
way
know
some
that
know
he
,

in
a
way
know
every
one
she
know
then
,
she
in
a
way
know
about
some
of
those
Alfred
Hersland
be
know
then
.
she
do
not
later
know
anything
of
those
Alfred
Hersland
be
know
.




really
almost
all
her
living
she
know
William
Beckling
,
she
do
not
come
to
marry
he
,
that
be
because
he
become
a
sick
man
and
be
certain
then
that
it
be
not
right
for
he
to
marry
any
woman
.
she
know
Theodore
Summers
a
few
year
,
she
always
sometime
hear
something
about
he
,
later
when
she
do
not
any
long
often
see
he
.
it
be
a
little
then
an
important
thing
in
her
living
as
part
of
really
learn
anything
,
as
part
of
be
one
certainly
and
she
be
certainly
such
a
one
as
part
of
be
in
courageous
be
one
go
on
certainly
go
on
be
live
.




she
come
to
know
the
Cranachs
after
she
be
a
married
one
.
they
have
a
little
know
William
Beckling
,
they
do
not
care
about
he
,
they
have
know
David
Hersland
,
they
like
know
he
.
Julia
afterwards
to
the
end
of
her
living
know
they
really
for
her
daily
living
.
there
will
be
a
history
write
a
short
one
of
she
and
each
one
of
they
.
Helen
Cooke
know
Julia

she
be
Mrs.

.
Helen
know
Mrs.
Cranach
,
she
know
William
Beckling
,
she
know
David
Hersland
,
she
really
do
not
interest
herself
really
to
know
any
of
they
then
.
she
later
come
to
know
David
Hersland
as
a
thing
interesting
to
she
for
the
living
being
in
she
,
she
always
all
her
living
know
Julia
Hersland
,
she
do
not
find
that
at
all
interesting
.
Rachel
Sherman
marry
Adolph
Herman
,
Adolph
Herman
know
William
Beckling
,
Rachel
Sherman
know
Helen
Cooke
very
well
then
and
she
meet
William
Beckling
and
Mrs.
Alfred
Hersland
and
then
Adolph
Herman
and
then
she
marry
he
.
I
will
tell
about
that
thing
.
the
Hermans
in
a
way
always
go
on
know
and
later
learn
anything
with
Mrs.
Hersland
.
that
be
interesting
.
I
will
tell
about
this
thing
.
Charles
Kohler
be
one
in
a
way
in
dehne
family
live
,
later
they
be
not
certain
that
in
a
way
he
have
be
in
Dehning
family
live
,
for
some
time
then
not
anybody
in
Dehning
family
living
see
he
,
Julia
sometimes
see
he
then
,
she
never
be
certain
whether
he
have
be
in
his
feeling
ever
in
Dehning
family
live
.
he
be
not
in
any
way
to
any
one
in
Dehning
family
live
or
to
any
one
know
Julia
Hersland
an
important
one
.
Linder
Herne
be
a
man
certainly
teach
something
.
Julia
have
hear
of
he
,
she
like
it
that
all
the
rest
of
his
living
she
could
know
he
.




Arthur
Keller
as
I
say
she
come
to
know
as
he
come
to
be
perhaps
go
to
be
a
brother
-
in
-
law
.
I
will
tell
about
he
later
in
the
history
of
David
Hersland
.
then
there
be
Hilda
who
marry
Ernest
Brakes
and
she
might
have
marry
George
Dehning
.
I
will
tell
a
little
about
she
now
and
more
about
she
later
,
she
never
completely
want
to
know
Julia
Hersland
and
yet
she
like
it
very
well
that
she
do
know
Julia
Hersland
.
she
marry
Ernest
Brakes
and
she
sometimes
meet
the
dehning
later
when
she
go
out
somewhere
.
then
there
be
other
one
as
I
say
in
tell
about
those
Julia
be
know
,
I
will
begin
again
tell
about
every
one
Julia
Hersland
be
know
.




there
certainly
be
kind
in
man
and
woman
.
there
certainly
be
thing
hurt
each
one
live
.
the
thing
hurt
each
one
hurt
they
in
the
way
their
kind
of
they
,
their
kind
in
man
and
woman
be
hurt
by
anything
.
sometimes
it
be
astonishing
to
some
one
that
they
be
effect
by
something
in
a
way
and
that
be
the
way
their
kind
of
they
in
man
and
woman
be
certain
to
be
affect
by
that
thing
and
they
do
not
know
of
which
kind
they
be
and
that
they
would
be
effect
the
way
their
kind
in
man
and
woman
be
always
be
effect
by
something
and
so
they
find
it
completely
astonishing
to
know
it
of
themselves
that
they
be
effect
that
way
by
that
thing
.
some
know
quite
certainly
by
the
middle
of
their
middle
living
how
they
be
go
to
be
effect
by
each
thing
.
very
many
be
never
really
certain
about
this
thing
.
quite
a
number
come
to
be
quite
certain
about
this
thing
.
some
can
be
certain
about
other
one
about
this
thing
.
some
be
quite
certain
but
be
not
really
know
this
thing
,
some
be
not
certain
and
be
not
really
know
this
thing
.




each
kind
then
in
man
and
woman
have
it
to
have
that
all
of
they
be
hurt
in
the
same
way
by
something
that
can
hurt
they
.
this
be
just
now
in
I
by
my
feeling
.
some
of
each
kind
of
they
have
it
to
be
much
less
hurt
than
other
of
their
kind
of
they
by
anything
.
some
of
each
kind
of
they
can
be
almost
quite
completely
hurt
by
something
hurt
they
.
each
kind
of
they
in
man
and
woman
have
it
in
they
to
have
their
own
way
of
have
frighten
feeling
in
they
from
something
really
scare
they
.
some
of
each
kind
in
man
and
woman
be
not
very
much
frightened
by
anything
scare
they
.
some
be
very
much
scared
by
something
frighten
they
.
some
easily
have
their
way
of
be
frighten
in
they
,
some
need
very
much
frightening
to
have
their
way
of
be
frighten
,
the
way
of
be
frightened
of
their
kind
of
they
come
out
of
they
.




I
be
beginning
now
tell
more
of
Miriam
Cranach
who
be
of
a
kind
of
they
of
whom
many
have
it
to
have
religion
in
they
so
that
they
be
in
live
really
one
having
really
inside
they
and
outside
of
they
distinction
from
this
thing
.
some
of
such
of
they
be
fairly
happy
one
in
living
but
very
many
of
such
of
they
be
happy
really
only
by
religion
.
these
be
of
the
resist
kind
in
man
and
woman
,
that
be
to
say
they
be
of
the
dependent
independent
kind
.
they
have
it
in
they
not
to
be
really
dependent
,
not
to
be
really
independent
.
they
have
completely
the
sensitiveness
of
resist
being
but
they
be
not
sensitive
to
anything
that
be
not
to
their
feeling
connect
with
the
relation
of
themselves
of
some
one
to
the
universal
feeling
.
they
have
not
at
all
engulf
be
although
some
of
they
almost
suggest
such
a
thing
,
they
have
not
at
all
resist
although
some
of
they
very
much
suggest
such
a
thing
,
they
seem
to
be
resist
because
they
be
not
respond
to
anything
that
be
to
they
whatever
mean
that
word
many
have
for
they
not
god
-
give
.
they
seem
some
of
they
to
be
engulf
because
they
be
completely
sensitive
to
that
thing
.
these
have
it
very
often
that
they
have
not
any
power
of
express
themselves
about
anything
that
do
not
completely
touch
they
.
many
of
these
if
it
be
not
for
the
look
of
they
would
seem
from
their
talking
or
their
writing
generally
to
be
quite
stupid
one
.




Miriam
be
such
a
one
.
I
will
not
tell
very
much
just
now
about
she
because
sometime
later
when
I
tell
more
about
man
and
woman
I
will
tell
about
Miss
ortenrie
who
marry
Olaf
Lawson
.
I
will
then
tell
all
I
know
then
about
this
kind
in
man
and
woman
,
how
they
have
religion
in
they
,
how
they
can
be
hurt
by
something
,
how
they
can
be
frighten
when
something
have
scare
they
.
I
tell
something
about
Miriam
Cranach
know
Julia
dehne
Hersland
.
I
have
already
tell
something
about
this
thing
.




always
something
be
happen
and
one
be
then
feel
something
and
sometimes
one
be
then
one
know
how
some
other
one
feel
when
something
be
happen
.
some
one
can
understand
then
always
sometime
how
some
other
one
be
feel
sometime
about
something
.




William
Bedding
be
one
who
be
almost
for
he
completely
,
brilliantly
succeed
in
living
,
and
then
he
come
to
be
a
sick
one
and
he
be
certain
then
that
it
would
not
be
right
for
he
to
marry

he
do
not
begin
early
in
his

be
so
brilliantly
succeed
,
but
about
the
middle
of
his
middle
living

be
certainly
almost
quite
brilliantly
succeed
.

many
know
they
and
to
themselves
all
their
live
very
happy
quite
successful
one
in
be
live
.
they
be
love
each
other
that
be
certain
and
be
pleasant
to
each
other
completely
in
be
husband
and
wife
live
together
and
go
about
together
.
they
both
have
much
intention
,
much
aspiration
,
much
conviction
,
much
sensitiveness
in
living
,
they
do
not
have
very
much
that
hurt
they
but
some
thing
do
hurt
they
,
perhaps
some
thing
frighten
they
that
be
not
certain
.
they
do
not
have
religion
but
they
each
have
complete
devotion
to
be
certain
that
each
one
be
to
be
one
really
and
truly
work
,
be
one
really
and
truly
work
.
these
come
to
know
Julia
Hersland
always
more
in
their
living
and
in
her
living
.
they
come
to
be
almost
always
more
or
less
in
each
other
daily
live
.
I
can
not
describe
they
more
because
I
do
not
know
what
to
be
certain
about
in
think
about
they
.
sometime
I
will
be
more
certain
and
then
I
will
begin
again
about
they
.
I
will
tell
more
now
about
Julia
Hersland
and
each
one
she
come
to
know
in
living
and
how
she
come
to
know
they
and
I
will
tell
more
and
more
about
all
the
living
ever
be
in
she
.
I
could
go
on
and
on
,
I
be
so
certain
that
it
would
be
a
very
important
thing
if
some
other
go
on
be
live
,
some
other
one
go
on
be
in
living
could
be
know
really
how
to
be
distinguish
the
resisting
from
the
attack
kind
in
man
and
woman
,
could
be
understand
the
way
have
it
in
they
to
have
religion
in
they
be
in
they
of
the
resist
kind
of
they
,
be
in
they
of
the
attack
kind
of
they
.
I
be
so
certain
that
I
be
know
a
very
great
deal
about
be
be
in
man
and
in
woman
that
it
certainly
do
seem
as
if
something
would
be
miss
if
not
any
one
could
be
come
to
know
from
I
all
of
that
everything
.
and
now
I
be
sad
with
this
thing
for
certainly
I
will
be
go
on
with
all
this
thing
and
certainly
then
not
any
one
will
be
rightly
certain
about
some
one
which
kind
of
be
that
one
have
in
they
resist
or
attack
and
how
religion
be
in
that
one
.
but
then
I
be
remember
that
every
one
be
ever
in
living
be
pretty
well
used
to
this
thing
that
some
one
have
it
to
have
know
realise
something
and
not
any
one
else
even
later
have
that
thing
and
so
then
I
will
go
on
writing
,
and
not
for
myself
and
not
for
any
other
one
but
because
it
be
a
thing
I
certainly
can
be
earnestly
do
with
sometimes
excited
feeling
and
sometimes
happy
feeling
and
sometimes
long
feeling
and
sometimes
almost
indifferent
feeling
and
always
with
a
little
dubious
feeling
.
I
could
though
be
so
wise
and
I
be
so
wise
and
it
would
be
so
nice
for
I
to
be
certain
that
from
I
some
other
one
could
be
a
wise
one
a
little
less
wise
than
I
be
who
be
the
original
wise
one
.
I
could
then
be
so
pleased
with
this
thing
with
be
certain
that
with
I
there
would
be
an
increasing
of
wise
realisation
,
and
then
I
be
remember
it
be
like
when
I
be
a
young
one
I
be
for
year
so
sorry
about
thing
important
in
something
be
lose
and
some
one
be
a
dead
one
by
an
accident
when
he
be
a
young
one
and
then
later
I
be
certain
I
would
not
be
use
that
thing
that
be
lose
and
would
not
be
read
something
if
it
have
be
write
and
if
I
do
not
need
that
thing
,
very
likely
not
any
one
would
be
really
need
that
thing
,
and
whatever
any
one
be
have
be
plenty
good
enough
unless
they
want
some
other
thing
and
perhaps
they
will
find
that
other
thing
,
and
anyhow
nobody
can
be
a
wise
one
in
the
way
I
be
just
now
a
wise
one
,
so
I
will
go
on
and
go
on
and
if
anybody
come
to
be
like
I
a
wise
one
why
then
there
will
have
come
to
be
another
wise
one
.
I
be
almost
certain
I
be
completely
a
wise
one
.
I
will
not
tell
any
more
now
about
this
thing
.
I
will
tell
now
some
more
about
religion
and
about
attack
and
about
resist
being
and
I
will
tell
some
more
now
about
everything
and
perhaps
sometime
I
will
be
sad
again
about
not
any
one
ever
have
the
understanding
of
be
in
man
and
woman
that
I
be
have
.




Julia
Dehning
come
to
know
each
of
they
,
some
man
and
some
woman

now
to
finish

yesterday

that
some
one
have
it
not

in

the
poignancy
of
experience

have
not
concentration
in

have
concentration
in
experience
be
common
but
then
again
it
be
not
so
very
common
.
there
be
one
that
I
be
see
yesterday
evening
and
this
one
be
of
the
slow
resist
and
engulf
kind
in
man
and
woman
and
this
one
be
quite
solemn
and
this
one
be
not
such
a
solid
one
in
be
a
slow
resist
engulf
one
as
this
one
be
in
expression
and
so
this
one
be
solemn
.
this
one
could
really
be
think
about
some
one
,
this
one
have
imagination
,
this
one
have
sensitiveness
for
come
to
be
realise
way
of
do
something
,
this
one
have
not
sensitiveness
for
realise
the
feeling
of
something
have
be
really
exist
,
this
one
have
the
feeling
of
have
feeling
of
be
really
exist
,
this
one
then
have
slow
solemn
expression
.
I
be
tell
some
one
yesterday
evening
,
no
I
do
not
think
I
be
tell
any
one
this
thing
yesterday
evening
.
I
would
have
be
tell
some
one
yesterday
evening
if
I
have
not
in
a
way
not
be
want
to
tell
that
one
this
thing
,
that
each
one
could
be
find
another
one
interesting
if
each
one
feel
another
one
be
in
act
of
feel
the
way
that
one
really
be
feel
be
live
.
I
can
not
come
to
be
more
certain
ever
of
anything
than
I
be
of
how
very
interesting
it
be
to
I
in
my
be
one
be
live
to
be
certain
of
the
feeling
there
be
be
in
each
one
and
how
that
feeling
come
out
of
each
one
as
expression
.
the
one
I
be
go
to
be
tell
this
thing
to
last
evening
be
one
have
it
that
he
be
sympathetically
realise
this
about
each
one
who
have
be
express
himself
in
something
write
or
paint
or
win
in
fighting
or
governing
,
or
think
or
discover
,
this
one
can
not
be
rightly
certain
although
this
one
be
very
often
tell
about
this
thing
and
this
one
be
very
often
quite
certain
what
the
being
be
in
any
one
as
experience
when
the
expression
be
not
a
formulated
one
.
now
I
can
learn
it
by
love
repeat
,
love
repeating
be
in
I
and
so
to
I
every
one
be
have
as
it
be
come
out
of
they
formulate
expression
.
love
repeat
in
I
make
of
I
then
one
understanding
be
in
man
and
woman
,
and
the
relation
of
expression
come
out
of
each
one
to
the
being
make
they
of
they
.
so
then
any
one
can
know
that
be
one
love
hearing
see
feeling
repeat
have
make
of
I
a
very
wise
one
.




I
be
commence
now
again
a
description
of
Julia
come
to
know
some
man
and
some
woman
sometime
in
her
living
.
I
be
begin
again
describe
being
and
expression
of
the
being
of
they
come
out
of
they
of
some
man
and
some
woman
Julia
come
to
know
in
living
.




it
be
a
queer
thing
that
some
one
want
to
be
give
and
give
some
one
something
be
not
give
that
one
what
that
one
be
want
.
it
be
a
queer
thing
that
some
be
want
to
be
give
some
something
and
be
give
some
something
and
be
not
give
they
what
they
be
want
,
what
they
be
need
for
their
living
.
it
be
a
queer
thing
that
some
be
realise
sometime
that
some
other
one
be
see
,
be
remember
something
that
one
can
not
be
see
by
look
,
can
not
be
remember
by
any
kind
of
try
to
remember
that
thing
.
it
be
a
queer
feeling
to
be
really
certain
that
one
be
not
remember
the
way
another
one
be
remember
,
be
not
see
the
way
another
one
be
see
,
it
be
a
queer
feeling
to
be
completely
realise
the
way
another
one
be
see
something
another
one
be
realise
something
and
to
be
quite
certain
by
realise
that
one
can
not
be
see
,
can
not
be
remember
that
thing
.
it
be
a
completely
queer
feeling
,
this
that
I
be
describe
.
it
be
a
completely
queer
feeling
to
be
realise
that
some
one
be
see
something
,
be
feel
something
be
remember
something
,
to
be
completely
realise
that
one
be
feel
,
be
remember
,
be
see
something
and
to
be
completely
realise
that
one
realise
another
one
's
feeling
see
remember
that
thing
can
not
one
's
self
feel
see
and
remember
that
thing
.
I
can
say
that
have
such
a
feeling
be
completely
have
a
queer
feeling
in
be
one
be
live
.
I
can
say
that
I
be
have
completely
a
queer
feeling
when
I
be
realise
that
I
be
not
be
feel
,
see
,
remember
something
when
I
be
completely
realise
some
one
else
be
feel
,
see
,
remember
that
thing
.
I
have
then
a
completely
queer
feeling
,
I
have
be
have
a
completely
queer
feeling
,
I
have
be
realise
some
one
be
able
to
be
feel
,
remember
,
see
something
and
I
have
be
realise
that
I
be
not
able
to
be
feel
,
remember
,
see
that
thing
.
it
be
not
a
completely
queer
feeling
if
one
be
not
completely
realise
some
one
's
experience
something
and
completely
realise
not
be
go
to
be
,
not
be
experience
that
thing
.
this
thing
then
be
the
complete
thing
in
have
complete
queer
feeling
in
living
.
I
well
tell
about
,
this
again
and
again
.
it
be
in
I
now
,
it
will
be
in
I
again
and
again
.
it
be
in
I
now
,
it
will
be
in
I
very
often
.
I
be
now
begin
the
ending
of
my
telling
about
the
living
in
Julia
Hersland
and
Alfred
Hersland
and
other
woman
and
other
man
know
they
.




some
one
be
say
of
some
one
that
he
be
an
interesting
one
,
he
want
himself
to
be
such
an
earnest
one
,
his
father
be
not
an
earnest
one
that
be
a
thing
he
be
use
to
in
his
living
,
his
mother
be
an
indolent
one
,
he
be
pretty
well
used
to
that
thing
that
she
be
an
indolent
one
,
his
brother
be
certainly
not
an
earnest
one
he
have
not
any
hope
that
he
could
be
in
living
,
a
fellow
who
be
such
a
one
as
his
brother
be
,
an
earnest
one
,
he
himself
be
not
ever
keep
go
in
be
an
earnest
one
,
this
one
then
be
as
another
one
say
of
he
one
ask
very
much
of
himself
in
live
and
he
be
not
succeed
,
very
likely
would
not
be
succeed
in
go
on
be
an
earnest
one
and
he
be
not
a
disappointed
one
one
disappoint
with
living
,
he
be
one
not
really
fill
with
any
earnest
feeling
in
be
one
be
live
,
he
have
earnest
feeling
of
know
that
not
any
one
in
his
family
have
be
be
in
live
an
earnest
one
and
this
make
of
he
in
a
way
one
who
could
be
in
live
if
he
would
be
,
a
disappointed
one
.
so
then
as
some
one
say
of
this
one
this
one
be
one
feel
it
in
he
that
he
might
have
be
expect
have
earnest
feeling
come
to
be
be
inside
he
but
he
do
not
come
to
be
expect
this
thing
as
he
be
almost
certain
that
his
father
do
not
have
ever
inside
he
earnest
feeling
,
that
his
mother
certainly
be
one
go
to
be
go
on
be
indolent
in
be
live
,
that
his
brother
certainly
never
would
have
anything
in
he
of
earnest
feeling
,
and
then
he
to
himself
as
one
to
be
realise
by
he
would
not
come
to
have
inside
in
he
certainly
earnest
feeling
,
that
be
very
likely
to
be
not
in
he
this
earnest
feeling
that
he
be
expect
from
some
one
inside
he
.
so
then
this
one
as
this
other
one
say
of
he
be
a
very
moral
man
.
he
certainly
ask
a
great
deal
of
himself
,
that
be
what
this
other
one
say
about
this
one
,
this
one
that
the
other
one
say
be
one
who
be
certainly
a
very
moral
one
in
his
be
one
go
on
be
live
.
this
one
then
as
I
be
say
be
a
very
moral
man
in
be
one
expect
very
much
from
himself
inside
he
in
his
be
one
be
live
.
he
certainly
be
not
have
it
in
he
very
expectantly
feel
this
expectation
of
have
earnest
feeling
go
on
be
in
he
but
he
certainly
be
a
moral
one
in
have
this
very
certain
realisation
that
not
his
father
not
his
mother
not
his
brother
not
himself
in
learn
living
be
an
earnest
one
in
feel
anything
.




it
be
a
very
amusing
thing
hear
some
realise
other
one
be
moral
one
in
living
.
she
should
do
it
,
she
want
so
much
from
herself
to
herself
in
living
,
let
she
pay
herself
for
be
one
go
to
be
go
to
be
a
good
one
.
that
be
what
some
one
be
say
about
some
one
.
it
be
very
interesting
to
be
help
some
one
go
to
be
a
good
one
.
it
be
certain
that
some
be
go
to
be
good
one
in
living
.
it
be
certain
that
to
some
this
be
in
some
other
one
very
unbecoming
.
it
be
certain
that
to
some
this
in
some
other
one
be
very
become
.
I
have
be
help
some
with
this
thing
with
come
to
be
go
to
be
a
good
one
.
I
have
be
help
some
very
much
in
this
thing
.
each
one
be
herself
,
be
himself
inside
her
inside
he
and
it
be
certainly
a
very
interesting
thing
help
each
one
,
help
some
of
each
kind
of
they
to
be
go
to
be
a
good
one
.
I
have
sometimes
be
help
some
,
with
very
much
feeling
and
serious
consideration
and
steady
struggle
and
earnest
attention
,
I
have
sometimes
be
help
some
to
go
to
be
a
good
one
in
their
living
for
they
.
I
have
quite
often
be
do
this
thing
.
I
be
now
go
on
tell
a
little
more
about
the
middle
living
in
Julia
Hersland
and
in
some
come
to
know
she
then
.
she
be
then
to
herself
inside
her
one
honest
in
all
daily
living
,
one
certainly
have
courage
in
be
one
certainly
go
to
be
go
on
live
,
one
certainly
go
to
be
learn
anything
,
one
certainly
to
herself
inside
she
in
a
way
certainly
a
good
one
.




one
cousin
be
dead
,
another
be
quite
a
sick
one
.
that
be
not
so
strange
as
they
be
then
in
the
middle
of
their
middle
living
,
it
be
not
strange
and
yet
it
be
certainly
something
one
be
not
wish
to
have
happen
just
then
.
it
be
natural
that
when
there
be
very
many
of
a
family
living
and
very
many
cousin
and
some
aunt
and
uncle
live
that
sometimes
some
of
they
should
be
sick
one
,
even
that
once
in
a
while
one
of
they
should
come
to
be
a
dead
one
.
in
a
way
it
be
a
strange
thing
because
very
often
for
many
year
not
any
one
in
the
family
connection
be
a
seriously
sick
one
,
not
any
one
be
ever
think
of
any
one
they
be
then
know
as
any
where
near
to
any
dying
.
sometimes
it
happen
that
one
cousin
be
quite
a
sick
one
,
sometimes
it
happen
that
all
the
uncle
be
dead
by
then
and
only
two
aunt
be
still
live
.
sometimes
it
happen
in
a
family
live
that
all
the
aunt
and
some
of
the
uncle
be
still
live
.
sometimes
it
happen
that
the
aunt
and
uncle
that
be
sister
and
brother
of
the
mother
of
some
one
be
all
live
and
the
mother
the
sister
of
these
uncle
and
aunt
be
the
only
one
of
that
family
who
be
not
then
any
long
live
.
sometimes
it
happen
that
pretty
nearly
every
one
of
the
brother
of
a
father
of
some
one
be
not
any
long
live
and
the
father
then
after
some
more
year
of
be
live
be
not
any
long
live
.
there
be
then
sometimes
in
family
live
when
there
be
not
any
one
who
be
then
a
seriously
sick
one
,
that
there
have
not
be
any
one
during
many
year
come
to
be
not
any
long
a
live
one
.
some
have
some
feeling
in
they
that
sometime
some
one
who
be
a
cousin
will
be
a
seriously
sick
one
and
some
one
who
be
a
cousin
will
come
to
be
not
any
long
live
.
some
be
feel
that
sometime
quite
a
number
who
be
cousin
to
they
will
not
be
any
long
live
.
Julia
Hersland
be
in
the
ending
of
her
middle
living
.
Mrs.
Dehning
have
be
for
sometime
not
any
long
live
.
Mr.
Dehning
be
not
any
long
live
.
Julia
Hersland
go
on
be
one
be
live
until
well
to
the
end
of
her
old
living
.
she
have
a
brother
George
and
a
sister
Hortense
.
these
be
both
a
good
deal
young
.
she
have
child
who
be
live
.
she
be
not
really
ever
marry
again
although
of
course
it
would
have
be
quite
a
natural
thing
for
she
to
marry
again
and
to
marry
William
Beckling
.
he
come
as
I
say
to
be
a
sick
one
but
he
really
do
not
come
to
be
a
dead
one
until
the
beginning
of
his
old
living
.
you
never
can
tell
anything
certainly
about
such
a
thing
.




I
be
certainly
go
to
be
tell
more
about
feel
be
in
live
.
I
will
tell
some
more
about
feel
be
in
living
,
feel
certain
that
one
be
be
in
live
in
some
and
then
in
some
other
man
and
woman
.
I
will
not
worry
any
one
just
now
with
this
thing
.
this
be
in
I
for
I
and
I
be
certainly
not
scare
myself
with
this
thing
.
I
certainly
would
not
be
frightening
any
one
in
living
.
I
certainly
would
be
want
every
one
to
be
certain
that
they
be
feel
themselves
be
live
.
some
like
the
being
they
have
in
they
.
some
be
frightened
and
then
they
do
the
thing
that
frighten
they
.
some
be
glad
that
when
they
have
be
sick
one
it
be
of
a
kind
of
sickness
that
be
not
a
very
expensive
one
.
some
when
they
have
a
sickness
need
expensive
medicine
to
cure
they
.
some
be
certain
that
some
other
one
be
always
certain
to
be
need
to
have
money
spend
,
and
that
they
be
of
the
kind
in
man
and
woman
who
even
when
they
come
to
be
sick
one
have
a
kind
of
sickness
come
to
they
that
do
not
need
expensive
medicine
for
cure
.
some
be
certain
that
they
would
be
strong
to
be
struggle
if
they
be
anywhere
where
they
need
to
be
win
by
fight
,
one
be
say
that
she
be
the
kind
of
one
who
would
be
hold
out
until
she
would
be
a
dead
one
because
it
be
what
she
need
for
her
satisfaction
,
but
she
say
she
would
not
really
be
hold
out
as
she
might
have
be
do
because
she
would
not
want
that
her
husband
should
be
lose
a
chance
to
be
earn
a
living
by
work
.
some
be
quite
right
in
say
that
they
be
one
be
one
strong
to
be
win
,
some
be
quite
right
then
in
say
such
a
thing
and
these
then
some
of
they
be
win
in
living
and
some
of
they
be
not
win
in
living
.
some
be
quite
right
in
say
that
they
be
one
to
certainly
injure
some
one
and
then
it
be
some
one
not
that
one
who
be
injure
that
one
.
some
be
quite
right
in
say
they
be
one
to
injure
some
one
,
some
do
then
injure
some
one
,
some
do
then
not
injure
some
one
.
some
be
quite
right
to
be
ask
a
question
after
they
have
be
silently
listen
while
other
people
have
be
talk
,
some
be
quite
right
in
not
then
let
themselves
be
ask
a
question
.
some
be
certainly
quite
right
to
be
listen
very
quietly
very
often
,
some
be
quite
right
to
be
almost
never
do
this
thing
.




I
will
tell
now
a
very
little
more
how
Julia
Hersland
and
some
other
do
something
,
do
everything
.




each
one
be
come
gradually
to
be
know
in
their
living
what
way
be
be
inside
in
man
in
woman
when
they
be
quite
young
one
,
completely
little
one
,
old
one
,
middle
aged

how
be
be
in
man
,
in

more
difference
than
just
very
young
living
,
young
living
,
middle
living
and
old
living
.
again
and
again
it
be
a
startling
thing
to
some
one
to
be
learn
piece
of
this
thing
of
the
way
being
be
at

something
about
be
in

and
in

when
they
be

and

.

and
three
year
old
in

something
about
they
when
they

,
a
very
little
when
they
be
seventeen
almost
nothing

.
I
know
a
very

and
some
then
when

healthy
one
.
I

and
I
,
I
be
just

,
find

quite
astonishing
to
be
really
realise
be
sixty
year
old
and
be
in
live
in
man
and
in

.




Alfred
Hersland
come
to
be
old
than
sixty
in
living
,
Julia
come
to
be
a
little
old
in
living
,
Minnie
who
marry
Alfred
later
do
not
come
in
live
to
be
sixty
before
she
come
to
an
ending
,
Mr.
Dehning
come
to
be
sixty
and
he
be
pretty
well
begin
then
to
be
quite
an
old
man
,
Mr.
Hersland
come
to
be
old
a
good
deal
old
than
sixty
before
he
be
not
any
long
one
be
live
,
he
be
when
he
be
sixty
in
a
way
then
a
completely
old
one
,
he
be
then
in
a
way
then
not
at
all
a
completely
old
one
.
I
will
tell
about
be
old
one
later
in
the
description
of
Dehning
and
Hersland
family
live
be
completely
then
for
that
generation
end
and
end
.




Minnie
Mason
as
I
say
be
married
to
Alfred
Hersland
.
she
would
never
have
it
that
she
would
not
be
married
to
he
when
they
be
begin
to
be
need
be
one
in
living
.
she
certainly
see
to
it
that
they
could
then
be
marry
and
quite
reasonably
happily
marry
then
.
she
know
David
Hersland
then
.
she
tell
he
she
like
he
and
she
would
be
a
nice
sister
-
in
-
law
to
he
.
she
be
quite
a
nice
sister
-
in
-
law
to
he
.
she
have
not
really
much
interest
in
Alfred
having
be
married
to
Julia
Dehning
except
only
that
it
would
be
certain
that
Julia
should
be
free
from
he
so
that
she
herself
should
marry
Alfred
Hersland
when
they
come
to
need
to
be
together
for
live
.
so
then
Alfred
Hersland
go
on
live
as
I
be
say
.
Julia
Hersland
go
on
live
as
I
have
be
say
.
I
will
tell
now
a
little
more
about
these
thing
,
about
be
in
live
.




certainly
some
be
love
each
other
more
in
living
than
mostly
any
one
be
love
any
other
one
.
this
be
not
a
thing
ever
come
to
be
in
Julia
Dehning
,
this
be
not
a
thing
that
ever
come
to
be
really
in
Alfred
Hersland
.
they
have
love
be
sometimes
in
they
each
one
of
they
.
I
have
say
this
of
they
again
and
again
.
almost
every
one
ever
know
either
one
of
they
think
of
each
one
of
they
that
they
have
each
one
of
they
sometime
love
feeling
in
they
.
I
have
tell
about
love
feeling
be
in
Alfred
Hersland
.
I
have
tell
about
love
feeling
be
in
Julia
Dehning
.
in
a
way
love
feeling
could
be
quite
poignantly
in
Julia
Dehning
and
she
could
have
sweetness
in
she
then
as
be
in
she
then
.
in
a
way
though
as
I
be
say
she
have
always
in
her
stupid
be
as
have
it
in
she
to
be
always
resist
have
any
way
in
she
of
really
learn
anything
and
in
a
way
she
do
not
have
any
sweetness
in
she
with
this
be
in
she
.
this
stupid
being
be
certainly
always
be
in
she
and
active
enough
inside
she
.
in
a
way
then
she
certainly
have
not
really
sweetness
as
actively
in
she
as
there
be
not
any
sweetness
in
she
with
the
stupid
being
of
she
active
in
she
and
stupid
be
in
she
be
always
active
inside
she
.
she
certainly
be
one
not
learn
anything
in
be
one
be
in
living
,
she
be
one
certainly
have
a
dominant
courage
in
she
from
be
one
certainly
go
on
be
live
,
she
be
one
have
certainly
earnest
intention
as
be
in
she
from
be
one
always
want
to
have
teach
be
in
the
world
as
always
exist
,
she
be
one
be
fairly
interesting
,
from
be
one
be
really
excited
in
be
one
always
be
live
,
she
be
one
certainly
be
harsh
and
be
troublesome
and
be
without
realise
anything
without
feel
anything
in
be
one
need
anything
as
anything
could
be
to
she
as
something
on
which
to
be
feed
,
she
certainly
be
one
have
affection
and
be
in
dehne
family
Jiving
,
she
be
one
having
certainly
sometimes
love
feeling
and
have
this
poignantly
with
sweetness
in
being
and
sweetness
in
kissing
and
she
be
one
certainly
have
stupid
be
as
be
in

all
her

so
that
she
be
everlasting
,
actively
resist
change
at
all
in
attack
.

be
one
as
I
be

not
fail

the
way
to

this
thing
,
I
have
not
get
the
money

I
my
money
every
month
that
be
what
I
mean
by
what
I
be
say
.
that
be
what
I
be
mean
say
that
one
,
you
be
need
the
money
to
-
day
to
your
feeling
,
I
be
need
the
money
to
-
day
we
will
say
to
my
feeling
but
you
do
not
need
the
money
to
-
day
to
your
feeling
,
that
be
what
you
be
mean
,
money
be
a
thing
like
work
you
be
give
it
when
you
be
feel
that
you
be
need
the
money
to
be
give
it
,
I
be
give
work
because
I
be
need
money
to
be
receive
it
,
say
this
one
.
I
have
a
confused
feeling
then
.
money
be
something
I
be
own
yes
,
but
not
own
because
it
be
like
be
in
myself
that
I
need
to
be
live
,
have
money
be
as
natural
to
I
then
as
be
in
living
and
I
could
not
be
spend
it
irregularly
,
I
must
spend
it
as
an
income
.
I
have
it
yes
but
not
to
give
except
when
regularly
I
have
some
.
it
be
confuse
that
I
be
so
certain
I
have
not
the
money
then
and
yet
certainly
I
could
get
the
money
then
but
it
be
not
possible
to
get
the
money
then
for
I
could
not
feel
I
could
be
need
really
to
be
spend
the
money
I
could
get
then
when
it
be
not
the
time
to
get
this
money
as
money
to
be
spend
.
some
have
such
a
feeling
in
living
,
some
have
not
such
a
feeling
in
living
.
some
can
not
really
believe
it
that
any
one
be
spend
money
when
they
be
not
certain
that
the
family
have
money
that
give
that
money
to
they
.
some
really
can
never
believe
this
thing
of
any
one
.
some
be
certain
that
every
one
who
be
not
live
by
daily
pay
for
working
can
ever
be
without
have
enough
for
some
kind
of
living
.
I
be
feel
always
more
and
more
in
live
how
certainly
some
be
certain
of
something
.
in
a
way
it
be
a
personal
thing
for
they
,
in
a
way
it
be
a
family
affair
in
they
,
in
a
way
it
be
a
way
of
live
in
a
national
way
for
they
,
in
a
way
it
be
a
way
of
living
of
the
local
way
in
they
,
in
a
way
it
be
a
way
of
live
their
kind
in
man
and
woman
have
in
be
in
live
.
it
be
certainly
quite
completely
a
difficult
thing
for
any
one
to
be
remember
how
any
one
else
be
do
their
daily
living
,
in
a
way
it
be
quite
a
difficult
thing
for
some
,
for
quite
a
number
of
man
for
quite
a
number
of
woman
to
be
remember
how
they
be
get
along
from
time
to
time
to
be
in
living
.
it
be
very
often
astonishing
to
be
realise
complete
be
in
live
in
man
and
in
woman
.
it
be
certainly
astonishing
to
know
it
of
each
one
what
that
one
have
do
in
be
in
live
in
himself
inside
he
,
to
himself
inside
he
,
with
other
one
,
with
some
other
one
,
to
any
other
one
,
to
some
one
.
I
be
say
this
thing
because
I
be
in
living
and
because
very
many
man
and
very
many
woman
be
live
.
I
be
say
this
thing
because
I
certainly
be
go
on
be
in
living
because
very
many
man
and
very
many
woman
be
certainly
go
on
be
in
living

I
do
ask
some
,
I
would
ask
every
one
,
I
do
not
ask
some
because
I
be
quite
certain
that
they
would
not
like
I
to
ask
it
,
I
do
ask
some
if
they
would
mind
it
if
they
find
out
that
they
do
have
the
name
they
have
then
and
have
be
having
be
bear
not
in
the
family
living
they
be
then
live
in
,
if
they
have
be
bear
illegitimate
.
I
ask
some
and
I
would
ask
every
one
only
I
be
quite
certain
very
many
would
not
like
to
have
I
ask
it
if
they
would
like
it
,
if
they
would
very
much
dislike
it
,
if
they
would
make
a
tragedy
of
it
,
if
they
would
make
a
joke
of
it
,
if
they
find
they
have
in
they
blood
of
some
kind
of
a
being
that
be
a
low
kind
to
they
.
I
would
like
to
know
how
every
one
can
be
feel
about
such
a
thing
,
if
they
have
any
feeling
about
any
such
thing
.
David
Hersland
be
the

of
Mr.

in
his
young

he
never
think
about
any
such
thing
as
that
about
which
I
have
just
be
tell
.
in
his
later

he
like
think
about
feel
such
thing
,
think
such
thing
be
in
man

.
some
when
they

be
think
then
about
such
thing
.
he
be
never
at
all

be
a
young
one
think
about
any

do
not
know
then
that
that
one
be
a
dead
one
.
some
have
be
certain
that
every
one
who
be
a
dead
one
do
not
then
know
that
that
one
be
a
dead
one
.




it
be
a
surprising
thing
sometimes
to
be
learn
which
one
of
some
one
have
be
know
be
quite
certain
and
say
the
thing
then
as
a
very
simple
thing
that
anybody
can
be
know
that
some
one
who
have
be
with
they
be
a
dead
one
be
not
know
that
that
one
be
a
dead
one
.




it
be
certainly
something
that
some
be
say
when
some
one
who
be
with
they
be
a
dead
one
that
that
one
be
not
know
then
that
that
one
be
a
dead
one
.
some
like
very
well
to
be
hear
some
one
say
this
thing
that
some
one
be
a
dead
one
and
be
certainly
then
not
know
this
thing
.
some
like
very
well
hear
this
thing
.
some
be
not
want
ever
to
be
hear
any
thing
about
any
one
ever
be
a
dead
one
.
this
will
soon
now
be
the
beginning
of
a
description
of
living
that
David
Hersland
do
before
he
come
to
be
a
dead
one
.




some
be
satisfied
with
having
be
live
when
they
be
come
to
be
a
dead
one
with
not
having
have
in
they
any
very
sick
feeling
,
any
very
bad
thing
to
be
do
,
any
very
hard
work
for
they
in
they
,
not
any
queer
feeling
of
not
having
have
their
head
quite
right
inside
they
.
some
be
satisfied
then
with
having
be
live
one
when
they
have
come
to
be
a
dead
one
,
some
be
not
satisfied
then
with
having
come
to
be
then
a
dead
one
.
some
be
satisfied
,
some
be
not
satisfied
with
having
be
one
be
live
.
some
be
quite
satisfied
with
having
be
one
have
live
in
they
,
some
be
not
satisfied
at
all
with
this
thing
.
some
be
very
well
satisfied
with
having
come
to
be
a
dead
one
,
some
be
not
at
all
satisfied
with
this
thing
.




some
one
give
to
another
one
a
stubborn
feeling
when
that
one
could
be
convincing
that
other
one
if
that
other
one
would
then
continue
listen
.
some
be
certain
that
sometimes
they
can
be
convince
by
some
one
.
some
be
certain
they
be
sometimes
convince
by
some
one
.
some
be
certain
that
they
could
be
conceive
sometimes
by
some
one
but
that
they
will
not
be
let
themselves
ever
have
any
such
a
thing
happen
to
they
.
some
like
be
convince
of
some
thing
by
some
,
by
some
one
.




some
one
and
I
certainly
never
do
think
that
one
ever
could
do
such
a
thing
have
it
to
be
so
strongly
repeat
the
fact
that
one
be
remember
that
almost
always
I
be
always
convinced
that
I
have
be
wrong
in
my
feeling
.
I
certainly
be
not
certain
whether
I
ever
can
be
certain
whether
I
ever
be
when
I
be
feel
something
justify
from
my
way
of
feel
anything
in
have
such
a
feeling
when
this
one
be
repeat
the
way
that
one
be
remember
everything
.
some
one
say
about
some
one
who
be
say
something
that
seem
a
very
foolish
thing
to
some
one
about
how
some
one
do
something
,
but
that
one
be
not
say
foolish
thing
,
she
be
judge
from
the
feeling
of
be
convenience
and
inconvenience
that
she
would
be
have
and
that
be
all
that
concern
she
in
her
judging
.
it
be
not
a
foolish
thing
then
that
that
one
have
be
say
.
no
,
there
be
many
way
of
not
be
a
foolish
one
in
be
live
.
there
be
certainly
lot
and
lot
of
they
of
way
of
not
be
a
foolish
one
in
be
in
living
.
so
then
some
certainly
could
be
convince
I
of
many
thing
if
I
go
on
listen
.
I
be
quite
certain
that
this
be
certain
.




David
Hersland
be
a
dead
one
before
he
be

be
a
very
difficult

how
it
can
be
not
active
in
they
,
why
they
like
have
their
being
in
they
,
why
they
do
not
like
have
their
being
in
they
.
mostly
every
one
have
listen
some
when
I
have
be
tell
they
about
be
in
they
.
some
have
listen
and
I
have
think
that
they
be
believe
what
I
be
tell
they
and
then
many
year
after
they
have
be
tell
that
they
be
certain
then
that
I
be
tell
they
then
what
I
have
not
any
reason
to
believe
be
true
of
they
.
and
sometimes
then
later
when
they
tell
I
such
a
thing
they
find
it
that
I
be
not
certain
that
I
be
not
then
do
this
thing
.
some
make
of
themselves
a
new
one
by
my
tell
they
about
the
being
in
they
and
to
very
many
then
they
be
quite
a
new
one
and
to
some
then
they
be
not
at
all
a
new
one
,
they
be
quite
an
old
one
.
some
like
listen
and
later
then
they
have
a
frightened
feeling
that
I
will
influence
they
to
be
another
one
,
they
do
not
like
very
well
some
of
they
what
they
be
in
living
,
they
do
like
some
of
they
what
they
be
in
living
,
they
be
quite
certain
they
do
not
want
I
to
be
influence
they
.
some
be
listen
and
I
be
talk
and
I
be
talk
and
then
they
ask
a
question
and
then
I
say
to
myself
that
word
can
have
a
meaning
to
some
one
and
a
meaning
to
some
other
one
and
that
I
be
talk
and
that
that
one
be
intelligently
listen
and
that
that
one
have
then
ask
this
question
.
I
have
tell
so
many
so
much
about
the
being
in
they
.
I
will

about
some
I
be
know
in

more
with
that

be
now
again
and
again
certain
that
I
will
not

of
very
many
man

I
could
realise
the
experiencing
in
each
one

be
say
that
there
be
not
so
very
many
kind
in
man
and
woman
as
I
be
feel
be
in
man
and
woman
,
but
as
I
be
say
each
one
of
a
kind
in
man
and
woman
have
be
in
that
one
be
differently
in
he
from
be
in
any
other
one
of
that
kind
of
they
.
I
be
now
begin
describe
be
in
David
Hersland
,
I
will
be
tell
very
much
now
about
talk
and
listen
,
I
will
be
describe
in
many
various
way
quite
a
number
of
man
and
quite
a
number
of
woman
.




each
one
be
mostly
all
his
living
all
her
living
,
a
young
one
,
an
old
one
,
one
in
middle
living
,
an
old
one
to
themselves
,
to
any
one
,
to
some
one
.
that
be
to
say
not
any
one
be
all
his
living
all
her
live
to
any
one
,
that
be
to
say
not
any
one
hardly
be
feel
another
one
be
a
young
one
and
then
an
old
one
and
then
an
old
one
.
it
be
a
very
strange
thing
this
thing
and
an
interesting
thing
that
almost
not
any
one
be
to
any
one
be
to
themselves
inside
they
one
having
be
in
all
part
of
be
live
.
that
be
to
say
it
be
very
striking
one
man
be
write
about
some
one
and
that
one
about
whom
that
one
be
write
be
to
that
one
say
an
old
man
.
that
one
write
tell
about
that
man
be
a
young
one
,
tell
about
that
man
be
a
middle
aged
one
and
always
it
be
a
description
of
the
old
man
who
be
once
a
young
man
,
a
child
,
a
middle
aged
man
,
it
be
not
a
description
of
a
young
man
a
middle
aged
man
or
a
child
.
it
be
the
same
thing
if
some
one
be
a
child
to
some
one
feeling
that
one
,
tell
about
that
one
,
that
one
may
be
describe
as
an
old
one
,
a
middle
aged
one
an
old
one
but
it
be
always
then
a
description
of
a
child
having
become
a
middle
aged
one
,
an
old
one
,
an
old
one
.
so
then
this
be
certain
that
each
one
be
to
some
one
for
all
of
the
living
ever
in
that
one
a
child
,
to
some
one
,
a
baby
,
to
some
one
,
an
old
one
,
to
some
one
,
a
middle
aged
one
,
to
some
one
,
an
old
one
,
to
some
one
.
I
be
not
say
that
not
any
one
can
be
feel
more
than
one
stage
of
be
in
themselves
,
in
any
other
one
,
but
I
be
really
almost
say
this
thing
.
it
be
an
interesting
thing
that
each
one
in
a
way
be
feel
the
world
be
exist
in
this
kind
of
way
too
in
they
.
those
feel
the
world
an
old
thing
be
only
feel
this
thing
,
those
feel
the
world
a
new
thing
be
only
feel
this
thing
,
those
feel
the
world
to
be
having
have
a
past
living
be
only
feel
it
as
a
thing
have
description
and
so
on
and
so
on
and
it
be
extraordinary
how
not
any
one
can
be
convincing
in
tell
about
one
be
a
young
man
if
they
be
feel
the
living
being
in
that
one
be
that
of
an
old
one
.
mostly
every
one
be
in
some
place
in
be
live
to
every
one
know
that
one
and
that
be
the
complete
realisation
that
each
one
be
have
of
that
one
.
always
then
this
come
to
be
to
I
more
an
extraordinary
thing
that
not
any
one
can
really
be
tell
the
whole
history
,
can
really
be
realise
the
whole
go
on
of
be
in
they
,
that
not
any
one
can
be
tell
the
whole
history
of
any
one
,
that
not
any
one
can
be
realise
the
whole
time
of
be
go
on
be
of
be
in
any
one
.
I
do
certainly
think
this
to
be
an
extraordinary
thing
.
mostly
then
as
I
be
say
not
any
one
be
feel
any
other
one
really
having
be
in
live
a
young
one
an
old
one
a
middle
aged
one
,
an
old
one
.
really
then
mostly
every
one
all
the
living
of
some
one
be
feel
that
one
to
have
be
a
young
one
or
an
old
one
,
or
a
middle
aged
one
or
an
old
one
.




listening
do
not
help
one
with
this
thing
because
as
I
be
say
each
one
be
feel
themselves
as
having
be
an
old
one
,
a
middle
aged
one
,
a
young
one
,
a
young
one
all
their
living
and
when
they
an
old
one
talk
about
themselves
as
a
young
one
,
it
be
a
description
of
an
old
one
having
be
a
young
one
,
not
a
realising
of
be
a
young
one
,
and
so
on
and
so
on
and
so
each
one
be
in
themselves
in
feel
one
having
be
in
all
live
a
young
one
,
or
an
old
one
,
or
a
middle
aged
one
,
or
an
old
one
.




I
do
use
to
find
this
very
perplexing
this
difficulty
each
one
have
of
realise
whole
be
having
be
go
on
be
in
any
one
,
in
themselves
inside
they
.
it
be
a
very
useful
thing
that
always
in
live
there
be
some
be
young
one
some
be
old
one
,
some
be
middle
aged
one
,
some
be
old
one
so
that
one
can
always
be
certain
that
not
any
one
have
be
live
without
all
the
being
in
they
having
be
go
on
be
as
be
a
young
one
an
old
one
a
middle
aged
one
,
an
old
one
.
as
I
be
say
listen
be
not
help
any
one
very
much
with
this
thing
,
know
one
self
inside
one
be
not
help
one
very
much
with
this
thing
,
talk
about
be
having
be
in
one
be
not
help
one
very
much
with
this
thing
.
know
family
living
be
help
some
with
this
thing
,
have
little
way
in
moment
inside
one
in
feeling
,
in
do
something
perhaps
be
help
something
with
this
thing
,
mostly
not
anything
be
really
help
one
do
this
thing
,
realise
the
whole
be
having
be
,
go
on
,
go
to
be
go
on
in
any
one
.
so
then
I
be
not
think
about
do
this
thing
.
I
be
think
about
tell
about
be
be
in
man
and
in
woman
,
I
be
think
about
tell
about
talk
and
listen
that
some
man
and
some
woman
be
do
,
that
mostly
every
one
be
or
be
or
will
be
do
.
I
be
think
then
about
tell
about
know
be
be
in
man
and
in
woman
.
I
be
think
then
about
listen
and
talk
being
,
go
to
be
be
,
having
be
be
in
some
man
in
some
woman
.

I
be
trouble
with
man
and
with
woman
,
I
be
trouble
by
man
and
by
woman
.
I
be
troubled
that
each
one
be
experience
each
thing
they
be
experience
the
way
each
one
be
experience
each
thing
.
I
do
not
want
that
any
one
should
experience
anything
any
way
but
the
way
each
one
be
experience
that
thing
.
I
certainly
do
not
want
it
that
any
one
should
experience
anything
in
any
way
that
that
one
be
not
experience
a
thing
.
no
I
do
not
want
anything
to
be
at
all
a
different
thing
in
the
way
each
one
be
experience
each
thing
,
no
I
do
not
want
anything
to
be
different
in
experience
than
it
be
in
each
one
,
I
certainly
do
not
,
I
may
but
I
doubt
it
,
I
certainly
do
not
,
I
be
certain
of
this
thing
.
I
certainly
do
not
want
any
one
to
be
experience
anything
in
a
different
way
than
the
way
they
have
it
in
they
to
experience
that
thing
.
I
be
troubled
as
I
be
say
with
each
one
be
one
experience
the
way
each
one
be
experience
,
I
be
trouble
by
each
one
experience
the
way
each
one
be
experience
each
thing
.
I
be
troubled
,
I
say
I
be
very
much
trouble
by
each
one
be
that
one
experience
each
thing
as
that
one
be
experience
that
thing
.
I
certainly
be
very
much
troubled
with
this
thing
.
each
one
be
experience
each
thing
in
the
way
that
one
be
experience
each
thing
.
I
certainly
do
not
at
all
want
that
each
one
should
not
be
experience
each
thing
the
way
that
one
be
experience
that
thing
.
some
say
I
do
want
each
one
to
be
experience
differently
from
the
way
each
one
be
experience
each
thing
,
I
may
but
I
doubt
this
thing
,
I
certainly
be
certain
that
I
do
not
want
that
each
one
be
experience
each
thing
differently
from
the
way
each
one
be
experience
each
thing
.
so
then
I
want
it
that
each
one
be
experience
each
thing
the
way
each
one
be
experience
each
thing
.
I
certainly
do
not
want
it
that
each
one
be
experience
each
thing
in
a
way
each
one
be
not
experience
each
thing
.
I
be
as
I
be
say
trouble
with
each
one
experience
each
thing
the
way
each
one
be
experience
each
thing
.
I
certainly
be
trouble
by
each
one
be
experience
each
thing
the
way
each
one
be
experience
each
thing
.




some
be
not
succeed
in

,
some
be
succeed
in

.
some
be
feel
some

succeed
in

,
some
be
not
feel
that
one
to
be
one
succeed
in

.
some
be
one
be
certain
that
sometime
something
will
be
work
in
a
different
way
from
the
way
that
thing
be
now
work
.
some
be
certain
that
everything
will
be
work
differently
from
the
way
everything
be
now
work
.
some
as
I
be

be
understand
something
one
way
,
some

David

have
it
that
each

have
love
in
they
have
on
he
some
effect
to
make
of
he
in
some
way
one
submit
to
that
one
.
he
be
then
one
in
a
way
do
very
much
submit
.
some
like
this
in

some
do
not

now
a
complete

I
be
certain
to

begin
with
his

one
before
the
ending
of
the
beginning
of
their
middle
living
.
some
do
not
come
to
be
dead
one
before
the
ending
of
their
begin
middle
living
.
quite
a
number
do
not
come
to
be
dead
one
before
the
ending
of
the
beginning
of
their
middle
living
.
David
Hersland
as
I
be
say
come
to
be
a
dead
one
before
he
come
to
be
at
the
ending
of
his
beginning
be
in
his
middle
living
.
David
Hersland
might
have
be
one
succeed
if
he
have
go
on
be
live
,
David
Hersland
might
have
be
one
not
succeed
if
he
have
go
on
be
live
.
so
then
certainly
some
man
,
some
woman
come
to
be
really
dead
one
before
the
ending
of
the
beginning
of
their
middle
living
.
certainly
quite
a
number
of
man
and
quite
a
number
of
woman
come
to
be
dead
before
they
come
to
be
at
the
ending
of
the
beginning
of
their
middle
living
.
some
as
I
be
say
of
these
if
they
have
go
on
be
live
would
have
be
succeed
well
enough
in
living
,
some
of
these
as
I
be
say
would
certainly
not
have
be
succeed
very
well
in
be
live
.
David
Hersland
as
I
say
of
he
be
one
who
come
to
be
one
be
dead
before
he
come
to
be
one
begin
be
in
the
middle
of
his
middle
living
,
he
be
one
as
I
have
say
of
he
who
might
have
be
one
succeed
in
live
if
he
have
be
one
go
on
be
live
,
he
might
have
be
one
fail
in
live
if
he
have
be
one
go
on
be
live
.
some
who
have
come
to
be
dead
one
before
they
have
come
to
the
beginning
of
the
middle
of
their
middle
living
would
certainly
have
be
succeed
if
they
have
be
one
go
on
be
live
.
some
who
come
to
be
dead
one
before
the
beginning
of
the
middle
of
the
middle
of
their
living
would
have
be
really
fail
if
they
have
go
on
be
live
.
I
be
go
now
to
be
tell
about
be
and
live
be
in
David
Hersland
from
his
beginning
be
in
live
to
his
come
to
be
one
not
be
any
long
be
live
.
I
can
not
tell
to
any
one
how
completely
very
many
come
to
be
die
and
quite
dead
one
before
they
come
to
the
beginning
of
the
middle
of
their
middle
living
.
I
be
tell
to
myself
that
I
be
certain
of
this
thing
.
I
be
tell
that
some
of
these
would
have
be
succeed
in
live
if
they
have
be
one
not
come
to
be
dead
one
before
the
beginning
of
the
middle
of
their
middle
living
.
I
be
also
tell
that
some
of
these
would
have
be
fail
in
live
if
they
have
be
one
go
on
be
live
to
the
ending
of
their
middle
living
,
if
they
have
be
one
go
on
to
be
old
one
in
be
live
.
as
I
be
certainly
say
David
Hersland
be
one
come
to
be
a
dead
one
before
the
ending
of
the
beginning
of
his
middle
living
.
this
be
now
to
be
a
complete
history
of
be
and
live
in
he
.




not
any
one
could
be
certain
all
their
living
that
any
other
one
be
completely
live
their
living
.
almost
not
any

can
be

that
any
other

the
living
of
that

very

.
there

this

a

description
of
David
Hersland
before
his
beginning
be
in
living
and
sometime
there
will
be
some
description
about
some
thinking
about
his
be
about
his
not
be
one
live
completely
his
living
.
I
say
of
he
that
he
come
to
be
one
not
any
long
be
live
before
he
come
to
be
at
the
end
of
the
beginning
of
his
middle
living
.
this
will
be
now
a
beginning
of
description
of
be
and
live
in
he
.




in
begin
his
live
David
Hersland
be
of
course
a
very
little
one
and
he
be
then
quite
interesting
to
some
.
in
begin
his
living
he
be
of
course
not
remember
anything
and
there
be
some
who
later
remember
about
he
then
.
in
begin
his
living
he
be
of
course
completely
a
very
small
one
,
he
be
begin
live
and
he
be
then
go
on
in
be
live
and
he
then
go
on
be
in
living
and
he
be
then
not
such
a
very
little
one
.
he
be
then
in
be
one
begin
be
in
live
a
very
little
one
.
then
he
be
go
on
be
in
living
and
always
more
and
more
then
he
be
come
to
be
not
such
a
very
little
one
.
he
be
in
begin
be
live
a
completely
small
one
.
as
I
be
say
he
be
a
young
one
,
he
come
to
be
live
after
Martha
and
after
Alfred
Hersland
have
each
of
they
be
sometime
live
.
Mr.
Hersland
have
always
intend
to
have
three
child
and
as
I
be
say
there
have
be
two
and
these
two
have
not
go
on
be
live
and
so
David
Hersland
come
to
be
live
and
sometime
later
in
some
way
he
hear
this
thing
when
he
be
still
quite
a
young
one
and
he
have
it
in
he
then
to
be
certain
that
be
live
be
a
very
queer
thing
,
he
be
one
be
live
and
yet
it
be
only
because
two
other
have
not
be
one
go
on
be
live
.
it
be
to
he
then
that
he
be
certain
then
that
be
live
be
a
queer
thing
.
as
I
say
of
he
in
a
way
he
be
need
it
that
every
moment
he
be
one
be
one
be
live
by
realise
then
that
he
be
one
need
then
be
one
be
live
.
he
be
in
a
way
then
as
I
be
say
need
to
be
certain
that
he
realise
in
he
every
minute
in
be
live
need
be
be
live
.
he
certainly
be
one
for
sometime
go
on
be
live
.
he
go
on
for
sometime
be
one
go
on
be
live
.
as
I
be
say
he
could
have
it
in
he
to
be
feel
that
it
be
a
very
queer
thing
to
be
one
be
live
.
he
be
one
that
could
be
realise
very
much
and
very
often
that
he
be
need
be
one
be
live
.
he
be
one
need
to
be
understand
every
minute
in
be
live
what
meaning
there
be
to
he
in
his
needing
to
be
to
he
one
be
be
live
.
he
certainly
then
could
have
it
in
he
to
be
go
on
be
live
.
he
certainly
could
have
it
in
he
to
feel
it
to
be
a
queer
thing
to
be
one
be
live
.
he
be
one
then
as
I
be
say
who
be
a
very
little
one
in
beginning
live
as
mostly
every
one
must
be
in
be
one
begin
be
live
,
he
be
then
one
begin
be
live
,
he
be
then
a
very
small
one
,
he
be
the
young
of
the
three
Hersland
child
,
he
be
quite
pleasant
to
the
Hersland
family
then
,
all
his
living
he
be
not
unpleasant
to
any
one
of
they
the
Hersland
family
,
this
be
to
be
now
quite
a
complete
history
of
he
.




one
man
have
one
kind
of
way
of
feel
something
,
something
that
be
exist
.
something
be
an
object
be
exist
,
it
can
be
anything
any
kind
of
a
thing
.
one
man
see
it
as
a
thing
having
solidly
be
exist
.
this
man
have
it
that
he
realise
a
thing
have
solidly
be
exist
,
he
do
not
realise
that
a
thing
have
character
make
it
a
particular
thing
,
he
do
not
realise
that
it
have
expression
its
way
of
tell
any
one
that
it
be
that
kind
of
thing
,
he
do
realise
it
as
have
existence
in
relation
to
other
thing
be

that
be
to
say
he
do
realise
that
other
thing
be
at
the
same
time
solidly
exist
and
each
thing
have
to
have
its
room
for
be
exist
and
so
for
each
one
to
have
this
solid
exist
make
a
relation
be
between
thing
be
exist
.
this
be
one
man
have
realisation
of
anything
.




another
one
have
it
that
he
have
it
to
be
realise
completely
the
character
of
each
thing
,
anything
,
have
it
to
be
realise
completely
the
way
each
thing
would
be
tell
the
character
it
have
in
be
live
by
repeat
if
each
thing
could
be
express
the
character
of
that
thing
to
any
one
.
this
one
have
that
thing
so
that
each
thing
be
exist
,
not
by
description
,
by
really
be
in
have
completely
character
in
be
exist
.
this
one
have
then
a
realise
a
complete
realising
of
each
thing
be
in
relation
to
any
other
thing
.
this
one
have
completely
the
realisation
of
this
thing
.
this
one
have
some
sense
of
a
thing
of
each
thing
be
solidly
exist
but
not
so
much
as
this
one
be
need
to
make
this
one
be
a
slow
one
in
grow
realisation
.




there
be
another
one
and
this
be
the
one
that
be
different
from
these
two
.
this
one
have
realisation
of
a
thing
have
solid
exist
,
this
one
have
realisation
of
character
in
each
thing
,
this
one
have
realisation
of
relation
exist
between
everything
so
that
each
thing
be
exist
at
the
same
time
as
every
other
thing
be
exist
and
this
one
have
emotion
in
he
about
each
one
of
three
thing
he
be
realise
about
each
thing
.
this
be
another
kind
of
a
one
.




there
be
some
who
realise
it
of
each
thing
that
it
be
a
pretty
thing
,
there
be
some

some
who
realise
it
of
each
thing
that
it
would
be
pretty
if
it
be
in
a
garden
,
there
be
some
who
realise
it
of
each
thing
that
it
would
be
a
nice
thing
if
it
be
in
a
room
with
simple
furnishing
,
there
be
some
who
realise
it
of
each
thing
that
it
be
a
thing
a
nice
thing
when
it
be
in
a
room
which
be
not
a
very
light
one
,
the
re
be
some
realise
that
each
thing
be
part
of
a
story
any
one
can
be
tell
about
anything
,
there
be
some
that
be
realise
each
thing
be
a
nice
thing
if
it
be
exciting
to
love
that
thing
,
in
a
way
then
every
one
have
it
in
they
to
feel
something
about
thing
be
in
be
exist
.




now
I
be
tell
about
another
one
.
one
this
one
have
a
gift
of
expression
of
express
something
and
that
be
a
beautiful
thing
that
be
to
say
the
mean
of
express
something
in
this
one
be
a
beautiful
thing
and
this
one
be
one
want
to
be
express
the
existence
the
character
of
anything
.
now
this
one
have
complete
emotion
about
the
mean
this
one
have
for
express
anything
,
this
one
certainly
have
not
any
emotion
about
anything
that
be
be
exist
.
this
one
have
not
a
realisation
of
something
be
solidly
exist
,
this
one
have
not
a
realisation
of
the
character
of
anything
,
of
the
way
anything
could
be
experience
be
exist
,
this
one
have
not
any
realisation
of
anything
be
in
relation
to
any
other
thing
and
this
be
a
natural
thing
when
one
be
realise
the
being
in
this
one
.
this
one
be
need
be
one
realise
anything
as
exist
so
that
this
one
can
be
have
something
to
be
use
his
beautiful
mean
of
expression
on
.
so
then
this
one
have
a
practical
realisation
of
everything
be
exist
.




these
then
be
some
way
of
be
one
realise
anything
.
I
will
not
now
tell
about
other
one
.
I
will
not
tell
now
about
other
one
.




David
Hersland
as
I
be
say
be
one
want
it
that
he
should
be
one
realise
every
minute
what
there
be
in
life
to
be
a
thing
go
on
be
do
.
he
be
one
do
this
thing
in
all
of
his
living
from
the
beginning
of
be
one
be
live
to
the
end
of
his
be
one
be
live
,
that
be
to
say
from
his
be
in
the
middle
of
his
beginning
be
live
to
the
ending
of
the
beginning
of
the
middle
of
be
live
.




as
I
be
say
the
last
one
I
have
be
just
describe
be
one
need
to
be
certain
that
thing
be
exist
so
that
he
could
be
use
his
beautiful
mean
of
expression
.
there
be
some
have
not
such
beautiful
mean
of
expression
who
be
need
for
their
mean
of
expression
that
they
have
as
be
,
be
need
realise
that
thing
be
exist
,
be
practically
need
this
thing
.
there
be
some
,
and
these
be
a
different
kind
,
in
whom
the
mean
of
expression
be
the
thing
really
exist
,
and
these
be
to
themselves
not
need
it
that
they
have
a
practical
need
of
realise
thing
be
exist
.
I
can
not
tell
enough
about
every
one
,
certainly
not
.
then
there
be
very
many
realise
object
not
as
be
exist
but
as
be
act
one
in
relation
to
another
one
,
this
be
very
common
,
for
very
many
of
such
of
they
thing
be
really
be
exist
,
for
very
many
of
such
of
they
thing
be
exist
be
only
a
practical
thing
so
that
they
can
be
be
in
relation
,
they
be
not
really
be
exist
they
be
act
for
themselves
,
for
some
other
one
,
toward
themselves
,
toward
some
other
thing
but
now
I
be
get
empty
of
realise
and
so
I
will
not
now
be
say
any
more
about
any
one
,
not
completely
empty
of
realise
but
empty
than
I
have
be
.




David
Hersland
be
then
certainly
for
himself
almost
completely
,
for
some
other
one
completely
,
for
some
quite
some
interesting
.
he
be
then
one
be
completely
interesting
to
some
,
almost
completely
interesting
to
himself
as
be
one
be
exist
,
quite
interesting
to
very
many
,
he
be
in
short
one
quite
interesting
in
be
one
be
live
to
very
many
and
a
little
some
to
almost
every
one
know
he
.
this
be
certainly
now
to
be
a
history
of
he
,
of
his
be
one
be
live
and
be
to
quite
some
quite
interesting
.




so
then
each
one
have
a
kind
of
way
of
feel
everything
be
exist
and
this
be
to
be
now
a
complete
history
of
David
Hersland
know
everything
he
know
in
be
one
be
live
and
of
everything
any
one
he
come
to
know
know
anything
come
to
know
in
be
live
.
certainly
now
I
will
begin
again
.




very
many
be
talk
,
very
many
be
listen
,
David
Hersland
certainly
in
be
one
be
live
be
one
be
one
talk
be
be
one
listen
.
certainly
he
be
one
begin
be
one
be
talk
be
one
be
listen
quite
from
the
beginning
of
the
middle
of
his
beginning
be
one
be
exist
in
be
live
.
he
be
one
then
certainly
all
his
living
be
one
be
listen
be
one
be
talk
.
he
be
interesting
to
quite
a
number
in
be
one
be
listen
,
he
be
interesting
to
quite
a
number
in
be
one
be
talk
.
quite
a
number
be
interesting
to
he
as
be
one
be
listen
,
quite
a
number
be
interesting
to
he
as
be
one
be
talk
.
he
be
one
as
I
be
say
who
be
want
to
be
need
it
that
every
woman
be
to
he
a
beautiful
one
in
be
live
.
this
be
in
he
from
the
ending
of
the
middle
of
his
beginning
live
to
the
ending
of
the
beginning
of
his
middle
living
and
then
he
be
one
not
any
long
be
live
.
certainly
want
to
be
need
that
every
woman
be
a
beautiful
thing
in
be
one
be
live
be
in
he
in
the
beginning
of
his
be
in
his
middle
living
.
this
be
to
be
now
a
description
of
be
in
he
and
of
live
in
he
in
the
beginning
of
his
be
one
be
live
.

be
tell
some
one
sometimes
what
that
one
thought
of
the
other
one
.
two
know
each
other
very
well
in
live
one
of
they
might
be
sometime
tell
some
one
what
that
one
have
often
be
think
about
be
,
about
live
in
the
other
one
.
two
know
each
other
very
well
in
live
one
of
they
might
sometime
tell
some
one
what
that
one
have
come
to
think
about
the
being
and
the
living
in
the
other
one
.
so
then
very
often
there
be
two
living
know
each
other
very
well
in
living
.
some
of
such
of
they
then
be
certain
that
they
be
know
what
the
other
one
think
of
that
one
.
some
be
not
certain
that
they
be
know
what
the
other
one
think
of
that
one
.
some
be
know
what
the
other
one
think
of
that
one
.
some
be
not
know
what
the
other
one
think
of
be
and
live
in
that
one
.
some
be
often
wonder
what
the
other
one
be
think
of
be
and
live
in
that
one
.
some
be
never
at
all
wonder
about
what
the
other
one
be
think
about
that
one
.
to
some
it
would
be
a
pleasant
thing
to
know
certainly
what
the
other
one
be
think
about
that
one
.
to
some
it
would
not
be
at
all
a
pleasant
thing
to
know
certainly
what
the
other
one
be
think
about
be
and
about
live
in
that
ore
.
some
sometime
talk
to
some
one
about
what
the
other
one
be
think
about
be
and
live
be
in
that
one
.
some
sometimes
talk
to
the
other
one
about
what
the
other
one
be
think
about
be
and
live
be
in
either
of
they
,
in
one
of
they
:
some
be
talk
to
every
one
they
be
know
about
what
the
other
one
be
think
about
be
and
live
be
in
that
one
.
some
be
for
a
very
long
time
have
a
feeling
of
be
one
know
about
think
about
be
and
live
in
both
of
they
in
both
of
they
.
two
of
two
of
they
sometimes
for
a
very
long
time
have
a
quite
certain
feeling
about
know
about
think
about
be
and
live
in
both
of
they
in
the
two
of
they
.
certainly
there
be
very
often
in
live
be
two
of
they
know
each
other
certainly
very
well
in
be
live
.
certainly
very
often
one
of

have
a
feeling
of

quite
a
number
of
other

.
David
Hersland
be
interested
in
one
be
live
.
he
be
one
as
I
be
say
almost
completely
interested
in
be
one
be
live
.
he
be
one
,
as
I
be
say
,
to
himself
almost
one
be
completely
,
almost
be
completely
living
.
he
be
one
interested
in
some
be
one
be
live
.
he
be
one
in
a
way
interested
in
every
one
he
come
to
be
know
,
in
any
one
who
come
to
know
he
.
he
be
one
as
I
be
say
interested
in
his
be
one
be
live
,
almost
completely
interested
in
be
live
,
he
be
one
almost
completely
live
.
this
be
to
be
now
some
description
of
his
be
a
quite
young
one
in
living
.




they
talk
in
different
way
about
different
thing
,
some
talk
in
some
way
about
something
then
talk
in
another
way
about
something
,
some
talk
in
some
way
about
something
then
talk
in
another
way
about
another
thing
,
some
talk
in
the
same
way
about
a
good
many
thing
,
mostly
every
one
talk
a
good
deal
about
something
,
mostly
every
one
talk
a
good
deal
about
a
number
of
thing
.
mostly
,
all
his
living
,
David
Hersland
talk
a
good
deal
about
something
,
mostly
all
his
living
he
talk
a
good
deal
about
a
good
many
thing
.
he
like
it
certainly
so
mostly
every
one
be
say
sometime
about
he
to
do
a
good
deal
of
talk
,
in
a
way
to
himself
and
to
very
many
know
he
do
not
like
do
a
good
deal
of
talk
.
any
way
he
certainly
do
considerable
talking
while
he
be
one
be
one
be
in
living
.
as
I
be
say
he
come
to
be
a
dead
one
at
the
end
of
the
beginning
of
his
middle
living
.
to
some
this
be
a
very
sad
thing
,
to
some
this
be
a
sad
enough
thing
,
in
a
way
to
some
it
be
not
at
all
an
interesting
thing
,
to
some
it
be
for
quite
a
very
long
time
a
very
interesting
thing
.
some
find
it
then
a
very
interesting
thing
to
be
wonder
whether
he
would
have
be
one
having
be
succeed
in
live
if
he
have
be
one
be
live
a
reasonably
long
time
.
some
certainly
think
this
to
be
an
exceedingly
interesting
question
.




as
I
be
say
the
Herslands
live
where
a
good
many
other
people
be
live
when
David
Hersland
be
a
young
one
,
be
begin
be
in
living
.
as
I
be
say
each
one
he
be
then
know
talk
some
about
something
,
talk
some
about
a
good
many
thing
.
David
Hersland
then
talk
some
about
something
,
talk
then
some
about
a
good
many
thing
.
he
be
then
one
talk
and
listen
and
so
be
everybody
else
do
that
thing
,
those
he
be
see
then
.
he
be
live
in
Hersland
family
live
then
,
he
be
live
in
that
part
of
Gossols
live
then
where
the
Hersland
family
be
live
then
.
this
be
to
be
now
some
description
of
living
he
be
do
then
and
the
live
some
other
one
be
do
then
in
their
daily
living
.




some
one
and
that
one
be
quite
reasonably
an
observe
one
be
see
some
one
sit
and
that
one
be
to
very
many
look
an
interesting
enough
one
and
then
that
one
the
one
that
be
reasonably
observe
say
of
this
one
the
one
sit
and
be
interesting
to
quite
a
number
who
be
look
that
way
just
then
that
this
one
be
certainly
quite
entirely
a
stupid
one
,
that
one
can
tell
that
by
observe
that
one
and
know
so
that
that
one
be
not
at
all
really
an
interesting
thing
.
this
one
then
tell
about
that
one
the
one
sit
and
it
be
certainly
true
what
the
one
tell
be
tell
about
that
one
,
it
be
quite
a
good
description
and
it
be
pleasantly
then
an
astonishing
thing
to
be
certain
that
the
one
describe
the
other
one
from
observation
be
extraordinarily
of
the
same
quality
and
having
be
have
the
same
history
in
be
live
as
the
one
that
one
have
be
describe
and
quite
correctly
describe
as
one
not
interesting
in
be
live
and
one
at
whom
very
many
be
quite
a
good
deal
look
.
this
kind
of
thing
happen
be
the
interesting
thing
in
some
be
in
be
live
to
David
Hersland
in
almost
any
part
of
his
be
in
living
.
as
I
be
say
of
he
he
certainly
be
one
want
to
be
need
that
every
woman
ever
live
should
be
a
beautiful
thing
to
he
in
his
feeling
.




David
Hersland
be
one
certainly
enjoy
some
kind
of
thing
that
be
happen
.
he
certainly
very
often
be
enjoy
thing
having
be
happen
.
this
be
to
be
now
a
quite
complete
history
of
he
from
his
beginning
to
his
ending
.




he
be
play
some
when
he
be
a
young
one
,
he
be
believe
something
then
pretty
nearly
believe
some
thing
then
,
read
some
then
,
talk
some
then
,
listen
some
then
,
eat
a
good
deal
sometimes
then
,
decide
some
thing
then
when
not
anybody
have
ask
he
to
decide
a
thing
,
be
listen
to
some
then
when
he
be
decide
some
thing
then
,
like
it
pretty
nearly
entirely
then
that
some
be
listen
while
he
be
decide
something
then
,
pretty
nearly
entirely
like
it
that
he
be
one
be
go
on
be
live
then
.
he
know
a
good

half
city
live
then
,
he
be
almost

the
living
of
many
he
be
know
then
in
his
daily

completely
like

go
on
be
live
.
he
talk
a
good
deal

and
then
he
come
to
die
and
then
he
be
a
dead
one
.
in
his
beginning
live
he
be
do
different
thing
in
his
daily
living
,
this
be
to
be
now
a
description
of
living
and
of
be
in
he
.




one
who
know
David
Hersland
a
long
time
in
living
be
one
certainly
live
so
that
that
one
later
in
the
living
of
that
one
should
certainly
be
one
certainly
not
marry
a
certain
one
.
this
one
might
be
love
that
one
,

be
one
certainly
one
never
go
to

.
very
many
knowing
of
this
one
,
know
this
one
a
little
would
be
say
that
this
one
be
certainly
sometimes
go
to
be
marry
a
certain
one
,
not
any

need
any
thinking
,
it
be
a
thing
that
everybody
know
this

take
as
be
of
course
certain
that
this
one
would
never
be
marry
that
certain
one
.
certainly
everybody
know
very
well
the
two

be
certain
that
each
of
they
be
certain

they
be
not
ever
think
about
that
one
ever
having
be
go
to
be
married
to
any
one
,
to
that
certain
one
.
to
some
it
be
not
a
puzzling
thing
,
it
be
a
thing
like
something
having
be
a
lost
thing
that
never
have
be
a
thing
any
one
have
find
before
it
be
lose
.
to
some
it
be
a
thing
that
be
not
puzzle
at
all
and
yet
be
different
from
what
every
one
know
anything
be
certain
could
be
happen
,
to
some
of
such
of
they
it
be
not
at
all
a
puzzling
thing
.
to
some
it
be
a
thing
that
be
like
be
a
dead
one
and
certainly
perhaps
one
be
a
dead
one
be
not
know
it
then
that
that
one
be
then
be
a
dead
one
.
to
mostly
not
any
one
be
it
at
all
exasperate
,
to
mostly
not
any
one
be
it
really
exciting
that
that
one
have
marry
a
certain
one
and
it
have
be
to
every
one
know
they
a
simply
inevitable
thing
that
that
one
would
not
ever
marry
that
certain
one
.
so
then
that
one
have
marry
that
certain
one
.
certainly
every
one
know
either
one
of
they
very
well
have
be
simply
certain
like
be
certain
of
be
one
be
live
that
that
one
would
not
ever
be
marry
that
certain
one
.
in
a
way
,
as
I
say
,
when
that
one
then
marry
that
certain
one
,
it
be
not
to
very
many
of
those
having
be
simply
certain
exciting
,
it
be
to
very
many
of
those
having
be
simply
certain
that
this
one
would
not
marry
that
certain
one
not
puzzle
,
it
be
not
to
any
one
know
they
and
having
be
simply
certain
at
all
exasperate
,
it
be
not
to
all
of
they
who
have
be
completely
certain
that
that
one
would
not
ever
marry
that
certain
one
when
that
one
marry
that
certain
one
really
exciting
.
and
this
be
a
strange
thing
to
be
in
David
Hersland
in
be
one
be
live
.
this
one
as
I
be
say
be
one
know
David
Hersland
very
well
in
living
.
this
one
be
one
David
Hersland
know
very
well
almost
all
his
living
.
David
Hersland
be
one
have
it
as
I
be
say
that
he
be
one
want
to
be
have
it
that
he
be
completely
need
to
be
certain
every
minute
in
be
live
of
have
it
that
he
be
realise
that
there
be
be
a
reason
in
be
live
so
that
he
could
be
one
go
on
be
live
.
he
be
one
as
I
be
say
certainly
need
every
moment
in
his
living
to
be
one
need
to
be
reason
to
be
realise
that
he
be
one
to
be
one
go
on
be
live
.
as
I
be
say
he
know
very
well
the
one
that
come
to
marry
a
certain
one
when
he
have
be
completely
quite
certain
that
that
one
would
not
be
marry
a
certain
one
and
it
be
not
to
he
completely
exciting
,
it
be
not
to
he
completely
interesting
that
this
one
have
then
marry
that
certain
one
and
that
not
he
,
not
any
one
that
he
know
then
know
then
whether
that
one
have
or
have
not
ever
be
completely
certain
that
one
could
certainly
not
ever
marry
that
certain
one
.
as
I
be
say
David
Hersland
know
this
one
very
well
,
this
one
know
David
Hersland
very
well
,
as
I
be
say
this
thing
be
not
then
when
it
have
suddenly
happen
,
and
it
happen
certainly
quite
suddenly
,
it
be
not
then
to
David
Hersland
completely

to
David
Hersland
completely

,
this
that
it
be
not
then
or
ever
later
than
then
a
completely
interesting
thing
a
completely
exciting
thing
to
David
Hersland
be
certainly
a
curious
thing
.
David
Hersland
be
one
I
be
now
begin
describe
.
I
certainly
will
tell
a
good
deal
of
everything
I
know
about
living
and
about
be
in
he
.




it
be
a
nice
thing
to
some
that
some
one
be
certain
that
every
one
would
be
thankful
perhaps
to
he
certainly
at
any
rate
thankful
,
just
thankful
if
they
could
be
have
it
completely
show
to
they
what
way
they
could
be
live
so
that
living
could
have
a
meaning
to
every
one
when
every
one
have
come
to
be
thankful
for
understand
live
have
such
a
meaning
.
there
be
very
many
certainly
be
certain
that
everybody
could
be
thankful
if
everybody
could
be

.
some
be
quite

that
anybody
could
be

if
everybody
could

.
some
be

could
be
want
.
mostly
a
good
many

certainly
be
sometime
a
dead

.
do
each

need
it
to
be
perhaps
like

be
think
that
each

be
or
could
be

and
then
some
one
be
not
then
be
such
a
one
and
be
it
then
really
completely
puzzling
,
completely
exciting
,

interesting
to
any

of
a
good

be
be
live
,
have
be
,
will
be
be
live
.
I
will
now
tell

that
be
I
will
tell

about
how
they
have
enough
money
to

thing
sometimes
to
some
one
about
live
come
to
be
pay
for
by
some
one
.
some
find

be
know
how
to
be
do

so
that
some

earn
a
living
be
a
thing
that
be
astonishing
,
to
some
be
one
earn
a
living
be
a
thing
that
be
not
at
all
in
any
kind
of
a
way
astonishing
.
those
live
in

be
live
be
one
live
in
small
house
as

about
how
some
make
money
to
be
one
go
on
be
live
and

do
not
know
this
about
some
of
they
how
they
be
earn
money
so
as
to
be
one

thing
.
some
be
not
do
thing
that
every
one
could
be
see
they
be
do
.
some
be
not
do
anything
that
any
one
could
see
would
be
a
thing
any
one
would
be
pay
they
anything
to
be
do
.
in
a
way
certainly
some
of
they
be
not
make
money
so
as
to
be
one
go
on
be
go
on
be
live
.
certainly
some
of
they
be
not
to
themselves
to
any
one
make
money
enough
for
any
such
a
thing
,
for
any
go
on
be
live
.
sometimes
it
be
a
puzzling
thing
about
some
family
live
in
some
house
then
in
that
part
of
Gossols
where
the
Herslands
be
live
about
who
it
be
that
be
in
that
house
live
.
sometimes
not
any
one
that
say
anything
really
know
anything
about
that
thing
.
it
be
confusing
and
then
mostly
not
any
one
be
really
confuse
by
that
thing
.




David
Hersland
all
his
living
know
quite
a
number
who
be
be
live
then
and
quite
a
number
who
be
be
live
know
he
then
.
he
know
quite
a
number
who
be
be
live
,
he
know
quite
a
number
when
he
be
a
young
one
,
some
know
he
then
,
as
I
be
say
all
his
living
he
know
quite
a
number
who
be
live
while
he
be
one
be
live
.
certainly
some
he
be
know
be
do
something
and
some
one
be
pay
they
something
for
that
thing
,
certainly
some
he
be
know
be
do
something
and
not
any
one
really
be
pay
they
anything
for
the
thing
they
be
do
,
certainly
there
be
some
he
be
know
who
be
really
not
do
very
much
any
one
thing
and
some
of
these
have
money
then
and
some
of
these
do
not
have
money
then
.
mostly
all
his
live
David
Hersland
would
have
like
it
very
well
to
be
know
it
about
each
one
what
they
be
do
,
what
they
have
be
do
,
what
they
would
be
do
to
be
earn
money
to
be
one
go
on
be
live
.
this
be
all
his
live
a
thing
that
be
quite
interesting
to
David
Hersland
know
this
thing
about
each
one
he
be
ever
know
.
sometimes
about
some
one
such
a
thing
be
very
confusing
sometimes
about
some
one
he
be
know
in
living
,
sometimes
he
be
confused
about
this
thing
about
some
one
,
sometimes
he
be
not
confused
about
this
thing
about
that
one
,
sometimes
he
be
not
listen
enough
to
some
one
to
be
really
understand
this
thing
about
some
one
how
that
one
be
have
money
enough
to
be
one
go
on
be
live
,
sometimes
he
be
listen
very
much
to
some
one
and
he
listen
to
every
one
know
that
one
and
it
be
not
confuse
about
that
one
but
he
never
could
find
out
about
that
one
about
the
money
that
one
have
to
be
one
go
on
be
live
.
always
all
his
living
this
be

interesting
enough
thing
about
each
one
he

money
they
have
and
how
they
have

when
those

of
listen
about
angry
feeling

there
be
not
anything

have
power
of
do
anything
when
that

fill
up
with
furious
angry

to
be
then
only
completely
do
smile

some
then

,
some
then
be
exist
in

that
one
mean
anything

any

in
be
one
be

.
certainly
this
can
be
in
some
be
live
,
this
way
of
be
one
have
angry
feeling
,
this
certainly
when
some
be
come
to
the
ending
of
the
middle
of
their
young
living
come
to
be
in
they
very
often
.
some
have
it
in
they
some
all
of
their
living
,
some
have
it
in
they
some
in
the
beginning
of
the
middle
of
their
young
living
,
some
of
they
have
it
in
they
some
at
the
ending
of
their
young
living
,
some
have
it
in

some
to
the
beginning
of
the
middle
of
their
middle
living
,
some
but
mostly
not
so
very
many
have
it
in
they
some
all
their
living
,
quite
a
number
certainly
do
have
it
some
all
their
living
this
then
this
way
of
have
angry
feeling
come
to
be
in
they
,
this
way
of
have
angry
feeling
in
they
,
quite
a
number
certainly
of
woman
,
quite
a
number
certainly
of
man
.
certainly
David
Hersland
could
have
it
in
he
to
have
this
in
he
when
he
be
in
the
beginning
of
the
middle
of
his
be
in
his
young
living
,
he
could
have
it
in
he
until
almost
the
ending
of
his
young
living
,
it
be
certainly
not
completely
certain
that
he
could
not
have
it
in
he
any
time
in
his
be
one
be
live
which
be
to
the
ending
of
the
beginning
of
his
middle
living
.
he
be
not
know
much
about
this
be
in
any
one
when
he
be
one
be
in
young
live
any
such
a
way
of
have
angry
feeling
,
he
could
come
to
be
certain
in
he
that
such
a
way
of
have
angry
feeling
be
not
at
all
uncommon
.
he
certainly
sometime
come
to
be
certain
of
this
thing
that
very
many
have
it
,
have
it
,
could
have
it
in
they
to
have
this
way
of
have
angry
feeling
come
to
be
in
they
,
be
in
they
.
very
many
do
not
come
to
have
angry
feeling
come
to
be
in
they
,
be
in
they
,
very
many
do
have
have
it
sometime
to
have
angry
feeling
come
to
be
in
this
way
in
they
,
be
in
this
way
in
they
,
very
many
do
not
,
very
many
certainly
very
many
sometime
do
come
to
have
angry
feeling
come
in
this
way
to
be
in
they
,
do
have
angry
feeling
in
some
such
way
in
they
then
.




certainly
each
one
have
their
own
way
of
have
angry
feeling
in
they
,
certainly
some
have
angry
feeling
come
to
be
in
they
from
some
one
not
have
it
to
have
it
from
be
one
be
in
live
have
any
way
of
be
one
act
to
affect
they
,
to
convince
they
have
it
then
to
have
angry
feeling
in
the
way
their
kind
of
they
,
in
the
way
that
one
have
angry
feeling
.
each
one
certainly
have
angry
feeling
the
way
it
be
natural
for
that
one
to
have
angry
feeling
in
that
one
,
that
be
mostly
every
one
.
some
do
not
have
it
completely
to
have
angry
feeling
in
they
the
way
it
be
natural
to
have
angry
feeling
in
they
but
this
be
another
thing
,
certainly
mostly
every
one
have
more
or
less
completely
in
they
when
they
have
angry
feeling
in
they
their
way
of
have
angry
feeling
in
they
.

have
just
now
be
tell
about
David
Hersland

I
have
be
just
tell
about

more
about
angry

angry

be
in
each

be
in
any
family
live
,
be
in

this
be
pretty
nearly

at
all
have
angry
feeling
,
sometimes
then
these
have
be
have
angry
feeling
,
sometimes
then
these
have
not

have
have
angry

sometime
other
have
not
be

when
these
be
think
those
other
be

that
thing
,
sometimes
other
have

these
be
have
angry
feeling
when
these
be
think
those
other
be
think
that
thing
.




some
then
have
angry
feeling
about
each
one
they
be
know
and
be
have
it
again
and
again
.
some
be
certainly
have
it
again
and
again
from
each
one
be
with
they
in
they
in
family
live
and
for
each
one
be
have
a
certain
kind
of
angry
feeling
and
be
certainly
have
it
again
and
again
.




each
one
have
then
the
angry
feeling
in
they
of
their
kind
of
they
,
of
their
be
one
be
live
.
there
be
different
way
of
have
angry
feeling
in
different
one
who
be
have
it
that
one
be
with
they
in
family
live
,
be
with
they
in
some
living
be
one
not
have
it
to
have
it
that
that
one
can
be
do
anything
to
the
one
then
have
angry
feeling
but
be
one
do
something
,
be
something
that
be
certainly
the
reason
why
the
one
have
angry
feeling
just
then
be
just
then
have
angry
feeling
in
that
one
.
certainly
there
be
in
this
way
of
have
it
happen
that
angry
feeling
be
in
some
,
different
way
of
have
angry
feeling
in
the
one
have
then
angry
feeling
.
as
I
be
say
some
certainly
be
then
need
to
be
want
not
to
have
it
that
they
themselves
that
any
one
be
certain
that
they
be
have
then
angry
feeling
.
certainly
some
be
need
when
such
angry
feeling
be
in
they
be
need
it
that
not
any
other
one
be
know
that
they
be
have
angry
feeling
inside
they
.
some
be
certainly
then
when
they
be
have
such
angry
feeling
in
they
be
certainly
then
need
to
be
certain
themselves
then
inside
they
that
they
be
then
have
angry
feeling
in
they
.
some
be
need
certainly
need
when
they
be
have
such
angry
feeling
in
they
be
certainly
need
that
some
one
some
other
one
be
know
it
then
that
they
be
have
then
such
angry
feeling
in
they
.
some
be
one
when
they
be
have
such
angry
feeling
in
they
be
one
want
to
be
need
that
some
other
one
be
know
it
of
they
that
they
be
then
have
such
angry
feeling
in
they
.
some
be
one
want
to
be
need
it
that
not
any
one
ever
can
be
know
that
they
be
one
have
such
angry
feeling
in
they
.
some
have
such
angry
feeling
be
one
want
to
be
need
it
that
they
be
one
not
then
know
it
that
they
have
inside
they
any
such
angry
feeling
.
some
have
such
angry
feeling
in
they
be
one
need
to
be
want
then
and
always
in
they
about
such
angry
feeling
in
they
that
they
be
not
know
it
inside
they
that
they
be
have
in
they
such
a
way
of
have
in
they
angry
feeling
.
then
there
be
one
certainly
not
ever
be
one
ever
remember
having
be
have
in
any
such
a
way
angry
feeling
.
then
there
be
some
certainly
need
that
they
be
want
that
not
any
one
should
ever
be
remember
anything
about
any
one
ever
have
any
such
a
way
of
have
angry

then
there
be
some
certainly
very
well
remember
that
they
be
one
having
be
have
such
an
angry
feeling
and
some
of
these
then
be
one
really
need
that
not
any
one
,
that
they
not
themselves
inside
they
be
ever
mention
that
they
have
be
have
any
such
a
way
of
have
angry
feeling
in

and
there
be
some
of
this
kind
of
they
that
can
never
be
listen
when
any
one
be
mention
such
a
way
of
have
angry
feeling
,
and
there
be
some
of
such
of
they
who
be
certainly
not
hear
when
any
one
in
any
way
be

of
have
angry

of
such
angry
feeling
having
be
sometime
in

certainly
to
very
many
have
such
angry
feeling
in
they
it
be
a
thing
they
be
mostly
not

,
certainly
some
,
quite
some
have
it
in
they
to
have
such
angry

in
they
be

some
be
in
some
way
come

from
some

not

.
certainly
Alfred
Hersland
be
one
be
in
the

live
of
David
Hersland
.
certainly
there
be
very
many
in
the
living
of
David
Hersland
sometimes
in
David
Hersland
be
one
be
live

certainly
some
of
these
be
sometimes
one
make
it
that
David
Hersland
have
in
he
angry

these
then
be

sometimes
angry

this
be
in
he
and
it
be
in
he
in
the
middle
of
his
young
living
and
this
be
in
he
because
Alfred
Hersland

.
certainly
then
sometimes
Alfred
Hersland

,
mostly
she
be
not
know
this
thing
,
David
Hersland
certainly
always
know
it
in
he
when
he
be
have
angry
feeling
in
he
in
such
a
way
inside
he
,
sometimes
later
he
could
be
explain
such
angry
feeling
when
he
be
explain
something
and
Martha
be
listen
,
sometimes
he
could
come
to
be
almost
think
it
a
funny
thing
to
have
be
have
any
such
angry

almost
mention
this

to
some
one
that
it
be
a
funny
thing
to
have
be
have
angry

be
think
it
to
be
a
funny
thing
that
he
have
angry
feeling
in
any
way
inside
he
,
he
certainly
sometime
could
come
to
be
completely
think
that
it
be
a
very
peculiar
thing
to
have
be
have
such
a
way
of
have
angry
feeling
,
to
have
be

could
be
completely
explain
to
himself
and
sometime
to
some
one
and
sometime
to
some
that
it
be
a
peculiar

.
he
certainly
could
be
sometime
completely
explain
such
angry
feeling
,
he
certainly
could
be
explain
completely
explain
that
this
be
a
peculiar
thing
that
this
be
quite
a
funny
thing
having
be
have
such
angry
feeling
in
he
,
he
could
certainly
sometime
he
completely
certain
about
the
explanation
of
this
thing
,
about
this
be
a
funny
thing
,
to
himself
and
to
some
.
he
be
one
as
I
be
say
having
have
quite
reasonably
often
such
a
way
of
have
angry
feeling
in
he
when
he
be
in
the
middle
of
his
young
living
.
he
be
one
in
a
way
have
such
a
way
of
have
angry
feeling
in
he
when
he
be
one
be
in
the
beginning
of
his
middle
living
.
he
be
quite
certainly
not
one
have
any
such
angry
feeling
in
he
in
any
such
a
way
when
he
be
in
the
ending
of
his
young
living
.
this
be
quite
clear
then
,
he
have
certainly
a
good
deal
of
such
angry
feeling
in
he
and
quite
often
in
the
middle
of
his
young
living
,
not
any
in
the
ending
of
his
young
living
,
certainly
some
and
fairly
often
in
the
beginning
of
his
middle
living
,
more
or
less
then
to
the
ending
of
his
living
which
be
in
the
ending
of
the
beginning
of
his
middle
living
.
he
have
angry
feeling
in
such
a
way
in
he
pretty
much
the
same
way
in
he
when
he
have
it
in
he
and
yet
there
be
difference
and
sometime
these
difference
will
be
come
to
be
show
themselves
in
his
come
to
be
have
it
that
every
one
be
know
other
thing
in
he
that
every
one
know
he
could
be
certainly
know
.




there
be
different
way
of
have
angry
feeling
when
some
one
be
teach
some
one
something
.
there
be
different
way
of
have
angry
feeling
when
some
one
be
try
to
teach
some
one
something
.
there
be
different
way
of
have
angry
feeling
inside
each
one
who
be
have
angry
feeling
with
some
one
teaching

.




one
be

some

be
teach
and
that
one
can
be
certain
that
that
be
not
at
all
a
good
way
for
that
one
to
be
teach
that
one
that
thing
.
one
be
be
one
some
one
be
teach
and
the
one
some
one
be
teach
can
be
quite
completely
certain
inside
that
one
that
the
one
that
be
teach
that
one
be
one
not
know
anything
about
that

.
that
one
the
one
some
one
be
teach
something
can
be
certain
of
this
thing
that
the

teaching
that
one
be
not
teach
that
one
in
the
right
way
of
teach
that
thing
,
can
be
certain
of
this
thing
when
that
one
be
quite
in
the
beginning
of
the
middle
of
young
living
.




some
one
be
one
to

some

that
be
in
the
middle
of
the
young

of
that

,
be
quite
in
the

something
be
one
not

anything
about

the

that

certainly
David
Hersland
be
one
not
admire
any

any

teach
he
in
any
fashion

then
teach
he
then
something
.




some
can
be
quite
,

,
in
only
one
part

.
as
I
be
say
David
Hersland
be
one
certainly
say
such
a
thing
sometimes
to
himself
inside
he
,
sometimes
to
some
one
,
sometime
to
the

teach
he

sometimes
to
the

,
he
be
one
say
such
a
thing
in
all
of
the
middle
of
his
young
living
.
in
some
,
say
such
a

be
an
important
thing
,
be
one
say
such
a
thing
be
an
important
thing
.
certainly
some
who
have
be
one
say
such
thing
be
not
important
one
,
except
while
they
be
say
such
thing
,
to
any
one
.
some
say
such
thing
be
need
be
one
think
about
the
thing
,
such
thing
,
be
say
by
they
.
some
say
such
thing
be
need
to
themselves
inside
they
be
one
having
be
say
such
thing
.
some
be
certainly
for
a
good
deal
of
the
time
they
be
one
be
live
be
one
need
in
some
way
be
one
say
such
a
thing
.
different
kind
of
they
in
man
and
woman
be
say
such
thing
in
the
way
their
kind
of
they
can
say
such
thing
.
each
one
have
their
own
be
inside
they
and
each
one
say
such
thing
be
use
the
being
in
they
for
the
saying
of
such
thing
,
be
feel
with
the
being
in
they
about
having
be
,
about
be
one
say
such
thing
.
certainly
this
have
close
connection
in
very
many
,
such
thing
with
angry
feeling
be
in
they
.
certainly
some
be
not
need
that
some
one
should
be
one
to
interfere
with
they
by
be
one
be
one
teach
something
,
they
be
quite
certain
.
certainly
they
can
then
have
angry
feeling
some
of
they
,
some
of
they
do
then
have
angry
feeling
.
some
of
they
do
not
then
always
have
angry
feeling
,
some
have
then
almost
not
at
all
angry
feeling
,
they
have
different
kind
of
feeling
,
some
do
then
always
have
angry
feeling
,
some
do
then
sometime
have
angry
feeling
.
certainly
David
Hersland
be
one
not
by
any
mean
always
have
then
angry
feeling
,
when
he
be
think
,
when
he
be
feel
,
when
he
be
say
such
thing
.
he
very
often
do
not
then
have
angry
feeling
,
he
could
have
then
the
need
in
he
to
be
explain
to
the
one
teach
he
what
he
be
think
about
they
,
he
could
have
it
in
he
sometimes
to
be
completely
disregard
their
be
exist
,
he
could
sometimes
be
think
about
they
and
not
hear
they
and
they
be
then
one
teach
he
,
he
could
be
one
almost
completely
listen
and
then
certainly
he
would
be
need
to
be
teach
they
,
he
could
be
want
they
not
to
be
a
bother
to
he
while
they
be
one
be
one
teach
he
something
,
he
could
be
one
almost
have
they
be
one
be
not
exist
and
they
certainly
be
exist
then
to
themselves
and
to
every
one
as
one
be
one
teach
he
something
.
as
I
be
say
he
be
one
certainly
not
pleasant
to
those
teach
he
something
,
he
be

almost
completely

to
any
of
they
,
he
be
very
nearly
completely
pleasant
to
some
of
they
.
he
be
one
,
sometimes
need
to
be
do
some
other
thing
when
some
one
be
be
one
teach
he
then
something
.
this
certainly
could
happen
to
he
,
it
certainly
do
happen
to
he
again
and
again
.




one
be

of
the
ending
of
the

living
in

David

be
not

.
David
Hersland
be
a
different
kind
of
a

.
this
one
be
one
have
it
to
be
realise
very
well
the
way
each
one
do
thinking
be
do
thinking
,
this

not
realise

any

experience
anything

of
do
thinking
in

do
thinking
with
the

each

certainly
have
angry

be
a

in
have
any
one
teaching
that

certainly
know
about
think
be
do
by
man
and
by
woman
do
thinking
.
this
one
then
be
different
from
David
Hersland
.
David
Hersland
be
not
like
this
one
I
have
just
be
describe
.
David
Hersland
be
one
certainly
often
certain
that
the
one
that
be
then
teach
he
be
one
not
understand
that
thing
.
David
Hersland
certainly
sometimes
carefully
explain
,
to
some
one
teach
he
,
that
thing
.
as
I
be
say
David

not
like
the
one
I
have
be
just
describe
.
David
Hersland
be

certainly
do
thinking
,
David
Hersland
be
certainly
one
talk
and
listen
,
the
one
I
have
be
just
describe
be
one
do
talk
and
listen
,
David
Hersland
be
one
want
to
be
need
to
be
one
teach
each
one
something
,
he
be
one
certainly
come
to
be
early
in
his
middle
live
a
dead
one
.
he
be
one
certainly
find
it
often
a
troublesome
thing
to
have
a
governess
live
in
the
house
with
he
as
he
be
one
to
himself
need
to
be
read
almost
anything
,
certainly
a
certain
thing
,
and
sometimes
a
governess
say
something
about
such
a
thing
.
he
could
find
it
a
pleasant
thing
to
have
a
governess
live
in
the
house
with
he
and
he
do
find
it
to
be
a
pleasant
thing
and
then
,
again
and
again
it
be
not
at
all
a
pleasant
thing
but
mostly
it
be
not
to
he
at
all
a
serious
thing
,
they
be
not
any
of
they
really
regularly
teach
anything
to
he
.




there
be
some
who
be
certain
,
in
be
one
be
in
later
living
,
who
be
certain
that
they
could
have
be
one
have
it
that
they
have
teacher
really
know
something
and
then
if
they
have
have
they
they
would
have
be
one
live
a
different
way
in
be
one
learn
in
be
live
in
be
one
be
in
be
live
.
there
be
in
each
kind
in
man
and
woman
some
have
such
feeling
in
they
.
David
Hersland
be
not
at
all
one
of
such
of
they
.
it
be
a
curious
thing
that
the
one
I
be
describe
as
be
one
certainly
know
about
think
be
in
any
one
be
in
a
way
such
a
one
.
surely
this
one
be
not
such
a
one
and
yet
in
a
way
that
one
be
such
a
one
.
that
one
be
such
a
one
although
certainly
not
any
one
to
that
one
be
when
that
one
be
a
young
one
be
one
really
know
how
to
be
teach
something
to
that
one
and
that
one
when
that
one
be
in
the
later
living
in
that
one
be
understand
think
be
in
each
one
thinking
and
be
one
certainly
think
and
one
then
certain
that
he
would
be
one
not
teach
as
it
be
not
a
thing
that
one
be
then
feel
any
one
could
be
understand
except
one
not
need
that
thing
and
this
one
be
surely
then
one
certain
that
some
one
when
that
one
be
a
young
one
could
have
be
teach
that
one
something
if
the
one
teaching
that
one
have
be
understand
teach
.
as
I
be
say
in
a
way
David
Hersland
be
one
like
this
one
,
in
a
way
David
Hersland
be
one
not
like
this
one
,
certainly
David
Hersland
be
one
certain
about
almost
every
one
teach
he
when
he
be
a
young
one
that
they
be
not
understand
what
they
be
teach
and
if
they
be
understand
what
they
be
teach
be
not
understand
how
to
be
teach
.
he
be
not
certain
about
every
one
,
he
be
to
some
teach
he
a
quite
completely
pleasant
one
.




there
be
some
not
think
,
not
feel
about
their
know
anything
,
not
have
angry
feeling
in
they
with
those
teach
they
regularly
but
have
very
much
such
feeling
about
some
teach
they
in
some
irregular
fashion
.
some
be
one
some
one
be
teach
it
be
just
the
other
way
in
they
.
David
Hersland
be
certainly
not
of
either
of
these
kind
of
they
,
be
one
some
one
be
teach
.




there
be
many
kind
of
way
of
have
angry
feeling
,
each
one
certainly
be
have
sometimes
angry
feeling
when
that
one
be

one
some
one
be
teach
,
each
one
certainly
be
have
sometimes
angry
feeling
when
that
one
be
be
one
some
one
be
teach
.




some

these
be
so
very
many
way
of

of
be

there
be
so
many

,
some
be

realise
anything
inside
they
at
any
time
before
it
be
a
completely
finished

certainly
very
many
in
their
be
one
be
living
be
one
be
be
one
to
whom
some

can

this
be
to
be
some
description
of
angry

be
in
man
and
in
woman
about
such
a
thing
,
in
all
of
they
.
this
will
be
then
some
description
of
one
kind
of
angry

,
of
some
explain
and
then
some
more

sometimes
more
angry
feeling
be
in
man
be
in

it
would
be
easy
to
have
angry

Martha
Hersland

of
they
be
certainly
listen
some
then
.
some
be
feel
about
some
other
one
that
that
one
be
repeat
very
much
and
that
that

be
very
certain
that
that

be
not
like
any

be
repeat
and
repeat
and
repeat
.
some
be
certain
about
such
a
one
that
that

be
one
mostly
have
an
angry
feeling
when
that

and
sometimes
that

be
not
have
then
an
angry
feeling
and
certainly
sometimes
then
that
one
be
have
angry
feeling
.
certainly
very
many
be
sometimes
quite
certain
about
some
other
one
that
that
one
be
not
listen
to
everything

judge
in
that

as
one
be
one
having
be
listen
completely
to
everything
that
one
have
be
hear
and
certainly
that
one
have
not
be
listen
to
everything
that
one
have
be
hear
.
mostly
every
one
sometime
be
certain
of
this
thing
in
every
one
and
very
many
when
they

have
then
very
much
angry
feeling
in

have
their
own
way
of
have

be
come
,
come
,
not
come
,
certainly
not
come
to
be
in
they
in
some
.
angry
feeling
be
certainly
come
to
be
in
they
in
some
.
it
be
really
a
surprising
thing
to
some
that
they
have
be
have
really
angry
feeling
in

.
some
be

before
,
during

after
they
have
be
have
angry
feeling
any
of
the
feeling
that
would
be
for
they
in
their
thinking
,
in
their
feeling
,
in
their
realisation
angry
feeling
.
it
be
a
curious
thing
that
certainly
certainly
very
many
be
not
feel
any
feeling
in
they
give
to
they
angry
feeling
and
yet
certainly
they
be
just
then
have
angry
feeling
in
they
.
this
be
happen
quite
often
to

that
they
would
be
to
themselves
have
angry
feeling
if
they
have
more
realisation
in
be
one
feel
some
of
they

some
of
such
of
they
be
one
who

that
they

boast
about

sometimes
some
one
hear
they
tell
about
this
thing
have
angry
feeling
in
that
one
.
one
can
have
be
in
living
,
to
that
one
and
to
mostly
every
one
,
one
certain

,
and
then
that
one
be
find
that

to
be
a
very
different
one
from
what
that

have
ever
be
in

be
tell

in

some
of
each

it

feel
,
think
,

,
know
,
would
like
to
know
,
do

know
about
live
feeling
be
in
anything
,
in
any
one
,
in
every
one
.
it
be
certainly
a
very
exciting
thing
to
some
to
feel
something
in
they
about
live
be
in
man
and
in
woman
.
it
be
not
at
all
,
not
the
least
bit
an
exciting
thing
to
some
to
feel
anything
about
live
be
in

,
in
anything
,
in

some
one
have
be
one
to
that
one
,
to
every
one
know
that
one
,
one
certainly
not
go
ever
to
be
certain
that
live
be
in
any
one
,
in
every
one
,
in
everything
,
be
a
thing
that
one
be
ever
go
to
be
understanding
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
,
sometime
when
that

have
be
change
in
some
way
in
do
something
,
that

be
one
to
keep
on
tell

certainly
do
understand
everything
that
be
to
say
living
be
in
man
and
in
woman
.
certainly
such
a
one
can
have
then
angry
feeling
but
,
very
often
,
almost
mostly
,
such
a
one
be
not
just
then
have
angry
feeling
and
certainly
some
be
have
about

angry

be
not
have
then
about

be
in
man

in

there
be
certainly
some

about

very
angry

David

do
have
in

about
some
of

quite
an
indifferent

,
about
some

have
sometimes
a
very
earnest
feeling
,
about
some

he
have
intensely
an

that
make
he
be

go
on
scold
they
every

he
think
about
they
,
about
some
other
of
some
of
they
he
be
not
certain
but
perhaps
they
really
do
understand
everything
and
then
sometimes
he
be
quite
certain
that
they
do
not
understand
everything
and
then
sometimes
he
have
a
humble
feeling
perhaps
they
be
understand
everything
and
then
sometimes
he
have
a
certain
feeling
that
they
be
not
understand
everything
.
as
I
be
say
David
Hersland
be
one
have
it
to
be
almost
one
to
be
sometimes
completely
certain
that
he
be
understand
everything
.




certainly
some
in
one
way
of
be
one
be
live
,
some
in
other
way
of
be
one
be
live
come
to
be
certain
,
some
gradually
,
some
all
of
a
sudden
,
some
sometime
,
some
sometimes
,
some
quite
often
,
some
very
often
,
come
to
be
certain
that
they
be
understand
every
one
be
one
be
live
.
some
as
I
be
say
be
have
when
they
be
have
this
thing
angry
feeling
,
some
when
they
be
have
this
thing
be
not
have
it
to
be
have
any
angry
feeling
.
some
about
such
of
they
have
angry
feeling
,
some
have
not
any
angry
feeling
about
any
one
of
such
of
they
.
as
I
be
say
there
be
very
many
way
of
come
to
be
certain
of
be
one
understanding
live
be
in
man
and
in
woman
.
as
I
be
say
there
be
very
many
way
of
be
impressed
of
not
be
impress
by
any
one
of
such
of
they
,
by
some
of
such
of
they
,
by
many
of
such
of
they
,
by
every
one
of
such
of
they
.




there
be
certainly
many
way
of
feeling
,
of
thinking
,
of
like
of
not
like
living
be
in
man
and
in
woman
,
live
be
exist
.
very
many
be
convince
that
living
be
a
real
thing
,
something
they
be
certain
be
exist
,
some
be
not
so
certain
of
this
thing
.
some
be
content
with
living
be
exist
,
some
be
not
at
all
content
with
this
thing
.
some
be
certainly
certain
that
if
every
one
be
understand
everything
that
not
any
one
will
only
be
want
to
be
certain
only
that
living
be
be
exist
.
some
be
so
certain
that
understand
anything
be
amusing
to
every
one
,
and
certainly
it
be
not
it
be
not
at
all
amusing
to
some
it
be
not
at
all
interesting
to
some
.
some
be
so
certain
that
understand
anything
be
interesting
to
every
one
that
they
be
certain
that
sometime
every
one
will
be
understand
something
.
some
be
so
certain
that
understand
everything
be
a
necessary
thing
that
they
be
certain
that
sometime
they
will
be
understand
everything
.
some
of
such
of
they
come
to
be
certain
that
they
be
understand
everything
,
to
some
of
such
of
they
it
come
all
of
a
sudden
.




as
I
be
say
some
of
such
of
they
have
angry
feeling
in
they
then
,
as
I
be
say
some
of
such
of
they
have
not
at
all
angry
feeling
in
they
then
.
as
I
be
say
David
Hersland
in
a
way
be
almost
such
a
one
.




if
he
feel
it
and
he
know
it
and
he
tell
it
and
he
think
it
and
he
say
it
,
clearly
tell
it
why
then
perhaps
it
be
something
and
perhaps
it
be
not
anything
.
some
be
certain
that
clear
thinking
and
clear
telling
and
certain
feeling

complete
emotion
be
something
some
one
can
be
do
.
some
be

that
sometime
they
will
be
have
complete
emotion

clear
thinking

,
not
at

any

might
easily
be
have
adequate
expression
.




which
be
then
the
important
one
,
certainly
one
of
the
two
of
they
.
one
of
the
two
of
they
be
certainly
in
a
way
the
important
one
.
one
of
the
two
of
they
be
certainly
in
a
way
not
the
important
one
.




David
Hersland
be
certain
that
really
one
of
they
be
the
more
important
one
.
David
Hersland
be
one
certainly
in
a
way
not
have
complete
emotion
,
certainly
in
a
way
do
clear
thinking
,

he
have
absolute
conviction

he
have
clear
thinking
,
he
have
adequate
expression
,
he
feel
inside
he
complete
emotion
.




some
be
work
hard
to
be
one
tell
some
one
something
.
some
be
work
and
be
tell
some
one
something
.
some
be
not
work
hard
to
tell
some
one
something
.
some
be
not
work
hard
and
they
be
then
tell
some
one
something
.




to
some
spirituality
and
idealism
have
no
meaning
except
as
mean
complete
intensification
of
any
experiencing
,
any
conception
of
transcending
experience
have
to
some
not
any
meaning
.
to
some
anything
to
have
meaning
must
be
exist
,
to
some
anything
to
have
meaning
must
be
be
,
having
be
go
to
be
experience
as
something
exist
by
some
one
.
many
who
be
carefully
and
completely
think
have
it
to
leave
out
something
they
have
be
,
they
will
be
,
they
be
,
they
can
be
experience
and
this
be
a
very
natural
thinking
as
very
many
who
have
it
to
be
one
clearly
and
completely
reasonably
think
have
it
to
have
it
that
they
be
think
to
be
solve
a
problem
and
naturally
then
they
be
not
think
into
they
everything
they
can
be
experience
.
some
be
quite
certain
that
any
one
very
clearly
thinking
be
not
ever
completely
experience
,
some
be
quite
certain
that
any
one
clearly
think
be
leave
out
very
much
that
should
be
be
remember
by
that
one
.
some
certainly
have
a
conception
that
everything
should
be
intelligible
to
some
one
,
certainly
some
of
such
of
they
be
to
some
other
,
listen
to
they
,
not
convincing
.
some
have
it
to
be
experience
that
they
be
experience
more
than
experience
and
this
be
to
very
many
completely
convincing
and
it
be
to
some
completely
convincing
in
some
,
and
it
be
altogether
convincing
to
some
and
to
some
it
be
convincing
when
these
have
it
in
they
to
have
such
experiencing
of
something
that
be
not
experience
explain
their
experience
,
to
some
it
be
not
then
convincing
.
to
some
,
some
have
experience
of
something
which
be
more
than
any
experiencing
be
convincing
when
they
be
explain
this
thing
.
to
some
it
would
be
a
very
pleasant
thing
if
not
any
one
have
such
experience
ever
got
mix
up
between
what
be
,
what
be
,
what
will
be
to
that
one
and
how
it
come
to
be
,
how
it
come
to
be
,
how
it
will
come
to
be
,
in
short
the
explanation
,
the
description
,
the
condition
what
as
experience
to
they
be
without
any
condition
.




as
I
be
say
some
be
work
in
be
one
be
think
,
some
be
not
work
in
be
one
be
think
.
some
be
certainly
think
and
work
in
be
one
be
think
and
certainly
come
to
an
ending
in
their
thinking
and
do
it
the
thinking
as
a
complete
thing
and
certainly
carefully
do
that
thing
and
certainly
clearly
tell
the
thinking
they
have
be
do
.
some
certainly
then
have
not
be
put
in
everything
that
any
one
could
be
experience
that
be
connect
with
the
thing
about
which
they
have
be
think
,
some
will
not
put
in
some
experiencing
,
some
can
not
put
in
some
experiencing
,
some
be
certain
that
they
have
put
in
all
that
experience
,
some
put
in
almost
all
experience
that
have
anything
to
do
with
that
thing
when
they
be
think
about
that
thing
.




certainly
to
be
completely
experience
,
to
be
clearly
think
,
to
have
real
conviction
,
to
have
enthusiasm
,
to
keep
on
go
in
do
thinking
and
have
experience
be
a
very
enjoyable
thing
.
certainly
very
many
be
very
clearly
think
that
be
quite
a
number
be
certainly
quite
think
quite
clearly
.
David
Hersland
be
such
a
one
.
he
certainly
have
enthusiasm
,
he
certainly
could
have
some
experience
,
he
certainly
be
need
for
his
own
satisfaction
to
put
in
everything
any
one
could
be
experience
in
think
about
anything
.
he
certainly
be
one
completely
want
to
do
this
thing
.
he
be
one
in
a
way
do
this
thing
.
he
be
one
in
a
way
never
come
to
be
completely
do
this
thing
,
he
be
one
have
almost
absolute
conviction
,
he
be
one
have
real
enthusiasm
.
he
be
one
not
be
certain
that
experience
be
intensify
be
spirituality
and
idealism
.
he
be
not
certain
that
one
could
not
be
experience
something
that
be
a
different
thing
.
he
almost
come
to
be
certain
that
one
could
not
be
experience
something
more
complete
than
any
experiencing
,
he
come
to
be
almost
certain
that
one
can
be
experience
something
that
be
more
than
experience
.
he
come
to

certain
that
not
anyone
could
explain
such
a
thing
,
he
come
to
be
almost
certain
that
perhaps
he
could
sometime
explain
such
a
thing
.




some
certainly
and
certainly
they

come
sometime
to

explain
what
they

certain
certainly

this
be
quite
common
.
some
certainly
come

that

.
David
Hersland
be
in
a
way
not
at
all
such
a
one
.




many
be
very
logical
in
be
one
be

.
some
demonstrate
something
in

.
many
be
very

some
keep

many
be
very
logical
in

,
some
of
these
be
demonstrate

,
some
of
these
be
beginning
demonstrate
something
,
some
of
these
be
not
really
demonstrate
anything
,
some
of
these
be
occasionally
demonstrate
something
.
it
be
like
this
,
many
who
be
logical
one
be
while
they
be
be
logical
be
always
experience
be
one
be
live
,
some
while
they
be
be
logical
one
be
be
one
experience
a
great
deal
of
be
one
be
live
,
some
while
they
be
be
logical
be
experience
very
little
of
be
one
be
live
,
some
while
they
be
be
logical
have
at
time
the
conviction
of
be
one
experience
be
live
,
some
be
certain
that
be
logical
one
make
of
they
one
be
one
experience
be
live
and
this
be
perhaps
true
of
they
.
the
way
each
one
be
experience
the
amount
each
one
be
experience
living
be
then
a
thing
that
some
one
be
know
,
that
some
one
be
not
know
,
that
some
be
not
know
of
themselves
inside
they
,
that
some
be
know
of
themselves
inside
they
,
about
which
some
have
conviction
,
about
which
some
do
not
have
conviction
,
about
which
some
have
conviction
and
they
certainly
be
not
know
what
they
be
certain
they
be
know
,
about
which
some
have
conviction
and
they
certainly
be
know
what
they
be
know
,
about
which
some
be
not
know
that
they
be
have
a
conviction
,
about
which
some
be
have
a
conviction
and
be
not
certain
of
that
thing
,
about
which
some
be
quite
certain
they
have
not
any
conviction
,
about
which
some

certainly
not

about
which
some

know
more
than
other
be
know
,
about
which
some
be
know
very
much
,
about
which
some
be
know
hardly
anything
.
so
then
experience
be
one
be
live
be
a
thing
about
which
some
be
know
very
much
in
themselves
,
in
other
one
.
experience
be
one
be

be
something
some
have
very
much
in

.
experience
be
one
be
live
be
something
many
be
certainly
have
some
.
experience
be
one
be
live
be
certainly
something
every
one
be
have
some
.
certainly
some
be
have
more
than
other
be
have
of
be
one
experience
be
one
be
live
.




surely
some
one
be
mean
something
by
what
that
one
be
say
.
it
would
be
a
nuisance
for
some
not
to
be
certain
of
this
thing
.
some
one
be
mean
something
when
that
one
be
say
something
.
certainly
in
each
one
there
be
a
connection
between
what
that
one
be
say
and
that
one
be
meaning
,
certainly
in
some
way
there
must
be
some
connection
.
each
one
have
their
own
way
inside
they
of
mean
something
,
each
one
have
their
own
way
of
have
connection
between
what
that
one
be
mean
and
what
that
one
be
think
,
between
what
that
one
be
mean
and
what
that
one
be
say
,
about
what
that
one
be
mean
and
what
that
one
be
feel
,
about
what
that
one
be
mean
and
what
that
one
be
certain
be
conviction
in
that
one
.




it
would
be
a
nuisance
for
some
not
to
be
certain
of
this
thing
that
each
one
have
some
connection
in
they
between
what
they
be

what
they
be

what

be

what
they
be
certain
about
in
be
one
be
live
.




certainly
some
be
pretty
certain
that
there
be
not
enough
connection
to
make
it
interesting
,
in
very
many
,
between
what
they
be

,
they
be

,
they
be

they
be

they
be
certain
in
something
exist
.




I
mean
,
I
mean
and
that
be
not
what
I
mean
,
I
mean
that
not
any
one
be
say
what
they
be
mean
,
I
mean
that
I
be
feel
something
,
I
mean
that
I
mean
something
and
I
mean
that
not
any
one
be
think
,
be
feel
,
be
say
,
be
certain
of
that
thing
,
I
mean
that
not
any
one
can
be
say
,
think
,
feeling
,
not
any
one
can
be
certain
of
that
thing

I
mean
I
be
not

,
I
be
not
ever

,
think
,
feeling

be
certain

this
thing
,
I
mean
,
I
mean
,
I
know
what
I
mean
.




and
certainly
some
one
be
right
in
say
such
a
thing
,
such
a
one
some
of
such
of
they
certainly
be
right
in
say
such
a
thing
.
some
of
such
of
they
have
it
that
the
moment
of
sensibility
,
emotion
and
expression
and
origin
be
all
in
a
state
of
completion
and
then
it
be
a
finished
thing
and
certainly
then
that
one
be
mean
something
and
he
be
say
I
mean
,
I
mean
,
and
it
be
all
finish
and
then
there
be
another
something
and
this
one
certainly
very
often
say
I
mean
.
that
one
say
that
very
often
in
be
one
be
live
.




surely
in
some
way
there
be
some
connection
between
what
each
one
be
mean
and
say
and
feel
and
think
and
be
certain
of
in
living
.
surely
it
would
be
a
very
great
nuisance
to
one
be
one
be
live
if
there
be
not
some
connection
in
each

between
meaning

and
think
and
be
certain
in
each

.




some
be
quite
certain
that
there
be
very
little
connection
certainly
not
enough
to
make
it
interesting

what
every

they

for
very
much
of

almost
a

want
to
be
need
to
be
feel
that
any
woman
be
in
some
way
a
really
beautiful
one
.
he
be
one
clearly
think
clearly
feel
and
do
both
very
much
and
very
often
and
that
together
make
it
that
he
be
one
need
in
a
way
to
be
think
everything
to
be
a
complete
thing
and
in
a
way
then
he
be
not
succeed
in
be
in
live
for
then
he
come
to
be
one
make
everything
a
pretty
transparent
thing
,
a
thing
so
clear
that
it
be
a
sparkling
thing
,
a
thing
so
clear
that
it
do
not
have
beginning
or
middle
or
end
and
as
I
be
say
it
be
not
a
completely
clear
thing
as
certainly
he
be
pretty
completely
want
to
be
need
to
be
feel
that
any
woman
that
could
ever
be
exist
be
in
some
way
a
really
beautiful
thing
.
David
Hersland
be
not
any
long
live
and
some
one
have
a
trunk
that
he
have
have
and
always
like
to
use
it
when
that
one
be
travel
.
some
one
be
very
indignant
that
he
have
come
to
be
a
dead
one
and
almost
go
out
to
where
he
be
not
any
long
live
to
complain
to
some
one
about
this

some
time
later
after
David
Hersland
be
not

long
live
that
he
be
not
any
long

and
that

it
to
be
a
completely
strange
thing
that
David
Hersland
be
not
any
long
live
and
after
that
it
be
not
a
strange
thing
and
after
that
it
be
not
a
real
thing
as
certainly
he
could
not
have
be
one
be
live
,
and
after
that
there
be
another
one
very
much
like
David
Hersland
and
that
one
be
already
not

the

know
about
this
one
.
there
be
another
one
who
have
certainly
be
one
go
to
be
very
sorry
if
anything

that
one
be
sorry
when
David

be
a

.
there
be
one
who
be
excited
about
David
Hersland
having
come
to
be
a
dead
one
because
David
Hersland
certainly
might
have
be
go
on
be
live
if

way
they
will
be
imagine

be
very
much
interested
in
their
be
one
having
be
,
be
,
go
to
be
be
one
imagine
everything
to

in
every
one
else
's
imagine

,
some
find
it
very
interesting
that
every
one
else
be
imagine
everything
be
something
.
some
be
imagine
some
thing
be
some
thing
when
they
be
young
one
and
then
be
imagine
everything
be
something
when
they
be
old
one
.
some
be
talk
very
much
and
very
often
about
be
one
be
imagine
in
be
one
be
live
.
some
be
very
convincing
in
be
one
tell
about
be
one
be
imagine
in
be
live
.
sometime
each
one
have
be
tell
very
much
and
very
often
what
that
one
be
think
about
that
one
be
one
be
imagine
in
living
,
be
one
talk
in

,

one
listen
in

,
be
one
succeed
in

,
be
one
fail
in

.
sometime
each
one
have
be
tell
very
much
and
very
often
about
live
having
be
,
about
live
be
in
that
one
.




some
have
be
do
something
very
often
,
they
have
be
do
that
thing
very
much
and
very
often
and
yet
they
be
not
then
know
be
in
be
one
do
that
thing
,
that
be
to
say
some
one
may
be
one
live
all
the
living
of
that
one
do
some
one
thing
again
and
again
with
many
man
and
many
woman
and
this
one
then
have
not
be
learn
anything
about
how
to
be
one
do
that
thing
.
some
one
might
be
one
ruin
many
man
and
many
woman
certainly
be
one
ruin
one
and
certainly
then
that
one
might
be
one
not
know
anything
about
ruin
about
not
ruin
any
one
,
might
be
one
certainly
not
know
anything
about
ruin
man
and
woman
,
might
certainly
be
one
not
know
anything
of
be
be
in
man
and
woman
who
be
who
be
not
ruin
by
that
one
,
in
short
it
be
sometimes
surprising
how
some
be
not
be
one
having
have
experience
in
be
one
do
something
when
they
have
be
one
do
something
.
some
have
be
one
do
something
and
really
then
they
have
not
very
often
do
that
thing
.
it
be
surprising
very
often
how
some
who
have
be
one
do
something
have
be
one
very
rarely
do
that
thing
,
and
some
who
have
be
one
do
something
have
be
do
that
thing
very
often
.




every
one
certainly
be
tell
very
much
and
very
often
everything
in
be
one
be
live
and
some
be
listen
to
some
and
some
be
listen
to
many
and
some
be
not
do
very
much
listening
and
some
be
listen
more
and
then
be
listen
less
and
some
be
talk
more
and
some
be
talk
less
and
each
one
be
one
be
live
and
then
each
one
be
one
go
on
be
live
all
the
time
that
one
be
one
be
live
,
and
each
one
be
sometime
a
young
one
and
each
one
be
sometime
quite
a
young
one
.




some
be
jump
when
they
be
young
one
,
jump
from
a
place
and
be
land
way
below
from
where
they
be
jump
and
it
be
a
pretty
thing
to
see
they
do
,
and
many
of
they
when
they
be
do
this
thing
be
not
hurt
themselves
in
landing
.
certainly
very
many
when
they
be
young
one
be
jump
a
long
distance
and
be
land
somewhere
and
to
some
of
such
of
they
it
be
not
an
important
thing
at
all
to
be
know
where
they
be
go
to
be
land
when
they
be
beginning
jump
.
some
be
certain
that
not
any
one
be
such
a
one
when
they
be
a
young
one
,
some
be
certain
that
every
one
when
they
be
jump
even
when
they
be
quite
young
one
have
it
that
it
be
to
they
an
important
thing
to
be
certain
that
they
can
be
land
safely
somewhere
below
the
place
from
which
they
have
be
jump
.
some
be
certain
that
mostly
every
one
when
they
be
young
one
be
one
jump
and
not
be
one
be
interested
in
know
that
they
will
be
land
somewhere
and
not
be
one
having
be
hurt
by
jump
.
some
be
quite

sometimes
then
completely
desolate
,
sometimes
then
make
in

that
that

a
good

in
a
way
David

be
such
a
kind
of

.




some
when
they
be
be

be
certainly
not

.




some
be
want
to
know
about
some
one
whether
that
one
be
a
young

or
be
an
old
one
.
it
be
an
important
thing
to
know
that
of
some
one
.
that
one
be
a
young
one
be
in
a
way
one
be
one
kind
of
a
one
and
that
one
be
an
old
one
be
then
in
a
way
not
that
kind
of
a
one
.
some
one
be
be
one
be
live
and
that
one
be
then
a
young
one
.
that
one
be
a
kind
of
a
one
.
that
one
be
that
kind
of
a
one
be
be
one
live
in
a
certain
way
,
think
and
do
in
a
certain
way
and
that
one
be
one
certainly
do
that
in
a
way
one
way
be
a
young
one
and
in
a
way
in
a
different
way
be
an
old
one
.
it
be
an
important
thing
to
be
know
of
that
one
,
of
any
one
whether
that
one
be
then
a
young
one
or
an
old
one
.
some
be
know
about
some
one
that
that
one
be
an
old
one
and
that
one
be
not
then
an
old
one
,
that
one
be
then
in
the
very
beginning
of
the
middle
living
of
that
one
and
not
in
the
middle
of
the
middle
living
of
that
one
.
perhaps
that
then
be
the
reason
that
one
be
do
something
in
the
way
that
one
be
do
it
then
.
perhaps
that
be
not
the
reason
that
that
one
be
do
that
thing
the
way
that
one
be
do
that
thing
then
.
perhaps
that
one
will
be
do
that
thing
that
way
in
the
ending
of
the
middle
of
the
living
in
that
one
.
perhaps
that
one
will
not
be
do
that
thing
in
that
way
at
the
ending
of
the
middle
of
the
middle
living
in
that
one
.
certainly
I
be
ask
each
one
how
old
that
one
be
just
then
.
certainly
I
be
do
this
thing
.
David
Hersland
be
a
young
one
in
the
ending
of
the
beginning
of
the

one
that
some
be
need
to
be
ask

be
think
then
that
he
be
as
old
as
he
be
then
and
certainly
some
be
think
then
that

be
old
than
he
be
then
.
certainly
he
be
at
the
beginning
of
the

then
to

one
be
a

and
this
one
have
be
one
be
a
young
enough
one
so
that
some
one
could
toss
that

,
toss
up
that
one
and
one
do
toss
up
that

,
do
regularly
toss
up

then
this
one
be
one
that
that
one
could
not
toss
up
any
long
and
this
one
then
the
one
that
have
be
a
toss
one
have
then
to
toss
himself
to
earn
a
living
and
this
one
be
then
a
quite
young
one
and
this
one
be
then
to
the
one
that
have
toss
that
one
a
completely
not
a
young
one
,
a
young
one
be
one
that
could
be
toss
by
that
one
and
this
one
could
not
be
toss
by
this
one
and
this
one
do
not
toss
himself
enough
to
be
another
kind
of
a
young
one
,
a
young
one
who
toss
himself
and
he
be
not
a
young
one
because
he
could
not
toss
himself
again
and
again
and
certainly
this
one
be
to
that
one
to
himself
inside
he
completely
a
young
one
,
completely
not
a
young
one
.




a
young
one
be
one
toss
himself
and
not
with
a
rhythm
,
not
with
a
regular
rhythm
,
one
who
be
not
a
young
one
be
one
toss
himself
with
a
rhythm
,
some
rhythm
,
be
toss
himself
with
a
regularity
that
have
meaning
as
a
repeat
thing
and
this
be
certainly
the
way
one
not
be
a
young
one
be
toss
himself
and
the
way
one
be
a
young
one
be
not
toss
himself
.




one
who
be
toss
himself
pretty
nearly
regularly
would
have
be
one
who
be
not
completely
a
young
one
but
he
be
completely
a
young
one
and
that
be
because
there
be
old
one
who
have
be
one
toss
themselves
regularly
and
this
one
know
then
that
this
be
the
way
that
one
should
toss
himself
and
that
one
then
do
not
toss
himself
so
then
and
always
when
this
one
be
toss
himself
as
regularly
as
they
have
be
toss
themselves
they
be
toss
themselves
more
regularly
,
so
that
that
one
to
himself
then
and
to
every
one
be
a
young
one
,
a
completely
young
one
,
quite
a
young
one
one
who
be
not
toss
himself
with
any
regular
rhythm
,
be
then
a
quite
completely
young
one
.




little
by
little
they
be
not
so
young
those
be
young
.
it
be
certainly
steadily
change
and
certainly
in
each
one
they
be
each
one
a
little
and
a
little
a
different
one
that
be
one
be
an
old
one
,
one
be
not
such
a
young
one
.




one
be
think
and
he
be
think
quite
the
same
thing
he
have
be
think
since
he
commence
thinking
and
always
and
always
it
be
a
little
old
,
a
little
different
and
a
little
different
and
it
be
a
very
pleasant
thing
to
some
to
see
in
any
one
,
to
see
in
themselves
little
grow
difference
in
they
and
then
it
be
like
a
map
of
anything
,
one
be
find
that
the
real
thing
be
like
the
description
.
that
be
very
exciting
and
very
depressing
and
very
content
and
very
disconcerting
and
very
expect
and
very
astonishing
and
some
then
be
certain
that
it
be
not
exist
in
every
one
and
some
be
certain
that
it
be

in
every

.
and
some
in
some
part
of
their
be
live
be
see
change
in
man

woman
and
in
other
part
of
their

be
not

happen
.




some
one
quite
in
the
middle
of
the
middle
living
in
that
one
be
meet
some
one
who
be
at
the

and
be
then
strike
by
the
change
in
that
one
and
that
one
be
then
strike
by
the
change
in
the
other
one
and
each
one
be
then
know
that
every
one
be
change
some
.




some
be
begin
see
change
in
every

when
they
be
in

be
realise
all
his
living
that

he
be

,
really
see
this
thing
until
the
middle
of
the
beginning
of
his
middle
living
and
then
he
be
love
this
thing
and
look
at
each
one
and
think
about
this
thing
and
live
in
this
thing
,
and
be
a
little
frightened
by
this
thing
and
be
content
by
this
thing
and
be
convince
of
this
thing
and
tell
it
to
himself
about
each

he
be
know
and
be
certain
that
be
live
be
a
thing
be
exist
and
be
then
almost
completely
certain
of
this
thing
.
he
be
then
one
who
come
to
be
a
dead
one
at
the
beginning
of
the
middle
of
his
middle
living
and
he
have
be
one
who
have
be
almost
completely
fully
live
in
change
be
exist
in
every

.
he
have
be

.
he
have
be
one
almost
completely

and
be
then
a
little
and
a
little
not
such
a
young
one
.
he
be
one
certainly
need
to
be
one
realise
change
be
exist
.
he
be
one
completely
enjoy
see
change

and
not
such
young

and
quite
old
one
and
certainly
he
sometimes
be
feel
change
be
exist
but
not
very
much
then
certainly
not
very
much
then
because
