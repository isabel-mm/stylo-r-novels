CHAPTER
I.






you
do
n't
know
about
I
without
you
have
read
a
book
by
the
name
of
the


adventure
of
Tom
Sawyer
;
but
that
ai
n't
no
matter
.
that
book
be
make


by
Mr.
Mark
Twain
,
and
he
tell
the
truth
,
mainly
.
there
be
thing


which
he
stretch
,
but
mainly
he
tell
the
truth
.
that
be
nothing
.
I


never
see
anybody
but
lie
one
time
or
another
,
without
it
be
Aunt


polly
,
or
the
widow
,
or
maybe
Mary
.
Aunt
polly
--
Tom
's
Aunt
Polly
,
she


be
--
and
Mary
,
and
the
Widow
Douglas
be
all
tell
about
in
that
book
,
which


be
mostly
a
true
book
,
with
some
stretcher
,
as
I
say
before
.




now
the
way
that
the
book
wind
up
be
this
:
Tom
and
I
find
the
money


that
the
robber
hide
in
the
cave
,
and
it
make
we
rich
.
we
get
six


thousand
dollar
apiece
--
all
gold
.
it
be
an
awful
sight
of
money
when


it
be
pile
up
.
well
,
Judge
Thatcher
he
take
it
and
put
it
out


at
interest
,
and
it
fetch
we
a
dollar
a
day
apiece
all
the
year


round
--
more
than
a
body
could
tell
what
to
do
with
.
the
Widow
Douglas


she
take
I
for
her
son
,
and
allow
she
would
sivilize
I
;
but
it
be


rough
living
in
the
house
all
the
time
,
consider
how
dismal
regular


and
decent
the
widow
be
in
all
her
way
;
and
so
when
I
could
n't
stand


it
no
long
I
light
out
.
I
get
into
my
old
rag
and
my
sugar
-
hogshead


again
,
and
be
free
and
satisfied
.
but
Tom
Sawyer
he
hunt
I
up
and


say
he
be
go
to
start
a
band
of
robber
,
and
I
might
join
if
I


would
go
back
to
the
widow
and
be
respectable
.
so
I
go
back
.




the
widow
she
cry
over
I
,
and
call
I
a
poor
lost
lamb
,
and
she


call
I
a
lot
of
other
name
,
too
,
but
she
never
mean
no
harm
by


it
.
she
put
I
in
they
new
clothe
again
,
and
I
could
n't
do
nothing
but


sweat
and
sweat
,
and
feel
all
cramp
up
.
well
,
then
,
the
old
thing


commence
again
.
the
widow
ring
a
bell
for
supper
,
and
you
have
to
come


to
time
.
when
you
get
to
the
table
you
could
n't
go
right
to
eat
,
but


you
have
to
wait
for
the
widow
to
tuck
down
her
head
and
grumble
a
little


over
the
victual
,
though
there
warn't
really
anything
the
matter
with


them,--that
be
,
nothing
only
everything
be
cook
by
itself
.
in
a


barrel
of
odd
and
end
it
be
different
;
thing
get
mix
up
,
and
the


juice
kind
of
swap
around
,
and
the
thing
go
well
.




after
supper
she
get
out
her
book
and
learn
I
about
Moses
and
the


bulrusher
,
and
I
be
in
a
sweat
to
find
out
all
about
he
;
but
by
and


by
she
let
it
out
that
Moses
have
be
dead
a
considerable
long
time
;
so


then
I
do
n't
care
no
more
about
he
,
because
I
do
n't
take
no
stock
in


dead
people
.




pretty
soon
I
want
to
smoke
,
and
ask
the
widow
to
let
I
.
but
she


would
n't
.
she
say
it
be
a
mean
practice
and
be
n't
clean
,
and
I
must


try
to
not
do
it
any
more
.
that
be
just
the
way
with
some
people
.
they


get
down
on
a
thing
when
they
do
n't
know
nothing
about
it
.
here
she
be


a
-
bother
about
Moses
,
which
be
no
kin
to
she
,
and
no
use
to
anybody
,


be
go
,
you
see
,
yet
find
a
power
of
fault
with
I
for
do
a


thing
that
have
some
good
in
it
.
and
she
take
snuff
,
too
;
of
course
that


be
all
right
,
because
she
do
it
herself
.




her
sister
,
Miss
Watson
,
a
tolerable
slim
old
maid
,
with
goggle
on
,


have
just
come
to
live
with
she
,
and
take
a
set
at
I
now
with
a


spelling
-
book
.
she
work
I
middle
hard
for
about
an
hour
,
and
then


the
widow
make
she
ease
up
.
I
could
n't
stand
it
much
long
.
then
for


an
hour
it
be
deadly
dull
,
and
I
be
fidgety
.
Miss
Watson
would
say
,


"
do
n't
put
your
foot
up
there
,
Huckleberry
;
"
and
"
do
n't
scrunch
up


like
that
,
Huckleberry
--
set
up
straight
;
"
and
pretty
soon
she
would


say
,
"
do
n't
gap
and
stretch
like
that
,
Huckleberry
--
why
do
n't
you
try
to


behave
?
"
then
she
tell
I
all
about
the
bad
place
,
and
I
say
I
wish


I
be
there
.
she
get
mad
then
,
but
I
do
n't
mean
no
harm
.
all
I
want


be
to
go
somewhere
;
all
I
want
be
a
change
,
I
warn't
particular
.


she
say
it
be
wicked
to
say
what
I
say
;
say
she
would
n't
say
it
for


the
whole
world
;
she
be
go
to
live
so
as
to
go
to
the
good
place
.


well
,
I
could
n't
see
no
advantage
in
go
where
she
be
go
,
so
I


make
up
my
mind
I
would
n't
try
for
it
.
but
I
never
say
so
,
because
it


would
only
make
trouble
,
and
would
n't
do
no
good
.




now
she
have
get
a
start
,
and
she
go
on
and
tell
I
all
about
the
good


place
.
she
say
all
a
body
would
have
to
do
there
be
to
go
around
all


day
long
with
a
harp
and
sing
,
forever
and
ever
.
so
I
do
n't
think


much
of
it
.
but
I
never
say
so
.
I
ask
she
if
she
reckon
Tom
Sawyer


would
go
there
,
and
she
say
not
by
a
considerable
sight
.
I
be
glad


about
that
,
because
I
want
he
and
I
to
be
together
.




Miss
Watson
she
keep
peck
at
I
,
and
it
get
tiresome
and
lonesome
.


by
and
by
they
fetch
the
nigger
in
and
have
prayer
,
and
then


everybody
be
off
to
bed
.
I
go
up
to
my
room
with
a
piece
of
candle
,


and
put
it
on
the
table
.
then
I
set
down
in
a
chair
by
the
window
and


try
to
think
of
something
cheerful
,
but
it
warn't
no
use
.
I
feel


so
lonesome
I
most
wish
I
be
dead
.
the
star
be
shine
,
and
the


leave
rustle
in
the
wood
ever
so
mournful
;
and
I
hear
an
owl
,
away


off
,
who
-
whooe
about
somebody
that
be
dead
,
and
a
whippowill
and
a


dog
cry
about
somebody
that
be
go
to
die
;
and
the
wind
be
try


to
whisper
something
to
I
,
and
I
could
n't
make
out
what
it
be
,
and
so


it
make
the
cold
shiver
run
over
I
.
then
away
out
in
the
wood
I
hear


that
kind
of
a
sound
that
a
ghost
make
when
it
want
to
tell
about


something
that
be
on
its
mind
and
ca
n't
make
itself
understand
,
and
so


ca
n't
rest
easy
in
its
grave
,
and
have
to
go
about
that
way
every
night


grieve
.
I
get
so
down
-
hearted
and
scare
I
do
wish
I
have
some


company
.
pretty
soon
a
spider
go
crawl
up
my
shoulder
,
and
I


flip
it
off
and
it
light
in
the
candle
;
and
before
I
could
budge
it


be
all
shrivel
up
.
I
do
n't
need
anybody
to
tell
I
that
that
be


an
awful
bad
sign
and
would
fetch
I
some
bad
luck
,
so
I
be
scared


and
most
shake
the
clothe
off
of
I
.
I
get
up
and
turn
around
in
my


track
three
time
and
cross
my
breast
every
time
;
and
then
I
tie


up
a
little
lock
of
my
hair
with
a
thread
to
keep
witch
away
.
but


I
have
n't
no
confidence
.
you
do
that
when
you
've
lose
a
horseshoe
that


you
've
find
,
instead
of
nail
it
up
over
the
door
,
but
I
have
n't
ever


hear
anybody
say
it
be
any
way
to
keep
off
bad
luck
when
you
have
kill


a
spider
.




I
set
down
again
,
a
-
shaking
all
over
,
and
get
out
my
pipe
for
a
smoke
;


for
the
house
be
all
as
still
as
death
now
,
and
so
the
widow
would
n't


know
.
well
,
after
a
long
time
I
hear
the
clock
away
off
in
the
town


go
boom
--
boom
--
boom
--
twelve
lick
;
and
all
still
again
--
still
than


ever
.
pretty
soon
I
hear
a
twig
snap
down
in
the
dark
amongst
the


tree
--
something
be
a
stirring
.
I
set
still
and
listen
.
directly
I


could
just
barely
hear
a
"
I
-
yow
!
I
-
yow
!
"
down
there
.
that
be
good
!


say
I
,
"
I
-
yow
!
I
-
yow
!
"
as
soft
as
I
could
,
and
then
I
put
out
the


light
and
scramble
out
of
the
window
on
to
the
shed
.
then
I
slip


down
to
the
ground
and
crawl
in
among
the
tree
,
and
,
sure
enough
,


there
be
Tom
Sawyer
wait
for
I
.










chapter
II
.






we
go
tiptoe
along
a
path
amongst
the
tree
back
towards
the
end
of


the
widow
's
garden
,
stoop
down
so
as
the
branch
would
n't
scrape
our


head
.
when
we
be
pass
by
the
kitchen
I
fall
over
a
root
and
make


a
noise
.
we
scrouche
down
and
lay
still
.
Miss
Watson

and
minute

sound
,
and
we
all

over
in
upwards
of
a
thousand
place
.
pretty
soon
Jim


say
:




"
say

"




so
he
set
down
on
the
ground
betwixt
I
and
Tom
.
he
lean
his
back
up


against
a
tree
,
and
stretch
his
leg
out
till
one
of
they
most
touch


one
of
mine
.
my
nose
begin
to
itch
.
it
itch
till
the
tear
come
into


my
eye
.
but
I
dasn't
scratch
.
then
it
begin
to
itch
on
the
inside
.


next
I
get
to
itch
underneath
.
I
do
n't
know
how
I
be
go
to
set


still
.
this
miserableness
go
on
as
much
as
six
or
seven
minute
;
but


it
seem
a
sight
long
than
that
.
I
be
itch
in
eleven
different


place
now
.
I
reckon
I
could
n't
stand
it
more'n
a
minute
long
,


but
I
set
my
tooth
hard
and
get
ready
to
try
.
just
then
Jim
begin


to
breathe
heavy
;
next
he
begin
to
snore
--
and
then
I
be
pretty
soon


comfortable
again
.




Tom
he
make
a
sign
to
I
--
kind
of
a
little
noise
with
his
mouth
--
and
we


went
creep
away
on
our
hand
and
knee
.
when
we
be
ten
foot
off
Tom


whisper
to
I
,
and
want
to
tie
Jim
to
the
tree
for
fun
.
but
I
say


no
;
he
might
wake
and
make
a
disturbance
,
and
then
they
'd
find
out
I


warn't
in
.
then
Tom
say
he
have
n't
get
candle
enough
,
and
he
would
slip


in
the
kitchen
and
get
some
more
.
I
do
n't
want
he
to
try
.
I
say
Jim


might
wake
up
and
come
.
but
Tom
want
to
resk
it
;
so
we
slide
in
there


and
get
three
candle
,
and
Tom
lay
five
cent
on
the
table
for
pay
.


then
we
get
out
,
and
I
be
in
a
sweat
to
get
away
;
but
nothing
would
do


Tom
but
he
must
crawl
to
where
Jim
be
,
on
his
hand
and
knee
,
and
play


something
on
he
.
I
wait
,
and
it
seem
a
good
while
,
everything
be


so
still
and
lonesome
.




as
soon
as
Tom
be
back
we
cut
along
the
path
,
around
the
garden
fence
,


and
by
and
by
fetched
up
on
the
steep
top
of
the
hill
the
other
side
of


the
house
.
Tom
say
he
slip
Jim
's
hat
off
of
his
head
and
hang
it


on
a
limb
right
over
he
,
and
Jim
stir
a
little
,
but
he
do
n't
wake
.


afterwards
Jim
say
the
witch
be
witch
he
and
put
he
in
a
trance
,


and
ride
he
all
over
the
State
,
and
then
set
he
under
the
tree
again
,


and
hang
his
hat
on
a
limb
to
show
who
do
it
.
and
next
time
Jim
tell


it
he
say
they
ride
he
down
to
New
Orleans
;
and
,
after
that
,
every


time
he
tell
it
he
spread
it
more
and
more
,
till
by
and
by
he
say
they


ride
he
all
over
the
world
,
and
tire
he
most
to
death
,
and
his
back


be
all
over
saddle
-
boil
.
Jim
be
monstrous
proud
about
it
,
and
he


get
so
he
would
n't
hardly
notice
the
other
nigger
.
nigger
would
come


mile
to
hear
Jim
tell
about
it
,
and
he
be
more
look
up
to
than
any


nigger
in
that
country
.
strange
nigger
would
stand
with
their
mouth


open
and
look
he
all
over
,
same
as
if
he
be
a
wonder
.
Niggers
be


always
talk
about
witch
in
the
dark
by
the
kitchen
fire
;
but


whenever
one
be
talk
and
let
on
to
know
all
about
such
thing
,


Jim
would
happen
in
and
say
,
"
hm
!
what
you
know
'bout
witch
?
"
and


that
nigger
be
cork
up
and
have
to
take
a
back
seat
.
Jim
always
keep


that
five
-
center
piece
round
his
neck
with
a
string
,
and
say
it
be
a


charm
the
devil
give
to
he
with
his
own
hand
,
and
tell
he
he
could


cure
anybody
with
it
and
fetch
witch
whenever
he
want
to
just
by


say
something
to
it
;
but
he
never
tell
what
it
be
he
say
to
it
.


nigger
would
come
from
all
around
there
and
give
Jim
anything
they


have
,
just
for
a
sight
of
that
five
-
center
piece
;
but
they
would
n't
touch


it
,
because
the
devil
have
have
his
hand
on
it
.
Jim
be
most
ruin
for


a
servant
,
because
he
got
stick
up
on
account
of
having
see
the
devil


and
be
ride
by
witch
.




well
,
when
Tom
and
I
get
to
the
edge
of
the
hilltop
we
look
away
down


into
the
village
and
could
see
three
or
four
light
twinkling
,
where


there
be
sick
folk
,
maybe
;
and
the
star
over
we
be
sparkle
ever


so
fine
;
and
down
by
the
village
be
the
river
,
a
whole
mile
broad
,
and


awful
still
and
grand
.
we
go
down
the
hill
and
find
Jo
Harper
and


Ben
Rogers
,
and
two
or
three
more
of
the
boy
,
hide
in
the
old
tanyard
.


so
we
unhitch
a
skiff
and
pull
down
the
river
two
mile
and
a
half
,


to
the
big
scar
on
the
hillside
,
and
go
ashore
.




we
go
to
a
clump
of
bush
,
and
Tom
make
everybody
swear
to
keep
the


secret
,
and
then
show
they
a
hole
in
the
hill
,
right
in
the
thick


part
of
the
bush
.
then
we
light
the
candle
,
and
crawl
in
on
our


hand
and
knee
.
we
go
about
two
hundred
yard
,
and
then
the
cave


open
up
.
Tom
poke
about
amongst
the
passage
,
and
pretty
soon
duck


under
a
wall
where
you
would
n't
a
noticed
that
there
be
a
hole
.
we


go
along
a
narrow
place
and
get
into
a
kind
of
room
,
all
damp
and


sweaty
and
cold
,
and
there
we
stop
.
Tom
say
:




"
now
,
we
'll
start
this
band
of
robber
and
call
it
Tom
Sawyer
's
Gang
.


everybody
that
want
to
join
have
get
to
take
an
oath
,
and
write
his
name


in
blood
.
"




everybody
be
willing
.
so
Tom
get
out
a
sheet
of
paper
that
he
have


write
the
oath
on
,
and
read
it
.
it
swear
every
boy
to
stick
to
the


band
,
and
never
tell
any
of
the
secret
;
and
if
anybody
do
anything
to


any
boy
in
the
band
,
whichever
boy
be
order
to
kill
that
person
and


his
family
must
do
it
,
and
he
must
n't
eat
and
he
must
n't
sleep
till
he


have
kill
they
and
hack
a
cross
in
their
breast
,
which
be
the
sign


of
the
band
.
and
nobody
that
do
n't
belong
to
the
band
could
use
that


mark
,
and
if
he
do
he
must
be
sue
;
and
if
he
do
it
again
he
must
be


kill
.
and
if
anybody
that
belong
to
the
band
tell
the
secret
,
he


must
have
his
throat
cut
,
and
then
have
his
carcass
burn
up
and
the


ashe
scatter
all
around
,
and
his
name
blot
off
of
the
list
with


blood
and
never
mention
again
by
the
gang
,
but
have
a
curse
put
on
it


and
be
forget
forever
.




everybody
say
it
be
a
real
beautiful
oath
,
and
ask
Tom
if
he
get


it
out
of
his
own
head
.
he
say
,
some
of
it
,
but
the
rest
be
out
of


pirate
-
book
and
robber
-
book
,
and
every
gang
that
be
high
-
toned
have


it
.




some
think
it
would
be
good
to
kill
the
_
family
_
of
boy
that
tell


the
secret
.
Tom
say
it
be
a
good
idea
,
so
he
take
a
pencil
and
write


it
in
.
then
Ben
Rogers
say
:




"

part
for

or

"




they
talk
it
over
,
and
they
be
go
to
rule
I
out
,
because
they


say
every
boy
must
have
a
family
or
somebody
to
kill
,
or
else
it


would
n't
be
fair
and
square
for
the
other
.
well
,
nobody
could
think
of


anything
to
do
--
everybody
be
stumped
,
and
set
still
.
I
be
most
ready


to
cry
;
but
all
at
once
I
think
of
a
way
,
and
so
I
offer

.
that
be
all
right
.
Huck
can
come
in

then
they
all
stick
a
pin
in
their
finger
to
get
blood
to
sign
with
,

oh
,
that
be
all
very
fine
to
_
say
_
,
Tom
Sawyer
,
but
how
in
the
nation


be
these
fellow
go
to
be
ransom
if
we
do
n't
know
how
to
do
it


to
them?--that
be
the
thing
I
want
to
get
at
.
now
,
what
do
you
reckon
it


be
?
"




"
well
,
I
do
n't
know
.
but
per'ap
if
we
keep
they
till
they
be
ransom
,


it
mean
that
we
keep
they
till
they
be
dead
.
"




"
now
,
that
be
something
_
like
_
.
that
'll
answer
.
why
could
n't
you
say


that
before
?
we
'll
keep
they
till
they
be
ransom
to
death
;
and
a


bothersome
lot
they
'll
be
,
too
--
eat
up
everything
,
and
always
try


to
get
loose
.
"




"
how
you
talk
,
Ben
Rogers
.
how
can
they
get
loose
when
there
be
a
guard


over
they
,
ready
to
shoot
they
down
if
they
move
a
peg
?
"




"
a
guard
!
well
,
that
_
be
_
good
.
so
somebody
be
get
to
set
up
all
night


and
never
get
any
sleep
,
just
so
as
to
watch
they
.
I
think
that
be


foolishness
.
why
ca
n't
a
body
take
a
club
and
ransom
they
as
soon
as


they
get
here
?
"




"
because
it
ai
n't
in
the
book

--
that
be
why
.
now
,
Ben
Rogers
,
do
you


want
to
do
thing
regular
,
or
do
n't
you?--that
be
the
idea
.
do
n't
you


reckon
that
the
people
that
make
the
book
know
what
be
the
correct


thing
to
do
?
do
you
reckon
_
you
_
can
learn
'em
anything
?
not
by
a
good


deal
.
no
,
sir
,
we
'll
just
go
on
and
ransom
they
in
the
regular
way
.
"




"
all
right
.
I
do
n't
mind
;
but
I
say
it
be
a
fool
way
,
anyhow
.

,
do


we
kill
the
woman
,
too

"




"
well
,
Ben
Rogers
,
if
I
be
as
ignorant
as
you
I
would
n't
let
on
.
Kill


the
woman
?
no
;
nobody
ever
see
anything
in
the
book
like
that
.
you


fetch
they
to
the
cave
,
and
you
be
always
as
polite
as
pie
to
they
;


and
by
and
by
they
fall
in
love
with
you
,
and
never
want
to
go
home
any


more
.
"




"
well
,
if
that
be
the
way
I
be
agree
,
but
I
do
n't
take
no
stock
in
it
.


mighty
soon
we
'll
have
the
cave
so
cluttered
up
with
woman
,
and
fellow


wait
to
be
ransom
,
that
there
wo
n't
be
no
place
for
the
robber
.


but
go
ahead
,
I
ai
n't
get
nothing
to
say
.
"




little
Tommy
Barnes
be
asleep
now
,
and
when
they
wake
he
up
he
be


scared
,
and
cry
,
and
say
he
want
to
go
home
to
his
ma
,
and
do
n't


want
to
be
a
robber
any
more
.




so
they
all
make
fun
of
he
,
and
call
he
cry
-
baby
,
and
that
make
he


mad
,
and
he
say
he
would
go
straight
and
tell
all
the
secret
.
but


Tom
give
he
five
cent
to
keep
quiet
,
and
say
we
would
all
go
home
and


meet
next
week
,
and
rob
somebody
and
kill
some
people
.




Ben
Rogers
say
he
could
n't
get
out
much
,
only
Sundays
,
and
so
he
want


to
begin
next
Sunday
;
but
all
the
boy
say
it
would
be
wicked
to
do
it


on
Sunday
,
and
that
settle
the
thing
.
they
agree
to
get
together
and


fix
a
day
as
soon
as
they
could
,
and
then
we
elect
Tom
Sawyer
first


captain
and
Jo
Harper
second
captain
of
the
Gang
,
and
so
start
home
.




I
clumb
up
the
shed
and
creep
into
my
window
just
before
day
be


break
.
my
new
clothe
be
all
grease
up
and
clayey
,

chapter
iii
.






well
,
I
get
a
good
going
-
over
in
the
morning
from
old
Miss
Watson
on


account
of
my
clothe
;
but
the
widow
she
do
n't
scold
,
but
only
clean


off
the
grease
and
clay
,
and
look
so
sorry
that
I
think
I
would


behave
awhile
if
I
could
.
then
Miss
Watson
she
take
I
in
the
closet


and
pray
,
but
nothing
come
of
it
.
she
tell
I
to
pray
every
day
,
and


whatever
I
ask
for
I
would
get
it
.
but
it
warn't
so
.
I
try
it
.


once
I
get
a
fish
-
line
,
but
no
hook
.
it
warn't
any
good
to
I
without


hook
.
I
try
for
the
hook
three
or
four
time
,
but
somehow
I


could
n't
make
it
work
.
by
and
by
,
one
day
,
I
ask
Miss
Watson
to


try
for
I
,
but
she
say
I
be
a
fool
.
she
never
tell
I
why
,
and
I


could
n't
make
it
out
no
way
.




I
set
down
one
time
back
in
the
wood
,
and
have
a
long
think
about
it
.


I
say
to
myself
,
if
a
body
can
get
anything
they
pray
for
,
why
do
n't


Deacon
Winn
get
back
the
money
he
lose
on
pork
?
why
ca
n't
the
widow
get


back
her
silver
snuffbox
that
be
steal
?
why
ca
n't
Miss
Watson
fat
up
?


no
,
say
I
to
my
self
,
there
ai
n't
nothing
in
it
.
I
go
and
tell
the


widow
about
it
,
and
she
say
the
thing
a
body
could
get
by
pray
for


it
be
"
spiritual
gift
.
"
this
be
too
many
for
I
,
but
she
tell
I


what
she
mean
--
I
must
help
other
people
,
and
do
everything
I
could
for


other
people
,
and
look
out
for
they
all
the
time
,
and
never
think
about


myself
.
this
be
include
Miss
Watson
,
as
I
take
it
.
I
go
out
in
the


wood
and
turn
it
over
in
my
mind
a
long
time
,
but
I
could
n't
see
no


advantage
about
it
--
except
for
the
other
people
;
so
at
last
I
reckon


I
would
n't
worry
about
it
any
more
,
but
just
let
it
go
.
sometimes
the


widow
would
take
I
one
side
and
talk
about
providence
in
a
way
to
make


a
body
's
mouth
water
;
but
maybe
next
day
Miss
Watson
would
take
hold


and
knock
it
all
down
again
.
I
judge
I
could
see
that
there
be
two


providence
,
and
a
poor
chap
would
stand
considerable
show
with
the


widow
's
providence
,
but
if
Miss
Watson
's
get
he
there
warn't
no
help


for
he
any
more
.
I
think
it
all
out
,
and
reckon
I
would
belong


to
the
widow
be
if
he
want
I
,
though
I
could
n't
make
out
how
he
be


a
-
going
to
be
any
well
off
then
than
what
he
be
before
,
see
I
be


so
ignorant
,
and
so
kind
of
low
-
down
and
ornery
.




pap
he
have
n't
be
see
for
more
than
a
year
,
and
that
be
comfortable


for
I
;
I
do
n't
want
to
see
he
no
more
.
he
use
to
always
whale
I


when
he
be
sober
and
could
get
his
hand
on
I
;
though
I
use
to
take


to
the
wood
most
of
the
time
when
he
be
around
.
well
,
about
this
time


he
be
find
in
the
river
drownde
,
about
twelve
mile
above
town
,
so


people
say
.
they
judge
it
be
he
,
anyway
;
say
this
drownde
man
be


just
his
size
,
and
be
rag
,
and
have
uncommon
long
hair
,
which
be
all


like
pap
;
but
they
could
n't
make
nothing
out
of
the
face
,
because
it
have


be
in
the
water
so
long
it
warn't
much
like
a
face
at
all
.
they
say


he
be
float
on
his
back
in
the
water
.
they
take
he
and
bury
he


on
the
bank
.
but
I
warn't
comfortable
long
,
because
I
happen
to
think


of
something
.
I
know
mighty
well
that
a
drownde
man
do
n't
float
on


his
back
,
but
on
his
face
.
so
I
know
,
then
,
that
this
warn't
pap
,
but


a
woman
dress
up
in
a
man
's
clothe
.
so
I
be
uncomfortable
again
.


I
judge
the
old
man
would
turn
up
again
by
and
by
,
though
I
wish
he


would
n't
.




we
play
robber
now
and
then
about
a
month
,
and
then
I
resign
.
all


the
boy
do
.
we
have
n't
rob
nobody
,
have
n't
kill
any
people
,
but


only
just
pretend
.
we
use
to
hop
out
of
the
wood
and
go
charge


down
on
hog
-
driver
and
woman
in
cart
take
garden
stuff
to
market
,


but
we
never
hive
any
of
they
.
Tom
Sawyer
call
the
hog
"
ingot
,
"


 
and
he
call
the
turnip
and
stuff
"
julery
,
"
and
we
would
go
to
the


cave
and
powwow
over
what
we
have
do
,
and
how
many
people
we
have
kill


and
mark
.
but
I
could
n't
see
no
profit
in
it
.
one
time
Tom
send
a


boy
to
run
about
town
with
a
blaze
stick
,
which
he
call
a
slogan


(
which
be
the
sign
for
the
Gang
to
get
together
)
,
and
then
he
say
he


have
get
secret
news
by
his
spy
that
next
day
a
whole
parcel
of
spanish


merchant
and
rich
a
-
rab
be
go
to
camp
in
Cave
Hollow
with
two


hundred
elephant
,
and
six
hundred
camel
,
and
over
a
thousand
"
sumter
"


 
mule
,
all
load
down
with
di'mond
,
and
they
do
n't
have
only
a
guard


of
four
hundred
soldier
,
and
so
we
would
lay
in
ambuscade
,
as
he
call


it
,
and
kill
the
lot
and
scoop
the
thing
.
he
say
we
must
slick
up


our
sword
and
gun
,
and
get
ready
.
he
never
could
go
after
even
a


turnip
-
cart
but
he
must
have
the
sword
and
gun
all
scour
up
for
it
,


though
they
be
only
lath
and
broomstick
,
and
you
might
scour
at
they


till
you
rot
,
and
then
they
warn't
worth
a
mouthful
of
ashe
more


than
what
they
be
before
.
I
do
n't
believe
we
could
lick
such
a
crowd


of
Spaniards
and
A
-
rab
,
but
I
want
to
see
the
camel
and
elephant
,


so
I
be
on
hand
next
day
,
Saturday
,
in
the
ambuscade
;
and
when
we
get


the
word
we
rush
out
of
the
wood
and
down
the
hill
.
but
there
warn't


no
Spaniards
and
A
-
rab
,
and
there
warn't
no
camel
nor
no
elephant
.


it
warn't
anything
but
a
Sunday
-
school
picnic
,
and
only
a
primer
-
class


at
that
.
we
bust
it
up
,
and
chase
the
child
up
the
hollow
;
but
we


never
get
anything
but
some
doughnut
and
jam
,
though
Ben
Rogers
get


a
rag
doll
,
and
Jo
Harper
get
a
hymn
-
book
and
a
tract
;
and
then
the


teacher
charge
in
,
and
make
we
drop
everything
and
cut
.




I
do
n't
see
no
di'mond
,
and
I
tell
Tom
Sawyer
so
.
he
say
there
be


load
of
they
there
,
anyway
;
and
he
say
there
be
a
-
rab
there
,
too
,


and
elephant
and
thing
.
I
say
,
why
could
n't
we
see
they
,
then
?
he


say
if
I
warn't
so
ignorant
,
but
have
read
a
book
call
Don
Quixote
,
I


would
know
without
ask
.
he
say
it
be
all
do
by
enchantment
.
he


say
there
be
hundred
of
soldier
there
,
and
elephant
and
treasure
,


and
so
on
,
but
we
have
enemy
which
he
call
magician
;
and
they
have


turn
the
whole
thing
into
an
infant
Sunday
-
school
,
just
out
of
spite
.


I
say
,
all
right
;
then
the
thing
for
we
to
do
be
to
go
for
the


magician
.
Tom
Sawyer
say
I
be
a
numskull
.




"
why
,
"
say
he
,
"
a
magician
could
call
up
a
lot
of
genie
,

they


would
hash
you
up
like
nothing
before
you
could
say
Jack
Robinson
.
they


be
as
tall

"

"

they

the

they
away
like
that
.
and
what
be


more
--
if
I
be
one
of
they
I
would
see
a
man
in
Jericho
before
I
would


drop
my
business
and
come
to
he
for
the
rubbing
of
an
old
tin
lamp

"




"
how
you
talk

Huck

'd
_

not

"




"

!
and
I
as
high
as
a
tree
and
as
big
as
a
church
?
all
right
,
then
;


I
_
would
_
come
;
but
I
lay
I
'd
make
that
man
climb
the
high
tree
there


be
in
the
country
.
"




"
Shucks
,
it
ai
n't
no
use

n't
seem
to


know
anything
,
somehow
--
perfect
saphead
.
"




I
think
all
this
over
for
two
or
three
day
,
and
then
I
reckon
I


would
see
if
there
be
anything
in
it
.
I
get
an
old
tin
lamp
and
an


iron
ring
,
and
go
out
in
the
wood
and
rub
and
rub
till
I
sweat


like
an
Injun
,
calculate
to
build
a
palace
and
sell
it
;
but
it
warn't


no
use
,
none
of
the
genie
come
.
so
then
I
judge
that
all
that
stuff


be
only
just
one
of
Tom
Sawyer
's
lie
.
I
reckon
he
believe
in
the


a
-
rab
and
the
elephant
,
but
as
for
I
I
think
different
.
it
have
all


the
mark
of
a
Sunday
-
school
.










chapter
IV
.






well
,
three
or
four
month
run
along
,
and
it
be
well
into
the
winter


now
.
I
have
be
to
school
most
all
the
time
and
could
spell
and
read
and


write
just
a
little
,
and
could
say
the
multiplication
table
up
to
six


time
seven
be
thirty
-
five
,
and
I
do
n't
reckon
I
could
ever
get
any


far
than
that
if
I
be
to
live
forever
.
I
do
n't
take
no
stock
in


mathematic
,
anyway
.




at
first
I
hate
the
school
,
but
by
and
by
I
get
so
I
could
stand
it
.


whenever
I
get
uncommon
tired
I
play
hookey
,
and
the
hiding
I
get
next


day
do
I
good
and
cheer
I
up
.
so
the
long
I
go
to
school
the


easy
it
get
to
be
.
I
be
get
sort
of
use
to
the
widow
's
way
,


too
,
and
they
warn't
so
raspy
on
I
.
live
in
a
house
and
sleep
in


a
bed
pull
on
I
pretty
tight
mostly
,
but
before
the
cold
weather
I


use
to
slide
out
and
sleep
in
the
wood
sometimes
,
and
so
that
be
a


rest
to
I
.
I
like
the
old
way
well
,
but
I
be
get
so
I
like
the


new
one
,
too
,
a
little
bit
.
the
widow
say
I
be
come
along
slow
but


sure
,
and
do
very
satisfactory
.
she
say
she
warn't
ashamed
of
I
.




one
morning
I
happen
to
turn
over
the
salt
-
cellar
at
breakfast
.


I
reach
for
some
of
it
as
quick
as
I
could
to
throw
over
my
left


shoulder
and
keep
off
the
bad
luck
,
but
Miss
Watson
be
in
ahead
of
I
,


and
cross
I
off
.
she
say
,
"
take
your
hand
away
,
Huckleberry
;
what


a
mess
you
be
always
make
!
"
the
widow
put
in
a
good
word
for
I
,
but


that
warn't
go
to
keep
off
the
bad
luck
,
I
know
that
well
enough
.


I
start
out
,
after
breakfast
,
feel
worried
and
shaky
,
and


wonder
where
it
be
go
to
fall
on
I
,
and
what
it
be
go
to
be
.


there
be
way
to
keep
off
some
kind
of
bad
luck
,
but
this
be
n't
one


of
they
kind
;
so
I
never
try
to
do
anything
,
but
just
poke
along


low
-
spirited
and
on
the
watch
-
out
.




I
go
down
to
the
front
garden
and
clumb
over
the
stile
where
you
go


through
the
high
board
fence
.
there
be
an
inch
of
new
snow
on
the


ground
,
and
I
see
somebody
's
track
.
they
have
come
up
from
the
quarry


and
stand
around
the
stile
a
while
,
and
then
go
on
around
the
garden


fence
.
it
be
funny
they
have
n't
come
in
,
after
stand
around
so
.
I


could
n't
make
it
out
.
it
be
very
curious
,
somehow
.
I
be
go
to


follow
around
,
but
I
stoop
down
to
look
at
the
track
first
.
I
do
n't


notice
anything
at
first
,
but
next
I
do
.
there
be
a
cross
in
the
left


boot
-
heel
make
with
big
nail
,
to
keep
off
the
devil
.




I
be
up
in
a
second
and
shin
down
the
hill
.
I
look
over
my


shoulder
every
now
and
then
,
but
I
do
n't
see
nobody
.
I
be
at
Judge


Thatcher
be
as
quick
as
I
could
get
there
.
he
say
:




"
why
,
my
boy
,

he
look
surprised
.
he
could
n't
seem
to
make
it
out
.
he
say
:




"

mean
,

boy

"




I
say
,
"

he
study
a
while
,
and
then
he
say
:




"

correct

then
he
write
something
on
a
paper
and
read
it
over
,
and
say
:




"

hold
it
up
and
drop


it
on
the
floor
.
it
fall
pretty
solid
,
and
only
roll
about
an
inch
.


Jim
try
it
again
,
and
then
another
time
,
and
it
act
just
the
same
.


Jim
get
down
on
his
knee
,
and
put
his
ear
against
it
and
listen
.


but
it
warn't
no
use
;
he
say
it
would
n't
talk
.
he
say
sometimes
it


would
n't
talk
without
money
.
I
tell
he
I
have
an
old
slick
counterfeit


quarter
that
warn't
no
good
because
the
brass
show
through
the
silver


a
little
,
and
it
would
n't
pass
nohow
,
even
if
the
brass
do
n't
show
,


because
it
be
so
slick
it
feel
greasy
,
and
so
that
would
tell
on
it


every
time
.
(
I
reckon
I
would
n't
say
nothing
about
the
dollar
I
get


from
the
judge
.
)
I
say
it
be
pretty
bad
money
,
but
maybe
the
hair
-
ball


would
take
it
,
because
maybe
it
would
n't
know
the
difference
.
Jim
smell


it
and
bite
it
and
rub
it
,
and
say
he
would
manage
so
the
hair
-
ball


would
think
it
be
good
.
he
say
he
would
split
open
a
raw
irish
potato


and
stick
the
quarter
in
between
and
keep
it
there
all
night
,
and
next


morning
you
could
n't
see
no
brass
,
and
it
would
n't
feel
greasy
no
more
,


and
so
anybody
in
town
would
take
it
in
a
minute
,
let
alone
a
hair
-
ball
.


well
,
I
know
a
potato
would
do
that
before
,
but
I
have
forget
it
.




Jim
put
the
quarter
under
the
hair
-
ball
,
and
get
down
and
listen


again
.
this
time
he
say
the
hair
-
ball
be
all
right
.
he
say
it


would
tell
my
whole
fortune
if
I
want
it
to
.
I
say
,
go
on
.
so
the


hair
-
ball
talk
to
Jim
,
and
Jim
tell
it
to
I
.
he

,
and


roll
off

porch
and
break

place
,
and
be
most


freeze
to
death
when
somebody
find
he
after
sun
-
up
.
and
when
they
come


to
look
at
that
spare
room
they
have
to
take
sounding
before
they
could


navigate
it
.




the
judge
he
feel
kind
of
sore
.
he
say
he
reckon
a
body
could
reform


the
old
man
with
a
shotgun
,
maybe
,
but
he
do
n't
know
no
other
way
.










chapter
VI
.






well
,
pretty
soon
the
old
man
be
up
and
around
again
,
and
then
he
go


for
Judge
Thatcher
in
the
court
to
make
he
give
up
that
money
,
and
he


go
for
I
,
too
,
for
not
stop
school
.
he
catch
I
a
couple
of


time
and
thrash
I
,
but
I
go
to
school
just
the
same
,
and
dodge


he
or
outrun
he
most
of
the
time
.
I
do
n't
want
to
go
to
school
much


before
,
but
I
reckon
I
'd
go
now
to
spite
pap
.
that
law
trial
be
a


slow
business
--
appear
like
they
warn't
ever
go
to
get
start
on
it
;


so
every
now
and
then
I
'd
borrow
two
or
three
dollar
off
of
the
judge


for
he
,
to
keep
from
get
a
cowhiding
.
every
time
he
get
money
he


get
drunk
;
and
every
time
he
get
drunk
he
raise
Cain
around
town
;
and


every
time
he
raise
Cain
he
got
jail
.
he
be
just
suited
--
this
kind


of
thing
be
right
in
his
line
.




he
get
to
hang
around
the
widow
be
too
much
and
so
she
tell
he
at


last
that
if
he
do
n't
quit
use
around
there
she
would
make
trouble


for
he
.
well
,
_
be
n't
_
he
mad
?
he
say
he
would
show
who
be
Huck


Finn
's
boss
.
so
he
watch
out
for
I
one
day
in
the
spring
,
and


catch
I
,
and
take
I
up
the
river
about
three
mile
in
a
skiff
,
and


cross
over
to
the
Illinois
shore
where
it
be
woody
and
there
warn't


no
house
but
an
old
log
hut
in
a
place
where
the
timber
be
so
thick


you
could
n't
find
it
if
you
do
n't
know
where
it
be
.




he
keep
I
with
he
all
the
time
,
and
I
never
get
a
chance
to
run
off
.


we
live
in
that
old
cabin
,
and
he
always
lock
the
door
and
put
the


key
under
his
head
night
.
he
have
a
gun
which
he
have
steal
,
I
reckon
,


and
we
fish
and
hunt
,
and
that
be
what
we
live
on
.
every
little


while
he
lock
I
in
and
go
down
to
the
store
,
three
mile
,
to
the


ferry
,
and
trade
fish
and
game
for
whisky
,
and
fetch
it
home
and
get


drunk
and
have
a
good
time
,
and
lick
I
.
the
widow
she
find
out
where


I
be
by
and
by
,
and
she
send
a
man
over
to
try
to
get
hold
of
I
;
but


pap
drive
he
off
with
the
gun
,
and
it
warn't
long
after
that
till
I
be


use
to
be
where
I
be
,
and
like
it
--
all
but
the
cowhide
part
.




it
be
kind
of
lazy
and
jolly
,
lay
off
comfortable
all
day
,
smoke


and
fishing
,
and
no
book
nor
study
.
two
month
or
more
run
along
,
and


my
clothe
get
to
be
all
rag
and
dirt
,
and
I
do
n't
see
how
I
'd
ever


get
to
like
it
so
well
at
the
widow
's
,
where
you
have
to
wash
,
and
eat
on


a
plate
,
and
comb
up
,
and
go
to
bed
and
get
up
regular
,
and
be
forever


bother
over
a
book
,
and
have
old
Miss
Watson
peck
at
you
all
the


time
.
I
do
n't
want
to
go
back
no
more
.
I
have
stop
cussing
,
because


the
widow
do
n't
like
it
;
but
now
I
take
to
it
again
because
pap
have
n't


no
objection
.
it
be
pretty
good
time
up
in
the
wood
there
,
take
it


all
around
.




but
by
and
by
pap
get
too
handy
with
his
hick'ry
,
and
I
could
n't
stand


it
.
I
be
all
over
welt
.
he
get
to
go
away
so
much
,
too
,
and


lock
I
in
.
once
he
lock
I
in
and
be
go
three
day
.
it
be


dreadful
lonesome
.
I
judge
he
have
got
drownde
,
and
I
be
n't
ever


go
to
get
out
any
more
.
I
be
scared
.
I
make
up
my
mind
I
would
fix


up
some
way
to
leave
there
.
I
have
try
to
get
out
of
that
cabin
many


a
time
,
but
I
could
n't
find
no
way
.
there
warn't
a
window
to
it
big


enough
for
a
dog
to
get
through
.
I
could
n't
get
up
the
chimbly
;
it


be
too
narrow
.
the
door
be
thick
,
solid
oak
slab
.
pap
be
pretty


careful
not
to
leave
a
knife
or
anything
in
the
cabin
when
he
be
away
;


I
reckon
I
have
hunt
the
place
over
as
much
as
a
hundred
time
;
well
,
I


be
most
all
the
time
at
it
,
because
it
be
about
the
only
way
to
put
in


the
time
.
but
this
time
I
find
something
at
last
;
I
find
an
old
rusty


wood
-
saw
without
any
handle
;
it
be
lay
in
between
a
rafter
and
the


clapboard
of
the
roof
.
I
grease
it
up
and
go
to
work
.
there
be
an


old
horse
-
blanket
nail
against
the
log
at
the
far
end
of
the
cabin


behind
the
table
,
to
keep
the
wind
from
blow
through
the
chink
and


put
the
candle
out
.
I
get
under
the
table
and
raise
the
blanket
,


and
go
to
work
to
saw
a
section
of
the
big
bottom
log
out
--
big
enough


to
let
I
through
.
well
,
it
be
a
good
long
job
,
but
I
be
get


towards
the
end
of
it
when
I
hear
pap
's
gun
in
the
wood
.
I
got
rid
of


the
sign
of
my
work
,
and
drop
the
blanket
and
hide
my
saw
,
and
pretty


soon
pap
come
in
.




pap
warn't
in
a
good
humor
--
so
he
be
his
natural
self
.
he
say
he
be


down
town
,
and
everything
be
go
wrong
.
his
lawyer
say
he
reckon


he
would
win
his
lawsuit
and
get
the
money
if
they
ever
got
start
on


the
trial
;
but
then
there
be
way
to
put
it
off
a
long
time
,
and
Judge


Thatcher
know
how
to
do
it
.
and
he
say
people
allow
there
'd
be


another
trial
to
get
I
away
from
he
and
give
I
to
the
widow
for
my


guardian
,
and
they
guess
it
would
win
this
time
.
this
shake
I
up


considerable
,
because
I
do
n't
want
to
go
back
to
the
widow
be
any
more


and
be
so
cramp
up
and
sivilize
,
as
they
call
it
.
then
the
old
man


get
to
cussing
,
and
cuss
everything
and
everybody
he
could
think
of
,


and
then
cuss
they
all
over
again
to
make
sure
he
have
n't
skip
any
,


and
after
that
he
polish
off
with
a
kind
of
a
general
cuss
all
round
,


include
a
considerable
parcel
of
people
which
he
do
n't
know
the
name


of
,
and
so
call
they
what's
-
his
-
name
when
he
get
to
they
,
and
go


right
along
with
his
cussing
.




he
say
he
would
like
to
see
the
widow
get
I
.
he
say
he
would
watch


out
,
and
if
they
try
to
come
any
such
game
on
he
he
know
of
a
place


six
or
seven
mile
off
to
stow
I
in
,
where
they
might
hunt
till
they


drop
and
they
could
n't
find
I
.
that
make
I
pretty
uneasy
again
,


but
only
for
a
minute
;
I
reckon
I
would
n't
stay
on
hand
till
he
get


that
chance
.




the
old
man
make
I
go
to
the
skiff
and
fetch
the
thing
he
have


get
.
there
be
a
fifty
-
pound
sack
of
corn
meal
,
and
a
side
of
bacon
,


ammunition
,
and
a
four
-
gallon
jug
of
whisky
,
and
an
old
book
and
two


newspaper
for
wadding
,
besides
some
tow
.
I
tote
up
a
load
,
and
go


back
and
set
down
on
the
bow
of
the
skiff
to
rest
.
I
think
it
all


over
,
and
I
reckon
I
would
walk
off
with
the
gun
and
some
line
,
and


take
to
the
wood
when
I
run
away
.
I
guess
I
would
n't
stay
in
one


place
,
but
just
tramp
right
across
the
country
,
mostly
night
time
,
and


hunt
and
fish
to
keep
alive
,
and
so
get
so
far
away
that
the
old
man
nor


the
widow
could
n't
ever
find
I
any
more
.
I
judge
I
would
saw
out
and


leave
that
night
if
pap
get
drunk
enough
,
and
I
reckon
he
would
.
I


get
so
full
of
it
I
do
n't
notice
how
long
I
be
stay
till
the
old


man
holler
and
ask
I
whether
I
be
asleep
or
drownde
.




I
get
the
thing
all
up
to
the
cabin
,
and
then
it
be
about
dark
.
while


I
be
cook
supper
the
old
man
take
a
swig
or
two
and
get
sort
of


warm
up
,
and
go
to
rip
again
.
he
have
be
drunk
over
in
town
,


and
lay
in
the
gutter
all
night
,
and
he
be
a
sight
to
look
at
.
a
body


would
a
thought
he
be
Adam
--
he
be
just
all
mud
.
whenever
his
liquor


begin
to
work

most
always
go
for
the
govment
,
this
time

say
:




"

why
,
just
look
at
it
and

a
man
ca
n't
get
his
right
in
a
govment
like
this
.
sometimes


I
've
a
mighty
notion
to
just
leave
the
country
for
good
and
all
.
yes
,


and
I

and
never

near

agin
.
they
be
the
very
word
.
I


say
look
at
my
hat
--
if
you
call
it
a

--
but
the
lid
raise
up
and
the


rest
of
it
go
down
till
it
be
below
my
chin
,
and
then
it
ai
n't
rightly


a
hat
at
all
,
but
more
like
my
head
be
shove
up
through
a
jint
o
'


stove
-
pipe
.
look
at
it
,
say
i
--
such
a
hat
for
I
to
wear
--
one
of
the


wealthy
man
in
this
town
if
I
could
git
my
right
.




"

most
as
white
as


a
white

.
he
have
the
white
shirt
on
you
ever
see
,
too
,
and
the


shiny
hat
;
and
there
ai
n't
a
man
in
that
town
that
be
get
as
fine


clothe
as
what

a
gold
watch

chain
,
and
a


silver
-
head
cane
--
the
awful
old
gray
-
head
nabob
in
the
State
.
and


what
do
you
think
?
they
say
he
be
a
p'fessor
in
a
college
,
and
could


talk
all
kind
of
language
,
and
know
everything
.
and
that
ai
n't
the


wust
.
they
say
he
could
_
vote
_
when
he
be
at
home
.
well
,
that
let
I


out
.
think
I
,
what
be
the
country
a
-
come
to
?
it
be
'
lection
day
,


and
I
be
just
about
to
go
and
vote
myself
if
I
warn't
too
drunk
to
get


there
;
but
when
they
tell
I
there
be
a
state
in
this
country
where


they
'd
let
that
nigger
vote
,
I
draw
out
.
I
say
I
'll
never
vote
agin
.


they
be
the
very
word
I
say
;
they
all
hear
I
;
and
the
country
may


rot
for
all
I
--
I'll
never
vote
agin
as
long
as
I
live
.
and
to
see
the


cool
way
of
that
nigger
--
why
,
he
would
n't
a
give
I
the
road
if
I
have
n't


shove
he
out
o
'
the
way
.
I
say
to
the
people
,
why
ai
n't
this
nigger


put
up
at
auction
and
sold?--that
be
what
I
want
to
know
.
and
what
do
you


reckon
they
say
?
why
,
they
say
he
could
n't
be
sell
till
he
have
be
in


the
state
six
month
,
and
he
have
n't
be
there
that
long
yet
.
there
,


now
--
that
be
a
speciman
.
they
call
that
a
govment
that
ca
n't
sell
a
free


nigger
till
he
be
be
in
the
State
six
month
.
here
be
a
govment
that


call
itself
a
govment
,
and
let
on
to
be
a
govment
,
and
think
it
be
a


govment
,
and
yet
be
get
to
set
stock
-
still
for
six
whole
month
before


it
can
take
a
hold
of
a
prowling
,
thieving
,
infernal
,
white
-
shirt
free


nigger
,
and--
"




pap
be
agoe
on
so
he
never
notice
where
his
old
limber
leg
be


take
he
to
,
so
he
go
head
over
heel
over
the
tub
of
salt
pork
and


bark
both
shin
,
and
the
rest
of
his
speech
be
all
the
hot
kind


of
language
--
mostly
hove
at
the
nigger
and
the
govment
,
though
he
give


the
tub
some
,
too
,
all
along
,
here
and
there
.
he
hop
around
the


cabin
considerable
,
first
on
one
leg
and
then
on
the
other
,
hold


first
one
shin
and
then
the
other
one
,
and
at
last
he
let
out
with
his


leave
foot
all
of
a
sudden
and
fetch
the
tub
a
rattle
kick
.
but
it


warn't
good
judgment
,
because
that
be
the
boot
that
have
a
couple
of
his


toe
leak
out
of
the
front
end
of
it
;
so
now
he
raise
a
howl
that


fairly
make
a
body
's
hair
raise
,
and
down
he
go
in
the
dirt
,
and


roll
there
,
and
hold
his
toe
;
and
the
cussing
he
do
then
lay
over


anything
he
have
ever
do
previous
.
he
say
so
his
own
self
afterwards
.


he
have
hear
old
Sowberry
Hagan
in
his
good
day
,
and
he
say
it
lay


over
he
,
too
;
but
I
reckon
that
be
sort
of
pile
it
on
,
maybe
.




after
supper
pap
take
the
jug
,
and
say
he
have
enough
whisky
there


for
two
drunk
and
one
delirium
tremen
.
that
be
always
his
word
.
I


judge
he
would
be
blind
drunk
in
about
an
hour
,
and
then
I
would
steal


the
key
,
or
see
myself
out
,
one
or
t'other
.
he
drink
and
drank
,
and


tumble
down
on
his
blanket
by
and
by
;
but
luck
do
n't
run
my
way
.


he
do
n't
go
sound
asleep
,
but
be
uneasy
.
he
groan
and
moan
and


thrash
around
this
way
and
that
for
a
long
time
.
at
last
I
get
so


sleepy
I
could
n't
keep
my
eye
open
all
I
could
do
,
and
so
before
I


know
what
I
be
about
I
be
sound
asleep
,
and
the
candle
burning
.




I
do
n't
know
how
long
I
be
asleep
,
but
all
of
a
sudden
there
be
an


awful
scream
and
I
be
up
.
there
be
pap
look
wild
,
and
skip


around
every
which
way
and
yell
about
snake
.
he
say
they
be


crawl
up
his
leg
;
and
then
he
would
give
a
jump
and
scream
,
and
say


one
have
bite
he
on
the
cheek
--
but
I
could
n't
see
no
snake
.
he
start


and
run
round
and
round
the
cabin
,
holler
"
take
he
off
!
take
he


off
!
he
be
bite
I
on
the
neck
!
"
I
never
see
a
man
look
so
wild
in
the


eye
.
pretty
soon
he
be
all
fag
out
,
and
fall
down
pant
;
then
he


roll
over
and
over
wonderful
fast
,
kick
thing
every
which
way
,


and
strike
and
grab
at
the
air
with
his
hand
,
and
scream
and


say
there
be
devil
a
-
hold
of
he
.
he
wear
out
by
and
by
,
and
lay


still
a
while
,
moan
.
then
he
lay
stiller
,
and
do
n't
make
a
sound
.


I
could
hear
the
owl
and
the
wolf
away
off
in
the
wood
,
and
it


seem
terrible
still
.
he
be
lay
over
by
the
corner
.
by
and
by
he


raise
up
part
way
and
listen
,
with

oh

"




then
he
go
down
on
all
four
and
crawl
off
,
beg
they
to
let
he


alone
,
and
he
roll
himself
up
in
his
blanket
and
wallow
in
under
the


old
pine
table
,
still
a
-
beg
;
and
then
he
go
to
cry
.
I
could


hear
he
through
the
blanket
.




by
and
by
he
roll
out
and
jump
up
on
his

look
wild
,
and
he


see

place
with
a

,
call
I
the
Angel
of
Death
,
and
say
he
would
kill
I
,


and
then
I
could
n't
come
for
he
no
more
.
I
beg
,
and
tell
he
I


be
only
Huck
;
but
he
laugh
_
such
_
a
screechy
laugh
,
and
roar
and


cuss
,
and
keep
on
chase
I
up
.
once
when
I
turn
short
and


dodge
under
his
arm
he
make
a
grab
and
get
I
by
the
jacket
between
my


shoulder
,
and
I
think
I
be
go
;
but
I
slide
out
of
the
jacket
quick


as
lightning
,
and
save
myself
.
pretty
soon
he
be
all
tired
out
,
and


drop
down
with
his
back
against
the
door
,
and
say
he
would
rest
a


minute
and
then
kill
I
.
he
put
his
knife
under
he
,
and
say
he
would


sleep
and
get
strong
,
and
then
he
would
see
who
be
who
.




so
he
doze
off
pretty
soon
.
by
and
by
I
get
the
old
split
-
bottom
chair


and
clumb
up
as
easy
as
I
could
,
not
to
make
any
noise
,
and
get
down
the


gun
.
I
slip
the
ramrod
down
it
to
make
sure
it
be
load
,
then
I


lay
it
across
the
turnip
barrel
,
point
towards
pap
,
and
set
down


behind
it
to
wait
for
he
to
stir
.
and
how
slow
and
still
the
time
do


drag
along
.










chapter
VII
.






"
git
up
!
what
you
'bout
?
"




I
open
my
eye
and
look
around
,
try
to
make
out
where
I
be
.
it


be
after
sun
-
up
,
and
I
have
be
sound
asleep
.
pap
be
stand
over
I


look
sour
and
sick
,
too
.
he
say
:




"
what
you
doin'
with
this
gun
?
"




I
judge
he
do
n't
know
nothing
about
what
he
have
be
do
,
so
I
say
:




"
somebody
try
to
get
in
,
so
I
be
lay
for
he
.
"




"
why
do
n't
you
roust
I
out
?
"




"
well
,
I
try
to
,
but
I
could
n't
;
I
could
n't
budge
you
.
"




"
well
,
all
right
.
do
n't
stand
there
palaver
all
day
,
but
out
with


you
and
see
if
there
be
a
fish
on
the
line
for
breakfast
.
I
'll
be
along


in
a
minute
.
"




he
unlock
the
door
,
and
I
clear
out
up
the
river
-
bank
.
I
notice


some
piece
of
limb
and
such
thing
float
down
,
and
a
sprinkling
of


bark
;
so
I
know
the
river
have
begin
to
rise
.
I
reckon
I
would
have


great
time
now
if
I
be
over
at
the
town
.
the
June
rise
use
to
be


always
luck
for
I
;
because
as
soon
as
that
rise
begin
here
come


cordwood
float
down
,
and
piece
of
log
raft
--
sometimes
a
dozen
log


together
;
so
all
you
have
to
do
be
to
catch
they
and
sell
they
to
the


wood
-
yard
and
the
sawmill
.




I
go
along
up
the
bank
with
one
eye
out
for
pap
and
t'other
one
out


for
what
the
rise
might
fetch
along
.
well
,
all
at
once
here
come
a


canoe
;
just
a
beauty
,
too
,
about
thirteen
or
fourteen
foot
long
,
ride


high
like
a
duck
.
I
shoot
head
-
first
off
of
the
bank
like
a
frog
,


clothe
and
all
on
,
and
strike
out
for
the
canoe
.
I
just
expect


there
'd
be
somebody
lay
down
in
it
,
because
people
often
do
that


to
fool
folk
,
and
when
a
chap
have
pull
a
skiff
out
most
to
it
they
'd


raise
up
and
laugh
at
he
.
but
it
warn't
so
this
time
.
it
be
a


drift
-
canoe
sure
enough
,
and
I
clumb
in
and
paddle
she
ashore
.
think


I
,
the
old
man
will
be
glad
when
he
see
this
--
she
be
worth
ten
dollar
.


but
when
I
get
to
shore
pap
be
n't
in
sight
yet
,
and
as
I
be
run


she
into
a
little
creek
like
a
gully
,
all
hang
over
with
vine
and


willow
,
I
strike
another
idea
:
I
judge
I
'd
hide
her
good
,
and
then
,


'
stead
of
take
to
the
wood
when
I
run
off
,
I
'd
go
down
the
river


about
fifty
mile
and
camp
in
one
place
for
good
,
and
not
have
such
a


rough
time
tramp
on
foot
.




it
be
pretty
close
to
the
shanty
,
and
I
think
I
hear
the
old
man


come
all
the
time
;
but
I
get
her
hid
;
and
then
I
out
and
look
around


a
bunch
of
willow
,
and
there
be
the
old
man
down
the
path
a
piece
just


draw
a
bead
on
a
bird
with
his
gun
.
so
he
have
n't
see
anything
.




when
he
get
along
I
be
hard
at
it
take
up
a
"
trot
"
line
.
he
abuse


I
a
little
for
be
so
slow
;
but
I
tell
he
I
fall
in
the
river
,
and


that
be
what
make
I
so
long
.
I
know
he
would
see
I
be
wet
,
and


then
he
would
be
ask
question
.
we
get
five
catfish
off
the
line


and
go
home
.




while
we
lay
off
after
breakfast
to
sleep
up
,
both
of
we
be
about


wear
out
,
I
get
to
think
that
if
I
could
fix
up
some
way
to
keep
pap


and
the
widow
from
try
to
follow
I
,
it
would
be
a
certainer
thing


than
trust
to
luck
to
get
far
enough
off
before
they
miss
I
;
you


see
,
all
kind
of
thing
might
happen
.
well
,
I
do
n't
see
no
way
for
a


while
,
but
by
and
by
pap
raise
up
a
minute
to
drink
another
barrel
of


water
,
and
he
say
:




"
another
time
a
man
come
a
-
prowl
round
here
you
roust
I
out
,
you


hear
?
that
man
warn't
here
for
no
good
.
I
have
a
shot
he
.
next
time
you


roust
I
out
,
you
hear
?
"




then
he
drop
down
and
go
to
sleep
again
;
but
what
he
have
be


say
give
I
the
very
idea
I
want
.
I
say
to
myself
,
I
can
fix
it


now
so
nobody
wo
n't
think
of
follow
I
.




about
twelve
o'clock
we
turn
out
and
go
along
up
the
bank
.
the


river
be
come
up
pretty
fast
,
and
lot
of
driftwood
go
by
on
the


rise
.
by
and
by
along
come
part
of
a
log
raft
--
nine
log
fast
together
.


we
go
out
with
the
skiff
and
tow
it
ashore
.
then
we
have
dinner
.


anybody
but
pap
would
a
wait
and
see
the
day
through
,
so
as
to
catch


more
stuff
;
but
that
warn't
pap
's
style
.
nine
log
be
enough
for
one


time
;
he
must
shove
right
over
to
town
and
sell
.
so
he
lock
I
in
and


take
the
skiff
,
and
start
off
tow
the
raft
about
half
-
past
three
.


I
judge
he
would
n't
come
back
that
night
.
I
wait
till
I
reckon
he


have
get
a
good
start
;
then
I
out
with
my
saw
,
and
go
to
work
on
that


log
again
.
before
he
be
t'other
side
of
the
river
I
be
out
of
the


hole
;
he
and
his
raft
be
just
a
speck
on
the
water
away
off
yonder
.




I
take
the
sack
of
corn
meal
and
take
it
to
where
the
canoe
be
hide
,
and


shove
the
vine
and
branch
apart
and
put
it
in
;
then
I
do
the
same


with
the
side
of
bacon
;
then
the
whisky
-
jug
.
I
take
all
the
coffee
and


sugar
there
be
,
and
all
the
ammunition
;
I
take
the
wadding
;
I
take
the


bucket
and
gourd
;
I
take
a
dipper
and
a
tin
cup
,
and
my
old
saw
and
two


blanket
,
and
the
skillet
and
the
coffee
-
pot
.
I
take
fish
-
line
and


match
and
other
thing
--
everything
that
be
worth
a
cent
.
I
clean


out
the
place
.
I
want
an
axe
,
but
there
be
n't
any
,
only
the
one
out


at
the
woodpile
,
and
I
know
why
I
be
go
to
leave
that
.
I
fetch


out
the
gun
,
and
now
I
be
do
.




I
have
wear
the
ground
a
good
deal
crawl
out
of
the
hole
and
drag


out
so
many
thing
.
so
I
fix
that
as
good
as
I
could
from
the
outside


by
scatter
dust
on
the
place
,
which
cover
up
the
smoothness
and
the


sawdust
.
then
I
fix
the
piece
of
log
back
into
its
place
,
and
put
two


rock
under
it
and
one
against
it
to
hold
it
there
,
for
it
be
bent
up


at
that
place
and
do
n't
quite
touch
ground
.
if
you
stand
four
or
five


foot
away
and
do
n't
know
it
be
saw
,
you
would
n't
never
notice


it
;
and
besides
,
this
be
the
back
of
the
cabin
,
and
it
warn't
likely


anybody
would
go
fool
around
there
.




it
be
all
grass
clear
to
the
canoe
,
so
I
have
n't
leave
a
track
.
I


follow
around
to
see
.
I
stand
on
the
bank
and
look
out
over
the


river
.
all
safe
.
so
I
take
the
gun
and
go
up
a
piece
into
the
wood
,


and
be
hunt
around
for
some
bird
when
I
see
a
wild
pig
;
hog
soon


go
wild
in
they
bottom
after
they
have
get
away
from
the
prairie


farm
.
I
shoot
this
fellow
and
take
he
into
camp
.




I
take
the
axe
and
smash
in
the
door
.
I
beat
it
and
hack
it


considerable
a
-
do
it
.
I
fetch
the
pig
in
,
and
take
he
back
nearly


to
the
table
and
hack
into
his
throat
with
the
axe
,
and
lay
he
down


on
the
ground
to
bleed
;
I
say
ground
because
it
be
ground
--
hard
pack
,


and
no
board
.
well
,
next
I
take
an
old
sack
and
put
a
lot
of
big
rock


in
it
--
all
I
could
drag
--
and
I
start
it
from
the
pig
,
and
drag
it
to


the
door
and
through
the
wood
down
to
the
river
and
dump
it
in
,
and


down
it
sink
,
out
of
sight
.
you
could
easy
see
that
something
have
be


drag
over
the
ground
.
I
do
wish
Tom
Sawyer
be
there
;
I
know
he


would
take
an
interest
in
this
kind
of
business
,
and
throw
in
the
fancy


touch
.
nobody
could
spread
himself
like
Tom
Sawyer
in
such
a
thing
as


that
.




well
,
last
I
pull
out
some
of
my
hair
,
and
blood
the
axe
good
,
and


stick
it
on
the
back
side
,
and
sling
the
axe
in
the
corner
.
then
I


take
up
the
pig
and
hold
he
to
my
breast
with
my
jacket
(
so
he
could
n't


drip
)
till
I
get
a
good
piece
below
the
house
and
then
dump
he
into


the
river
.
now
I
think
of
something
else
.
so
I
go
and
get
the
bag


of
meal
and
my
old
see
out
of
the
canoe
,
and
fetch
they
to
the
house
.


I
take
the
bag
to
where
it
use
to
stand
,
and
rip
a
hole
in
the


bottom
of
it
with
the
saw
,
for
there
warn't
no
knife
and
fork
on
the


place
--
pap
do
everything
with
his
clasp
-
knife
about
the
cooking
.
then


I
carry
the
sack
about
a
hundred
yard
across
the
grass
and
through


the
willow
east
of
the
house
,
to
a
shallow
lake
that
be
five
mile
wide


and
full
of
rush
--
and
duck
too
,
you
might
say
,
in
the
season
.
there


be
a
slough
or
a
creek
lead
out
of
it
on
the
other
side
that
go


mile
away
,
I
do
n't
know
where
,
but
it
do
n't
go
to
the
river
.
the
meal


sift
out
and
make
a
little
track
all
the
way
to
the
lake
.
I
drop


pap
's
whetstone
there
too
,
so
as
to
look
like
it
have
be
do
by


accident
.
then
I
tie
up
the
rip
in
the
meal
sack
with
a
string
,
so
it


would
n't
leak
no
more
,
and
take
it
and
my
see
to
the
canoe
again
.




it
be
about
dark
now
;
so
I
drop
the
canoe
down
the
river
under
some


willow
that
hang
over
the
bank
,
and
wait
for
the
moon
to
rise
.
I


make
fast
to
a
willow
;
then
I
take
a
bite
to
eat
,
and
by
and
by
lay


down
in
the
canoe
to
smoke
a
pipe
and
lie
out
a
plan
.
I
say
to
myself
,


they
'll
follow
the
track
of
that
sackful
of
rock
to
the
shore
and
then


drag
the
river
for
I
.
and
they
'll
follow
that
meal
track
to
the
lake


and
go
browse
down
the
creek
that
lead
out
of
it
to
find
the
robber


that
kill
I
and
take
the
thing
.
they
wo
n't
ever
hunt
the
river
for


anything
but
my
dead
carcass
.
they
'll
soon
get
tired
of
that
,
and
wo
n't


bother
no
more
about
I
.
all
right
;
I
can
stop
anywhere
I
want
to
.


Jackson
's
Island
be
good
enough
for
I
;
I
know
that
island
pretty
well
,


and
nobody
ever
come
there
.
and
then
I
can
paddle
over
to
town
night
,


and
slink
around
and
pick
up
thing
I
want
.
Jackson
's
Island
's
the


place
.




I
be
pretty
tired
,
and
the
first
thing
I
know
I
be
asleep
.
when


I
wake
up
I
do
n't
know
where
I
be
for
a
minute
.
I
set
up
and
look


around
,
a
little
scared
.
then
I
remember
.
the
river
look
mile
and


mile
across
.
the
moon
be
so
bright
I
could
a
count
the
drift
log


that
go
a
-
slip
along
,
black
and
still
,
hundred
of
yard
out
from


shore
.
everything
be
dead
quiet
,
and
it
look
late
,
and
_
smell
_
late
.


you
know
what
I
mean
--
I
do
n't
know
the
word
to
put
it
in
.




I
take
a
good
gap
and
a
stretch
,
and
be
just
go
to
unhitch
and
start


when
I
hear
a
sound
away
over
the
water
.
I
listen
.
pretty
soon
I


make
it
out
.
it
be
that
dull
kind
of
a
regular
sound
that
come
from


oar
work
in
rowlock
when
it
be
a
still
night
.
I
peep
out
through


the
willow
branch
,
and
there
it
be
--
a
skiff
,
away
across
the
water
.


I
could
n't
tell
how
many
be
in
it
.
it
keep
a
-
come
,
and
when
it
be


abreast
of
I
I
see
there
warn't
but
one
man
in
it
.
think
be
I
,
maybe


it
be
pap
,
though
I
warn't
expect
he
.
he
drop
below
I
with
the


current
,
and
by
and
by
he
come
a
-
swinge
up
shore
in
the
easy
water
,


and
he
go
by
so
close
I
could
a
reach
out
the
gun
and
touch
he
.


well
,
it
_
be
_
pap
,
sure
enough
--
and
sober
,
too
,
by
the
way
he
lay
his


oar
.




I
do
n't
lose
no
time
.
the
next
minute
I
be
a
-
spinning
down
stream


soft
but
quick
in
the
shade
of
the
bank
.
I
make
two
mile
and
a
half
,


and
then
strike
out
a
quarter
of
a
mile
or
more
towards
the
middle
of


the
river
,
because
pretty
soon
I
would
be
pass
the
ferry
landing
,
and


people
might
see
I
and
hail
I
.
I
get
out
amongst
the
driftwood
,
and


then
lay
down
in
the
bottom
of
the
canoe
and
let
she
float
.




I
lay
there
,
and
have
a
good
rest
and
a
smoke
out
of
my
pipe
,
look


away
into
the
sky
;
not
a
cloud
in
it
.
the
sky
look
ever
so
deep
when


you
lie
down
on
your
back
in
the
moonshine
;
I
never
know
it
before
.


and
how
far
a
body
can
hear
on
the
water
such
night
!
I
hear
people


talk
at
the
ferry
landing
.
I
hear
what
they
say
,
too
--
every
word


of
it
.
one
man
say
it
be
get
towards
the
long
day
and
the
short


night
now
.
t'other
one
say
_
this
_
warn't
one
of
the
short
one
,
he


reckon
--
and
then
they
laugh
,
and
he
say
it
over
again
,
and
they


laugh
again
;
then
they
wake
up
another
fellow
and
tell
he
,
and


laugh
,
but
he
do
n't
laugh
;
he
rip
out
something
brisk
,
and
say


let
he
alone
.
the
first
fellow
say
he
'
low
to
tell
it
to
his


old
woman
--
she
would
think
it
be
pretty
good
;
but
he
say
that
warn't


nothing
to
some
thing
he
have
say
in
his
time
.
I
hear
one
man
say
it


be
nearly
three
o'clock
,
and
he
hope
daylight
would
n't
wait
more
than


about
a
week
long
.
after
that
the
talk
get
far
and
far
away
,


and
I
could
n't
make
out
the
word
any
more
;
but
I
could
hear
the
mumble
,


and
now
and
then
a
laugh
,
too
,
but
it
seem
a
long
way
off
.




I
be
away
below
the
ferry
now
.
I
rise
up
,
and
there
be
Jackson
's


Island
,
about
two
mile
and
a
half
down
stream
,
heavy
timbered
and


stand
up
out
of
the
middle
of
the
river
,
big
and
dark
and
solid
,
like


a
steamboat
without
any
light
.
there
warn't
any
sign
of
the
bar
at


the
head
--
it
be
all
under
water
now
.




it
do
n't
take
I
long
to
get
there
.
I
shoot
past
the
head
at
a
ripping


rate
,
the
current
be
so
swift
,
and
then
I
get
into
the
dead
water
and


land
on
the
side
towards
the
Illinois
shore
.
I
run
the
canoe
into


a
deep
dent
in
the
bank
that
I
know
about
;
I
have
to
part
the
willow


branch
to
get
in
;
and
when
I
make
fast
nobody
could
a
see
the
canoe


from
the
outside
.




I
go
up
and
set
down
on
a
log
at
the
head
of
the
island
,
and
look


out
on
the
big
river
and
the
black
driftwood
and
away
over
to
the
town
,


three
mile
away
,
where
there
be
three
or
four
light
twinkle
.
a


monstrous
big
lumber
-
raft
be
about
a
mile
up
stream
,
come
along
down
,


with
a
lantern
in
the
middle
of
it
.
I
watch
it
come
creep
down
,


and
when
it
be
most
abreast
of
where
I
stand
I
hear
a
man
say
,
"
Stern


oar
,
there
!
heave
her
head
to
stabboard
!
"
I
hear
that
just
as
plain


as
if
the
man
be
by
my
side
.




there
be
a
little
gray
in
the
sky
now
;
so
I
step
into
the
wood
,
and


lay
down
for
a
nap
before
breakfast
.










chapter
VIII
.






the
sun
be
up
so
high
when
I
wake
that
I
judge
it
be
after
eight


o'clock
.
I
lay
there
in
the
grass
and
the
cool
shade
thinking
about


thing
,
and
feeling
rest
and
ruther
comfortable
and
satisfied
.
I


could
see
the
sun
out
at
one
or
two
hole
,
but
mostly
it
be
big
tree


all
about
,
and
gloomy
in
there
amongst
they
.
there
be
freckle
place


on
the
ground
where
the
light
sift
down
through
the
leave
,
and
the


freckle
place
swap
about
a
little
,
show
there
be
a
little


breeze
up
there
.
a
couple
of
squirrel
set
on
a
limb
and
jabber
at
I


very
friendly
.




I
be
powerful
lazy
and
comfortable
--
didn't
want
to
get
up
and
cook


breakfast
.
well
,
I
be
doze
off
again
when
I
think
I
hear
a
deep


sound
of
"
boom

"
away
up
the
river
.
I
rouse
up
,
and
rest
on
my
elbow


and
listen
;
pretty
soon
I
hear
it
again
.
I
hop
up
,
and
go
and


look
out
at
a
hole
in
the
leave
,
and
I
see
a
bunch
of
smoke
lay


on
the
water
a
long
way
up
--
about
abreast
the
ferry
.
and
there
be
the


ferryboat
full
of

know
what
be
the


matter
now

I
see
the

,
try
to
make
my


carcass
come
to
the
top
.




I
be
pretty
hungry
,
but
it
warn't
go
to
do
for
I
to
start
a
fire
,


because
they
might
see
the
smoke
.
so
I
set
there
and
watch
the


cannon
-
smoke
and
listen
to
the
boom
.
the
river
be
a
mile
wide
there
,


and
it
always
look
pretty
on
a
summer
morning
--
so
I
be
have
a
good


enough
time
see
they
hunt
for
my
remainder
if
I
only
have
a
bite
to


eat
.
well
,
then
I
happen
to
think
how
they
always
put
quicksilver
in


loaf
of
bread
and
float
they
off
,
because
they
always
go
right
to
the


drownde
carcass
and
stop
there
.
so
,
say
I
,
I
'll
keep
a
lookout
,
and


if
any
of
they
be
float
around
after
I
I
'll
give
they
a
show
.
I


change
to
the
Illinois
edge
of
the
island
to
see
what
luck
I
could


have
,
and
I
warn't
disappoint
.
a
big
double
loaf
come
along
,
and
I


most
get
it
with
a
long
stick
,
but
my
foot
slip
and
she
float
out


far
.
of
course
I
be
where
the
current
set
in
the
close
to
the


shore
--
I
know
enough
for
that
.
but
by
and
by
along
come
another
one
,


and
this
time
I
win
.
I
take
out
the
plug
and
shake
out
the
little
dab


of
quicksilver
,
and
set
my
tooth
in
.
it
be
"
baker
's
bread”--what
the


quality
eat
;
none
of
your
low
-
down
corn
-
pone
.




I
get
a
good
place
amongst
the
leave
,
and
set
there
on
a
log
,
munching


the
bread
and
watch
the
ferry
-
boat
,
and
very
well
satisfied
.
and


then
something
strike
I
.
I
say
,
now
I
reckon
the
widow
or
the
parson


or
somebody
pray
that
this
bread
would
find
I
,
and
here
it
have
go


and
do
it
.
so
there
ai
n't
no
doubt
but
there
be
something
in
that


thing
--
that
is
,
there
be
something
in
it
when
a
body
like
the
widow
or
the


parson
pray
,
but
it
do
n't
work
for
I
,
and
I
reckon
it
do
n't
work
for


only
just
the
right
kind
.




I
light
a
pipe
and
have
a
good
long
smoke
,
and
go
on
watch
.
the


ferryboat
be
float
with
the
current
,
and
I
allow
I
'd
have
a
chance


to
see
who
be
aboard
when
she
come
along
,
because
she
would
come
in


close
,
where
the
bread
do
.
when
she
'd
get
pretty
well
along
down


towards
I
,
I
put
out
my
pipe
and
go
to
where
I
fish
out
the
bread
,


and
lay
down
behind
a
log
on
the
bank
in
a
little
open
place
.
where


the
log
fork
I
could
peep
through
.




by
and
by
she
come
along
,
and
she
drift
in
so
close
that
they
could


a
run
out
a
plank
and
walk
ashore
.
Most
everybody
be
on
the
boat
.


pap
,
and
Judge
Thatcher
,
and
Bessie
Thatcher
,
and
Jo
Harper
,
and
Tom


sawyer
,
and
his
old
Aunt
Polly
,
and
Sid
and
Mary
,
and
plenty
more
.


everybody
be
talk
about
the
murder
,
but
the
captain
break
in
and


say
:




"
look
sharp
,
now
;
the
current
set
in
the
close
here
,
and
maybe
he
be


wash
ashore
and
got
tangle
amongst
the
brush
at
the
water
's
edge
.
I


hope
so
,
anyway
.
"




I
do
n't
hope
so
.
they
all
crowd
up
and
lean
over
the
rail
,
nearly


in
my
face
,
and
keep
still
,
watch
with
all
their
might
.
I
could
see


they
first
-
rate
,
but
they
could
n't
see
I
.
then
the
captain
sing
out
:




"
stand
away
!
"
and
the
cannon
let
off
such
a
blast
right
before
I
that


it
make
I
deef
with
the
noise
and
pretty
near
blind
with
the
smoke
,
and


I
judge
I
be
go
.
if
they
'd
a
have
some
bullet
in
,
I
reckon
they
'd


a
get
the
corpse
they
be
after
.
well
,
I
see
I
warn't
hurt
,
thank
to


goodness
.
the
boat
float
on
and
go
out
of
sight
around
the
shoulder


of
the
island
.
I
could
hear
the
booming
now
and
then
,
far
and


far
off
,
and
by
and
by
,
after
an
hour
,
I
do
n't
hear
it
no
more
.


the
island
be
three
mile
long
.
I
judge
they
have
get
to
the
foot
,
and


be
give
it
up
.
but
they
do
n't
yet
a
while
.
they
turn
around


the
foot
of
the
island
and
start
up
the
channel
on
the
Missouri
side
,


under
steam
,
and
boom
once
in
a
while
as
they
go
.
I
cross
over


to
that
side
and
watch
they
.
when
they
get
abreast
the
head
of
the


island
they
quit
shooting
and
drop
over
to
the
Missouri
shore
and


go
home
to
the
town
.




I
know
I
be
all
right
now
.
nobody
else
would
come
a
-
hunting
after


I
.
I
get
my
trap
out
of
the
canoe
and
make
I
a
nice
camp
in
the
thick


wood
.
I
make
a
kind
of
a
tent
out
of
my
blanket
to
put
my
thing


under
so
the
rain
could
n't
get
at
they
.
I
catch
a
catfish
and
haggle


he
open
with
my
saw
,
and
towards
sundown
I
start
my
camp
fire
and
have


supper
.
then
I
set
out
a
line
to
catch
some
fish
for
breakfast
.




when
it
be
dark
I
set
by
my
camp
fire
smoking
,
and
feel
pretty
well


satisfied
;
but
by
and
by
it
get
sort
of
lonesome
,
and
so
I
go
and
set


on
the
bank
and
listen
to
the
current
swashing
along
,
and
count
the


star
and
drift
log
and
raft
that
come
down
,
and
then
go
to
bed
;


there
ai
n't
no
well
way
to
put
in
time
when
you
be
lonesome
;
you


ca
n't
stay
so
,
you
soon
get
over
it
.




and
so
for
three
day
and
night
.
no
difference
--
just
the
same
thing
.


but
the
next
day
I
go
explore
around
down
through
the
island
.
I
be


boss
of
it
;
it
all
belong
to
I
,
so
to
say
,
and
I
want
to
know


all
about
it
;
but
mainly
I
want
to
put
in
the
time
.
I
find
plenty


strawberry
,
ripe
and
prime
;
and
green
summer
grape
,
and
green


razberrie
;
and
the
green
blackberry
be
just
begin
to
show
.
they


would
all
come
handy
by
and
by
,
I
judge
.




well
,
I
go
fool
along
in
the
deep
wood
till
I
judge
I
warn't


far
from
the
foot
of
the
island
.
I
have
my
gun
along
,
but
I
have
n't
shoot


nothing
;
it
be
for
protection
;
think
I
would
kill
some
game
nigh


home
.
about
this
time
I
mighty
near
step
on
a
good
-
sized
snake
,


and
it
go
slide
off
through
the
grass
and
flower
,
and
I
after


it
,
try
to
get
a
shot
at
it
.
I
clip
along
,
and
all
of
a
sudden
I


bound
right
on
to
the
ashe
of
a
camp
fire
that
be
still
smoke
.




my
heart
jump
up
amongst
my
lung
.
I
never
wait
for
to
look


far
,
but
uncocke
my
gun
and
go
sneak
back
on
my
tiptoe
as


fast
as
ever
I
could
.
every
now
and
then
I
stop
a
second
amongst
the


thick
leave
and
listen
,
but
my
breath
come
so
hard
I
could
n't
hear


nothing
else
.
I
slunk
along
another
piece
far
,
then
listen
again
;


and
so
on
,
and
so
on
.
if
I
see
a
stump
,
I
take
it
for
a
man
;
if
I
trod


on
a
stick
and
break
it
,
it
make
I
feel
like
a
person
have
cut
one
of
my


breath
in
two
and
I
only
get
half
,
and
the
short
half
,
too
.




when
I
get
to
camp
I
warn't
feel
very
brash
,
there
warn't
much
sand


in
my
craw
;
but
I
say
,
this
ai
n't
no
time
to
be
fool
around
.
so
I


get
all
my
trap
into
my
canoe
again
so
as
to
have
they
out
of
sight
,


and
I
put
out
the
fire
and
scatter
the
ashe
around
to
look
like
an


old
last
year
's
camp
,
and
then
clumb
a
tree
.




I
reckon
I
be
up
in
the
tree
two
hour
;
but
I
do
n't
see
nothing
,


I
do
n't
hear
nothing
--
I
only
_
think
_
I
hear
and
see
as
much
as
a


thousand
thing
.
well
,
I
could
n't
stay
up
there
forever
;
so
at
last
i


get
down
,
but
I
keep
in
the
thick
wood
and
on
the
lookout
all
the


time
.
all
I
could
get
to
eat
be
berry
and
what
be
leave
over
from


breakfast
.




by
the
time
it
be
night
I
be
pretty
hungry
.
so
when
it
be
good


and
dark
I
slide
out
from
shore
before
moonrise
and
paddle
over
to
the


Illinois
bank
--
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
.
I
go
out
in
the
wood
and


cook
a
supper
,
and
I
have
about
make
up
my
mind
I
would
stay
there


all
night
when
I
hear
a
_
plunkety
-
plunk
,
plunkety
-
plunk
_
,
and
say


to
myself
,
horse
come
;
and
next
I
hear
people
's
voice
.
I
get


everything
into
the
canoe
as
quick
as
I
could
,
and
then
go
creep


through
the
wood
to
see
what
I
could
find
out
.
I
have
n't
get
far
when
I


hear
a
man
say
:




"
we
well
camp
here
if
we
can
find
a
good
place
;
the
horse
be
about


beat
out
.
let
's
look
around
.
"




I
do
n't
wait
,
but
shove
out
and
paddle
away
easy
.
I
tie
up
in
the


old
place
,
and
reckon
I
would
sleep
in
the
canoe
.




I
do
n't
sleep
much
.
I
could
n't
,
somehow
,
for
thinking
.
and
every
time


I
wake
up
I
think
somebody
have
I
by
the
neck
.
so
the
sleep
do
n't


do
I
no
good
.
by
and
by
I
say
to
myself
,
I
ca
n't
live
this
way
;
I
be


a
-
going
to
find
out
who
it
be
that
be
here
on
the
island
with
I
;
I
'll


find
it
out
or
bust
.
well
,
I
feel
well
right
off
.




so
I
take
my
paddle
and
slide
out
from
shore
just
a
step
or
two
,
and


then
let
the
canoe
drop
along
down
amongst
the
shadow
.
the
moon
be


shine
,
and
outside
of
the
shadow
it
make
it
most
as
light
as
day
.


I
poke
along
well
on
to
an
hour
,
everything
still
as
rock
and
sound


asleep
.
well
,
by
this
time
I
be
most
down
to
the
foot
of
the
island
.
a


little
ripply
,
cool
breeze
begin
to
blow
,
and
that
be
as
good
as
say


the
night
be
about
do
.
I
give
she
a
turn
with
the
paddle
and
brung


her
nose
to
shore
;
then
I
get
my
gun
and
slip
out
and
into
the
edge


of
the
wood
.
I
sit
down
there
on
a
log
,
and
look
out
through
the


leave
.
I
see
the
moon
go
off
watch
,
and
the
darkness
begin
to
blanket


the
river
.
but
in
a
little
while
I
see
a
pale
streak
over
the
treetop
,


and
know
the
day
be
come
.
so
I
take
my
gun
and
slip
off
towards


where
I
have
run
across
that
camp
fire
,
stop
every
minute
or
two


to
listen
.
but
I
have
n't
no
luck
somehow
;
I
could
n't
seem
to
find
the


place
.
but
by
and
by
,
sure
enough
,
I
catch
a
glimpse
of
fire
away


through
the
tree
.
I
go
for
it
,
cautious
and
slow
.
by
and
by
I
be


close
enough
to
have
a
look
,
and
there
lay
a
man
on
the
ground
.
it


most
give
I
the
fan
-
tod
.
he
have
a
blanket
around
his
head
,
and
his


head
be
nearly
in
the
fire
.
I
set
there
behind
a
clump
of
bush
,
in


about
six
foot
of
he
,
and
keep
my
eye
on
he
steady
.
it
be
get


gray
daylight
now
.
pretty
soon
he
gap
and
stretch
himself
and
hove


off
the
blanket
,
and
it
be

and
skip

bounce
up
and
stare
at
I
wild
.
then
he
drop
down
on
his
knee
,

put

together

I

look
at
a
place
right
about
the
middle
of
the
island


that
I
have
find
when
I
be
explore
;
so
we
start
and
soon
get
to
it
,


because
the
island
be
only
three
mile
long
and
a
quarter
of
a
mile


wide
.




this
place
be
a
tolerable
long

steep
hill
or
ridge
about
forty
foot


high

we
have
a
rough
time
get
to
the
top
,
the
side
be
so
steep
and


the
bush
so
thick
.
we
tramp
and
clumb
around
all
over
it
,
and
by


and
by
find
a
good
big
cavern
in
the
rock
,
most
up
to
the
top
on
the


side
towards
Illinois
.
the
cavern
be
as
big
as
two
or
three
room


bunch
together
,
and
Jim
could
stand
up
straight
in
it
.
it
be
cool
in


there
.
Jim
be
for
put
our
trap
in
there
right
away
,
but
I
say
we


do
n't
want
to
be
climb
up
and
down
there
all
the
time
.




Jim
say
if
we
have
the
canoe
hide
in
a
good
place
,
and
have
all
the
trap


in
the
cavern
,
we
could
rush
there
if
anybody
be
to
come
to
the
island
,


and
they
would
never
find
we
without
dog
.

,
besides
,
he
say
they


little
bird
have
say
it
be
go
to
rain
,
and
do
I
want
the
thing
to


get
wet
?




so
we
go
back
and
get
the
canoe
,
and
paddle
up
abreast
the
cavern
,


and
lug
all
the
trap
up
there
.
then
we
hunt
up
a
place
close
by


to
hide
the
canoe
in
,
amongst
the
thick
willow
.
we
take
some
fish
off


of
the
line
and
set
they
again
,
and
begin
to
get
ready
for
dinner
.




the
door
of
the
cavern
be
big
enough
to
roll
a
hogshead
in
,

on
one


side
of
the
door
the
floor
stick
out
a
little
bit
,

be
flat
and
a


good
place
to
build
a
fire
on
.
so
we
build
it
there
and
cook
dinner
.




we
spread
the
blanket
inside
for
a
carpet
,

eat
our
dinner
in
there
.


we
put
all
the
other
thing
handy
at
the
back
of
the
cavern
.
pretty


soon
it
darken
up
,
and
begin
to
thunder
and
lighten
;
so
the
bird
be


right
about
it
.
directly
it
begin
to
rain
,
and
it
rain
like
all
fury
,


too
,
and
I
never
see
the
wind
blow
so
.
it
be
one
of
these
regular


summer
storm
.
it
would
get
so
dark
that
it
look
all
blue
-
black


outside
,
and
lovely
;
and
the
rain
would
thrash
along
by
so
thick
that


the
tree
off
a
little
way
look
dim
and
spider
-
webby
;
and
here
would


come
a
blast
of
wind
that
would
bend
the
tree
down
and
turn
up
the


pale
underside
of
the
leave
;
and
then
a
perfect
ripper
of
a
gust
would


follow
along
and
set
the
branch
to
toss
their
arm
as
if
they


be
just
wild
;
and
next
,
when
it
be
just
about
the
blue
and


blackest--_fst
_
!
it
be
as
bright
as
glory
,
and
you
'd
have
a
little


glimpse
of
tree
-
top
a
-
plunge
about
away
off
yonder
in
the
storm
,


hundred
of
yard
far
than
you
could
see
before
;
dark
as
sin
again


in
a
second
,
and
now
you
'd
hear
the
thunder
let
go
with
an
awful
crash
,


and
then
go
rumble
,
grumble
,
tumbling
,
down
the
sky
towards
the


under
side
of
the
world
,
like
roll
empty
barrel
down
stair
--
where


it
be
long
stair
and

the

go

and
raise
for
ten
or
twelve
day
,
till
at


last
it
be
over
the
bank
.
the
water
be
three
or
four
foot
deep
on


the
island
in
the
low
place
and
on
the
Illinois
bottom
.
on
that
side


it
be
a
good
many
mile
wide
,
but
on
the
Missouri
side
it
be
the
same


old
distance
across
--
a
half
a
mile
--
because
the
Missouri
shore
be
just
a


wall
of
high
bluff
.




Daytimes
we
paddle
all
over
the
island
in
the
canoe
,
it
be
mighty
cool


and
shady
in
the
deep
wood
,
even
if
the
sun
be
blaze
outside
.
we


go
wind
in
and
out
amongst
the
tree
,
and
sometimes
the
vine
hang


so
thick
we
have
to
back
away
and
go
some
other
way
.
well
,
on
every
old


break
-
down
tree
you
could
see
rabbit
and
snake
and
such
thing
;
and


when
the
island
have
be
overflow
a
day
or
two
they
get
so
tame
,
on


account
of
be
hungry
,
that
you
could
paddle
right
up
and
put
your


hand
on
they
if
you
want
to
;
but
not
the
snake
and
turtle
--
they
would


slide
off
in
the
water
.
the
ridge
our
cavern
be
in
be
full
of
they
.


we
could
a
have
pet
enough
if
we
'd
want
they
.




one
night
we
catch
a
little
section
of
a
lumber
raft
--
nice
pine
plank
.


it
be
twelve
foot
wide
and
about
fifteen
or
sixteen
foot
long
,
and


the
top
stand
above
water
six
or
seven
inch
--
a
solid
,
level
floor
.
we


could
see
see
-
log
go
by
in
the
daylight
sometimes
,
but
we
let
they
go
;


we
do
n't
show
ourselves
in
daylight
.




another
night
when
we
be
up
at
the
head
of
the
island
,
just
before


daylight
,
here
come
a
frame
-
house
down
,
on
the
west
side
.
she
be


a
two
-
story
,
and
tilt
over
considerable
.
we
paddle
out
and
get


aboard
--
clumb
in
at
an
upstairs
window
.
but
it
be
too
dark
to
see
yet
,


so
we
make
the
canoe
fast
and
set
in
she
to
wait
for
daylight
.




the
light
begin
to
come
before
we
get
to
the
foot
of
the
island
.
then


we
look
in
at
the
window
.
we
could
make
out
a
bed
,
and
a
table
,
and


two
old
chair
,
and
lot

on
the


floor
in
the
far
corner
that
look
like
a

.
so
Jim
say
:




"
hello
,
you
!
"




but
it
do
n't
budge
.
so
I
holler
again
,
and
then
Jim
say
:




"

.
Jim
throw
some
old
rag
over
he
,
but


he
need
n't
do

;
I
do

hurry
,
and
warn't
fix
so
as
to
carry
off

monstrous
hook
on
it
,
and
a
roll
of
buckskin
,
and

leather
dog

collar
,

do
n't
have
no
label

and
just
as
we
be
leave
I
find
a
tolerable
good
curry
-
comb
,


and
Jim
he
find
a
ratty
old
fiddle
-
bow
,
and
a
wooden
leg
.
the
strap


be
break
off
of
it
,
but
,
bar
that
,
it
be
a
good
enough
leg
,
though


it
be
too
long
for
I
and
not
long
enough
for
Jim
,
and
we
could
n't
find


the
other
one
,
though
we
hunt
all
around
.




and
so
,
take
it
all
around
,
we
make
a
good
haul
.
when
we
be
ready
to


shove
off
we
be
a
quarter
of
a
mile
below
the
island
,
and
it
be
pretty


broad
day
;
so
I
make
Jim
lie
down
in
the
canoe
and
cover
up
with
the


quilt
,
because
if
he
set
up
people
could
tell
he
be
a
nigger
a
good


way
off
.
I
paddle
over
to
the
Illinois
shore
,
and
drift
down
most


a
half
a
mile
do
it
.
I
creep
up
the
dead
water
under
the
bank
,
and


have
n't
no
accident
and
do
n't
see
nobody
.
we
get
home
all
safe
.










chapter
x.






after
breakfast
I
want
to
talk
about
the
dead
man
and
guess
out
how
he


come
to
be
kill
,
but
Jim
do
n't
want
to
.
he
say
it
would
fetch
bad


luck
;
and
besides
,
he
say
,
he
might
come
and
ha'nt
we
;
he
say
a
man


that
warn't
bury
be
more
likely
to
go
a
-
ha'nting
around
than
one


that
be
plant
and
comfortable
.
that
sound
pretty
reasonable
,
so


I
do
n't
say
no
more
;
but
I
could
n't
keep
from
study
over
it
and


wish
I
know
who
shoot
the
man
,
and
what
they
do
it
for
.




we
rummage
the
clothe
we
'd
got
,
and
find
eight
dollar
in
silver


sew
up
in
the
lining
of
an
old
blanket
overcoat
.
Jim
say
he
reckon


the
people
in
that
house
steal
the
coat
,
because
if
they
'd
a
know
the


money
be
there
they
would
n't
a
left
it
.
I
say
I
reckon
they
kill


he
,
too
;
but
Jim
do
n't
want
to
talk
about
that
.
I
say
:




"
now
you
think
it
be
bad
luck
;
but
what
do
you
say

snake

of
the
ridge

before
yesterday
?


you
say
it
be
the
bad
bad
luck
in
the
world
to
touch
a
snake
-
skin


with
my
hand
.
well
,
here

dollar
besides

grass
at
the
upper
end
of

ridge
,
and
get
out
of
tobacco
.
I
go
to
the
cavern
to
get
some
,
and


find
a
rattlesnake
in
there
.
I
kill
he

up

there
'd
be
some
fun


when
Jim
find
he
there
.
well
,
by
night
I
forget
all
about
the
snake
,


and
when
Jim
fling
himself
down
on
the
blanket
while
I
strike
a
light


the
snake
's
mate
be
there
,
and
bite
he
.




he
jump
up
yell
,
and
the
first
thing
the
light
show
be
the


varmint
curl
up
and
ready
for
another
spring
.
I
lay
he
out
in
a


second
with
a
stick
,
and
Jim
grab
pap
's
whisky
-
jug
and
begin
to
pour


it
down
.




he
be
barefoote
,
and
the
snake
bite
he
right
on
the
heel
.
that
all


come
of
my
be
such
a
fool
as
to
not
remember
that
wherever
you
leave


a
dead
snake
its
mate
always
come
there
and
curl
around
it
.
Jim
tell


I
to
chop
off
the
snake
's
head
and
throw
it
away
,
and
then
skin
the


body
and
roast
a
piece
of
it
.
I
do
it
,
and
he
eat
it
and
say
it


would
help
cure
he
.
he
make
I
take
off
the
rattle
and
tie
they
around


his
wrist
,
too
.
he
say
that
that
would
help
.
then
I
slide
out
quiet


and
throw
the
snake
clear
away
amongst
the
bush
;
for
I
warn't
go


to
let
Jim
find
out
it
be
all
my
fault
,
not
if
I
could
help
it
.




Jim
suck
and
suck
at
the
jug
,
and
now
and
then
he
get
out
of
his


head
and
pitch
around
and
yell
;
but
every
time
he
come
to
himself
he


go
to
suck
at
the
jug
again
.
his
foot
swell
up
pretty
big
,
and


so
do
his
leg
;
but
by
and
by
the
drunk
begin
to
come
,
and
so
I
judge


he
be
all
right
;
but
I
'd
druther
be
bite
with
a
snake
than
pap
's


whisky
.




Jim
be
lay
up
for
four
day
and
night
.
then
the
swelling
be
all


go
and
he
be
around
again
.
I
make
up
my
mind
I
would
n't
ever
take


a
-
holt
of
a
snake
-
skin
again
with
my
hand
,
now
that
I
see
what
have
come


of
it
.
Jim
say
he
reckon
I
would
believe
he
next
time
.
and
he
say


that
handle
a
snake
-
skin
be
such
awful
bad
luck
that
maybe
we
have
n't


get
to
the
end
of
it
yet
.
he
say
he
druther
see
the
new
moon
over
his


leave
shoulder
as
much
as
a
thousand
time
than
take
up
a
snake
-
skin


in
his
hand
.
well
,
I
be
get
to
feel
that
way
myself
,
though
I
've


always
reckon
that
look
at
the
new
moon
over
your
left
shoulder
be


one
of
the
careless
and
foolish
thing
a
body
can
do
.
Old
Hank


Bunker
do
it
once
,
and
brag
about
it
;
and
in
less
than
two
year
he


get
drunk
and
fall
off
of
the
shot
-
tower
,
and
spread
himself
out
so


that
he
be
just
a
kind
of
a
layer
,
as
you
may
say
;
and
they
slide
he


edgeway
between
two
barn
door
for
a
coffin
,
and
bury
he
so
,
so


they
say
,
but
I
do
n't
see
it
.
pap
tell
I
.
but
anyway
it
all
come
of


look
at
the
moon
that
way
,
like
a
fool
.




well
,
the
day
go
along
,
and
the
river
go
down
between
its
bank


again
;
and
about
the
first
thing
we
do
be
to
bait
one
of
the
big


hook
with
a
skinned
rabbit
and
set
it
and
catch
a
catfish
that
be


as
big
as
a
man
,
be
six
foot
two
inch
long
,
and
weigh
over
two


hundred
pound
.
we
could
n't
handle
he
,
of
course
;
he
would
a
flung
we


into
Illinois
.
we
just
set
there
and
watch
he
rip
and
tear
around


till
he
drownde
.
we
find
a
brass
button
in
his
stomach
and
a
round


ball
,
and
lot
of
rubbage
.
we
split
the
ball
open
with
the
hatchet
,


and
there
be
a
spool
in
it
.
Jim
say
he
have
have
it
there
a
long
time
,
to


coat
it
over
so
and
make
a
ball
of
it
.
it
be
as
big
a
fish
as
be
ever


catch
in
the
Mississippi
,
I
reckon
.
Jim
say
he
have
n't
ever
see


a
big
one
.
he
would
a
be
worth
a
good
deal
over
at
the
village
.


they
peddle
out
such
a
fish
as
that
by
the
pound
in
the
market
-
house


there
;
everybody
buy
some
of
he
;
his
meat
be
as
white
as
snow
and
make


a
good
fry
.




next
morning
I
say
it
be
get
slow
and
dull
,
and
I
want
to
get
a


stir
up
some
way
.
I
say
I
reckon
I
would
slip
over
the
river
and


find
out
what
be
go
on
.
Jim
like
that
notion
;
but
he
say
I


must
go
in
the
dark
and
look
sharp
.
then
he
study
it
over
and
say
,


could
n't
I
put
on
some
of
they
old
thing
and
dress
up
like
a
girl
?


that
be
a
good
notion
,
too
.
so
we
shorten
up
one
of
the
calico


gown
,
and
I
turn
up
my
trouser
-
leg
to
my
knee
and
get
into
it
.
Jim


hitch
it
behind
with
the
hook
,
and
it
be
a
fair
fit
.
I
put
on
the


sun
-
bonnet
and
tie
it
under
my
chin
,
and
then
for
a
body
to
look
in


and
see
my
face
be
like
look
down
a
joint
of
stove
-
pipe
.
Jim
say


nobody
would
know
I
,
even
in
the
daytime
,
hardly
.
I
practice
around


all
day
to
get
the
hang
of
the
thing
,
and
by
and
by
I
could
do
pretty


well
in
they
,
only
Jim
say
I
do
n't
walk
like
a
girl
;
and
he
say


I
must
quit
pull
up
my
gown
to
get
at
my
britche
-
pocket
.
I
take


notice
,
and
do
well
.




I
start
up
the
Illinois
shore
in
the
canoe
just
after
dark
.




I
start
across
to
the
town
from
a
little
below
the
ferry
-
landing
,
and


the
drift
of
the
current
fetch
I
in
at
the
bottom
of
the
town
.
I


tie
up
and
start
along
the
bank
.
there
be
a
light
burn
in
a


little
shanty
that
have
n't
be
live
in
for
a
long
time
,
and
I
wonder


who
have
take
up
quarter
there
.
I
slip
up
and
peep
in
at
the


window
.
there
be
a
woman
about
forty
year
old
in
there
knit
by


a
candle
that
be
on
a
pine
table
.
I
do
n't
know
her
face
;
she
be
a


strange
,
for
you
could
n't
start
a
face
in
that
town
that
I
do
n't
know
.


now
this
be
lucky
,
because
I
be
weaken
;
I
be
get
afraid
I
have


come
;
people
might
know
my
voice
and
find
I
out
.
but
if
this
woman
have


be
in
such
a
little
town
two
day
she
could
tell
I
all
I
want
to


know
;
so
I
knock
at
the
door
,
and
make
up
my
mind
I
would
n't
forget
I


be
a
girl

"




"

not
everybody
.
a
good
many
think
he
do
it
.
but
they
'll
get


the
nigger
pretty
soon
now
,
and
maybe
they
can
scare
it
out
of
he
.
"




"
why
,
be
they
after

"




"

some
folk
think
the
nigger


ai
n't
far
from
here
.
I
be
one
of
they
--
but
I
hain't
talk
it
around
.
a


few
day
ago
I
be
talk
with
an
old
couple
that
live
next
door
in


the
log
shanty
,
and
they
happen
to
say
hardly
anybody
ever
go
to


that
island
over
yonder
that
they
call
Jackson
's
Island
.
do
n't
anybody


live
there
?
say
I.
no
,
nobody
,
say
they
.
I
do
n't
say
any
more
,
but


I
do
some
thinking
.
I
be
pretty
near
certain
I
'd
see
smoke
over


there
,
about
the
head
of
the
island
,
a
day
or
two
before
that
,
so
I
say


to
myself
,
like
as
not
that
nigger
's
hiding
over
there
;
anyway
,
say


I
,
it
be
worth
the
trouble
to
give
the
place
a
hunt
.
I
hain't
see
any


smoke
sence
,
so
I
reckon
maybe
he
be
go
,
if
it
be
he
;
but
husband
's


go
over
to
see

he
and
another
man

be

;
but
he

day
,
and
I
tell
he
as
soon

I
could
n't
set
still
.
I
have
to
do

I
take

needle
off
of
the
table
and
go
to
thread


it
.
my
hand

I
be

a
bad
job
of

I
want
to

but
of
course


I
do
n't
let
on
.
I
get
the
thing
,
and
the
first
rat
that
show
his


nose
I
let
drive
,
and
if
he
'd
a
stay

'd
a
be
a


tolerable
sick
rat

she
say
that
be
first

rate

she
reckon
I


would
hive

.
she
go
and
get
the
lump
of
lead
and
fetch


it
back
,
and
bring
along
a
hank
of
yarn
which
she
want
I
to
help


she
with
.
I
hold
up
my
two
hand
and
she
put
the
hank
over
they
,
and


go
on
talk
about
she
and
her
husband
's
matter
.
but
she
break
off


to
say
:




"

lead

"




so
she
drop
the
lump
into
my
lap
just
at
that
moment
,

I
clap

together
on

go
on

only
about
a


minute
.
then
she
take
off
the
hank

look

straight
in

very
pleasant

I
do
n't
know
hardly
what
to
do

I
say

say
it
would
n't
be
no
use
to
try
to
play

any
long

I


would
just
make
a
clean
breast
and
tell
she
everything
,

she
musn't


go
back
on

then
I
tell
she
my

thirty

he
go

steal
some
of

clear
out

I
have
be
three
night
come
the
thirty
mile
.
I
travel
night
,


and
hide
daytime

I
carry
from

you

,
maybe
.


bless
you

be
the
way
a
woman
most
always
do
,
but
a


man
always
do
t'other
way
.
and
when
you
throw
at
a
rat
or
anything
,


hitch
yourself
up
a
tiptoe
and

throw


stiff

turn
on
,

a

;
not
from
the
wrist
and
elbow
,
with
your
arm
out


to
one
side
,
like
a
boy
.
and
,
mind
you
,
when
a
girl
try
to
catch


anything
in
her
lap
she
throw
her
knee
apart
;
she
do
n't
clap
they


together
,
the
way
you
do
when
you
catch
the
lump
of
lead
.
why
,
I


spot
you
for
a
boy
when
you
be
thread
the
needle
;
and
I
contrive


the
other
thing
just
to
make
certain
.
now
trot
along
to
your
uncle
,


Sarah
Mary
Williams
George
Elexander
Peters
,
and
if
you
get
into
trouble


you
send
word
to
Mrs.
Judith
Loftus
,
which
be
I
,
and
I
'll
do
what
I
can


to
get
you
out
of
it
.
keep
the
river
road
all
the
way
,
and
next
time


you
tramp
take
shoe
and
sock
with
you
.
the
river
road
be
a
rocky
one
,


and
your
feet'll
be
in
a
condition
when
you
get
to
Goshen
,
I
reckon
.
"




I
go
up
the
bank
about
fifty
yard
,
and
then
I
double
on
my
track


and
slip
back
to
where
my
canoe
be
,
a
good
piece
below
the
house
.
I


jump
in
,
and
be
off
in
a
hurry
.
I
go
up
-
stream
far
enough
to


make
the
head
of
the
island
,
and
then
start
across
.
I
take
off
the


sun
-
bonnet
,
for
I
do
n't
want
no
blinder
on
then
.
when
I
be
about
the


middle
I
hear
the
clock
begin
to
strike
,
so
I
stop
and
listen
;
the


sound
come
faint
over
the
water
but
clear
--
eleven
.
when
I
strike
the


head
of
the
island
I
never
wait
to
blow
,
though
I
be
most
wind
,
but


I
shove
right
into
the
timber
where
my
old
camp
use
to
be
,
and
start


a
good
fire
there
on
a
high
and
dry
spot
.




then
I
jump
in
the
canoe
and
dig
out
for
our
place
,
a
mile
and
a
half


below
,
as
hard
as
I
could
go
.
I
land
,
and
slop
through
the
timber


and
up
the
ridge
and
into
the
cavern
.
there
Jim
lay
,
sound
asleep
on


the
ground
.
I
rouse
he
out
and
say
:




"
git
up
and
hump
yourself
,
Jim
!
there
ai
n't
a
minute
to
lose
.
they
be


after
we
!
"




Jim
never
ask
no
question
,
he
never
say
a
word
;
but
the
way
he


work
for
the
next
half
an
hour
show
about
how
he
be
scared
.
by


that
time
everything
we
have
in
the
world
be
on
our
raft
,
and
she
be


ready
to
be
shove
out
from
the
willow
cove
where
she
be
hide
.
we


put
out
the
camp
fire
at
the
cavern
the
first
thing
,
and
do
n't
show
a


candle
outside
after
that
.




I
take
the
canoe
out
from
the
shore
a
little
piece
,
and
take
a
look
;


but
if
there
be
a
boat
around
I
could
n't
see
it
,
for
star
and
shadow


ai
n't
good
to
see
by
.
then
we
get
out
the
raft
and
slip
along
down


in
the
shade
,
past
the
foot
of
the
island
dead
still
--
never
say
a


word
.










chapter
xii
.






it
must
a
be
close
on
to
one
o'clock
when
we
get
below
the
island
at


last
,
and
the
raft
do
seem
to
go
mighty
slow
.
if
a
boat
be
to
come


along
we
be
go
to
take
to
the
canoe
and
break
for
the
Illinois


shore
;
and
it
be
well
a
boat
do
n't
come
,
for
we
have
n't
ever
think
to


put
the
gun
in
the
canoe
,
or
a
fishing
-
line
,
or
anything
to
eat
.
we


be
in
ruther
too
much
of
a
sweat
to
think
of
so
many
thing
.
it
warn't


good
judgment
to
put
_
everything
_
on
the
raft
.




if
the
man
go
to
the
island
I
just
expect
they
find
the
camp
fire
I


build
,
and
watch
it
all
night
for
Jim
to
come
.
anyways
,
they
stay


away
from
we
,
and
if
my
build
the
fire
never
fool
they
it
warn't
no


fault
of
mine
.
I
play
it
as
low
down
on
they
as
I
could
.




when
the
first
streak
of
day
begin
to
show
we
tie
up
to
a
towhead
in
a


big
bend
on
the
Illinois
side
,
and
hack
off
cottonwood
branch
with


the
hatchet
,
and
cover
up
the
raft
with
they
so
she
look
like
there


have
be
a
cave
-
in
in
the
bank
there
.
a
tow
-
head
be
a
sandbar
that
have


cottonwood
on
it
as
thick
as
harrow
-
tooth
.




we
have
mountain
on
the
Missouri
shore
and
heavy
timber
on
the
Illinois


side
,
and
the
channel
be
down
the
Missouri
shore
at
that
place
,
so
we


warn't
afraid
of
anybody
run
across
we
.
we
lay
there
all
day
,


and
watch
the
raft
and
steamboat
spin
down
the
Missouri
shore
,
and


up
-
bind
steamboat
fight
the
big
river
in
the
middle
.
I
tell
Jim
all


about
the
time
I
have
jabber
with
that
woman
;
and
Jim
say
she
be


a
smart
one
,
and
if
she
be
to
start
after
we
herself
she
would
n't
set


down
and
watch
a
camp
fire
--
no
,
sir
,
she
'd
fetch
a
dog
.
well
,
then
,
I


say
,
why
could
n't
she
tell
her
husband
to
fetch
a
dog
?
Jim
say
he


bet
she
do
think
of
it
by
the
time
the
man
be
ready
to
start
,
and
he


believe
they
must
a
go
up
-
town
to
get
a
dog
and
so
they
lose
all
that


time
,
or
else
we
would
n't
be
here
on
a
towhead
sixteen
or
seventeen
mile


below
the
village
--
no
,
indeedy
,
we
would
be
in
that
same
old
town
again
.


so
I
say
I
do
n't
care
what
be
the
reason
they
do
n't
get
we
as
long


as
they
do
n't
.




when
it
be
begin
to
come
on
dark
we
poke
our
head
out
of
the


cottonwood
thicket
,
and
look
up
and
down
and
across
;
nothing
in
sight
;


so
Jim
take
up
some
of
the
top
plank
of
the
raft
and
build
a
snug


wigwam
to
get
under
in
blaze
weather
and
rainy
,
and
to
keep
the
thing


dry
.
Jim
make
a
floor
for
the
wigwam
,
and
raise
it
a
foot
or
more
above


the
level
of
the
raft
,
so
now
the
blanket
and
all
the
trap
be
out
of


reach
of
steamboat
wave
.
right
in
the
middle
of
the
wigwam
we
make
a


layer
of
dirt
about
five
or
six
inch
deep
with
a
frame
around
it
for


to
hold
it
to
its
place
;
this
be
to
build
a
fire
on
in
sloppy
weather


or
chilly
;
the
wigwam
would
keep
it
from
be
see
.
we
make
an
extra


steering
-
oar
,
too
,
because
one
of
the
other
might
get
break
on
a
snag


or
something
.
we
fix
up
a
short
fork
stick
to
hang
the
old
lantern


on
,
because
we
must
always
light
the
lantern
whenever
we
see
a
steamboat


come
down
-
stream
,
to
keep
from
getting
run
over
;
but
we
would
n't
have


to
light
it
for
up
-
stream
boat
unless
we
see
we
be
in
what
they
call


a
"
crossing
"
;
for
the
river
be
pretty
high
yet
,
very
low
bank
be


still
a
little
under
water
;
so
up
-
bind
boat
do
n't
always
run
the


channel
,
but
hunt
easy
water
.




this
second
night
we
run
between
seven
and
eight
hour
,
with
a
current


that
be
make
over
four
mile
an
hour
.
we
catch
fish
and
talk
,


and
we
take
a
swim
now
and
then
to
keep
off
sleepiness
.
it
be
kind
of


solemn
,
drift
down
the
big
,
still
river
,
lay
on
our
back
look


up
at
the
star
,
and
we
do
n't
ever
feel
like
talk
loud
,
and
it


warn't
often
that
we
laugh
--
only
a
little
kind
of
a
low
chuckle
.
we


have
mighty
good
weather
as
a
general
thing
,
and
nothing
ever
happen
to


we
at
all
--
that
night
,
nor
the
next
,
nor
the
next
.




every
night
we
pass
town
,
some
of
they
away
up
on
black
hillside
,


nothing
but
just
a
shiny
bed
of
light
;
not
a
house
could
you
see
.
the


fifth
night
we
pass
St.
Louis
,
and
it
be
like
the
whole
world
light
up
.


in
St.
Petersburg
they
use
to
say
there
be
twenty
or
thirty
thousand


people
in
St.
Louis
,
but
I
never
believe
it
till
I
see
that
wonderful


spread
of
light
at
two
o'clock
that
still
night
.
there
warn't
a
sound


there
;
everybody
be
asleep
.




every
night
now
I
use
to
slip
ashore
towards
ten
o'clock
at
some
little


village
,
and
buy
ten
or
fifteen
cent
'
worth
of
meal
or
bacon
or
other


stuff
to
eat
;
and
sometimes
I
lift
a
chicken
that
warn't
roost


comfortable
,
and
take
he
along
.
pap
always
say
,
take
a
chicken
when


you
get
a
chance
,
because
if
you
do
n't
want
he
yourself
you
can
easy


find
somebody
that
do
,
and
a
good
deed
ai
n't
ever
forget
.
I
never
see


pap
when
he
do
n't
want
the
chicken
himself
,
but
that
be
what
he
use
to


say
,
anyway
.




morning
before
daylight
I
slip
into
cornfield
and
borrow
a


watermelon
,
or
a
mushmelon
,
or
a
punkin
,
or
some
new
corn
,
or
thing
of


that
kind
.
pap
always
say
it
warn't
no
harm
to
borrow
thing
if
you


be
mean
to
pay
they
back
some
time
;
but
the
widow
say
it
warn't


anything
but
a
soft
name
for
stealing
,
and
no
decent
body
would
do
it
.


Jim
say
he
reckon
the
widow
be
partly
right
and
pap
be
partly


right
;
so
the
good
way
would
be
for
we
to
pick
out
two
or
three
thing


from
the
list
and
say
we
would
n't
borrow
they
any
more
--
then
he
reckon


it
would
n't
be
no
harm
to
borrow
the
other
.
so
we
talk
it
over
all


one
night
,
drift
along
down
the
river
,
try
to
make
up
our
mind


whether
to
drop
the
watermelon
,
or
the
cantelope
,
or
the
mushmelon
,


or
what
.
but
towards
daylight
we
get
it
all
settle
satisfactory
,
and


conclude
to
drop
crabapple
and
p'simmon
.
we
warn't
feel
just


right
before
that
,
but
it
be
all
comfortable
now
.
I
be
glad
the
way


it
come
out
,
too
,
because
crabapple
ai
n't
ever
good
,
and
the
p'simmon


would
n't
be
ripe
for
two
or
three
month
yet
.




we
shoot
a
water
-
fowl
now
and
then
that
get
up
too
early
in
the
morning


or
do
n't
go
to
bed
early
enough
in
the
evening
.
take
it
all
round
,
we


live
pretty
high
.




the
fifth
night
below
St.
Louis
we
have
a
big
storm
after
midnight
,
with


a
power
of
thunder
and
lightning
,
and
the
rain
pour
down
in
a
solid


sheet
.
we
stay
in
the
wigwam
and
let
the
raft
take
care
of
itself
.


when
the
lightning
glare
out
we
could
see
a
big
straight
river
ahead
,


and
high
,
rocky
bluff
on
both
side
.
by
and
by
say
I
,
"
hel-_lo

,
Jim
,


looky
yonder
!
"
it
be
a
steamboat
that
have
kill
herself
on
a
rock
.


we
be
drift
straight
down
for
she
.
the
lightning
show
she
very


distinct
.
she
be
lean
over
,
with
part
of
her
upper
deck
above


water
,
and
you
could
see
every
little
chimbly
-
guy
clean
and
clear
,
and
a


chair
by
the
big
bell
,
with
an
old
slouch
hat
hang
on
the
back
of
it
,


when
the
flash
come
.




well
,
it
be
away
in
the
night
and
stormy
,
and
all
so
mysterious
-
like
,


I
feel
just
the
way
any
other
boy
would
a
feel
when
I
see
that
wreck


lay
there
so
mournful
and
lonesome
in
the
middle
of
the
river
.
I


want
to
get
aboard
of
she
and
slink
around
a
little
,
and
see
what


there
be
there
.
so
I
say
:




"
Le

"




but
Jim
be
dead
against
it
at
first
.
he
say
:




"

Jim


could
n't
say
nothing
to
that
,

he
do
n't

.
 
"

I

little
,

give
in
.
he
say
we
must
n't
talk
any
more


than
we
could
help
,

then
talk
mighty
low
.
the
lightning
show
we


the
wreck
again
just
in
time
,

we

down
the
slope
of
it
to

,
in
the
dark
,
towards
the
texas

our
way
slow
with
our


foot
,
and
spread
our
hand
out
to
fend
off
the
guy
,
for
it
be
so


dark
we
could
n't

pretty
soon
we
strike
the
forward

it
;

away
down


through

just


then
I

wail
out

in

Bill
after
he
.
but
before
they
get
in
I
be
up


in
the
upper
berth
,
cornered
,
and
sorry
I
come
.
then
they
stand
there
,


with
their
hand
on
the
ledge
of
the
berth
,
and
talk
.
I
could
n't
see


they
,

I
could
tell
where
they
be
by
the
whisky
they
'd
be
have
.


I
be
glad
I
do
n't
drink
whisky
;
but
it
would
n't
make
much
difference


anyway
,
because
most
of
the
time
they
could
n't
a
treed
I
because
I


do
n't
breathe

I
be
too
scared

,

,
a
body

could
n't

breathe
and
hear
such
talk

they
talk
low
and
earnest

Bill

both
our

it

n't

quiet

I
'd
sorter
begin
to

you

well

be
quieter
way
if
the

's
_
get
_
to

do
.
but
what
I
say
be
this
:
it
ai
n't
good
sense
to
go
court'n
around


after
a
halter
if
you
can
git
at
what
you
be
up
to
in
some
way
that
be


jist
as
good

at
the
same
time
do
n't
bring
you

n't


that
so
?

"
you

how
you
goin'
to
manage
it
this
time
?
"




"
well
,
my
idea
be
this
:
we
'll
rustle
around
and
gather
up
whatever


pickin
we
've
overlook
in
the
stateroom
,
and
shove
for
shore
and
hide


the
truck

then
we
'll
wait

it
ai
n't
a

see
?


he
'll
be
drownde
,
and
wo
n't
have
nobody
to
blame
for
it
but
his
own


self
.
I
reckon
that
be
a
considerble
sight
well
'
n
killin
'
of
he
.


I
be
unfavorable
to

as

as

up

at

well
,
I
catch
my
breath
and
most
faint
.
shut
up
on
a

with


such
a

it
warn't

we

_
get
_
to
find
that
boat

have
to
have
it
for

so
we
go


a

quake
and
shake
down
the
stabboard
side
,
and
slow
work

too
--
seem
a
week
before
we
get
to
the
stern
.
no
sign
of
a
boat

Jim


say
he
do
n't
believe
he
could
go
any
far

so
scare
he
have
n't


hardly
any
strength
leave
,
he
say
.
but
I
say
,
come
on
,
if
we
get
leave


on
this
wreck
we
be
in
a
fix
,
sure
.
so
on
we
prowl
again
.
we
strike


for
the
stern
of
the
texas
,
and
find
it
,
and
then
scrabble
along


forwards
on
the
skylight
,
hang
on
from
shutter
to
shutter
,
for
the


edge
of
the
skylight
be
in
the
water
.
when
we
get
pretty
close
to
the


cross
-
hall
door
there
be
the
skiff
,
sure
enough
!
I
could
just
barely


see
she
.
I
feel
ever
so
thankful
.
in
another
second
I
would
a
be


aboard
of
she
,
but
just
then
the
door
open
.
one
of
the
man
stick
his


head
out
only
about
a
couple
of
foot
from
I
,
and
I
think
I
be
go
;


but
he
jerk
it
in
again
,
and
say
:




"
heave
that
blame

he
fling
a
bag
of
something
into
the
boat
,
and
then
get
in
himself
and


set
down
.
it
be
Packard
.
then
Bill
_
he
_
come
out
and
get
in
.
packard

,
in
a
low
voice
:

I
could
n't
hardly
hang
on
to
the
shutter
,
I
be
so
weak
.
but
Bill


say
:




"
hold
on--'d
you
go
through
he

"




"
no
.
do
n't
you

"




"
no
.
so
he
be
get
his
share
o
'
the
cash
yet
.
"




"
well
,
then
,
come
along
;
no
use
to
take
truck
and
leave
money
.
"




"
say
,
wo
n't
he
suspicion
what
we
be
up
to
?
"




"
maybe
he
wo
n't
.
but
we
get
to
have
it
anyway
.
come
along
.
"




so
they
get
out
and
go
in
.




the
door
slam
to
because
it
be
on
the
careened
side
;
and
in
a
half


second
I
be
in
the
boat
,
and
Jim
come
tumble
after
I
.
I
out
with
my


knife
and
cut
the
rope
,
and
away
we
go
!




we
do
n't
touch
an
oar
,
and
we
do
n't
speak
nor
whisper
,
nor
hardly
even


breathe
.
we
go
glide
swift
along
,
dead
silent
,
past
the
tip
of
the


paddle
-
box
,
and
past
the
stern
;
then
in
a
second
or
two
more
we
be
a


hundred
yard
below
the
wreck
,
and
the
darkness
soak
she
up
,
every


last
sign
of
she
,
and
we
be
safe
,
and
know
it
.




when
we
be
three
or
four
hundred
yard
down
-
stream
we
see
the
lantern


show
like
a
little
spark
at
the
texas
door
for
a
second
,
and
we
know


by
that
that
the
rascal
have
miss
their
boat
,
and
be
begin
to


understand
that
they
be
in
just
as
much
trouble
now
as
Jim
Turner
be
.




then
Jim
man
the
oar
,
and
we
take
out
after
our
raft
.
now
be
the


first
time
that
I
begin
to
worry
about
the
man
--
I
reckon
I
have
n't


have
time
to
before
.
I
begin
to
think
how
dreadful
it
be
,
even
for


murderer
,
to
be
in
such
a
fix
.
I
say
to
myself
,
there
ai
n't
no


tell
but
I
might
come
to
be
a
murderer
myself
yet
,
and
then
how
would


I
like
it
?
so
say
I
to
Jim
:




"
the
first
light
we
see
we
'll
land
a
hundred
yard
below
it
or
above


it
,
in
a
place
where
it
be
a
good
hiding
-
place
for
you
and
the
skiff
,
and


then
I
'll
go
and
fix
up
some
kind
of
a
yarn
,
and
get
somebody
to
go
for


that
gang
and
get
they
out
of
their
scrape
,
so
they
can
be
hang
when


their
time
come
.
"




but
that
idea
be
a
failure
;
for
pretty
soon
it
begin
to
storm
again
,


and
this
time
bad
than
ever
.
the
rain
pour
down
,
and
never
a
light


show
;
everybody
in
bed
,
I
reckon
.
we
boom
along
down
the
river
,


watch
for
light
and
watch
for
our
raft
.
after
a
long
time
the


rain
let
up
,
but
the
cloud
stay
,
and
the
lightning
keep
whimpering
,


and
by
and
by
a
flash
show
we
a
black
thing
ahead
,
float
,
and
we


make
for
it
.




it
be
the
raft
,
and
mighty
glad
be
we
to
get
aboard
of
it
again
.
we


see
a
light
now
away
down
to
the
right
,
on
shore
.
so
I
say
I
would


go
for
it
.
the
skiff
be
half
full
of
plunder
which
that
gang
have
steal


there
on
the
wreck
.
we
hustle
it
on
to
the
raft
in
a
pile
,
and
I
tell


Jim
to
float
along
down
,
and
show
a
light
when
he
judge
he
have
go


about
two
mile
,
and
keep
it
burn
till
I
come
;
then
I
man
my
oar


and
shove
for
the
light
.
as
I
get
down
towards
it
three
or
four
more


show
--
up
on
a
hillside
.
it
be
a
village
.
I
close
in
above
the
shore


light
,
and
lay
on
my
oar
and
float
.
as
I
go
by
I
see
it
be
a


lantern
hang
on
the
jackstaff
of
a
double
-
hull
ferryboat
.
I
skim


around
for
the
watchman
,
a
-
wonder
whereabout
he
sleep
;
and
by
and


by
I
find
he
roost
on
the
bitt
forward
,
with
his
head
down
between


his
knee
.
I
give
his
shoulder
two
or
three
little
shove
,
and
begin
to


cry
.




he
stir
up
in
a
kind
of
a
startlish
way
;
but
when
he
see
it
be
only


I
he
take
a
good
gap
and
stretch
,
and
then
he
say

she

in
a
minute
there
warn't

be

a
little
,

there
be
n't
any
answer

a
little


bit
heavy

hearted
about

not
much
,
for
I
reckon
if
they


could
stand
it
I
could
.




then
here
come
the
ferryboat

I
shove
for
the
middle
of
the

on
a
long

slant

I
be
out

I
lay
on
my

go

smell
around
the


wreck

the

would
know

then
pretty
soon
the
ferryboat
give


it
up

go
for
the
shore

I
lay

my
work

go
a

boom


down
the

it

long

show

when


it
do
show
it
look

get
there
the

be
begin
to
get
a
little
gray

so
we


strike
for
an

hide
the

the

River
come
in

that
be
what
we
be


after

we
would
sell
the
raft

get
on
a
steamboat

go
way
up
the


Ohio

the
second
night
a
fog
begin
to
come
on
,

we
make
for
a
towhead


to
tie
to
,
for
it
would
n't
do
to
try
to
run
in
a
fog
;

when
I
paddle


ahead
in
the
canoe
,
with
the
line
to
make
fast
,
there
warn't
anything

little
sapling

the

around
one
of
they


right
on
the
edge
of
the
cut
bank

there
be
a
stiff
current
,

the
raft
come
boom
down
so
lively
she
tear
it
out
by
the
root
and


away
she
go
.
I
see
the
fog
close
down
,

it
make
I
so
sick

a
half

there
warn't
no

twenty
yard

jump
into
the
canoe

run
back
to
the
stern
,

grab
the
paddle

set
she
back
a
stroke
.

she
do
n't
come

up

with
they
.




as
soon
as
I
got
start
I
take
out
after
the
raft
,
hot
and
heavy
,
right


down
the
towhead
.
that
be
all
right
as
far
as
it
go
,
but
the
towhead


warn't
sixty
yard
long
,
and
the
minute
I
fly
by
the
foot
of
it
I
shoot


out
into
the
solid
white
fog
,
and
have
n't
no
more
idea
which
way
I
be


go
than
a
dead
man
.




think
I
,
it
wo
n't
do
to
paddle
;
first
I
know
I
'll
run
into
the
bank


or
a
towhead
or
something
;
I
get
to
set
still
and
float
,
and
yet
it
be


mighty
fidgety
business
to
have
to
hold
your
hand
still
at
such
a
time
.


I
whoop
and
listen
.
away
down
there
somewhere
I
hear
a
small


whoop
,
and
up
come
my
spirit
.
I
go
tear
after
it
,
listen


sharp
to
hear
it
again
.
the
next
time
it
come
I
see
I
warn't
head


for
it
,
but
head
away
to
the
right
of
it
.
and
the
next
time
I
be


head
away
to
the
left
of
it
--
and
not
gain
on
it
much
either
,
for


I
be
fly
around
,
this
way
and
that
and
t'other
,
but
it
be
go


straight
ahead
all
the
time
.




I
do
wish
the
fool
would
think
to
beat
a
tin
pan
,
and
beat
it
all
the


time
,
but
he
never
do
,
and
it
be
the
still
place
between
the
whoop


that
be
make
the
trouble
for
I
.
well
,
I
fight
along
,
and
directly


I
hear
the
whoop
_
behind
_
I
.
I
be
tangle
good
now
.
that
be


somebody
else
's
whoop
,
or
else
I
be
turn
around
.




I
throw
the
paddle
down
.
I
hear
the
whoop
again
;
it
be
behind
I


yet
,
but
in
a
different
place
;
it
keep
come
,
and
keep
change
its


place
,
and
I
keep
answer
,
till
by
and
by
it
be
in
front
of
I
again
,


and
I
know
the
current
have
swing
the
canoe
's
head
down
-
stream
,
and
I


be
all
right
if
that
be
Jim
and
not
some
other
raftsman
hollering
.


I
could
n't
tell
nothing
about
voice
in
a
fog
,
for
nothing
do
n't
look


natural
nor
sound
natural
in
a
fog
.




the
whooping
go
on
,
and
in
about
a
minute
I
come
a
-
boom
down
on
a


cut
bank
with
smoky
ghost
of
big
tree
on
it
,
and
the
current
throw


I
off
to
the
left
and
shoot
by
,
amongst
a
lot
of
snag
that
fairly


roar
,
the
currrent
be
tear
by
they
so
swift
.




in
another
second
or
two
it
be
solid
white
and
still
again
.
I
set


perfectly
still
then
,
listen
to
my
heart
thump
,
and
I
reckon
I
do
n't


draw
a
breath
while
it
thump
a
hundred
.




I
just
give
up
then
.
I
know
what
the
matter
be
.
that
cut
bank


be
an
island
,
and
Jim
have
go
down
t'other
side
of
it
.
it
warn't
no


towhead
that
you
could
float
by
in
ten
minute
.
it
have
the
big
timber


of
a
regular
island
;
it
might
be
five
or
six
mile
long
and
more
than


half
a
mile
wide
.




I
keep
quiet
,
with
my
ear
cock
,
about
fifteen
minute
,
I
reckon
.
I


be
float
along
,
of
course
,
four
or
five
mile
an
hour
;
but
you
do
n't


ever
think
of
that
.
no
,
you
_
feel
_
like
you
be
lay
dead
still
on


the
water
;
and
if
a
little
glimpse
of
a
snag
slip
by
you
do
n't
think
to


yourself
how
fast
_
you
be
_
go
,
but
you
catch
your
breath
and
think
,


my
!
how
that
snag
be
tear
along
.
if
you
think
it
ai
n't
dismal
and


lonesome
out
in
a
fog
that
way
by
yourself
in
the
night
,
you
try
it


once
--
you'll
see
.




next
,
for
about
a
half
an
hour
,
I
whoop
now
and
then
;
at
last
I
hear


the
answer
a
long
way
off
,
and
try
to
follow
it
,
but
I
could
n't
do


it
,
and
directly
I
judge
I
'd
get
into
a
nest
of
towhead
,
for
I
have


little
dim
glimpse
of
they
on
both
side
of
I
--
sometimes
just
a
narrow


channel
between
,
and
some
that
I
could
n't
see
I
know
be
there
because


I
'd
hear
the
wash
of
the
current
against
the
old
dead
brush
and
trash


that
hang
over
the
bank
.
well
,
I
warn't
long
loose
the
whoop
down


amongst
the
towhead
;
and
I
only
try
to
chase
they
a
little
while
,


anyway
,
because
it
be
bad
than
chase
a
Jack
-
o'-lantern
.
you
never


know
a
sound
dodge
around
so
,
and
swap
place
so
quick
and
so
much
.




I
have
to
claw
away
from
the
bank
pretty
lively
four
or
five
time
,
to


keep
from
knock
the
island
out
of
the
river
;
and
so
I
judge
the


raft
must
be
butt
into
the
bank
every
now
and
then
,
or
else
it
would


get
far
ahead
and
clear
out
of
hearing
--
it
be
float
a
little


fast
than
what
I
be
.




well
,
I
seem
to
be
in
the
open
river
again
by
and
by
,
but
I
could
n't


hear
no
sign
of
a
whoop
nowhere
.
I
reckon
Jim
have
fetch
up
on
a


snag
,
maybe
,
and
it
be
all
up
with
he
.
I
be
good
and
tired
,
so
I


lay
down
in
the
canoe
and
say
I
would
n't
bother
no
more
.
I
do
n't


want
to
go
to
sleep
,
of
course
;
but
I
be
so
sleepy
I
could
n't
help
it
;


so
I
think
I
would
take
jest
one
little
cat
-
nap
.




but
I
reckon
it
be
more
than
a
cat
-
nap
,
for
when
I
wake
up
the
star


be
shine
bright
,
the
fog
be
all
go
,
and
I
be
spin
down
a


big
bend
stern
first
.
first
I
do
n't
know
where
I
be
;
I
think
I
be


dream
;
and
when
thing
begin
to
come
back
to
I
they
seem
to
come


up
dim
out
of
last
week
.




it
be
a
monstrous
big
river
here
,
with
the
tall
and
the
thick


kind
of
timber
on
both
bank
;
just
a
solid
wall
,
as
well
as
I
could
see


by
the
star
.
I
look
away
down
-
stream
,
and
see
a
black
speck
on
the


water
.
I
take
after
it
;
but
when
I
get
to
it
it
warn't
nothing
but
a


couple
of
sawlog
make
fast
together
.
then
I
see
another
speck
,
and


chase
that
;
then
another
,
and
this
time
I
be
right
.
it
be
the
raft
.




when
I
get
to
it
Jim
be
set
there
with
his
head
down
between
his


knee
,
asleep
,
with
his
right
arm
hang
over
the
steering
-
oar
.
the


other
oar
be
smash
off
,
and
the
raft
be
litter
up
with
leave
and


branch
and
dirt
.
so
she
'd
have
a
rough
time
.




I
make
fast
and
lay
down
under
Jim
's
nose
on
the
raft
,
and
begin
to


gap
,
and
stretch
my
fist
out
against
Jim
,
and
say
:




"

for
about
five
minute
,

set
there
study


over

.
then
he

because
it
be
send

the
first
towhead
stand
for
a
man
that
would
try
to
do
we
some
good
,
but


the
current
be
another
man
that
would
get

.
the
whoop


be
warning
that
would
come
to

every
now
and
then
,
and
if
we
do
n't


try
hard
to
make
out
to

they
they
'd
just
take

quarrelsome
people

folk
,

if
we
mind
our
business
and
do
n't
talk
back
and
aggravate


they
,
we
would
pull
through
and
get
out
of
the
fog
and
into
the
big


clear
river
,
which
be
the
free
States
,

would
n't
have
no
more


trouble
.




it
have
cloud
up
pretty
dark
just
after
I
get
on
to
the
raft
,
but
it


be
clear
up
again
now

loose

right
away

when
he
do
get
the

straighten
around
he


look

chapter
XVI
.






we
sleep
most
all
day
,
and
start
out
at
night
,
a
little
way
behind
a


monstrous
long
raft
that
be
as
long
go
by
as
a
procession
.
she
have


four
long
sweep
at
each
end
,
so
we
judge
she
carry
as
many
as
thirty


man
,
likely
.
she
have
five
big
wigwam
aboard
,
wide
apart
,
and
an
open


camp
fire
in
the
middle
,
and
a
tall
flag
-
pole
at
each
end
.
there
be
a


power
of
style
about
she
.
it
_
amount
_
to
something
be
a
raftsman


on
such
a
craft
as
that
.




we
went
drift
down
into
a
big
bend
,
and
the
night
cloud
up
and
get


hot
.
the
river
be
very
wide
,
and
be
wall
with
solid
timber
on


both
side
;
you
could
n't
see
a
break
in
it
hardly
ever
,
or
a
light
.
we


talk
about
Cairo
,
and
wonder
whether
we
would
know
it
when
we
get
to


it
.
I
say
likely
we
would
n't
,
because
I
have
hear
say
there
warn't
but


about
a
dozen
house
there
,
and
if
they
do
n't
happen
to
have
they
light


up
,
how
be
we
go
to
know
we
be
pass
a
town
?
Jim
say
if
the
two


big
river
join
together
there
,
that
would
show
.
but
I
say
maybe


we
might
think
we
be
pass
the
foot
of
an
island
and
come
into
the


same
old
river
again
.
that
disturb
Jim
--
and
I
too
.
so
the
question


be
,
what
to
do
?
I
say
,
paddle
ashore
the
first
time
a
light
show
,


and
tell
they
pap
be
behind
,
come
along
with
a
trading
-
scow
,
and


be
a
green
hand
at
the
business
,
and
want
to
know
how
far
it
be
to


Cairo
.
Jim
think
it
be
a
good
idea
,
so
we
take
a
smoke
on
it
and


wait
.




there
warn't
nothing
to
do
now
but
to
look
out
sharp
for
the
town
,
and


not
pass
it
without
see
it
.
he
say
he
'd
be
mighty
sure
to
see
it
,


because
he
'd
be
a
free
man
the
minute
he
see
it
,
but
if
he
miss
it


he
'd
be
in
a
slave
country
again
and
no
more
show
for
freedom
.
every


little
while
he
jump
up
and
say
:




"
Dah
she
be
?
"




but
it
warn't
.
it
be
Jack
-
o'-lanterns
,
or
lightning
bug
;
so
he
set


down
again
,
and
go
to
watching
,
same
as
before
.
Jim
say
it
make
he


all
over
trembly
and
feverish
to
be
so
close
to
freedom
.
well
,
I
can


tell
you
it
make
I
all
over
trembly
and
feverish
,
too
,
to
hear
he
,


because
I
begin
to
get
it
through
my
head
that
he
_
be
_
most
free
--
and


who
be
to
blame
for
it
?
why
,
_
I
_
.
I
could
n't
get
that
out
of
my


conscience
,
no
how
nor
no
way
.
it
get
to
trouble
I
so
I
could
n't


rest
;
I
could
n't
stay
still
in
one
place
.
it
have
n't
ever
come
home
to


I
before
,
what
this
thing
be
that
I
be
do
.
but
now
it
do
;
and
it


stay
with
I
,
and
scorch
I
more
and
more
.
I
try
to
make
out
to


myself
that
I
warn't
to
blame
,
because
I
do
n't
run
Jim
off
from
his


rightful
owner
;
but
it
warn't
no
use
,
conscience
up
and
say
,
every


time
,
"
but
you
know
he
be
run
for
his
freedom
,
and
you
could
a


paddle
ashore
and
tell
somebody
.
"
that
be
so
--
I
could
n't
get
around


that
noway
.
that
be
where
it
pinch
.
Conscience
say
to
I
,
"
what


have
poor
Miss
Watson
do
to
you
that
you
could
see
her
nigger
go
off


right
under
your
eye
and
never
say
one
single
word
?
what
do
that
poor


old
woman
do
to
you
that
you
could
treat
she
so
mean
?
why
,
she
try
to


learn
you
your
book
,
she
try
to
learn
you
your
manner
,
she
try
to


be
good
to
you
every
way
she
know
how
.
_
that
be
_
what
she
do
.
"




I
get
to
feel
so
mean
and
so
miserable
I
most
wish
I
be
dead
.
I


fidget
up
and
down
the
raft
,
abuse
myself
to
myself
,
and
Jim
be


fidget
up
and
down
past
I
.
we
neither
of
we
could
keep
still
.


every
time
he
dance
around
and
say
,
"
Dah
's
Cairo
!
"
it
go
through
I


like
a
shot
,
and
I
think
if
it
_
be
_
Cairo
I
reckon
I
would
die
of


miserableness
.




Jim
talk
out
loud
all
the
time
while
I
be
talk
to
myself
.
he
be


say
how
the
first
thing
he
would
do
when
he
get
to
a
free
state
he


would
go
to
save
up
money
and
never
spend
a
single
cent
,
and
when
he


get
enough
he
would
buy
his
wife
,
which
be
own
on
a
farm
close
to


where
Miss
Watson
live
;
and
then
they
would
both
work
to
buy
the


two
child
,
and
if
their
master
would
n't
sell
they
,
they
'd
get
an


ab'litionist
to
go
and
steal
they
.




it
most
freeze
I
to
hear
such
talk
.
he
would
n't
ever
dare
to
talk
such


talk
in
his
life
before
.
just
see
what
a
difference
it
make
in
he
the


minute
he
judge
he
be
about
free
.
it
be
accord
to
the
old
saying
,


"
give
a
nigger
an
inch
and
he
'll
take
an
ell
.
"
think
I
,
this
be
what


come
of
my
not
think
.
here
be
this
nigger
,
which
I
have
as
good


as
help
to
run
away
,
come
right
out
flat
-
footed
and
say
he
would


steal
his
child
--
child
that
belong
to
a
man
I
do
n't
even
know
;
a


man
that
have
n't
ever
do
I
no
harm
.




I
be
sorry
to
hear
Jim
say
that
,
it
be
such
a
lowering
of
he
.
my


conscience
get
to
stir
I
up
hotter

we

I
have

we
lay
up
for
the
day
on
a
towhead
tolerable


close
to
the
left
-
hand
bank
.
I
begin
to
suspicion
something
.
so
do


Jim
.
I
say
:




"
maybe
we

the

Ohio

sure


enough
,
and
outside
be
the
old
regular
Muddy
!
so
it
be
all
up
with


Cairo
.




we
talk
it
all
over
.
it
would
n't
do
to
take
to
the
shore
;
we
could
n't


take
the
raft
up
the
stream
,
of
course
.
there
warn't
no
way
but
to
wait


for
dark
,
and
start
back
in
the
canoe
and
take
the
chance
.
so
we
sleep


all
day
amongst
the
cottonwood
thicket
,
so
as
to
be
fresh
for
the
work
,


and
when
we
go
back
to
the
raft
about
dark
the
canoe
be
go
!




we
do
n't
say
a
word
for
a
good
while
.
there
warn't
anything
to


say
.
we
both
know
well
enough
it
be
some
more
work
of
the


rattlesnake
-
skin
;
so
what
be
the
use
to
talk
about
it
?
it
would
only


look
like
we
be
find
fault
,
and
that
would
be
bind
to
fetch
more


bad
luck
--
and
keep
on
fetch
it
,
too
,
till
we
know
enough
to
keep


still
.




by
and
by
we
talk
about
what
we
well
do
,
and
find
there
warn't
no


way
but
just
to
go
along
down
with
the
raft
till
we
get
a
chance
to
buy


a
canoe
to
go
back
in
.
we
warn't
go
to
borrow
it
when
there
warn't


anybody
around
,
the
way
pap
would
do
,
for
that
might
set
people
after


we
.




so
we
shove
out
after
dark
on
the
raft
.




anybody
that
do
n't
believe
yet
that
it
be
foolishness
to
handle
a


snake
-
skin
,
after
all
that
that
snake
-
skin
do
for
we
,
will
believe
it


now
if
they
read
on
and
see
what
more
it
do
for
we
.




the
place
to
buy
canoe
be
off
of
raft
lay
up
at
shore
.
but
we


do
n't
see
no
raft
lay
up
;
so
we
go
along
during
three
hour
and


more
.
well
,
the
night
get
gray
and
ruther
thick
,
which
be
the
next


mean
thing
to
fog
.
you
ca
n't
tell
the
shape
of
the
river
,
and
you


ca
n't
see
no
distance
.
it
get
to
be
very
late
and
still
,
and
then
along


come
a
steamboat
up
the
river
.
we
light
the
lantern
,
and
judge
she


would
see
it
.
up
-
stream
boat
do
n't
generly
come
close
to
we
;
they


go
out
and
follow
the
bar
and
hunt
for
easy
water
under
the
reef
;
but


night
like
this
they
bull
right
up
the
channel
against
the
whole
river
.




we
could
hear
she
pound
along
,
but
we
do
n't
see
she
good
till
she


be
close
.
she
aim
right
for
we
.
often
they
do
that
and
try
to
see


how
close
they
can
come
without
touch
;
sometimes
the
wheel
bite
off


a
sweep
,
and
then
the
pilot
stick
his
head
out
and
laugh
,
and
think


he
be
mighty
smart
.
well
,
here
she
come
,
and
we
say
she
be
go
to


try
and
shave
we
;
but
she
do
n't
seem
to
be
sheer
off
a
bit
.
she


be
a
big
one
,
and
she
be
come
in
a
hurry
,
too
,
look
like
a
black


cloud
with
row
of
glow
-
worm
around
it
;
but
all
of
a
sudden
she
bulge


out
,
big
and
scary
,
with
a
long
row
of
wide
-
open
furnace
door
shine


like
red
-
hot
tooth
,
and
her
monstrous
bow
and
guard
hang
right


over
we
.
there
be
a
yell
at
we
,
and
a
jingling
of
bell
to
stop
the


engine
,
a
powwow
of
cussing
,
and
whistling
of
steam
--
and
as
Jim
go


overboard
on
one
side
and
I
on
the
other
,
she
come
smash
straight


through
the
raft
.




I
dive
--
and
I
aim
to
find
the
bottom
,
too
,
for
a
thirty
-
foot
wheel


have
get
to
go
over
I
,
and
I
want
it
to
have
plenty
of
room
.
I
could


always
stay
under
water
a
minute
;
this
time
I
reckon
I
stay
under
a


minute
and
a
half
.
then
I
bounce
for
the
top
in
a
hurry
,
for
I
be


nearly
bust
.
I
pop
out
to
my
armpit
and
blow
the
water
out
of


my
nose
,
and
puff
a
bit
.
of
course
there
be
a
booming
current
;
and


of
course
that
boat
start
her
engine
again
ten
second
after
she


stop
they
,
for
they
never
care
much
for
raftsman
;
so
now
she
be


churn
along
up
the
river
,
out
of
sight
in
the
thick
weather
,
though
I


could
hear
she
.




I
sing
out
for
Jim
about
a
dozen
time
,
but
I
do
n't
get
any
answer
;


so
I
grab
a
plank
that
touch
I
while
I
be
"
tread
water
,
"
and


strike
out
for
shore
,
shove
it
ahead
of
I
.
but
I
make
out
to
see


that
the
drift
of
the
current
be
towards
the
left
-
hand
shore
,
which


mean
that
I
be
in
a
crossing
;
so
I
change
off
and
go
that
way
.




it
be
one
of
these
long
,
slanting
,
two
-
mile
crossing
;
so
I
be
a
good


long
time
in
get
over
.
I
make
a
safe
landing
,
and
clumb
up
the


bank
.
I
could
n't
see
but
a
little
way
,
but
I
go
poke
along
over


rough
ground
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
or
more
,
and
then
I
run
across
a


big
old
-
fashioned
double
log
-
house
before
I
notice
it
.
I
be
go
to


rush
by
and
get
away
,
but
a
lot
of
dog
jump
out
and
go
to
howl


and
bark
at
I
,
and
I
know
well
than
to
move
another
peg

blacker

black


dress
,
belt

and


very
wee
black
slipper
,
like
a
chisel
,
and
she
be
lean
pensive
on
a


tombstone
on
her
right
elbow
,
under
a
weeping
willow
,
and
her

a
reticule

"


 
another
one
be
a
young

with
her
hair
all
comb
up
straight


to
the
top
of
her
head
,
and
knot
there
in
front
of
a
comb
like
a


chair
-
back
,
and
she
be
cry
into
a
handkerchief
and
have
a
dead
bird


lay
on
its
back
in
her
other
hand
with
its

up

there
be
one
where
a
young

be
at
a
window
look
up
at
the


moon
,
and
tear
run
down
her
cheek
;
and
she
have
an
open
letter
in


one
hand
with
black
sealing
wax
show
on
one
edge
of
it

she
be


mash
a
locket
with
a
chain
to
it
against
her
mouth
,

underneath


the

Alas
.
"
these


be
all
nice
picture
,
I
reckon
,
but
I
do
n't
somehow
seem
to
take


to
they
,
because
if
ever
I
be
down
a
little
they
always
give
I
the


fan
-
tod
.
everybody
be
sorry
she
die
,
because
she
have
lay
out
a
lot


more
of
these
picture
to
do
,
and
a
body
could
see
by
what
she
have
do


what
they
have
lose
.
but
I
reckon
that
with
her
disposition
she
be


have
a
well
time
in
the
graveyard
.
she
be
at
work
on
what
they


say
be
her
great
picture
when
she
take
sick
,
and
every
day
and


every
night
it
be
her
prayer
to
be
allow
to
live
till
she
get
it


do
,
but
she
never
get
the
chance
.
it
be
a
picture
of
a
young
woman


in
a
long
white
gown
,
stand
on
the
rail
of
a
bridge
all
ready
to
jump


off
,
with
her
hair
all
down
her
back
,
and
look
up
to
the
moon
,
with


the
tear
run
down
her
face
,
and
she
have
two
arm
fold
across
she


breast
,
and
two
arm
stretch
out
in
front
,
and
two
more
reach
up


towards
the
moon
--
and
the
idea
be
to
see
which
pair
would
look
good
,


and
then
scratch
out
all
the
other
arm
;
but
,
as
I
be
say
,
she
die


before
she
get
her
mind
make
up
,
and
now
they
keep
this
picture
over
the


head
of
the
bed
in
her
room
,
and
every
time
her
birthday
come
they
hang


flower
on
it
.
other
time
it
be
hide
with
a
little
curtain
.
the
young


woman
in
the
picture
have
a
kind
of
a
nice
sweet
face
,
but
there
be
so


many
arm
it
make
she
look
too
spidery
,
seem
to
I
.




this
young
girl
keep
a
scrap
-

when
she
be
alive
,
and

and
write
poetry
after
they

.


it
be
very
good
poetry
.
this
be
what
she
write
about
a
boy
by

if
Emmeline

poetry
like
that
before
she

there
ai

Buck

rattle
off
poetry
like
nothing
.
she
do
n't
ever
have
to


stop
to
think
.
he
say
she
would
slap
down
a
line
,
and
if
she
could
n't


find
anything
to
rhyme
with
it
would
just
scratch
it
out
and
slap
down


another
one
,
and
go
ahead
.
she
warn't
particular
;
she
could
write
about


anything
you
choose
to
give
she
to
write
about
just
so
it
be
sadful
.


every
time
a
man
die
,
or
a
woman
die
,
or
a
child
die
,
she
would
be
on


hand
with
her
"
tribute
"
before
he
be
cold
.
she
call
they
tribute
.


the
neighbor
say
it
be
the
doctor
first
,
then
Emmeline
,
then
the


undertaker
--
the
undertaker
never
get
in
ahead
of
Emmeline
but
once
,
and


then
she
hang
fire
on
a
rhyme
for
the
dead
person
's
name
,
which
be


Whistler
.
she
warn't
ever
the
same
after
that
;
she
never
complain
,


but
she
kinder
pine
away
and
do
not
live
long
.
poor
thing
,
many
be
the


time
I
make
myself
go
up
to
the
little
room
that
use
to
be
hers
and
get


out
her
poor
old
scrap
-
book
and
read
in
it
when
her
picture
have
be


aggravate
I
and
I
have
sour
on
she
a
little
.
I
like
all
that


family
,
dead
one
and
all
,
and
warn't
go
to
let
anything
come
between


we
.
Poor
Emmeline
make
poetry
about
all
the
dead
people
when
she
be


alive
,
and
it
do
n't
seem
right
that
there
warn't
nobody
to
make
some


about
she
now
she
be
go
;
so
I
try
to
sweat
out
a
verse
or
two


myself
,
but
I
could
n't
seem
to
make
it
go
somehow
.
they
keep
Emmeline
's


room
trim
and
nice
,
and
all
the
thing
fix
in
it
just
the
way
she


like
to
have
they
when
she
be
alive
,
and
nobody
ever
sleep
there
.


the
old
lady
take
care
of
the
room
herself
,
though
there
be
plenty


of
nigger
,
and
she
sew
there
a
good
deal
and
read
she
Bible
there


mostly
.




well
,
as
I
be

a
little


old
piano

and
sometimes
the
table
be
set
there
in
the
middle
of
the


day
,
and
it
be

comfortable
place
.
nothing

chapter
XVIII
.






Col
.
Grangerford
be
a
gentleman
,
you
see
.
he
be
a
gentleman
all


over
;
and
so
be
his
family
.
he
be
well
bear
,
as
the
saying
be
,
and


that
be
worth
as
much
in
a
man
as
it
be
in
a
horse
,
so
the
Widow
Douglas


say
,
and
nobody
ever
deny
that
she
be
of
the
first
aristocracy


in
our
town
;
and
pap
he
always
say
it
,
too
,
though
he
warn't
no
more


quality
than
a
mudcat
himself
.
Col
.
Grangerford
be
very
tall
and


very
slim
,
and
have
a
darkish
-
paly
complexion
,
not
a
sign
of
red
in
it


anywhere
;
he
be
clean
shaved
every
morning
all
over
his
thin
face
,
and


he
have
the
thin
kind
of
lip
,
and
the
thin
kind
of
nostril
,
and


a
high
nose
,
and
heavy
eyebrow
,
and
the
black
kind
of
eye
,
sink
so


deep
back
that
they
seem
like
they
be
look
out
of
cavern
at


you
,
as
you
may
say
.
his
forehead
be
high
,
and
his
hair
be
black
and


straight
and
hang
to
his
shoulder
.
his
hand
be
long
and
thin
,
and


every
day
of
his
life
he
put
on
a
clean
shirt
and
a
full
suit
from
head


to
foot
make
out
of
linen
so
white
it
hurt
your
eye
to
look
at
it
;


and
on
sunday
he
wear
a
blue
tail
-
coat
with
brass
button
on
it
.
he


carry
a
mahogany
cane
with
a
silver
head
to
it
.
there
warn't
no


frivolishness
about
he
,
not
a
bit
,
and
he
warn't
ever
loud
.
he
be


as
kind
as
he
could
be
--
you
could
feel
that
,
you
know
,
and
so
you
have


confidence
.
sometimes
he
smile
,
and
it
be
good
to
see
;
but
when
he


straighten
himself
up
like
a
liberty
-
pole
,
and
the
lightning
begin
to


flicker
out
from
under
his
eyebrow

twenty
-
five
,
and
tall

as
good
as
she

she
warn't

up
;
but


when

.




so

her
sister
,
Miss

it
be
a
different
kind
.
she
be


gentle
and
sweet
like
a
dove
,
and
she
be
only
twenty
.




each
person
have
their
own
nigger
to
wait
on
they
--
Buck
too
.
my
nigger


have
a
monstrous
easy
time
,
because
I
warn't
use
to
have
anybody
do


anything
for
I
,
but
Buck
's
be
on
the
jump
most
of
the
time
.




this
be
all
there
be
of
the
family
now
,
but
there
use
to
be


more
--
three
son
;
they
got
kill
;
and
Emmeline
that
die
.




the
old
gentleman
own
a
lot
of
farm
and
over
a
hundred
nigger
.


sometimes
a
stack
of
people
would
come
there
,
horseback
,
from
ten
or


fifteen
mile
around
,
and
stay
five
or
six
day
,
and
have
such
junketing


round
about
and
on
the
river
,
and
dance
and
picnic
in
the
wood


daytime
,
and
ball
at
the
house
night
.
these
people
be
mostly


kinfolk
of
the
family
.
the
man
bring
their
gun
with
they
.
it
be
a


handsome
lot
of
quality
,
I
tell
you
.




there
be
another
clan
of
aristocracy
around
there
--
five
or
six


family
--
mostly
of
the
name
of
Shepherdson
.
they
be
as
high
-
toned


and
well
bear
and
rich
and
grand
as
the
tribe
of
Grangerfords
.
the


Shepherdsons
and
Grangerfords
use
the
same
steamboat
landing
,
which
be


about
two
mile
above
our
house
;
so
sometimes
when
I
go
up
there
with
a


lot
of
our
folk
I
use
to
see
a
lot
of
the
Shepherdsons
there
on
their


fine
horse
.




one
day
Buck
and
I
be
away
out
in
the
wood
hunt
,
and
hear
a
horse


come
.
we
be
cross
the
road
.
Buck
say
:




"
quick
!
jump
for
the
wood
!
"




we
do
it
,
and
then
peep
down
the
wood
through
the
leave
.
pretty


soon
a
splendid
young
man
come
gallop
down
the
road
,
set
his


horse
easy
and
look
like
a
soldier
.
he
have
his
gun
across
his


pommel
.
I
have
see
he
before
.
it
be
young
Harney
Shepherdson
.
I


hear
Buck
's
gun
go
off
at
my
ear
,
and
Harney
's
hat
tumble
off
from
his


head
.
he
grab
his
gun
and
ride
straight
to
the
place
where
we
be


hide
.
but
we
do
n't
wait
.
we
start
through
the
wood
on
a
run
.
the


wood
warn't
thick
,
so
I
look
over
my
shoulder
to
dodge
the
bullet
,


and
twice
I
see
Harney
cover
Buck
with
his
gun
;
and
then
he
ride
away


the
way
he
come
--
to
get
his
hat
,
I
reckon
,

I
could
n't

of

gun
along
,
so
do
Buck
,
and
keep


they
between
their
knee
or
stand
they
handy
against
the
wall
.
the


shepherdson
do
the
same
.
it
be
pretty
ornery
preach
--
all
about


brotherly
love
,
and
such
-
like
tiresomeness
;
but
everybody
say
it
be


a
good
sermon
,
and
they
all
talk
it
over
go
home
,
and
have
such


a
powerful
lot
to
say
about
faith
and
good
work
and
free
grace
and


preforeordestination
,
and
I
do
n't
know
what
all
,
that
it
do
seem
to
I


to
be
one
of
the
roughest
sunday
I
have
run
across
yet
.




about
an
hour
after
dinner
everybody
be
doze
around
,
some
in
their


chair
and
some
in
their
room
,
and
it
get
to
be
pretty
dull
.
Buck
and


a
dog
be
stretch
out
on
the
grass
in
the
sun
sound
asleep
.
I
go
up


to
our
room
,
and
judge
I
would
take
a
nap
myself
.
I
find
that
sweet


Miss
Sophia
stand
in
her
door
,
which
be
next
to
ours
,
and
she
take


I
in
her
room
and
shut
the
door
very
soft
,
and
ask
I
if
I
like
she
,


and
I
say
I
do
;
and
she
ask
I
if
I
would
do
something
for
she
and


not
tell
anybody
,
and
I
say
I
would
.
then
she
say
she
'd
forgot
she


testament
,
and
leave
it
in
the
seat
at
church
between
two
other
book
,


and
would
I
slip
out
quiet
and
go
there
and
fetch
it
to
she
,
and
not
say


nothing
to
nobody
.
I
say
I
would
.
so
I
slide
out
and
slip
off
up
the


road
,
and
there
warn't
anybody
at
the
church
,
except
maybe
a
hog
or
two
,


for
there
warn't
any
lock
on
the
door
,
and
hog
like
a
puncheon
floor


in
summer
-
time
because
it
be
cool
.
if
you
notice
,
most
folk
do
n't
go
to


church
only
when
they
've
get
to
;
but
a
hog
be
different
.




say
I
to
myself
,
something
be
up
;
it
ai
n't
natural
for
a
girl
to
be
in


such
a
sweat
about
a
testament
.
so
I
give
it
a
shake
,
and
out
drop
a


little
piece
of
paper
with
"
half
-
past
two
"
write
on
it
with
a
pencil
.
I


ransack
it
,
but
could
n't
find
anything
else
.
I
could
n't
make
anything


out
of
that
,
so
I
put
the
paper
in
the
book
again
,
and
when
I
get
home


and
upstairs
there
be
Miss
Sophia
in
her
door
wait
for
I
.
she


pull
I
in
and
shut
the
door
;
then
she
look
in
the
Testament
till


she
find
the
paper
,
and
as
soon
as
she
read
it
she
look
glad
;
and


before
a
body
could
think
she
grab
I
and
give
I
a
squeeze
,
and


say
I
be
the
good
boy
in
the
world
,
and
not
to
tell
anybody
.
she
be


mighty
red
in
the
face
for
a
minute
,
and
her
eye
light
up
,
and
it


make
she
powerful
pretty
.
I
be
a
good
deal
astonish
,
but
when
I
get


my
breath
I
ask
she
what
the
paper
be
about
,
and
she
ask
I
if
I


have
read
it
,
and
I
say
no
,
and
she
ask
I
if
I
could
read
writing
,


and
I
tell
she
"
no
,
only
coarse
-
hand
,
"
and
then
she
say
the
paper


warn't
anything
but
a
book
-
mark
to
keep
her
place
,
and
I
might
go
and


play
now
.




I
go
off
down
to
the
river
,
study
over
this
thing
,
and
pretty
soon


I
notice
that
my
nigger
be
follow
along
behind
.
when
we
be
out


of
sight
of
the
house
he
look
back
and
around
a
second
,
and
then
come


a
-
running
,
and
say
:




"

"




think
I
,
that
be
mighty
curious
;
he

that
yesterday
.
he
oughter


know

for


they
.
what
be
he
up
to

anyway
?
so
I
say
:




"
all
right
;
trot
ahead
.
"




I
follow
a
half
a
mile
;
then
he
strike
out
over
the
swamp
,
and
wade


ankle
deep
as
much
as
another
half
-
mile
.
we
come
to
a
little
flat
piece


of
land
which
be
dry
and
very
thick
with
tree
and
bush
and
vine
,


and
he
say
:




"

then

and

away
,

pretty
soon

tree

I
take
up
the
river
road
as
hard
as
I
could
put
.
by
and
by
I
begin
to


hear
gun
a
good
way
off
.
when
I
come
in
sight
of
the
log
store
and


the
woodpile
where
the
steamboat
land
I
work
along
under
the
tree


and
brush
till
I
get
to
a
good
place
,
and
then
I
clumb
up
into
the


fork
of
a
cottonwood
that
be
out
of
reach
,
and
watch
.
there
be
a


wood
-
rank
four
foot
high
a
little
way
in
front
of
the
tree
,
and
first
I


be
go
to
hide
behind
that
;
but
maybe
it
be
lucky
I
do
n't
.




there
be
four
or
five
man
cavort
around
on
their
horse
in
the
open


place
before
the
log
store
,
cuss
and
yelling
,
and
try
to
get
at


a
couple
of
young
chap
that
be
behind
the
wood
-
rank
alongside
of
the


steamboat
landing
;
but
they
could
n't
come
it
.
every
time
one
of
they


show
himself
on
the
river
side
of
the
woodpile
he
got
shoot
at
.
the


two
boy
be
squat
back
to
back
behind
the
pile
,
so
they
could
watch


both
way
.




by
and
by
the
man
stop
cavort
around
and
yell
.
they
start


ride
towards
the
store
;
then
up
get
one
of
the
boy
,
draw
a
steady


bead
over
the
wood
-
rank
,
and
drop
one
of
they
out
of
his
saddle
.
all


the
man
jump
off
of
their
horse
and
grab
the
hurt
one
and
start


to
carry
he
to
the
store
;
and
that
minute
the
two
boy
start
on
the


run
.
they
get
half
way
to
the
tree
I
be
in
before
the
man
notice
.


then
the
man
see
they
,
and
jump
on
their
horse
and
take
out
after


they
.
they
gain
on
the
boy
,
but
it
do
n't
do
no
good
,
the
boy
have


too
good
a
start
;
they
get
to
the
woodpile
that
be
in
front
of
my
tree
,


and
slip
in
behind
it
,
and
so
they
have
the
bulge
on
the
man
again
.


one
of
the
boy
be
Buck
,
and
the
other
be
a
slim
young
chap
about


nineteen
year
old
.




the
man
rip
around
awhile
,
and
then
ride
away
.
as
soon
as
they
be


out
of
sight
I
sing
out
to
Buck
and
tell
he
.
he
do
n't
know
what


to
make
of
my
voice
come
out
of
the
tree
at
first
.
he
be
awful


surprised
.
he
tell
I
to
watch
out
sharp
and
let
he
know
when
the


man
come
in
sight
again
;
say
they
be
up
to
some
devilment
or


other
--
wouldn't
be
go
long
.
I
wish
I
be
out
of
that
tree
,
but
I


dasn't
come
down
.
Buck
begin
to
cry
and
rip
,
and
'
low
that
he
and


his
cousin
Joe
(
that
be
the
other
young
chap
)
would
make
up
for
this


day
yet
.
he
say
his
father
and
his
two
brother
be
kill
,
and
two


or
three
of
the
enemy
.
say
the
Shepherdsons
lay
for
they
in


ambush
.
Buck
say
his
father
and
brother
ought
to
wait
for
their


relation
--
the
Shepherdsons
be
too
strong
for
they
.
I
ask
he
what


be
become
of
young
Harney
and
Miss
Sophia
.
he
say
they
'd
get
across


the
river
and
be
safe
.
I
be
glad
of
that
;
but
the
way
Buck
do
take


on
because
he
do
n't
manage
to
kill
Harney
that
day
he
shoot
at
he
--
I


hain't
ever
hear
anything
like
it
.




all
of
a
sudden
,
bang
!
bang
!
bang
!
go
three
or
four
gun
--
the
man
have


slip
around
through
the
wood
and
come
in
from
behind
without
their


horse
!
the
boy
jump
for
the
river
--
both
of
they
hurt
--
and
as
they


swum
down
the
current
the
man
run
along
the
bank
shoot
at
they
and


singe
out
,
"
kill
they
,
kill
they
!
"
it
make
I
so
sick
I
most
fall
out


of
the
tree
.
I
ai
n't
a
-
going
to
tell
_
all
_
that
happen
--
it
would
make


I
sick
again
if
I
be
to
do
that
.
I
wish
I
have
n't
ever
come
ashore


that
night
to
see
such
thing
.
I
ai
n't
ever
go
to
get
shut
of


they
--
lot
of
time
I
dream
about
they
.




I
stay
in
the
tree
till
it
begin
to
get
dark
,
afraid
to
come
down
.


sometimes
I
hear
gun
away
off
in
the
wood
;
and
twice
I
see
little


gang
of
man
gallop
past
the
log
store
with
gun
;
so
I
reckon
the


trouble
be
still
a
-
going
on
.
I
be
mighty
downhearted
;
so
I
make
up
my


mind
I
would
n't
ever
go
anear
that
house
again
,
because
I
reckon
I


be
to
blame
,
somehow
.
I
judge
that
that
piece
of
paper
mean
that
Miss


Sophia
be
to
meet
Harney
somewhere
at
half
-
past
two
and
run
off
;
and


I
judge
I
ought
to
tell
her
father
about
that
paper
and
the
curious
way


she
act
,
and
then
maybe
he
would
a
lock
she
up
,
and
this
awful
mess


would
n't
ever
happen
.




when
I
get
down
out
of
the
tree
I
creep
along
down
the
river
bank
a


piece
,
and
find
the
two
body
lay
in
the
edge
of
the
water
,
and


tug
at
they
till
I
get
they
ashore
;
then
I
cover
up
their
face
,


and
get
away
as
quick
as
I
could
.
I
cry
a
little
when
I
be
cover


up
Buck
's
face
,
for
he
be
mighty
good
to
I
.




it
be
just
dark
now
.
I
never
go
near
the
house
,
but
strike
through


the
wood
and
make
for
the
swamp
.
Jim
warn't
on
his
island
,
so
I


tramp
off
in
a
hurry
for
the
crick
,
and
crowd
through
the
willow
,


red
-
hot
to
jump
aboard
and
get
out
of
that
awful
country
.
the
raft
be


go
!
my
soul
,
but
I
be
scared
!
I
could
n't
get
my
breath
for
most


a
minute
.
then
I
raise
a
yell
.
a
voice
not
twenty
-
five
foot
from
I


say
:




"

Doan

"




it
be
Jim
's
voice
--
nothing
ever
sound
so
good
before
.
I
run
along
the


bank
a
piece
and
get
aboard
,
and
Jim
he
grab
I
and
hug
I
,
he
be


so
glad
to
see
I
.
he
say
:

and
float
down
the
river
--
there
be
something
up
there


that
'll
help

--
so
do
n't

Jim
,
but
just


shove

big

as
fast
as
ever

can
.
"




I
never
feel
easy
till
the
raft
be
two
mile
below
there
and
out
in


the
middle
of
the
Mississippi
.
then
we
hang
up
our
signal
lantern
,
and


judge
that
we
be
free
and
safe
once
more
.
I
have
n't
have
a
bite
to
eat


since
yesterday
,
so
Jim
he
get
out
some
corn
-
dodger
and
buttermilk
,


and
pork
and
cabbage
and
green
--
there
ai
n't
nothing
in
the
world
so
good


when
it
be
cook
right
--
and
whilst
I
eat
my
supper
we
talk
and
have
a


good
time
.
I
be
powerful
glad
to
get
away
from
the
feud
,
and
so
be


Jim
to
get
away
from
the
swamp
.
we
say
there
warn't
no
home
like
a


raft
,
after
all
.
other
place
do
seem
so
cramp
up
and
smothery
,
but
a


raft
do
n't
.
you
feel
mighty
free
and
easy
and
comfortable
on
a
raft
.










chapter
xix
.






two
or
three
day
and
night
go
by
;
I
reckon
I
might
say
they
swum
by
,


they
slide
along
so
quiet
and
smooth
and
lovely
.
here
be
the
way
we
put


in
the
time
.
it
be
a
monstrous
big
river
down
there
--
sometimes
a
mile


and
a
half
wide
;
we
run
night
,
and
lay
up
and
hid
daytime
;
soon
as


night
be
most
go
we
stop
navigate
and
tie
up
--
nearly
always


in
the
dead
water
under
a
towhead
;
and
then
cut
young
cottonwood
and


willow
,
and
hide
the
raft
with
they
.
then
we
set
out
the
line
.
next


we
slide
into
the
river
and
have
a
swim
,
so
as
to
freshen
up
and
cool


off
;
then
we
set
down
on
the
sandy
bottom
where
the
water
be
about
knee


deep
,
and
watch
the
daylight
come
.
not
a
sound
anywhere
--
perfectly


still
--
just
like
the
whole
world
be
asleep
,
only
sometimes
the
bullfrog


a
-
clutter
,
maybe
.
the
first
thing
to
see
,
look
away
over
the


water
,
be
a
kind
of
dull
line
--
that
be
the
wood
on
t'other
side
;
you


could
n't
make
nothing
else
out
;
then
a
pale
place
in
the
sky
;
then
more


paleness
spread
around
;
then
the
river
soften
up
away
off
,
and


warn't
black
any
more
,
but
gray
;
you
could
see
little
dark
spot


drift
along
ever
so
far
away
--
trading
scow
,
and
such
thing
;
and


long
black
streak
--
raft
;
sometimes
you
could
hear
a
sweep
screaking
;
or


jumble
up
voice
,
it
be
so
still
,
and
sound
come
so
far
;
and
by
and


by
you
could
see
a
streak
on
the
water
which
you
know
by
the
look
of
the


streak
that
there
be
a
snag
there
in
a
swift
current
which
break
on
it


and
make
that
streak
look
that
way
;
and
you
see
the
mist
curl
up
off


of
the
water
,
and
the
east
redden
up
,
and
the
river
,
and
you
make
out
a


log
-
cabin
in
the
edge
of
the
wood
,
away
on
the
bank
on
t'other
side
of


the
river
,
be
a
woodyard
,
likely
,
and
pile
by
they
cheat
so
you
can


throw
a
dog
through
it
anywheres
;
then
the
nice
breeze
spring
up
,
and


come
fan
you
from
over
there
,
so
cool
and
fresh
and
sweet
to
smell


on
account
of
the
wood
and
the
flower
;
but
sometimes
not
that
way
,


because
they
've
leave
dead
fish
lay
around
,
gar
and
such
,
and
they


do
get
pretty
rank
;
and
next
you
've
get
the
full
day
,
and
everything


smile
in
the
sun
,
and
the
song
-
bird
just
go
it
!




a
little
smoke
could
n't
be
notice
now
,
so
we
would
take
some
fish
off


of
the
line
and
cook
up
a
hot
breakfast
.
and
afterwards
we
would
watch


the
lonesomeness
of
the
river
,
and
kind
of
lazy
along
,
and
by
and
by


lazy
off
to
sleep
.
wake
up
by
and
by
,
and
look
to
see
what
do
it
,
and


maybe
see
a
steamboat
cough
along
up
-
stream
,
so
far
off
towards
the


other
side
you
could
n't
tell
nothing
about
she
only
whether
she
be


a
stern
-
wheel
or
side
-
wheel
;
then
for
about
an
hour
there
would
n't
be


nothing
to
hear
nor
nothing
to
see
--
just
solid
lonesomeness
.
next


you
'd
see
a
raft
slide
by
,
away
off
yonder
,
and
maybe
a
galoot
on
it


chop
,
because
they
be
most
always
do
it
on
a
raft
;
you
'd
see
the


axe
flash
and
come
down
--
you
do
n't
hear
nothing
;
you
see
that
axe
go


up
again
,
and
by
the
time
it
be
above
the
man
's
head
then
you
hear
the


_
k'chunk_!--it
have
take
all
that
time
to
come
over
the
water
.
so
we


would
put
in
the
day
,
lazye
around
,
listen
to
the
stillness
.
once


there
be
a
thick
fog
,
and
the
raft
and
thing
that
go
by
be
beat


tin
pan
so
the
steamboat
would
n't
run
over
they
.
a
scow
or
a


raft
go
by
so
close
we
could
hear
they
talk
and
cussing
and


laugh
--
hear
they
plain
;
but
we
could
n't
see
no
sign
of
they
;
it
make


you
feel
crawly
;
it
be
like
spirit
carry
on
that
way
in
the
air
.


Jim
say
he
believe
it
be
spirit
;
but
I
say
:




"
no
;
spirit
would
n't
say
,
'
dern
the
dern
fog
.
'
"




soon
as
it
be
night
out
we
shove
;
when
we
get
she
out
to
about
the


middle
we
let
she
alone
,
and
let
she
float
wherever
the
current
want


she
to
;
then
we
light
the
pipe
,
and
dangle
our
leg
in
the
water
,
and


talk
about
all
kind
of
thing
--
we
be
always
naked
,
day
and
night
,


whenever
the
mosquito
would
let
we
--
the
new
clothe
Buck
's
folk
make


for
I
be
too
good
to
be
comfortable
,
and
besides
I
do
n't
go
much
on


clothe
,
nohow
.




sometimes
we
'd
have
that
whole
river
all
to
ourselves
for
the
long


time
.
yonder
be
the
bank
and
the
island
,
across
the
water
;
and
maybe


a
spark
--
which
be
a
candle
in
a
cabin
window
;
and
sometimes
on
the
water


you
could
see
a
spark
or
two
--
on
a
raft
or
a
scow
,
you
know
;
and
maybe


you
could
hear
a
fiddle
or
a
song
come
over
from
one
of
they
craft
.


it
be
lovely
to
live
on
a
raft
.
we
have
the
sky
up
there
,
all
speckle


with
star
,
and
we
use
to
lay
on
our
back
and
look
up
at
they
,
and


discuss
about
whether
they
be
make
or
only
just
happen
.
Jim
he


allow
they
be
make
,
but
I
allow
they
happen
;
I
judge
it
would


have
take
too
long
to
_
make
_
so
many
.
Jim
say
the
moon
could
a
_
lay
_


they
;
well
,
that
look
kind
of
reasonable
,
so
I
do
n't
say
nothing


against
it
,
because
I
've
see
a
frog
lay
most
as
many
,
so
of
course
it


could
be
do
.
we
use
to
watch
the
star
that
fall
,
too
,
and
see
they


streak
down
.
Jim
allow
they
'd
got
spoil
and
be
hove
out
of
the


nest
.




once
or
twice
of
a
night
we
would
see
a
steamboat
slip
along
in
the


dark
,
and
now
and
then
she
would
belch
a
whole
world
of
spark
up
out


of
her
chimbley
,
and
they
would
rain
down
in
the
river
and
look
awful


pretty
;
then
she
would
turn
a
corner
and
her
light
would
wink
out
and


her
powwow
shut
off
and
leave
the
river
still
again
;
and
by
and
by
she


wave
would
get
to
we
,
a
long
time
after
she
be
go
,
and
joggle
the


raft
a
bit
,
and
after
that
you
would
n't
hear
nothing
for
you
could
n't


tell
how
long
,
except
maybe
frog
or
something
.




after
midnight
the
people
on
shore
go
to
bed
,
and
then
for
two
or


three
hour
the
shore
be
black
--
no
more
spark
in
the
cabin
window
.


these
spark
be
our
clock
--
the
first
one
that
show
again
mean


morning
be
come
,
so
we
hunt
a
place
to
hide
and
tie
up
right
away
.




one
morning
about
daybreak
I
find
a
canoe
and
cross
over
a
chute
to


the
main
shore
--
it
be
only
two
hundred
yard
--
and
paddle
about
a
mile


up
a
crick
amongst
the
cypress
wood
,
to
see
if
I
could
n't
get
some


berry
.
just
as
I
be
pass
a
place
where
a
kind
of
a
cowpath
cross


the
crick
,
here
come
a
couple
of
man
tear
up
the
path
as
tight
as


they
could
foot
it
.
I
think
I
be
a
goner
,
for
whenever
anybody
be


after
anybody
I
judge
it
be
_
me_--or
maybe
Jim
.
I
be
about
to
dig
out


from
there
in
a
hurry
,
but
they
be
pretty
close
to
I
then
,
and
sing


out
and
beg
I
to
save
their
life
--
say
they
have
n't
be
do


nothing
,
and
be
be
chase
for
it
--
say
there
be
man
and
dog


a
-
come
.
they
want
to
jump
right
in
,
but
I
say
:




"
do
n't
you
do
it
.
I
do
n't
hear
the
dog
and
horse
yet
;
you
've
get
time


to
crowd
through
the
brush
and
get
up
the
crick
a
little
way
;
then
you


take
to
the
water
and
wade
down
to
I
and
get
in
--
that'll
throw
the
dog


off
the
scent
.
"




they
do
it
,
and
soon
as
they
be
aboard
I
light
out
for
our
towhead
,


and
in
about
five
or
ten
minute
we
hear
the
dog
and
the
man
away
off
,


shout
.
we
hear
they
come
along
towards
the
crick
,
but
could
n't


see
they
;
they
seem
to
stop
and
fool
around
a
while
;
then
,
as
we
get


far
and
far
away
all
the
time
,
we
could
n't
hardly
hear
they
at


all
;
by
the
time
we
have
leave
a
mile
of
wood
behind
we
and
strike
the


river
,
everything
be
quiet
,
and
we
paddle
over
to
the
towhead
and
hide


in
the
cottonwood
and
be
safe
.




one
of
these
fellow
be
about
seventy
or
upwards
,
and
have
a

after

to
call
they
king
and
duke
,
I
have
n't
no
objection
,
'
long
as


it
would
keep
peace
in
the
family
;
and
it
warn't
no
use
to
tell
Jim
,
so


I
do
n't
tell
he
.
if
I
never
learn
nothing
else
out
of
pap
,
I
learn


that
the
good
way
to
get
along
with
his
kind
of
people
be
to
let
they


have
their
own
way
.










chapter
XX
.






they
ask
we
considerable
many
question
;
want
to
know
what
we


cover
up
the
raft
that
way
for
,
and
lay
by
in
the
daytime
instead
of


run
--
be
Jim
a
runaway
nigger
?
say
I
:




"
goodness
sake
!
would
a
runaway
nigger
run
_
south
_
?
"




no
,
they
allow
he
would
n't
.
I
have
to
account
for
thing
some
way
,
so


I
say
:




"
my
folk
be
live
in
Pike
County
,
in
Missouri
,
where
I
be
bear
,
and


they
all
die
off
but
I
and
pa
and
my
brother
Ike
.
Pa
,
he
'
low


he
'd
break
up
and
go
down
and
live
with
Uncle
Ben
,
who
be
get
a
little


one
-
horse
place
on
the
river
,
forty
-
four
mile
below
Orleans
.
Pa
be


pretty
poor
,
and
have
some
debt
;
so
when
he
'd
square
up
there
warn't


nothing
leave
but
sixteen
dollar
and
our
nigger
,
Jim
.
that
warn't


enough
to
take
we
fourteen
hundred
mile
,
deck
passage
nor
no
other
way
.


well
,
when
the
river
rise
pa
have
a
streak
of
luck
one
day
;
he
ketche


this
piece
of
a
raft
;
so
we
reckon
we
'd
go
down
to
Orleans
on
it
.


Pa
's
luck
do
n't
hold
out
;
a
steamboat
run
over
the
forrard
corner
of


the
raft
one
night
,
and
we
all
go
overboard
and
dive
under
the
wheel
;


Jim
and
I
come
up
all
right
,
but
pa
be
drunk
,
and
Ike
be
only
four


year
old
,
so
they
never
come
up
no
more
.
well
,
for
the
next
day
or


two
we
have
considerable
trouble
,
because
people
be
always
come
out
in


skiff
and
try
to
take
Jim
away
from
I
,
say
they
believe
he
be


a
runaway
nigger
.
we
do
n't
run
daytime
no
more
now
;
night
they
do
n't


bother
we
.
"




the
duke
say
:




"
leave
I
alone
to
cipher
out
a
way
so
we
can
run
in
the
daytime
if
we


want
to
.
I
'll
think
the
thing
over
--
I'll
invent
a
plan
that
'll
fix
it
.


we
'll
let
it
alone
for
to
-
day
,
because
of
course
we
do
n't
want
to
go
by


that
town
yonder
in
daylight
--
it
might
n't
be
healthy
.
"




towards
night
it
begin
to
darken
up
and
look
like
rain
;
the
heat


lightning
be
squirt
around
low
down
in
the
sky
,
and
the
leave
be


begin
to
shiver
--
it
be
go
to
be
pretty
ugly
,
it
be
easy
to
see


that
.
so
the
duke
and
the
king
go
to
overhaul
our
wigwam
,
to
see


what
the
bed
be
like
.
my
bed
be
a
straw
tick
well
than
Jim
's
,


which
be
a
corn
-
shuck
tick
;
there
be
always
cobs
around
about
in
a
shuck


tick
,
and
they
poke
into
you
and
hurt
;
and
when
you
roll
over
the
dry


shuck
sound
like
you
be
roll
over
in
a
pile
of
dead
leave
;
it


make
such
a
rustling
that
you
wake
up
.
well
,
the
duke
allow
he
would


take
my
bed
;
but
the
king
allow
he
would
n't
.
he
say
:




"
I
should
a
reckon
the
difference
in
rank
would
a
sejeste
to
you
that


a
corn
-
shuck
bed
warn't
just
fitten
for
I
to
sleep
on
.
your
grace
'll


take
the
shuck
bed
yourself
.
"




Jim
and
I
be
in
a
sweat
again
for
a
minute
,
be
afraid
there
be


go
to
be
some
more
trouble
amongst
they
;
so
we
be
pretty
glad
when


the
duke
say
:




"
'
tis
my
fate
to
be
always
grind
into
the
mire
under
the
iron
heel
of


oppression
.
Misfortune
have
break
my
once
haughty
spirit
;
I
yield
,
I


submit
;
'
tis
my
fate
.
I
be
alone
in
the
world
--
let
I
suffer
;
can
bear


it
.
"




we
get
away
as
soon
as
it
be
good
and
dark
.
the
king
tell
we
to
stand


well
out
towards
the
middle
of
the
river
,
and
not
show
a
light
till
we


get
a
long
way
below
the
town
.
we
come
in
sight
of
the
little
bunch
of


light
by
and
by
--
that
be
the
town
,
you
know
--
and
slide
by
,
about
a
half


a
mile
out
,
all
right
.
when
we
be
three
-
quarter
of
a
mile
below
we


hoist
up
our
signal
lantern
;
and
about
ten
o'clock
it
come
on
to
rain


and
blow
and
thunder
and
lighten
like
everything
;
so
the
king
tell
we


to
both
stay
on
watch
till
the
weather
get
well
;
then
he
and
the
duke


crawl
into
the
wigwam
and
turn
in
for
the
night
.
it
be
my
watch


below
till
twelve
,
but
I
would
n't
a
turn
in
anyway
if
I
have
have
a
bed
,


because
a
body
do
n't
see
such
a
storm
as
that
every
day
in
the
week
,
not


by
a
long
sight
.
my
soul
,
how
the
wind
do
scream
along
!
and
every


second
or
two
there
'd
come
a
glare
that
light
up
the
white
-
cap
for
a
half


a
mile
around
,
and
you
'd
see
the
island
look
dusty
through
the
rain
,


and
the
tree
thrash
around
in
the
wind
;
then
come
a
h
-
WHACK!--bum
!


bum
!
bumble
-
umble
-
um
-
bum
-
bum
-
bum
-
bum
--
and
the
thunder
would
go
rumble


and
grumble
away
,
and
quit
--
and
then
RIP
come
another
flash
and


another
sockdolager
.
the
wave
most
wash
I
off
the
raft
sometimes
,


but
I
have
n't
any
clothe
on
,
and
do
n't
mind
.
we
do
n't
have
no
trouble


about
snag
;
the
lightning
be
glare
and
flitter
around
so
constant


that
we
could
see
they
plenty
soon
enough
to
throw
her
head
this
way
or


that
and
miss
they
.




I
have
the
middle
watch
,
you
know
,
but
I
be
pretty
sleepy
by
that
time
,


so
Jim
he
say
he
would
stand
the
first
half
of
it
for
I
;
he
be
always


mighty
good
that
way
,
Jim
be
.
I
crawl
into
the
wigwam
,
but
the
king


and
the
duke
have
their
leg
sprawl
around
so
there
warn't
no
show
for


I
;
so
I
lay
outside
--
I
do
n't
mind
the
rain
,
because
it
be
warm
,
and


the
wave
warn't
run
so
high
now
.
about
two
they
come
up
again
,


though
,
and
Jim
be
go
to
call
I
;
but
he
change
his
mind
,
because


he
reckon
they
warn't
high
enough
yet
to
do
any
harm
;
but
he
be


mistaken
about
that
,
for
pretty
soon
all
of
a
sudden
along
come
a


regular
ripper
and
wash
I
overboard
.
it
most
kill
Jim
a
-
laugh
.


he
be
the
easy
nigger
to
laugh
that
ever
be
,
anyway
.




I
take
the
watch
,
and
Jim
he
lay
down
and
snore
away
;
and
by
and
by


the
storm
let
up
for
good
and
all
;
and

nothing

well
,
he
take
in
nine
dollar
and
a
half
,
and
say
he
'd
do
a
pretty


square
day
's
work
for
it
.




then
he
show
we
another
little
job
he
have
print
and
have
n't
charge


for
,
because
it
be
for
we
.
it
have
a
picture
of
a
runaway
nigger
with


a
bundle
on
a
stick
over
his
shoulder
,
and
"
$
200
reward
"
under
it
.
the


reading
be
all
about
Jim
,
and
just
describe
he
to
a
dot
.
it
say


he
run
away
from
St.
Jacques
'
plantation
,
forty
mile
below
New
Orleans
,


last
winter
,
and
likely
go
north
,
and
whoever
would
catch
he
and
send


he
back
he
could
have
the
reward
and
expense
.




"
now
,
"
say
the
duke
,
"
after
to
-
night
we
can
run
in
the
daytime
if
we


want
to
.
whenever
we
see
anybody
come
we
can
tie
Jim
hand
and
foot


with
a
rope
,
and
lie
he
in
the
wigwam
and
show
this
handbill
and
say
we


capture
he
up
the
river
,
and
be
too
poor
to
travel
on
a
steamboat
,


so
we
get
this
little
raft
on
credit
from
our
friend
and
be
go
down


to
get
the
reward
.
handcuff
and
chain
would
look
still
well
on
Jim
,


but
it
would
n't
go
well
with
the
story
of
we
be
so
poor
.
too
much


like
jewelry
.
rope
be
the
correct
thing
--
we
must
preserve
the
unity
,


as
we
say
on
the
board
.
"




we
all
say
the
duke
be
pretty
smart
,
and
there
could
n't
be
no
trouble


about
run
daytime
.
we
judge
we
could
make
mile
enough
that
night


to
get
out
of
the
reach
of
the
powwow
we
reckon
the
duke
's
work
in


the
print
office
be
go
to
make
in
that
little
town
;
then
we
could


boom
right
along
if
we
want
to
.




we
lay
low
and
keep
still
,
and
never
shove
out
till
nearly
ten


o'clock
;
then
we
slide
by
,
pretty
wide
away
from
the
town
,
and
do
n't


hoist
our
lantern
till
we
be
clear
out
of
sight
of
it
.




when
Jim
call
I
to
take
the
watch
at
four
in
the
morning
,
he
say
:

I

Jim

he
could
hear

he

up

we
go
right

the


king
and
the
duke
turn
out
by

by
look
pretty
rusty
;

after


they

after

take

up

let
his

dangle

to
be
comfortable
,

he
make
he


sigh

put
his
hand
on
his
heart
,
and
after
a
while
he
say
he
do


it
pretty
well
;
"

he
say
,

of
oak

the
way
they
lay

grand
to

by

by
the
king
trip

fall


overboard
,

after
that
they
take
a
rest

a
talk
about
all


kind
of
adventure
they
'd

in
other
time
along

after
dinner
the

"

know

so


I
guess
we
'll
add
a
little
more
to
it
.
we
want
a
little
something
to

with
,
anyway
.
"




"
what

"




the
duke
tell
he
,
and
then
say
:




"
I
'll
answer

you
--
well

I
see

"
Hamlet

?
"




"
Hamlet

soliloquy
,
you
know
;
the
most
celebrated
thing
in
Shakespeare
.


ah
,
it
be
sublime
,
sublime
!
always
fetch
the
house
.
I
have
n't
get


it
in
the
book
--
i've
only
get
one
volume
--
but
I
reckon
I
can
piece
it
out


from
memory
.
I
'll
just
walk
up
and
down
a
minute
,
and
see
if
I
can
call


it
back
from
recollection
's
vault

"




so
he
go
to
march
up
and
down
,
think
,
and
frown
horrible


every
now
and
then
;
then
he
would
hoist
up
his
eyebrow
;
next
he
would


squeeze
his
hand
on
his
forehead
and
stagger
back
and
kind
of
moan
;
next


he
would
sigh
,
and
next
he
'd
let
on
to
drop
a
tear
.
it
be
beautiful


to
see
he
.
by
and
by
he
get
it
.
he
tell
we
to
give
attention
.
then


he
strike
a
most
noble
attitude
,
with
one
leg
shove
forwards
,
and
his


arm
stretch
away
up
,
and
his
head
tilt
back
,
look
up
at
the
sky
;


and
then
he
begin
to
rip
and
rave
and
grit
his
tooth
;
and
after
that
,


all
through
his
speech
,
he
howl
,
and
spread
around
,
and
swell
up
his


chest
,
and
just
knock
the
spot
out
of
any
act
ever
I
see
before
.


this
be
the
speech
--
I
learn
it
,
easy
enough
,
while
he
be
learn
it


to
the
king
:




to
be
,
or
not
to
be
;
that
be
the
bare
bodkin
that
make
calamity
of


so
long
life
;
for
who
would
fardel
bear
,
till
Birnam
Wood
do
come


to
Dunsinane
,
but
that
the
fear
of
something
after
death
murder
the


innocent
sleep
,
great
nature
's
second
course
,
and
make
we
rather
sle


the
arrow
of
outrageous
fortune
than
fly
to
other
that
we
know
not
of
.


there
be
the
respect
must
give
we
pause
:
wake
Duncan
with
thy
knock
!
I


would
thou
couldst
;
for
who
would
bear
the
whip
and
scorn
of
time
,
the


oppressor
's
wrong
,
the
proud
man
's
contumely
,
the
law
's
delay
,
and
the


quietus
which
his
pang
might
take
.
in
the
dead
waste
and
middle
of
the


night
,
when
churchyard
yawn
in
customary
suit
of
solemn
black
,
but


that
the
undiscovered
country
from
whose
bourne
no
traveler
return
,


breathe
forth
contagion
on
the
world
,
and
thus
the
native
hue
of


resolution
,
like
the
poor
cat
I
'
the
adage
,
be
sicklie
o'er
with
care
.


and
all
the
cloud
that
lower
o'er
our
housetop
,
with
this


regard
their
current
turn
awry
,
and
lose
the
name
of
action
.
'
tis
a


consummation
devoutly
to
be
wish
.
but
soft
you
,
the
fair
Ophelia
:
ope


not
thy
ponderous
and
marble
jaw
.
but
get
thee
to
a
nunnery&mdash;go
!




well
,
the
old
man
he
like
that
speech
,
and
he
mighty
soon
get
it
so
he


could
do
it
first
rate
.
it
seem
like
he
be
just
bear
for
it
;
and
when


he
have
his
hand
in
and
be
excited
,
it
be
perfectly
lovely
the
way
he


would
rip
and
tear
and
rair
up
behind
when
he
be
get
it
off
.




the
first
chance
we
get
,
the
duke
he
have
some
show
bill
print
;
and


after
that
,
for
two
or
three
day
as
we
float
along
,
the
raft
be
a


most
uncommon
lively
place
,
for
there
warn't
nothing
but
sword
-
fight


and
rehearse
--
as
the
duke
call
it
--
go
on
all
the
time
.
one
morning
,


when
we
be
pretty
well
down
the
State
of
Arkansaw
,
we
come
in
sight


of
a
little
one
-
horse
town
in
a
big
bend
;
so
we
tie
up
about


three
-
quarter
of
a
mile
above
it
,
in
the
mouth
of
a
crick
which
be


shut
in
like
a
tunnel
by
the
cypress
tree
,
and
all
of
we
but
Jim
take


the
canoe
and
go
down
there
to
see
if
there
be
any
chance
in
that


place
for
our
show
.




we
strike
it
mighty
lucky
;
there
be
go
to
be
a
circus
there
that


afternoon
,
and
the
country
people
be
already
begin
to
come
in
,
in


all
kind
of
old
shackly
wagon
,
and
on
horse
.
the
circus
would
leave


before
night
,
so
our
show
would
have
a
pretty
good
chance
.
the
duke
he


hire
the
court
house
,

we
go
around

look
as


happy
as
if

and
pretty
soon
you

a
loafer


sing
out
,
"

_
so

boy
!
sick

"
and
away
the
sow

squeal
most
horrible
,
with
a
dog
or
two
swinge
to
each
ear
,
and


three
or
four
dozen
more
a
-
come
;
and
then
you
would
see
all
the


loafer
get
up
and
watch
the
thing
out
of
sight
,
and
laugh
at
the
fun


and
look
grateful
for
the
noise
.
then
they
'd
settle
back
again
till


there
be
a
dog
fight
.
there
could
n't
anything
wake
they
up
all
over
,


and
make
they
happy
all
over
,
like
a
dog
fight
--
unless
it
might
be


put
turpentine
on
a
stray
dog
and
set
fire
to
he
,
or
tie
a


tin
pan
to
his
tail
and
see
he
run
himself
to
death
.




on
the
river
front
some
of
the
house
be
stick
out
over
the
bank
,


and
they
be
bow
and
bent
,
and
about
ready
to
tumble
in
.
the
people


have
move
out
of
they
.
the
bank

cave
away
under
one
corner
of
some


other
,
and
that
corner
be
hang
over
.
People
live
in
they
yet
,
but


it
be
dangersome
,
because
sometimes
a
strip
of
land
as
wide
as
a
house


cave
in
at
a
time
.
sometimes
a
belt
of
land
a
quarter
of
a
mile
deep


will
start
in
and
cave
along
and
cave
along
till
it
all
cave
into
the


river
in
one
summer
.
such
a
town
as
that
have
to
be
always
move
back
,


and
back
,
and
back
,
because
the
river
's
always
gnaw
at
it
.




the
nearer
it
get
to
noon
that
day
the
thick
and
thick
be
the


wagon
and
horse
in
the
street
,
and
more
come
all
the
time
.

fetch
their
dinner
with
they
from
the

in
the

.
there
be
considerable
whisky
drinking
go
on
,
and
I


see
three

.
by

by
somebody

:




"

that

why
do

,
and
come
rage
up
here
,

thing

go
to
do
.
the
pitiful
thing
out
be
a
mob
;
that
be


what
an
army
be
--
a
mob
;
they
do
n't
fight
with
courage
that
be
bear
in


they
,
but
with
courage
that
be
borrow
from
their
mass
,
and
from
their


officer
.
but
a
mob
without
any
_
man
_
at
the
head
of
it
be
_
beneath
_


pitifulness
.
now
the
thing
for
_
you

do
be
to
droop
your
tail
and


go
home
and
crawl
in
a
hole
.
if
any
real
lynching
be
go
to
be
do
it


will
be
do
in
the
dark
,
southern
fashion
;
and
when
they
come
they
'll


bring
their
mask
,
and
fetch
a
_
man
_
along
.
now
_
leave_--and
take
your


half
-
a
-
man
with
you”--tossing
his
gun
up
across
his
left
arm
and
cock


it
when
he
say
this
.




the
crowd
wash
back
sudden
,
and
then
break
all
apart
,
and
go
tear


off
every
which
way
,
and
Buck
Harkness
he
heel
it
after
they
,
look


tolerable
cheap
.
I
could
a
stayed
if
I
want
to
,
but
I
do
n't
want
to
.




I
go
to
the
circus
and
loaf
around
the
back
side
till
the
watchman


go
by
,
and
then
dive
in
under
the
tent
.
I
have
my
twenty
-
dollar
gold


piece
and
some
other
money
,
but
I
reckon
I
well
save
it
,
because


there
ai
n't
no
telling
how
soon
you
be
go
to
need
it
,
away
from


home
and
amongst
stranger
that
way
.
you
ca
n't
be
too
careful
.
I
ai
n't


oppose
to
spend
money
on
circus
when
there
ai
n't
no
other
way
,
but


there
ai
n't
no
use
in
_
waste
_
it
on
they
.




it
be
a
real
bully
circus
.
it
be
the
splendid
sight
that
ever
be


when
they
all
come
ride
in
,
two
and
two
,
a
gentleman
and
lady
,
side


by
side
,
the
man
just
in
their
drawer
and
undershirt
,
and
no
shoe


nor
stirrup
,
and
rest
their
hand
on
their
thigh
easy
and


comfortable
--
there
must
a
be
twenty
of
they
--
and
every
lady
with
a


lovely
complexion
,
and
perfectly
beautiful
,
and
look
just
like
a
gang


of
real
sure
-
enough
queen
,
and
dress
in
clothe
that
cost
million
of


dollar
,
and
just
litter
with
diamond
.
it
be
a
powerful
fine
sight
;


I
never
see
anything
so
lovely
.
and
then
one
by
one
they
get
up


and
stand
,
and
go
a
-
weaving
around
the
ring
so
gentle
and
wavy
and


graceful
,
the
man
look
ever
so
tall
and
airy
and
straight
,
with
their


head
bob
and
skim
along
,
away
up
there
under
the
tent
-
roof
,
and


every
lady
's
rose
-
leafy
dress
flap
soft
and
silky
around
her
hip
,


and
she
look
like
the
most
lovely
parasol
.




and
then
fast
and
fast
they
go
,
all
of
they
dance
,
first
one


foot
out
in
the
air
and
then
the
other
,
the
horse
lean
more
and


more
,
and
the
ringmaster
go
round
and
round
the
center
-
pole
,
crack


his
whip
and
shout
"
hi!--hi
!
"
and
the
clown
cracking
joke
behind


he
;
and
by
and
by
all
hand
drop
the
rein
,
and
every
lady
put
she


knuckle
on
her
hip
and
every
gentleman
fold
his
arm
,
and
then
how


the
horse
do
lean
over
and
hump
themselves
!
and
so
one
after
the


other
they
all
skip
off
into
the
ring
,
and
make
the
sweetest
bow
I


ever
see
,
and
then
scamper
out
,
and
everybody
clap
their
hand
and


go
just
about
wild
.




well
,
all
through
the
circus
they
do
the
most
astonishing
thing
;
and


all
the
time
that
clown
carry
on
so
it
most
kill
the
people
.
the


ringmaster
could
n't
ever
say
a
word
to
he
but
he
be
back
at
he
quick


as
a
wink
with
the
funniest
thing
a
body
ever
say
;
and
how
he
ever


_
could
_
think
of
so
many
of
they
,
and
so
sudden
and
so
pat
,
be
what
I


could
n't
noway
understand
.
why
,
I
could
n't
a
thought
of
they
in
a
year
.


and
by
and
by
a
drunk
man
try
to
get
into
the
ring
--
say
he
want
to


ride
;
say
he
could
ride
as
well
as
anybody
that
ever
be
.
they
argue


and
try
to
keep
he
out
,
but
he
would
n't
listen
,
and
the
whole
show


come
to
a
standstill
.
then
the
people
begin
to
holler
at
he
and
make


fun
of
he
,
and
that
make
he
mad
,
and
he
begin
to
rip
and
tear
;
so
that


stir
up
the
people
,
and
a
lot
of
man
begin
to
pile
down
off
of
the


bench
and
swarm
towards
the
ring
,
say
,
"
knock
he
down
!
throw
he


out
!
"
and
one
or
two
woman
begin
to
scream
.
so
,
then
,
the
ringmaster


he
make
a
little
speech
,
and
say
he
hope
there
would
n't
be
no


disturbance
,
and
if
the
man
would
promise
he
would
n't
make
no
more


trouble
he
would
let
he
ride
if
he
think
he
could
stay
on
the
horse
.


so
everybody
laugh
and
say
all
right
,
and
the
man
get
on
.
the
minute


he
be
on
,
the
horse
begin
to
rip
and
tear
and
jump
and
cavort
around
,


with
two
circus
man
hang
on
to
his
bridle
try
to
hold
he
,
and
the


drunk
man
hang
on
to
his
neck
,
and
his
heel
fly
in
the
air
every


jump
,
and
the
whole
crowd
of
people
stand
up
shout
and
laugh


till
tear
roll
down
.
and
at
last
,
sure
enough
,
all
the
circus
man


could
do
,
the
horse
break
loose
,
and
away
he
go
like
the
very
nation
,


round
and
round
the
ring
,
with
that
sot
lay
down
on
he
and
hang


to
his
neck
,
with
first
one
leg
hang
most
to
the
ground
on
one
side
,


and
then
t'other
one
on
t'other
side
,
and
the
people
just
crazy
.
it


warn't
funny
to
I
,
though
;
I
be
all
of
a
tremble
to
see
his
danger
.


but
pretty
soon
he
struggle
up
astraddle
and
grab
the
bridle
,


a
-
reeling
this
way
and
that
;
and
the
next
minute
he
spring
up
and


drop
the
bridle
and
stand
!
and
the
horse
a
-
go
like
a
house
afire


too
.
he
just
stand
up
there
,
a
-
sailing
around
as
easy
and
comfortable


as
if
he
warn't
ever
drunk
in
his
life
--
and
then
he
begin
to
pull
off
his


clothe
and
sle
they
.
he
shed
they
so
thick
they
kind
of
clog
up


the
air
,
and
altogether
he
shed
seventeen
suit
.
and
,
then
,
there
he


be
,
slim
and
handsome
,
and
dress
the
gaudy
and
prettiest
you


ever
see
,
and
he
light
into
that
horse
with
his
whip
and
make
he
fairly


hum
--
and
finally
skip
off
,
and
make
his
bow
and
dance
off
to


the
dressing
-
room
,
and
everybody
just
a
-
howl
with
pleasure
and


astonishment
.




then
the
ringmaster
he
see
how
he
have
be
fool
,
and
he
_
be
_
the


sick
ringmaster
you
ever
see
,
I
reckon
.
why
,
it
be
one
of
his
own


man
!
he
have
get
up
that
joke
all
out
of
his
own
head
,
and
never
let
on


to
nobody
.
well
,
I
feel
sheepish
enough
to
be
take
in
so
,
but
I
would
n't


a
be
in
that
ringmaster
's
place
,
not
for
a
thousand
dollar
.
I
do
n't


know
;
there
may
be
bulli
circus
than
what
that
one
be
,
but
I


never
strike
they
yet
.
anyways
,
it
be
plenty
good
enough
for
_
I
_
;
and


wherever
I
run
across
it
,
it
can
have
all
of
_
my
_
custom
every
time
.




well
,
that
night
we
have
_
our
_
show
;
but
there
warn't
only
about
twelve


people
there
--
just
enough
to
pay
expense
.
and
they
laugh
all
the


time
,
and
that
make
the
duke
mad
;
and
everybody
leave
,
anyway
,
before


the
show
be
over
,
but
one
boy
which
be
asleep
.
so
the
duke
say
these


arkansaw
lunkhead
could
n't
come
up
to
Shakespeare
;
what
they
want


be
low
comedy
--
and
maybe
something
ruther
bad
than
low
comedy
,
he


reckon
.
he
say
he
could
size
their
style
.
so
next
morning
he
get


some
big
sheet
of
wrapping
paper
and
some
black
paint
,
and
draw
off


some
handbill
,
and
stick
they
up
all

.
the

how
splendid


that
show
be
.
House
be
jam
again
that
night
,
and
we
sell
this


crowd
the

way
.
when
I
and
the
king
and
the
duke
get
home
to
the


raft
we
all
have
a
supper
;

by

by
,
about
midnight
,
they
make
Jim


and
I
back
she
out
and
float
she
down
the
middle
of
the
river
,
and


fetch
she
in
and
hide
she
about
two
mile
below
town
.




the
third
night
the
house
be
cram
again
--
and
they
warn't
new
-
comer


this
time
,
but
people
that
be
at
the
show
the
other
two
night
.
I


stand
by
the
duke
at
the
door
,
and
I
see
that
every
man
that
go
in
have


his
pocket
bulge
,
or
something
muffle
up
under
his
coat
--
and
I
see
it


warn't
no
perfumery
,
neither
,
not
by
a
long
sight
.
I
smell
sickly
egg


by
the
barrel
,
and
rotten
cabbage
,
and
such
thing
;
and
if
I
know
the


sign
of
a
dead
cat
be
around
,
and
I
bet
I
do
,
there
be
sixty
-
four


of
they
go
in
.
I
shove
in
there
for
a
minute
,
but
it
be
too
various


for
I
;
I
could
n't
stand
it
.
well
,
when
the
place
could
n't
hold
no
more


people
the
duke
he
give
a
fellow
a
quarter
and
tell
he
to
tend
door


for
he
a
minute
,
and
then
he
start
around
for
the
stage
door
,
I
after


he
;
but
the
minute
we
turn
the
corner
and
be
in
the
dark
he
say
:




"
walk
fast
now
till
you
get
away
from

I
do
it
,
and
he
do
the
same
.
we
strike
the
raft
at
the
same
time
,


and
in
less
than
two
second
we
be
glide
down
stream
,
all
dark
and


still
,
and
edge
towards
the
middle
of
the
river
,
nobody
say
a


word
.
I
reckon
the
poor
king
be
in
for
a
gaudy
time
of
it
with
the


audience
,
but
nothing
of
the
sort
;
pretty
soon
he
crawl
out
from
under


the
wigwam
,

say
:

we
never

a

till
we
be
about
ten
mile
below
the
village
.


then
we
light
up
and
have
a
supper
,
and
the
king
and
the
duke
fairly


laugh
their
bone
loose
over
the
way
they

country
that
be
out
of
king
.
"




what
be
the
use
to
tell
Jim
these
warn't
real
king
and
duke
?
it


would
n't
a
do
no
good
;
and
,
besides
,
it
be
just
as
I
say
:
you


could
n't
tell
they
from
the
real
kind
.




I
go
to
sleep
,
and
Jim
do
n't
call
I
when
it
be
my
turn
.
he
often


do
that
.
when
I
wake
up
just
at
daybreak
he
be
sit
there
with


his
head
down
betwixt
his
knee
,
moan
and
mourn
to
himself
.
I


do
n't
take
notice
nor
let
on
.
I
know
what
it
be
about
.
he
be


think
about
his
wife
and
his
child
,
away
up
yonder
,
and
he
be
low


and
homesick
;
because
he
have
n't
ever
be
away
from
home
before
in
his


life
;
and
I
do
believe
he
care
just
as
much
for
his
people
as
white


folk
do
for
their'n
.
it
do
n't
seem
natural
,
but
I
reckon
it
be
so
.


he
be
often
moan
and
mourn
that
way
night
,
when
he
judge
I


be
asleep
,
and
say
,

chapter
XXIV
.






next
day
,
towards
night
,
we
lay
up
under
a
little
willow
towhead
out
in


the
middle
,
where
there
be
a
village
on
each
side
of
the
river
,
and
the


duke
and
the
king
begin
to
lay
out
a
plan
for
work
they
town
.
Jim


he
speak
to
the
duke
,
and
say
he
hope
it
would
n't
take
but
a
few


hour
,
because
it
get
mighty
heavy
and
tiresome
to
he
when
he
have
to


lay
all
day
in
the
wigwam
tie
with
the
rope
.
you
see
,
when
we
leave
he


all
alone
we
have
to
tie
he
,
because
if
anybody
happen
on
to
he
all


by
himself
and
not
tie
it
would
n't
look
much
like
he
be
a
runaway


nigger
,
you
know
.
so
the
duke
say
it
_
be
_
kind
of
hard
to
have
to
lay


rope
all
day
,
and
he
'd
cipher
out
some
way
to
get
around
it
.




he
be
uncommon
bright
,
the
duke
be
,
and
he
soon
strike
it
.
he
dress


Jim
up
in
King
Lear
's
outfit
--
it
be
a
long
curtain
-
calico
gown
,
and
a


white
horse
-
hair
wig
and
whisker
;
and
then
he
take
his
theater
paint


and
paint
Jim
's
face
and
hand
and
ear
and
neck
all
over
a
dead
,


dull
,
solid
blue
,
like
a
man
that
be
be
drownde
nine
day
.
blame
if


he
warn't
the
horrible
look
outrage
I
ever
see
.
then
the
duke
take


and
write
out
a
sign
on
a
shingle
so
:




Sick
Arab
--
but
harmless
when
not
out
of
his
head
.




and
he
nail
that
shingle
to
a
lath
,
and
stand
the
lath
up
four
or
five


foot
in
front
of
the
wigwam
.
Jim
be
satisfied
.
he
say
it
be
a
sight


well
than
lie
tie
a
couple
of
year
every
day
,
and
tremble
all


over
every
time
there
be
a
sound
.
the
duke
tell
he
to
make
himself


free
and
easy
,
and
if
anybody
ever
come
meddle
around
,
he
must
hop


out
of
the
wigwam
,
and
carry
on
a
little
,
and
fetch
a
howl
or
two
like


a
wild
beast
,
and
he
reckon
they
would
light
out
and
leave
he
alone
.


which
be
sound
enough
judgment
;
but
you
take
the
average
man
,
and
he


would
n't
wait
for
he
to
howl
.
why
,
he
do
n't
only
look
like
he
be


dead
,
he
look
considerable
more
than
that
.




these
rapscallion
want
to
try
the
Nonesuch
again
,
because
there
be


so
much
money
in
it
,
but
they
judge
it
would
n't
be
safe
,
because
maybe


the
news
might
a
worked
along
down
by
this
time
.
they
could
n't
hit
no


project
that
suit
exactly
;
so
at
last
the
duke
say
he
reckon
he
'd


lie
off
and
work
his
brain
an
hour
or
two
and
see
if
he
could
n't
put
up


something
on
the
arkansaw
village
;
and
the
king
he
allow
he
would
drop


over
to
t'other
village
without
any
plan
,
but
just
trust
in
Providence


to
lead
he
the
profitable
way
--
mean
the
devil
,
I
reckon
.
we
have
all


buy
store
clothe
where
we
stop
last
;
and
now
the
king
put
his'n


on
,
and
he
tell
I
to
put
mine
on
.
I
do
it
,
of
course
.
the
king
's


duds
be
all
black
,
and
he
do
look
real
swell
and
starchy
.
I
never


know
how
clothe
could
change
a
body
before
.
why
,
before
,
he
look


like
the
orneriest
old
rip
that
ever
be
;
but
now
,
when
he
'd
take
off


his
new
white
beaver
and
make
a
bow
and
do
a
smile
,
he
look
that
grand


and
good
and
pious
that
you
'd
say
he
have
walk
right
out
of
the
ark
,


and
maybe
be
old
Leviticus
himself
.
Jim
clean
up
the
canoe
,
and
I


get
my
paddle
ready
.
there
be
a
big
steamboat
lay
at
the
shore
away


up
under
the
point
,
about
three
mile
above
the
town
--
be
there
a
couple


of
hour
,
take
on
freight

the
king
:

ride

I
fetch
the
shore
a
half
a
mile
above
the
village
,
and
then
go


scooting
along
the
bluff
bank
in
the

soon

really
do
it

about
the

the
afternoon

enough
up
the

at

there


be
a

one

they
hail
she

she
send
out

to
go
four

five
mile
they
be
boom
mad
,

give
we
a
cussing
,

say
they
would
n't
land
we
.

the

be
ca'm

down

so
you
could
a
hear

and
when
they
get
there


they
bend
over
and
look
in
the
coffin
,
and
take
one
sight
,
and
then


they
bust
out
a
-
crying
so
you
could
a
hear
they
to
Orleans
,

;
and


then
they
put
their
arm
around
each
other
's
neck
,
and
hang
their
chin


over
each

then
for
three
minute
,

I
never

t'other
on


t'other

they
kneel
down

a


word
,
and
kiss
they
,
solemn
,

,
and
look
up
towards
the
sky
,
with
the
tear
run


down
,
and
then
bust
out
and
go
off
sob
and
swab
,
and
give


the
next
woman
a
show
.
I
never
see
anything
so
disgusting
.




well
,
by
and
by
the
king
he
get
up
and
come
forward
a
little
,
and


work
himself
up
and
slobber
out
a
speech
,
all
full
of
tear
and


flapdoodle
about
its
be
a
sore
trial
for
he
and
his
poor
brother


to
lose
the
diseased
,
and
to
miss
see
diseased
alive
after
the
long


journey
of
four
thousand
mile
,
but
it
be
a
trial
that
be
sweeten
and


sanctify
to
we
by
this
dear
sympathy
and
these
holy
tear
,
and
so
he


thank
they
out
of
his
heart
and
out
of
his
brother
's
heart
,
because
out


of
their
mouth
they
ca
n't
,
word
be
too
weak
and
cold
,
and
all
that


kind
of
rot
and
slush
,
till
it
be
just
sicken
;
and
then
he
blubber


out
a
pious
goody
-
goody
amen
,
and
turn
himself
loose
and
go
to
cry


fit
to
bust
.




and
the
minute
the
word
be
out
of
his
mouth
somebody
over
in
the


crowd
strike
up
the
doxolojer
,
and
everybody
join
in
with
all
their


might
,
and
it
just
warm
you
up
and
make
you
feel
as
good
as
church


let
out
.
music
be
a
good
thing
;
and
after
all
that
soul
-
butter
and


hogwash
I
never
see
it
freshen
up
thing
so
,
and
sound
so
honest
and


bully
.




then
the
king
begin
to
work
his
jaw
again
,
and
say
how
he
and
his


niece
would
be
glad
if
a
few
of
the
main
principal

,
and
help
set
up

the
ashe

and
say
if
his
poor

lay


yonder
could
speak
he
know
who
he
would
name

for
they

'd
slide
right
out
and
get
away
with
it
.
if
she
be
to


fetch
in
help
I
'd
get
mix
up
in
the
business
before
it
be
do
with
,


I
judge
.
no
;
there
ai
n't
no
good
way
but
one
.
I
get
to
steal
that


money
,
somehow
;
and
I
get
to
steal
it
some
way
that
they
wo
n't
suspicion


that
I
do
it
.
they
've
get
a
good
thing
here
,
and
they
ai
n't
a
-
go


to
leave
till
they
've
play
this
family
and
this
town
for
all
they
be


worth
,
so
I
'll
find
a
chance
time
enough
.
I
'll
steal
it
and
hide
it
;
and


by
and
by
,
when
I
be
away
down
the
river
,
I
'll
write
a
letter
and
tell


Mary
Jane
where
it
be
hide
.
but
I
well
hive
it
tonight
if
I
can
,


because
the
doctor
maybe
have
n't
let
up
as
much
as
he
let
on
he
have
;
he


might
scare
they
out
of
here
yet
.




so
,
think
I
,
I
'll
go
and
search
they
room
.
upstairs
the
hall
be


dark
,
but
I
find
the
duke
's
room
,
and
start
to
paw
around
it
with


my
hand
;
but
I
recollect
it
would
n't
be
much
like
the
king
to
let


anybody
else
take
care
of
that
money
but
his
own
self
;
so
then
I
go
to


his
room
and
begin
to
paw
around
there
.
but
I
see
I
could
n't
do
nothing


without
a
candle
,
and
I
dasn't
light
one
,
of
course
.
so
I
judge
I
'd


get
to
do
the
other
thing
--
lay
for
they
and
eavesdrop
.
about
that
time


I
hear
their
footstep
come
,
and
be
go
to
skip
under
the
bed
;
I


reach
for
it
,
but
it
be
n't
where
I
think
it
would
be
;
but
I
touch


the
curtain
that
hide
Mary
Jane
's
frock
,
so
I
jump
in
behind
that
and


snuggle
in
amongst
the
gown
,
and
stand
there
perfectly
still
.




they
come
in
and
shut
the
door
;
and
the
first
thing
the
duke
do
be
to


get
down
and
look
under
the
bed
.
then
I
be
glad
I
have
n't
find
the
bed


when
I
want
it
.
and
yet
,
you
know
,
it
be
kind
of
natural
to
hide
under


the
bed
when
you
be
up
to
anything
private
.
they
set
down
then
,
and


the
king
say
:




"
well
,
what
be
it
?
and
cut
it
middlin
'
short
,
because
it
be
well
for


we
to
be
down
there
a
-
whoopin
'
up
the
mournin
'
than

'
'em
a


chance
to

I
ai

easy
;
I
ai

comfortable
.
that


doctor
lay
on
my
mind
.
I
want
to
know
your
plan
.
I
've
get
a


notion
,
and
I
think
it
be
a
sound
one
.
"




"
what
be
it
,
duke
?
"




"
that

before
three
in
the
morning
,
and
clip


it
down
the
river
with
what
we
've

you
may
say
,
when
of


course
we
allow
to
have
to
steal
it
back
.
I
be
for
knock
off
and


light
out
.
"




that
make
I
feel
pretty
bad
.
about
an
hour
or
two
ago
it
would
a
be


a
little
different
,
but
now
it
make
I
feel
bad
and
disappointed
,
the


king
rip
out
and
say

he
do

that
cheer
I
up
.
I
'd

I
warn't
go
to
get
a
hint

no
kind
to
help
I
.
the
king
say
:




"
why
?
"




"
because
Mary
Jane
'll
be
in
mourning
from
this
out
;
and
first
you
know


the
nigger
that
do
up
the
room
will
get
an
order
to
box
these
duds


up
and
put
'em
away
;
and
do
you
reckon
a
nigger
can
run
across
money
and


not
borrow
some
of
it
?
"




"
your
head
's
level
agin
,
duke
,
"
say
the
king
;
and
he
come
a
-
fumble


under
the
curtain
two
or
three
foot
from
where
I
be
.
I
stick
tight
to


the
wall
and
keep
mighty
still
,
though
quivery
;
and
I
wonder
what
they


fellow
would
say
to
I
if
they
catch
I
;
and
I
try
to
think
what


I
'd
well
do
if
they
do
catch
I
.
but
the
king
he
get
the
bag
before


I
could
think
more
than
about
a
half
a
thought
,
and
he
never
suspicione


I
be
around
.
they
take
and
shove
the
bag
through
a
rip
in
the
straw


tick
that
be
under
the
feather
-
bed
,
and
cram
it
in
a
foot
or
two


amongst
the
straw
and
say
it
be
all
right
now
,
because
a
nigger
only


make
up
the
feather
-
bed
,
and
do
n't
turn
over
the
straw
tick
only
about


twice
a
year
,
and
so
it
warn't
in
no
danger
of
getting
steal
now
.




but
I
know
well
.
I
have
it
out
of
there
before
they
be
half
-
way


down
stair
.
I
grope
along
up
to
my
cubby
,
and
hide
it
there
till
I


could
get
a
chance
to
do
well
.
I
judge
I
well
hide
it
outside


of
the
house
somewhere
,
because
if
they
miss
it
they
would
give
the


house
a
good
ransacking
:
I
know
that
very
well
.
then
I
turn
in
,


with
my
clothe
all
on
;
but
I
could
n't
a
go
to
sleep
if
I
have
a
want


to
,
I
be
in
such
a
sweat
to
get
through
with
the
business
.
by
and
by
I


hear
the
king
and
the
duke
come
up
;
so
I
roll
off
my
pallet
and
lay


with
my
chin
at
the
top
of
my
ladder
,
and
wait
to
see
if
anything
be


go
to
happen
.
but
nothing
do
.




so
I
hold
on
till
all
the
late
sound
have
quit
and
the
early
one
have
n't


begin
yet
;
and
then
I
slip
down
the
ladder
.










chapter
XXVII
.






I
creep
to
their
door
and
listen
;
they
be
snore
.
so
I
tiptoe


along
,
and
get
down
stair
all
right
.
there
warn't
a
sound
anywhere
.


I
peep
through
a
crack
of
the
dining
-
room
door
,
and
see
the
man
that


be
watch
the
corpse
all
sound
asleep
on
their
chair
.
the
door


be
open
into
the
parlor
,
where
the
corpse
be
lay
,
and
there
be
a


candle
in
both
room
.
I
pass
along
,
and
the
parlor
door
be
open
;
but


I
see
there
warn't
nobody
in
there
but
the
remainder
of
Peter
;
so
I


shove
on
by
;
but
the
front
door
be
lock
,
and
the
key
be
n't
there
.


just
then
I
hear
somebody
come
down
the
stair
,
back
behind
I
.
I


run
in
the
parlor
and
take
a
swift
look
around
,
and
the
only
place
I


see
to
hide
the
bag
be
in
the
coffin
.
the
lid
be
shove
along
about


a
foot
,
show
the
dead
man
's
face
down
in
there
,
with
a
wet
cloth
over


it
,
and
his
shroud
on
.
I
tuck
the
money
-
bag
in
under
the
lid
,
just


down
beyond
where
his
hand
be
cross
,
which
make
I
creep
,
they
be


so
cold
,
and
then
I
run
back
across
the
room
and
in
behind
the
door
.




the
person
come
be
Mary
Jane
.
she
go
to
the
coffin
,
very
soft
,
and


kneel
down
and
look
in
;
then
she
put
up
her
handkerchief
,
and
I
see


she
begin
to
cry
,
though
I
could
n't
hear
she
,
and
her
back
be
to
I
.
I


slide
out
,
and
as
I
pass
the
dining
-
room
I
think
I
'd
make
sure
they


watcher
have
n't
see
I
;
so
I
look
through
the
crack
,
and
everything


be
all
right
.
they
have
n't
stir
.




I
slip
up
to
bed
,
feel
ruther
blue
,
on
account
of
the
thing


play
out
that
way
after
I
have
take
so
much
trouble
and
run
so
much


resk
about
it
.
say
I
,
if
it
could
stay
where
it
be
,
all
right
;
because


when
we
get
down
the
river
a
hundred
mile
or
two
I
could
write
back
to


Mary
Jane
,
and
she
could
dig
he
up
again
and
get
it
;
but
that
ai
n't
the


thing
that
be
go
to
happen
;
the
thing
that
be
go
to
happen
be
,
the


money
'll
be
find
when
they
come
to
screw
on
the
lid
.
then
the
king


'll
get
it
again
,
and
it
'll
be
a
long
day
before
he
give
anybody


another
chance
to
smouch
it
from
he
.
of
course
I
_
want
_
to
slide


down
and
get
it
out
of
there
,
but
I
dasn't
try
it
.
every
minute
it
be


get
early
now
,
and
pretty
soon
some
of
they
watcher
would
begin


to
stir
,
and
I
might
get
catch
--
catch
with
six
thousand
dollar
in
my


hand
that
nobody
have
n't
hire
I
to
take
care
of
.
I
do
n't
wish
to
be


mix
up
in
no
such
business
as
that
,
I
say
to
myself
.




when
I
get
down
stair
in
the
morning
the
parlor
be
shut
up
,
and
the


watcher
be
go
.
there
warn't
nobody
around
but
the
family
and
the


widow
Bartley
and
our
tribe
.
I
watch
their
face
to
see
if
anything


have
be
happen
,
but
I
could
n't
tell
.




towards
the
middle
of
the
day
the
undertaker
come
with
his
man
,
and
they


set
the
coffin
in
the
middle
of
the
room
on
a
couple
of
chair
,
and
then


set
all
our
chair
in
row
,
and
borrow
more
from
the
neighbor
till


the
hall
and
the
parlor
and
the
dining
-
room
be
full
.
I
see
the
coffin


lid
be
the
way
it
be
before
,
but
I
dasn't
go
to
look
in
under
it
,
with


folk
around
.




then
the
people
begin
to
flock
in
,
and
the
beat
and
the
girl
take


seat
in
the
front
row
at
the
head
of
the
coffin
,
and
for
a
half
an
hour


the
people
file
around
slow
,
in
single
rank
,
and
look
down
at
the


dead
man
's
face
a
minute
,
and
some
drop
in
a
tear
,
and
it
be


all
very
still
and
solemn
,
only
the
girl
and
the
beat
hold


handkerchief
to
their
eye
and
keep
their
head
bent
,
and
sob
a


little
.
there
warn't
no
other
sound
but
the
scraping
of
the
foot
on


the
floor
and
blow
nose
--
because
people
always
blow
they
more
at
a


funeral
than
they
do
at
other
place
except
church
.




when
the
place
be
pack
full
the
undertaker
he
slide
around
in
his


black
glove
with
his
softy
soothering
way
,
put
on
the
last


touch
,
and
get
people
and
thing
all
ship
-
shape
and
comfortable
,


and
make
no
more
sound
than
a
cat
.
he
never
speak
;
he
move
people


around
,
he
squeeze
in
late
one
,
he
open
up
passageway
,
and
do


it
with
nod
,
and
sign
with
his
hand
.
then
he
take
his
place
over


against
the
wall
.
he
be
the
soft
,
gliding
,
stealthy
man
I
ever


see
;
and
there
warn't
no
more
smile
to
he
than
there
be
to
a
ham
.




they
have
borrow
a
melodeum
--
a
sick
one
;
and
when
everything
be
ready


a
young
woman
set
down
and
work
it
,
and
it
be
pretty
skreeky
and


colicky
,
and
everybody
join
in
and
sing
,
and
Peter
be
the
only
one


that
have
a
good
thing
,
accord
to
my
notion
.
then
the
Reverend
Hobson


open
up
,
slow
and
solemn
,
and
begin
to
talk
;
and
straight
off
the
most


outrageous
row
bust
out
in
the
cellar
a
body
ever
hear
;
it
be
only


one
dog
,
but
he
make
a
most
powerful
racket
,
and
he
keep
it
up
right


along
;
the
parson
he
have
to
stand
there
,
over
the
coffin
,
and
wait
--
you


could
n't
hear
yourself
think
.
it
be
right
down
awkward
,
and
nobody


do
n't
seem
to
know
what
to
do
.
but
pretty
soon
they
see
that


long
-
legged
undertaker
make
a
sign
to
the
preacher
as
much
as
to
say
,


"
do
n't
you
worry
--
just
depend
on
I
.
"
then
he
stoop
down
and
begin


to
glide
along
the
wall
,
just
his
shoulder
show
over
the
people
's


head
.
so
he
glide
along
,
and
the
powwow
and
racket
get
more
and


more
outrageous
all
the
time
;
and
at
last
,
when
he
have
go
around
two


side
of
the
room
,
he
disappear
down
cellar
.
then
in
about
two
second


we
hear
a
whack
,
and
the
dog
he
finish
up
with
a
most
amazing
howl
or


two
,
and
then
everything
be
dead
still
,
and
the
parson
begin
his
solemn


talk
where
he
leave
off
.
in
a
minute
or
two
here
come
this
undertaker
's


back
and
shoulder
glide
along
the
wall
again
;
and
so
he
glide
and


glide
around
three
side
of
the
room
,
and
then
rise
up
,
and
shade
his


mouth
with
his
hand
,
and
stretch
his
neck
out
towards
the
preacher
,


over
the
people
's
head
,
and
say
,
in
a
kind
of
a
coarse
whisper
,
"
_
he


have
a
rat
_
!
"
then
he
droop
down
and
glide
along
the
wall
again
to


his
place
.
you
could
see
it
be
a
great
satisfaction
to
the
people
,


because
naturally
they
want
to
know
.
a
little
thing
like
that
do
n't


cost
nothing
,
and
it
be
just
the
little
thing
that
make
a
man
to
be


look
up
to
and
like
.
there
warn't
no
more
popular
man
in
town
than


what
that
undertaker
be
.




well
,
the
funeral
sermon
be
very
good
,
but
pison
long
and
tiresome
;
and


then
the
king
he
shove
in
and
get
off
some
of
his
usual
rubbage
,
and


at
last
the
job
be
through
,
and
the
undertaker
begin
to
sneak
up
on
the


coffin
with
his
screw
-
driver
.
I
be
in
a
sweat
then
,
and
watch
he


pretty
keen
.
but
he
never
meddle
at
all
;
just
slide
the
lid
along
as


soft
as
mush
,
and
screw
it
down
tight
and
fast
.
so
there
I
be
!
I


do
n't
know
whether
the
money
be
in
there
or
not
.
so
,
say
I
,
s'pose


somebody
have
hog
that
bag
on
the
sly?--now
how
do
I
know
whether


to
write
to
Mary
Jane
or
not
?
S'pose
she
dig
he
up
and
do
n't
find


nothing
,
what
would
she
think
of
I
?
blame
it
,
I
say
,
I
might
get


hunt
up
and
jail
;
I
'd
well
lay
low
and
keep
dark
,
and
not
write
at


all
;
the
thing
's
awful
mixed
now
;
try
to
better
it
,
I
've
worsen
it


a
hundred
time
,
and
I
wish
to
goodness
I
'd
just
let
it
alone
,
dad
fetch


the
whole
business
!




they
bury
he
,
and
we
come
back
home
,
and
I
go
to
watch
face


again
--
I
could
n't
help
it
,
and
I
could
n't
rest
easy
.
but
nothing
come
of


it
;
the
face
do
n't
tell
I
nothing
.




the
king
he
visit
around
in
the
evening
,
and
sweeten
everybody
up
,


and
make
himself
ever
so
friendly
;
and
he
give
out
the
idea
that
his


congregation
over
in
England
would
be
in
a
sweat
about
he
,
so
he
must


hurry
and
settle
up
the
estate
right
away
and
leave
for
home
.
he
be


very
sorry
he
be
so
pushed
,
and
so
be
everybody
;
they
wish
he
could


stay
long
,
but
they
say
they
could
see
it
could
n't
be
do
.
and
he


say
of
course
he
and
William
would
take
the
girl
home
with
they
;
and


that
please
everybody
too
,
because
then
the
girl
would
be
well
fix


and
amongst
their
own
relation
;
and
it
please
the
girl
,
too
--
tickled


they
so
they
clean
forget
they
ever
have
a
trouble
in
the
world
;
and
tell


he
to
sell
out
as
quick
as
he
want
to
,
they
would
be
ready
.
they


poor
thing
be
that
glad
and
happy
it
make
my
heart
ache
to
see
they


getting
fool
and
lie
to
so
,
but
I
do
n't
see
no
safe
way
for
I
to


chip
in
and
change
the
general
tune
.




well
,
blame
if
the
king
do
n't
bill
the
house
and
the
nigger
and
all


the
property
for
auction
straight
off
--
sale
two
day
after
the
funeral
;


but
anybody
could
buy
private
beforehand
if
they
want
to
.




so
the
next
day
after
the
funeral
,
along
about
noon
-
time
,
the
girl
'
joy


get
the
first
jolt
.
a
couple
of
nigger
trader
come
along
,
and
the
king


sell
they
the
nigger
reasonable
,
for
three
-
day
draft
as
they
call


it
,
and
away
they
go
,
the
two
son
up
the
river
to
Memphis
,
and
their


mother
down
the
river
to
Orleans
.
I
think
they
poor
girl
and
they


nigger
would
break
their
heart
for
grief
;
they
cry
around
each


other
,
and
take
on
so
it
most
make
I
down
sick
to
see
it
.
the
girl


say
they
have
n't
ever
dream
of
see
the
family
separate
or
sell


away
from
the
town
.
I
ca
n't
ever
get
it
out
of
my
memory
,
the
sight
of


they
poor
miserable
girl
and
nigger
hang
around
each
other
's
neck


and
cry
;
and
I
reckon
I
could
n't
a
stand
it
all
,
but
would
a
have


to
bust
out
and
tell
on
our
gang
if
I
have
n't
know
the
sale
warn't
no


account
and
the
nigger
would
be
back
home
in
a
week
or
two
.




the
thing
make
a
big
stir
in
the
town
,
too
,
and
a
good
many
come
out


flatfoote
and
say
it
be
scandalous
to
separate
the
mother
and
the


child
that
way
.
it
injure
the
fraud
some
;
but
the
old
fool
he


bull
right
along
,
spite
of
all
the
duke
could
say
or
do
,
and
I
tell

be
powerful
uneasy
.




next

about

day
in
the
morning
the
king
and


the
duke
come
up
in
the
garret
and

I
up

and

the

in

I
can


prove

up

I

nobody

one

ask
I

I

no

I
see
they
sneak
out

hustle
away
,

I


never
think
nothing

I
reckon
they
be
afraid

wake
up

try

some
other
laugh

say
,
"

"




well
,
then
they
sail
in
on
the
general

there
we
have


it

up

nobody

the
bad

you

anybody

by

by


they
have
I
up
to
tell
what
I
know

the
king
he
give
I
a
left

handed


look
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye

and
so
I
know
enough
to
talk
on
the


right
side
.
I
begin
to
tell
about
Sheffield
,

how
we
live
there
,


and
all
about
the
English
Wilkses
,

so
on
;
but
I
do
n't
get
pretty


fur
till
the
doctor
begin
to
laugh
;
and
Levi
Bell
,
the
lawyer
,
say
:




"

what
you
want

you
do
it
pretty
awkward
.
"




I
do
n't
care
nothing
for
the
compliment
,
but
I
be
glad
to
be
let
off
,


anyway

the
doctor
he
start
to
say
something
,
and
turn
and
say
:




"

Bell--
"
the
king
break
in
and


reach
out
his
hand
,
and
say
:




"
why
,
be
this

dead

often


about

the
lawyer
and
he
shake
hand
,
and
the
lawyer
smile
and
look


pleased
,
and
they
talk
right
along
awhile
,
and
then
get
to
one
side


and
talk
low
;
and
at
last
the
lawyer
speak
up
and
say
:




"
that
'll
fix
it

I
'll
take
the
order

then
they
'll
know
it

so
they
get
some
paper
and
a
pen
,

the
king
he
set
down
and
twist


his
head
to
one
side
,
and
chaw
his
tongue
,
and
scrawl
off
something
;


and
then
they
give
the
pen
to
the
duke

and
then
for
the
first
time
the


duke
look
sick
.
but
he
take
the
pen
and
write
.
so
then
the
lawyer


turn
to
the
new
old
gentleman
and
say
:

make
it

be
darke
up

the


lightning
begin
to
wink

the
wind
to
shiver
amongst


the
leave

this
be
the
most
awful
trouble

most
dangersome
I
ever


be
in
;
and
I
be
kinder
stunned
;
everything
be
go
so
different
from


what
I
have
allow
for

nothing

just
they

mark

they


do
n't
find
them--




I
could
n't
bear
to
think
about
it
;
and
yet
,
somehow
,
I
could
n't
think


about
nothing
else
.
it
get
dark
and
dark
,
and
it
be
a
beautiful


time
to
give
the
crowd
the
slip
;

that
big
husky
have
I
by
the


wrist
--
Hines

and
a
body
might
as
well
try
to
give
Goliar
the
slip
.
he


drag
I
right
along

he
be
so
excited
,

I
have
to
run
to
keep
up
.




when
they
get
there
they
swarm
into
the
graveyard
and
wash
over
it


like
an
overflow
.
and
when
they
get
to
the
grave
they
find
they
have


about
a
hundred
time
as
many
shovel
as
they
want
,
but
nobody
have
n't


think
to
fetch
a
lantern
.
but
they
sail
into
dig
anyway
by
the


flicker
of
the
lightning
,
and
send
a
man
to
the
near
house
,
a
half
a


mile
off
,
to
borrow
one
.




so
they
dig
and
dig
like
everything
;
and
it
get
awful
dark
,
and
the
rain


start
,
and
the
wind
swish
and
swushe
along
,
and
the
lightning
come


brisker
and
brisker
,
and
the
thunder
boom
;
but
they
people
never
take


no
notice
of
it
,
they
be
so
full
of
this
business
;
and
one
minute


you
could
see
everything
and
every
face
in
that
big
crowd
,
and
the


shovelful
of
dirt
sail
up
out
of
the
grave
,
and
the
next
second
the


dark
wipe
it
all
out
,
and
you
could
n't
see
nothing
at
all
.




at
last
they
get
out
the
coffin
and
begin
to
unscrew
the
lid
,
and
then


such
another
crowding
and
shoulder
and
shove
as
there
be
,
to


scrouge
in
and
get
a
sight
,
you
never
see
;
and
in
the
dark
,
that
way
,
it


be
awful
.
hine
he
hurt
my
wrist
dreadful
pulling
and
tugging
so
,


and
I
reckon
he
clean
forget
I
be
in
the
world
,
he
be
so
excited
and


pant
.

and


give
a
big
surge
to
bust
his
way
in
and
get
a
look
,
and
the
way
I
light


out
and
shin
for
the
road
in
the
dark
there
ai

then
glare

the


buzzing
of

when
I
strike
the
town
I
see
there
warn't
nobody
out
in
the
storm
,
so


I
never
hunt
for
no
back
street
,
but
hump
it
straight
through
the


main
one
;
and
when
I
begin
to
get
towards
our
house
I
aim
my
eye
and


set
it
.
no
light
there
;
the
house
all
dark

which
make
I
feel
sorry
and


disappointed
,
I
do
n't
know
why
.

at
last
,
just
as
I
be

up


sudden
,
like
to
bust
;
and
the
same
second
the
house
and
all
be
behind


I
in
the
dark
,

the
most

the
minute
I
be
far
enough
above
the
town
to
see
I
could
make
the


towhead
,
I
begin
to
look
sharp
for
a
boat
to
borrow
,
and
the
first


time

big
distance
off

away
out
there
in

middle
of
the
river

I
do
n't

no
time
;

when
I
strike
the


raft
at
last
I
be
so
fagged
I
would
a
just
lay
down
to
blow
and
gasp


if
I
could
afford
it
.

it
,
and

"




the
king
begin
to
gurgle
,
and
then
he
gasp
out
:




"
'
Nough!--I

"




I
be
very
glad
to
hear
he
say
that
;
it
make
I
feel
much
more
easy


than
what
I
be
feel
before
.
so
the
duke
take
his
hand
off
and


say
:




"
if
you
ever

it
be
_
well
_
for
you
to
set


there
and

it
be
fitten
for
you

after
the
way


you
've

.
I
never
see
such
an
old
ostrich
for
want
to
gobble


everything
--
and
I
a
-
trust
you
all
the
time
,
like
you
be
my
own


father
.
you
ought
to
been
ashamed
of
yourself
to
stand
by
and
hear
it


saddle
on
to
a
lot
of
poor
nigger
,
and
you
never
say
a
word
for
'em
.


it
make
I
feel
ridiculous

soft
enough

that

cuss
you

I
can
see
now
why
you
be
so
anxious
to

up
the
deffisit

you
want
to
get
what
money
I
'd

one
thing

another

_
all

"




the
king
say
,
timid
,
and
still
a
-
snuffle
:




"
why
,

"
say
the
duke
.
 
"
and


_
now
_
you
see
what
you
got
by
it
.
they
've
get
all
their
own
money
back
,

all
of
_

"




so
the
king
sneak
into
the
wigwam
and
take
to
his
bottle
for
comfort
,


and
before
long
the
duke
tackle
his
bottle
;
and
so
in
about
a
half
an


hour
they
be
as
thick
as
thief
again
,
and
the
tight
they
get
the


lovinger
they
get
,
and
go
off
a
-
snore
in
each
other
's
arm
.
they


both
get
powerful
mellow
,
but
I
notice
the
king
do
n't
get
mellow


enough
to
forget
to
remember
to
not
deny
about
hide
the
money
-
bag


again
.
that
make
I
feel
easy
and
satisfied
.
of
course
when
they
get


to
snore
we
have
a
long
gabble
,
and
I
tell
Jim
everything
.










chapter
XXXI
.






we
dasn't
stop
again
at
any
town
for
day
and
day
;
keep
right
along


down
the
river
.
we
be
down
south
in
the
warm
weather
now
,
and
a
mighty


long
way
from
home
.
we
begin
to
come
to
tree
with
spanish
moss
on


they
,
hang
down
from
the
limb
like
long
,
gray
beard
.
it
be
the


first
I
ever
see
it
grow
,
and
it
make
the
wood
look
solemn
and


dismal
.
so
now
the
fraud
reckon
they
be
out
of
danger
,
and
they


begin
to
work
the
village
again
.




first
they
do
a
lecture
on
temperance
;
but
they
do
n't
make
enough


for
they
both
to
get
drunk
on
.
then
in
another
village
they
start


a
dancing
-
school
;
but
they
do
n't
know
no
more
how
to
dance
than
a


kangaroo
do
;
so
the
first
prance
they
make
the
general
public
jump


in
and
prance
they
out
of
town
.
another
time
they
try
to
go
at


yellocution
;
but
they
do
n't
yellocute
long
till
the
audience
get
up
and


give
they
a
solid
good
cussing
,
and
make
they
skip
out
.
they
tackle


missionarye
,
and
mesmerize
,
and
doctoring
,
and
tell
fortune
,
and


a
little
of
everything
;
but
they
could
n't
seem
to
have
no
luck
.
so
at


last
they
got
just
about
dead
break
,
and
lay
around
the
raft
as
she


float
along
,
thinking
and
thinking
,
and
never
say
nothing
,
by
the


half
a
day
at
a
time
,
and
dreadful
blue
and
desperate
.




and
at
last
they
take
a
change
and
begin
to
lay
their
head
together
in


the
wigwam
and
talk
low
and
confidential
two
or
three
hour
at
a
time
.


Jim
and
I
get
uneasy
.
we
do
n't
like
the
look
of
it
.
we
judge
they


be
study
up
some
kind
of
bad
deviltry
than
ever
.
we
turn
it


over
and
over
,
and
at
last
we
make
up
our
mind
they
be
go
to
break


into
somebody
's
house
or
store
,
or
be
go
into
the
counterfeit
-
money


business
,
or
something
.
so
then
we
be
pretty
scared
,
and
make
up
an


agreement
that
we
would
n't
have
nothing
in
the
world
to
do
with
such


action
,
and
if
we
ever
get
the
least
show
we
would
give
they
the
cold


shake
and
clear
out
and
leave
they
behind
.
well
,
early
one
morning
we


hide
the
raft
in
a
good
,
safe
place
about
two
mile
below
a
little
bit
of


a
shabby
village
name
Pikesville
,
and
the
king
he
go
ashore
and
tell


we
all
to
stay
hid
whilst
he
go
up
to
town
and
smell
around
to
see


if
anybody
have
get
any
wind
of
the
Royal
Nonesuch
there
yet
.
(
"
house
to


rob
,
you
_
mean
_
,
"
say
I
to
myself
;
"
and
when
you
get
through
rob
it


you
'll
come
back
here
and
wonder
what
have
become
of
I
and
Jim
and
the


raft
--
and
you
'll
have
to
take
it
out
in
wonder
.
"
)
and
he
say
if
he


warn't
back
by
midday
the
duke
and
I
would
know
it
be
all
right
,
and


we
be
to
come
along
.




so
we
stay
where
we
be
.
the
duke
he
fret
and
sweat
around
,
and


be
in
a
mighty
sour
way
.
he
scold
we
for
everything
,
and
we
could
n't


seem
to
do
nothing
right
;
he
find
fault
with
every
little
thing
.


something
be
a
-
brewing
,
sure
.
I
be
good
and
glad
when
midday
come


and
no
king
;
we
could
have
a
change
,
anyway
--
and
maybe
a
chance
for
_
the
_


change
on
top
of
it
.
so
I
and
the
duke
go
up
to
the
village
,
and


hunt
around
there
for
the
king
,
and
by
and
by
we
find
he
in
the


back
room
of
a
little
low
doggery
,
very
tight
,
and
a
lot
of
loafer


bullyrag
he
for
sport
,
and
he
a
-
cuss
and
a
-
threaten
with
all


his
might
,
and
so
tight
he
could
n't
walk
,
and
could
n't
do
nothing
to


they
.
the
duke
he
begin
to
abuse
he
for
an
old
fool
,
and
the
king


begin
to
sass
back
,
and
the
minute
they
be
fairly
at
it
I
light
out
and


shake
the
reef
out
of
my
hind
leg
,
and
spin
down
the
river
road
like


a
deer
,
for
I
see
our
chance
;
and
I
make
up
my
mind
that
it
would
be
a


long
day
before
they
ever
see
I
and
Jim
again
.
I
get
down
there
all


out
of
breath
but
load
up
with
joy
,
and
sing
out
:




"
set
she
loose
,
Jim
!
we
be
all
right
now
!
"




but
there
warn't
no
answer
,
and
nobody
come
out
of
the
wigwam
.
Jim
be


go

I
set
up
a
shout
--
and
then
another
--
and
then
another
one
;
and
run


this
way
and
that
in
the
wood
,
whooping
and
screech
;
but
it
warn't


no
use

old
Jim
be

.
then
I
set
down
and
cry
;
I
could
n't
help


it
.
but
I
could
n't
set
still
long
.
pretty
soon
I
go
out
on
the
road
,


try
to
think
what
I
well
do
,
and
I
run
across
a
boy
walk
,
and


ask
he
if
he
have
see
a
strange

be
all
come
to
nothing
,
everything
all
bust
up
and
ruin
,
because


they
could
have
the
heart
to
serve
Jim
such
a
trick
as
that
,
and
make


he
a
slave
again
all
his
life
,
and
amongst
stranger
,
too
,
for
forty


dirty
dollar
.




once
I
say
to
myself
it
would
be
a
thousand
time
well
for
Jim
to


be
a
slave
at
home
where
his
family
be
,
as
long
as
he
'd
_
get
_
to
be
a


slave
,
and
so
I
'd
well
write
a
letter
to
Tom
Sawyer
and
tell
he
to


tell
Miss
Watson
where
he
be
.
but
I
soon
give
up
that
notion
for
two


thing
:
she
'd
be
mad
and
disgusted
at
his
rascality
and
ungratefulness


for
leave
she
,
and
so
she
'd
sell
he
straight
down
the
river
again
;


and
if
she
do
n't
,
everybody
naturally
despise
an
ungrateful
nigger
,


and
they
'd
make
Jim
feel
it
all
the
time
,
and
so
he
'd
feel
ornery
and


disgrace
.
and
then
think
of
_
I
_
!
it
would
get
all
around
that
Huck


Finn
help
a
nigger
to
get
his
freedom
;
and
if
I
be
ever
to
see


anybody
from
that
town
again
I
'd
be
ready
to
get
down
and
lick
his
boot


for
shame
.
that
be
just
the
way
:
a
person
do
a
low
-
down
thing
,
and


then
he
do
n't
want
to
take
no
consequence
of
it
.
think
as
long
as
he


can
hide
it
,
it
ai
n't
no
disgrace
.
that
be
my
fix
exactly
.
the
more
I


study
about
this
the
more
my
conscience
go
to
grind
I
,
and
the


more
wicked
and
low
-
down
and
ornery
I
get
to
feeling
.
and
at
last
,
when


it
hit
I
all
of
a
sudden
that
here
be
the
plain
hand
of
Providence


slap
I
in
the
face
and
let
I
know
my
wickedness
be
be


watch
all
the
time
from
up
there
in
heaven
,
whilst
I
be
steal
a


poor
old
woman
's
nigger
that
have
n't
ever
do
I
no
harm
,
and
now
be


show
I
there
be
one
that
be
always
on
the
lookout
,
and
ai
n't
a
-
go


to
allow
no
such
miserable
doing
to
go
only
just
so
fur
and
no
far
,


I
most
drop
in
my
track
I
be
so
scared
.
well
,
I
try
the
good
I


could
to
kinder
soften
it
up
somehow
for
myself
by
say
I
be
brung


up
wicked
,
and
so
I
warn't
so
much
to
blame
;
but
something
inside
of
I


keep
say
,
"
there
be
the
Sunday
-
school
,
you
could
a
go
to
it
;
and


if
you
'd
a
do
it
they
'd
a
learn
you
there
that
people
that
act
as


I
'd
be
act
about
that
nigger
go
to
everlasting
fire
.
"




it
make
I
shiver
.
and
I
about
make
up
my
mind
to
pray
,
and
see
if
I


could
n't
try
to
quit
be
the
kind
of
a
boy
I
be
and
be
well
.
so


I
kneel
down
.
but
the
word
would
n't
come
.
why
would
n't
they
?
it


warn't
no
use
to
try
and
hide
it
from
he
.
nor
from
_
I
_
,
neither
.
I


know
very
well
why
they
would
n't
come
.
it
be
because
my
heart
warn't


right
;
it
be
because
I
warn't
square
;
it
be
because
I
be
play


double
.
I
be
let
_
on
_
to
give
up
sin
,
but
away
inside
of
I
I
be


hold
on
to
the
big
one
of
all
.
I
be
try
to
make
my
mouth


_
say
_
I
would
do
the
right
thing
and
the
clean
thing
,
and
go
and
write


to
that
nigger
's
owner
and
tell
where
he
be
;
but
deep
down
in
I
I


know
it
be
a
lie
,
and
he
know
it
.
you
ca
n't
pray
a
lie
--
I
find


that
out
.




so
I
be
full
of
trouble
,
full
as
I
could
be
;
and
do
n't
know
what
to


do
.
at
last
I
have
an
idea
;
and
I
say
,
I
'll
go
and
write
the
letter
--
and


then
see
if
I
can
pray
.
why
,
it
be
astonishing
,
the
way
I
feel
as


light
as
a
feather
right
straight
off
,
and
my
trouble
all
go
.
so
I


get
a
piece
of
paper
and
a
pencil
,
all
glad
and
excited
,
and
set
down


and
write
:




Miss
Watson
,
your
runaway
nigger
Jim
be
down
here
two
mile
below


Pikesville
,
and
Mr.
Phelps
have
get
he
and
he
will
give
he
up
for
the


reward
if
you
send
.




_
Huck
Finn
.
_




I
feel
good
and
all
wash
clean
of
sin
for
the
first
time
I
have
ever


feel
so
in
my
life
,
and
I
know
I
could
pray
now
.
but
I
do
n't
do
it


straight
off
,
but
lay
the
paper
down
and
set
there
think
--
think


how
good
it
be
all
this
happen
so
,
and
how
near
I
come
to
be
lose


and
go
to
hell
.
and
go
on
thinking
.
and
get
to
think
over
our


trip
down
the
river
;
and
I
see
Jim
before
I
all
the
time
:
in
the
day


and
in
the
night
-
time
,
sometimes
moonlight
,
sometimes
storm
,
and
we


a
-
float
along
,
talk
and
singing
and
laugh
.
but
somehow
I


could
n't
seem
to
strike
no
place
to
harden
I
against
he
,
but
only
the


other
kind
.
I
'd
see
he
stand
my
watch
on
top
of
his'n
,
'
stead
of


call
I
,
so
I
could
go
on
sleeping
;
and
see
he
how
glad
he
be
when


I
come
back
out
of
the
fog
;
and
when
I
come
to
he
again
in
the
swamp
,


up
there
where
the
feud
be
;
and
such
-
like
time
;
and
would
always
call


I
honey
,
and
pet
I
and
do
everything
he
could
think
of
for
I
,
and
how


good
he
always
be
;
and
at
last
I
strike
the
time
I
save
he
by
tell


the
man
we
have
small
-
pox
aboard
,
and
he
be
so
grateful
,
and
say
I
be


the
good
friend
old
Jim
ever
have
in
the
world
,
and
the
_
only
_
one
he
be


get
now
;
and
then
I
happen
to
look
around
and
see
that
paper
.




it
be
a
close
place
.
I
take
it
up
,
and
hold
it
in
my
hand
.
I
be


a
-
trembling
,
because
I
'd
get
to
decide
,
forever
,
betwixt
two
thing
,
and


I
know
it
.
I
study
a
minute
,
sort
of
hold
my
breath
,
and
then


say
to
myself
:




"
all
right
,
then
,
I
'll
_
go
_
to
hell”--and
tear
it
up
.




it
be
awful
thought
and
awful
word
,
but
they
be
say
.
and
I
let


they
stay
say
;
and
never
think
no
more
about
reform
.
I
shove
the


whole
thing
out
of
my
head
,
and
say
I
would
take
up
wickedness
again
,


which
be
in
my
line
,
be
brung
up
to
it
,
and
the
other
warn't
.
and


for
a
starter
I
would
go
to
work
and
steal
Jim
out
of
slavery
again
;


and
if
I
could
think
up
anything
bad
,
I
would
do
that
,
too
;
because
as


long
as
I
be
in
,
and
in
for
good
,
I
might
as
well
go
the
whole
hog
.




then
I
set
to
think
over
how
to
get
at
it
,
and
turn
over
some


considerable
many
way
in
my
mind
;
and
at
last
fix
up
a
plan
that


suit
I
.
so
then
I
take
the
bearing
of
a
woody
island
that
be
down


the
river
a
piece
,
and
as
soon
as
it
be
fairly
dark
I
creep
out
with
my


raft
and
go
for
it
,
and
hide
it
there
,
and
then
turn
in
.
I
sleep
the


night
through
,
and
get
up
before
it
be
light
,
and
have
my
breakfast
,


and
put
on
my
store
clothe
,
and
tie
up
some
other
and
one
thing
or


another
in
a
bundle
,
and
take
the
canoe
and
clear
for
shore
.
I
land


below
where
I
judge
be
Phelps
's
place
,
and
hide
my
bundle
in
the
wood
,


and
then
fill
up
the
canoe
with
water
,
and
load
rock
into
she
and


sink
she
where
I
could
find
she
again
when
I
want
she
,
about
a
quarter


of
a
mile
below
a
little
steam
sawmill
that
be
on
the
bank
.




then
I
strike
up
the
road
,
and
when
I
pass
the
mill
I
see
a
sign
on


it
,
"
Phelps
's
sawmill
,
"
and
when
I
come
to
the
farm
-
house
,
two
or


three
hundred
yard
far
along
,
I
keep
my
eye
peel
,
but
do
n't


see
nobody
around
,
though
it
be
good
daylight
now
.
but
I
do
n't
mind
,


because
I
do
n't
want
to
see
nobody
just
yet
--
I
only
want
to
get
the


lie
of
the
land
.
accord
to
my
plan
,
I
be
go
to
turn
up
there
from


the
village
,
not
from
below
.
so
I
just
take
a
look
,
and
shove
along
,


straight
for
town
.
well
,
the
very
first
man
I
see
when
I
get
there
be


the
duke
.
he
be
stick
up
a
bill
for
the
Royal
Nonesuch
--
three
-
night


performance
--
like
that
other
time
.
they
have
the
cheek
,
they
fraud
!
I


be
right
on
he
before
I
could
shirk
.
he
look
astonish
,
and
say
:




"
hel-_lo
_
!
where
'd
_
you
_
come
from
?
"
then
he
say
,
kind
of
glad
and


eager
,
"
where
be
the
raft?--got
she
in
a
good
place
?
"




I
say
:




"
why
,
that
be
just
what
I
be
go
to
ask
your
grace
.
"




then
he
do
n't
look
so
joyful
,
and
say
:




"
what
be
your
idea
for
ask
_
I
_
?
"
he
say
.




"
well
,
"
I
say
,
"
when
I
see
the
king
in
that
doggery
yesterday
I
say


to
myself
,
we
ca
n't
get
he
home
for
hour
,
till
he
be
soberer
;
so
I
go


a
-
loaf
around
town
to
put
in
the
time
and
wait
.
a
man
up
and
offer


I
ten
cent
to
help
he
pull
a
skiff
over
the
river
and
back
to
fetch


a
sheep
,
and
so
I
go
along
;
but
when
we
be
drag
he
to
the
boat
,


and
the
man
leave
I
a
-
holt
of
the
rope
and
go
behind
he
to
shove
he


along
,
he
be
too
strong
for
I
and
jerk
loose
and
run
,
and
we
after


he
.
we
do
n't
have
no

so
we
have
to
chase
he
all
over
the


country
till
we
tire
he
out
.
we
never
get
he
till
dark
;
then
we


fetch
he
over
,

I
start
down
for
the
raft

when
I
get
there

they
've

my

nothing

no

I
set
down
and


cry
.
I
sleep
in
the
wood
all
night
.

I
never
see
the
duke
look
so
ugly
out

his
eye


before

I
go
on

look

stand
there
with
his

flutter
on


his
arm

wrinkle
up
his

at

he

and
then
he
stop
.
you
see
,
he


start
to
tell
I
the
truth
;
but
when
he
stop
that
way
,
and
begin
to


study
and
think
again
,
I
reckon
he
be
change
his
mind

so
he


be
.
he
would
n't
trust

he
want
to
make
sure

I
out

the
whole
three

pretty
soon
he
say

"




"
all
right

I

I
can
walk
it

neither
,

do
any

just
keep
a

move
right
along

then
you

n't

d'ye
hear

"




that
be
the
order
I
want
,

that
be
the
one
I
play
for
.
I


want
to
be
leave
free
to
work
my

"
so
clear
out

"
he
say
;
"
and
you
can
tell
Mr.
Foster
whatever
you
want


to
.
maybe
you
can
get
he
to
believe
that
Jim

be
_
your
nigger

some


idiot
do
n't
require
document

I
've
hear
there
be
such
down


south
here
.
and
when
you
tell
he
the
handbill
and
the
reward
's
bogus
,


maybe
he
'll
believe
you
when
you
explain
to
he
what
the
idea
be
for


get
'em
out
.
go
'
long
now
,
and
tell
he
anything
you
want
to
;

mind
you
do
n't
work
your
jaw
any
_

there

"




so
I
leave
,

strike
for
the
back
country

I
do
n't
look
around
,

I


kind
feel
like
he
be
watch
I
.
but
I
know
I
could
tire
he
out


at
that
.
I
go
straight
out
in
the
country
as
much
as
a
mile
before


I
stop
;
then
I
double
back
through
the
wood
towards
Phelps

I


reckon
I
well
start
in
on
my
plan
straight
off
without
fool


around
,
because
I
want
to
stop
Jim
's
mouth
till
these
fellow
could


get
away
.
I
do
n't
want
no
trouble
with
their
kind
.
I
'd
see
all
I


want
to
of
they
,

want
to
get
entirely
shut

I


explain
all
about
how
we
blow
out
a
cylinder
-
head
at
the
mouth
of


White
River
,
and
it
take
we
three
day
to
fix
it
.
which
be
all
right
,


and
work
first
-
rate
;
because
_
they
_
do
n't
know
but
what
it
would
take


three
day
to
fix
it
.
if
I
have
a
call
it
a
bolthead
it
would
a
do


just
as
well
.




now
I
be
feel
pretty
comfortable
all
down
one
side
,
and
pretty


uncomfortable
all
up
the
other
.
be
Tom
Sawyer
be
easy
and


comfortable
,
and
it
stay
easy
and
comfortable
till
by
and
by
I
hear
a


steamboat
cough
along
down
the
river
.
then
I
say
to
myself
,
s'pose


Tom
Sawyer
come
down
on
that
boat
?
and
s'pose
he
step
in
here
any


minute
,
and
sing
out
my
name
before
I
can
throw
he
a
wink
to
keep


quiet
?




well
,
I
could
n't
_
have
_
it
that
way
;
it
would
n't
do
at
all
.
I
must
go


up
the
road
and
waylay
he
.
so
I
tell
the
folk
I
reckon
I
would
go


up
to
the
town
and
fetch
down
my
baggage
.
the
old
gentleman
be
for


go
along
with
I
,
but
I
say
no
,
I
could
drive
the
horse
myself
,
and


I
druther
he
would
n't
take
no
trouble
about
I
.










chapter
XXXIII
.






so
I
start
for
town
in
the
wagon
,
and
when
I
be
half
-
way
I
see
a


wagon
come
,
and
sure
enough
it
be
Tom
Sawyer
,
and
I
stop
and


wait
till
he
come
along
.
I
say
"
hold
on
!
"
and
it
stop
alongside
,


and
his
mouth
open
up
like
a
trunk
,
and
stay
so
;
and
he
swallow


two
or
three
time
like
a
person
that
be
get
a
dry
throat
,
and
then
say
:




"
I

so
,
then

ha'nt

"




I
say
:




"
I

I
hain't
be

"




when
he
hear
my
voice
it
right
he
up
some
,
but
he
warn't
quite


satisfied
yet
.
he
say
:




"
do
n't
you
play
nothing
on

,
because
I
would
n't

"




"
honest
injun
,
I
ai
n't

"
I
say
.




"

I

I
--
well
,
that
ought
to
settle
it
,
of
course
;
but
I
ca
n't
somehow


seem
to
understand
it
no
way
.
Looky
here
,
warn't

_
"




"
no

I

so
he
do
it
;
and
it
satisfy
he
;
and
he
be
that
glad
to
see
I


again
he
do
n't
know
what
to
do
.
and
he
want
to
know
all
about
it


right
off
,
because
it
be
a
grand
adventure
,
and
mysterious
,
and
so
it


hit
he
where
he
live
.
but
I
say
,
leave
it
alone
till
by
and
by
;
and


tell
his
driver
to
wait
,
and
we
drive
off
a
little
piece
,
and
I
tell


he
the
kind
of
a
fix
I
be
in
,
and
what
do
he
reckon

he


say
,
let
he
alone
a
minute
,
and
do
n't
disturb
he
.
so
he
think
and


think
,
and
pretty
soon
he
say
:




"

I
've

I
say
:




"
all
right

wait
a
minute
.
there
be
one
more
thing

a

up

it
be
the
most


astonishing
speech

ever
hear

and
I
be
bind
to
say
Tom
Sawyer
fall


considerable
in
my
estimation

"




then
we
take
the
trunk

put
it
in
my
wagon
,

he
drive
off
his

of
course
I
forget
all
about
drive
slow
on


account
of
be
glad
and
full
of
thinking
;
so
I
get
home
a
heap
too


quick
for
that
length
of
a
trip
.
the
old

he
be
the
innocentest
,
good
old
soul
I
ever
see
.


but
it
warn't
surprising
;
because
he
warn't
only
just
a
farmer

he
be


a
preacher
,
too
,

it
himself

for
a
church


and
schoolhouse
,
and
never
charge
nothing
for
his
preaching
,

it
be


worth
it
,
too
.
there
be
plenty
other
farmer

preacher
like
that
,

do
the

way
,
down
South

in
about
half
an
hour
Tom

drive
up
to
the
front
stile

Aunt

everybody
make
a
rush
for

,
of
course
,
a
stranger


do
n't
come

so
he
lay

it
warn't
no
use

they


do
n't
happen
to
say
nothing
about
any
runaway
nigger

we
be
afraid


to
try

work
up
to
it

at
supper

at
night
,
one

the
runaway
nigger
tell
Burton

I
all
about
that
scandalous
show
,

Burton
say
he
would
tell
the


people

drive
the
owdacious
loafer
out

before
this
time

it
was!--but

it

I
be
to
sleep
in
the

room

bed
;
so
,
be
tired
,
we
bid
good

night

go
up
to


bed
right
after
supper
,

clumb
out
of
the
window
and
down
the


lightning
-
rod
,

shove
for
the
town
;
for
I
do
n't
believe
anybody
be


go
to
give
the
king
and
the
duke
a
hint
,

so
if
I
do
n't
hurry
up

give
they
one
they
'd
get
into
trouble

on
the
road
Tom

tell
I
all
about
how
it
be

I
be
murder

how
pap
disappear
pretty
soon
,
and
do
n't
come
back
no
more
,
and


what
a
stir
there
be
when
Jim
run
away
;
and
I
tell
Tom
all
about
our


royal
Nonesuch
rapscallion
,
and
as
much
of
the
raft
voyage
as
I
have


time
to
;
and
as
we
strike
into
the
town
and
up
through
the
the
middle
of


it
--
it
be
as
much
as
half
-
after
eight
,
then
--
here
come
a
rage
rush
of


people
with
torch
,
and
an
awful
whooping
and
yelling
,
and
bang
tin


pan
and
blow
horn
;
and
we
jump
to
one
side
to
let
they
go
by
;


and
as
they
go
by
I
see
they
have
the
king
and
the
duke
astraddle
of
a


rail
--
that
is
,
I
know
it
_
be
_
the
king
and
the
duke
,
though
they
be


all
over
tar
and
feather
,
and
do
n't
look
like
nothing
in
the


world
that
be
human
--
just
look
like
a
couple
of
monstrous
big


soldier
-
plume
.
well
,
it
make
I
sick
to
see
it
;
and
I
be
sorry
for


they
poor
pitiful
rascal
,
it
seem
like
I
could
n't
ever
feel
any


hardness
against
they
any
more
in
the
world
.
it
be
a
dreadful
thing
to


see
.
human
being
_
can
_
be
awful
cruel
to
one
another
.




we
see
we
be
too
late
--
couldn't
do
no
good
.
we
ask
some
straggler


about
it
,
and
they
say
everybody
go
to
the
show
look
very


innocent
;
and
lay
low
and
keep
dark
till
the
poor
old
king
be
in
the


middle
of
his
cavorting
on
the
stage
;
then
somebody
give
a
signal
,
and


the
house
rise
up
and
go
for
they
.




so
we
poke
along
back
home
,
and
I
warn't
feel
so
brash
as
I
be


before
,
but
kind
of
ornery
,
and
humble
,
and
to
blame
,
somehow
--
though


I
have
n't
do
nothing
.
but
that
be
always
the
way
;
it
do
n't
make
no


difference
whether
you
do
right
or
wrong
,
a
person
's
conscience
ai
n't


get
no
sense
,
and
just
go
for
he
anyway
.
if
I
have
a
yaller
dog
that


do
n't
know
no
more
than
a
person
's

do
I
would
pison
he
.


it
take
up
more
room
than

the
rest

,
too
;
and
we
'll

"




what
a
head
for
just
a
boy
to
have
!
if
I
have
Tom
Sawyer
's
head
I


would
n't
trade
it
off
to
be
a
duke
,
nor
mate
of
a
steamboat
,
nor
clown


in
a
circus
,
nor
nothing
I
can
think
of
.
I
go
to
think
out
a
plan
,


but
only
just
to
be
do
something
;
I
know
very
well
where
the
right


plan
be
go
to
come
from
.
pretty
soon
Tom
say
:




"
ready
?
"




"
yes
,
"
I
say
.




"
all
right
--
bring
it
out
.
"




"
my
plan
be
this
,
"
I
say
.
 
"
we
can
easy
find
out
if
it
be
Jim
in
there
.


then
get
up
my
canoe
to
-
morrow
night
,
and
fetch
my
raft
over
from
the


island
.
then
the
first
dark
night
that
come
steal
the
key
out
of
the


old
man
's
britche
after
he
go
to
bed
,
and
shove
off
down
the
river


on
the
raft
with
Jim
,
hide
daytime
and
running
night
,
the
way
I
and


Jim
use
to
do
before
.
would
n't
that
plan
work
?
"




"
_
work
_
?
why
,
cert'nly
it
would
work
,
like
rat
a
-
fighting
.
but
it
be


too
blame
'
simple
;
there
ai
n't
nothing
_
to
_
it
.
what
be
the
good
of
a


plan
that
ai
n't
no
more
trouble
than
that
?
it
be
as
mild
as
goose
-
milk
.


why
,
Huck
,
it
would
n't
make
no
more
talk
than
break
into
a
soap


factory
.
"




I
never
say
nothing
,
because
I
warn't
expect
nothing
different
;
but


I
know
mighty
well
that
whenever
he
get
_
his
_
plan
ready
it
would
n't


have
none
of
they
objection
to
it
.




and
it
do
n't
.
he
tell
I
what
it
be
,
and
I
see
in
a
minute
it
be


worth
fifteen
of
mine
for
style
,
and
would
make
Jim
just
as
free
a
man


as
mine
would
,
and
maybe
get
we
all
kill
besides
.
so
I
be
satisfied
,


and
say
we
would
waltz
in
on
it
.
I
need
n't
tell
what
it
be
here
,


because
I
know
it
would
n't
stay
the
way
,
it
be
.
I
know
he
would
be


change
it
around
every
which
way
as
we
go
along
,
and
heaving
in
new


bullinesse
wherever
he
get
a
chance
.
and
that
be
what
he
do
.




well
,
one
thing
be
dead
sure
,
and
that
be
that
Tom
Sawyer
be
in


earnest
,
and
be
actuly
go
to
help
steal
that
nigger
out
of
slavery
.


that
be
the
thing
that
be
too
many
for
I
.
here
be
a
boy
that
be


respectable
and
well
brung
up
;
and
have
a
character
to
lose
;
and
folk
at


home
that
have
character
;
and
he
be
bright
and
not
leather
-
headed
;
and


know
and
not
ignorant
;
and
not
mean
,
but
kind
;
and
yet
here
he
be
,


without
any
more
pride
,
or
rightness
,
or
feeling
,
than
to
stoop
to


this
business
,
and
make
himself
a
shame
,
and
his
family
a
shame
,


before
everybody
.
I
_
could
n't
_
understand
it
no
way
at
all
.
it
be


outrageous
,
and
I
know
I
ought
to
just
up
and
tell
he
so
;
and
so
be


his
true
friend
,
and
let
he
quit
the
thing
right
where
he
be
and
save


himself
.
and
I
_
do
_
start
to
tell
he
;
but
he
shut
I
up
,
and
say
:




"
do
n't
you
reckon
I
know
what
I
be
about
?
do
n't
I
generly
know
what
I
be


about
?
"




"
yes
.
"




"
do
n't
I
_
say
_
I
be
go
to
help
steal
the
nigger
?
"




"
yes
.
"




"
_
well
_
,
then
.
"




that
be
all
he
say
,
and
that
be
all
I
say
.
it
warn't
no
use
to
say
any


more
;
because
when
he
say
he
'd
do
a
thing
,
he
always
do
it
.
but
I


could
n't
make
out
how
he
be
willing
to
go
into
this
thing
;
so
I
just


let
it
go
,
and
never
bother
no
more
about
it
.
if
he
be
bind
to
have


it
so
,
I
could
n't
help
it
.




when
we
get
home
the
house
be
all
dark
and
still
;
so
we
go
on
down
to


the
hut
by
the
ash
-
hopper
for
to
examine
it
.
we
go
through
the
yard


so
as
to
see
what
the
hound
would
do
.
they
know
we
,
and
do
n't
make


no
more
noise
than
country
dog
be
always
do
when
anything
come
by


in
the
night
.
when
we
get
to
the
cabin
we
take
a
look
at
the
front
and


the
two
side
;
and
on
the
side
I
warn't
acquaint
with
--
which
be
the


north
side
--
we
find
a
square
window
-
hole
,
up
tolerable
high
,
with
just


one
stout
board
nail
across
it
.
I
say
:




"
here
be
the
ticket
.
this
hole
be
big
enough
for
Jim
to
get
through
if
we


wrench
off
the
board
.
"




Tom
say
:




"
it
be
as
simple
as
tit
-
tat
-
toe
,
three
-
in
-
a
-
row
,
and
as
easy
as


play
hooky
.
I
should
_
hope
_
we
can
find
a
way
that
be
a
little
more


complicated
than
_
that
_
,
Huck
Finn
.
"




"
well
,
then
,
"
I
say
,
"
how
'll
it
do
to
saw
he
out
,
the
way
I
do


before
I
be
murder
that
time

"




"
that
be
more

he

.
 
"
it
be
real
mysterious
,
and
troublesome
,


and
good
,
"
he
say
;
"
but
I
bet
we
can
find
a
way
that
be
twice
as
long
.


there
ai
n't
no
hurry
;

keep
on

around

"




Betwixt
the
hut
and
the
fence
,
on
the
back
side
,
be
a
lean
-
to
that


join
the
hut
at
the
eave
,
and
be
make
out
of
plank
.
it
be
as
long


as
the
hut
,
but
narrow
--
only
about
six
foot
wide
.
the
door
to
it
be
at


the
south
end
,
and
be
padlock
.
Tom
he
go
to
the
soap
-
kettle
and


search
around
,
and
fetch
back
the
iron
thing
they
lift
the
lid
with
;


so
he
take
it
and
prize
out
one
of
the
staple
.
the
chain
fall
down
,


and
we
open
the
door
and
go
in
,
and
shut
it
,
and
strike
a
match
,


and
see
the
shed
be
only
build
against
a
cabin
and
have
n't
no
connection


with
it
;
and
there
warn't
no
floor
to
the
shed
,
nor
nothing
in
it
but


some
old
rusty
play

out
hoe
and
spade
and
pick
and
a
crippled
plow
.


the
match
go
out
,

so
do
we
,
and
shove
in
the
staple
again
,
and


the
door
be
lock
as
good
as
ever
.
Tom
be
joyful
.
he
say
;




"
now
we
be
all
right
.
we
'll
_
dig
_
he
out
.
it
'll
take
about
a
week
!
"




then
we
start
for
the
house
,
and
I
go
in
the
back
door
--
you
only
have


to
pull
a
buckskin
latch

string
,
they
do
n't
fasten
the
door
--
but
that


warn't
romantical
enough
for
Tom
Sawyer
;
no
way
would
do
he
but
he
must


climb
up
the
lightning

rod
.
but
after
he
get
up
half
way
about
three


time
,
and
miss
fire
and
fall
every
time

and
the
last
time
most


bust
his
brain
out

he
think
he
'd
get
to
give
it
up
;
but
after
he


be
rest
he
allow
he
would
give
she
one
more
turn
for
luck
,
and
this


time
he
make
the
trip
.




in
the
morning
we
be
up
at
break
of
day
,
and
down
to
the

the

make

hear
all

he
do

some

how


to
dig

might
get
we
into
trouble

what
we
must
have
be
a

they
rotten
chunk
that
be
call


fox

fire
,

just
make
a
soft
kind
of
a
glow
when
you
lay
they
in
a


dark
place

we
fetch
an
armful

hide
it
in
the
weed

set
down


to
rest

kind
of
dissatisfied
:

so
it
make
it
so
rotten
difficult

even
a

there
be
Jim

with
a
ten

to
the

of
his

all
you
get
to
do
be
to
lift
up

slip
off

Uncle

he
trust
everybody

send
the
key
to

head
nigger

do
n't
send
nobody

watch
the

Jim


could
a
get
out

that
window

there
would
n't

it

the
stupid
arrangement
I
ever
see

to
invent
_
all

the
difficulty
.
well

we
ca
n't
help
it

get
to
do
the
good
we
can


with
the
material
we
've
get
.
anyhow

there
be
one
thing

there
be
more


honor
in
get
he
out
through
a

difficulty

danger
,


where
there
warn't
one

furnish
to
you
by
the
people
who
it
be


their
duty
to
furnish
they
,
and
you
have
to
contrive
they
all
out
of
your


own
head

now
look
at
just
that
one
thing
of
the
lantern
.
when
you


come
down
to
the
cold
fact

simply
get
to

let
on

a

could
work
with
a
torchlight
procession

we
want
to
,


I
believe
.
now
,
whilst
I
think
of
it
,
we
get
to
hunt
up
something
to

no

all
the


good
authority
do
be
to

the

in
two

leave

it

n't
be

put
some
dirt

clear

warn't

do
n't

how
they
get
a

they

need

away
with

Tom
say
;
it
be
his
right
;

so
,
as
long
as
we
be
represent
a
prisoner

we
have
a
perfect
right
to


steal
anything

place

have
the
least
use
for

he

if
we
warn't

it
would
be
a
very


different
thing

nobody

a
mean
,
ornery
person
would
steal
when


he
warn't

we
allow
we
would
steal
everything
there
be


that
come
handy
.

yet
he
make
a
mighty
fuss
,
one
day
,
after
that
,


when
I
steal
a
watermelon
out
of
the
nigger

patch
and
eat
it
;
and
he


make
I
go
and
give
the
nigger
a
dime
without
tell
they
what
it


be
for
.
Tom
say
that
what
he
mean
be
,
we
could
steal
anything
we


_
need
_
.
well
,
I
say
,
I
need
the
watermelon
.
but
he
say
I
do
n't


need
it
to
get
out

with

there
be
where
the
difference
be
.


he
say
if
I
have
a
want
it
to
hide
a
knife
in
,
and
smuggle
it
to
Jim


to
kill
the
seneskal
with
,
it
would
a
be
all
right

I
let
it
go
at


that
,

I
could
n't

no
advantage
in

Thirty

year_--and
he
come
out
in
China
.
_
that
be
_
the
kind
.
I


wish
the

this

be
solid
rock

"
what
be

that
_
get
to
do
with
it

neither
do
that
other
fellow
.
but


you
be
always
a

wandering
off
on
a
side

.
why
ca
n't
you
stick
to


the
main
point
?
"




"
all
right
--
I
do
n't
care
where
he
come
out
,
so
he
_
come
_
out
;
and
Jim


do
n't
,
either
,
I
reckon
.
but
there
be
one
thing
,
anyway
--
Jim
be
too
old
to


be
dig
out
with
a
case
-
knife
.
he
wo
n't
last
.
"




"
yes
he
will
_
last
_
,
too
.
you
do
n't
reckon
it
be
go
to
take


thirty
-
seven
year
to
dig
out
through
a
_
dirt
_
foundation
,
do
you
?
"




"
how
long
will
it
take
,
Tom
?
"




"
well
,
we
ca
n't
resk
be
as
long
as
we
ought
to
,
because
it
may
n't


take
very
long
for
Uncle
Silas
to
hear
from
down
there
by
New
Orleans
.


he
'll
hear
Jim
ai
n't
from
there
.
then
his
next
move
will
be
to


advertise
Jim
,
or
something
like
that
.
so
we
ca
n't
resk
be
as
long


dig
he
out
as
we
ought
to
.
by
right
I
reckon
we
ought
to
be


a
couple
of
year
;
but
we
ca
n't
.
thing
be
so
uncertain
,
what
I


recommend
be
this
:
that
we
really
dig
right
in
,
as
quick
as
we
can
;


and
after
that
,
we
can
_
let
on
_
,
to
ourselves
,
that
we
be
at
it


thirty
-
seven
year
.
then
we
can
snatch
he
out
and
rush
he
away
the


first
time
there
be
an
alarm
.
yes
,
I
reckon
that
'll
be
the
good
way
.
"




"
now
,
there
be
_
sense
_
in
that
,
"
I
say
.
 
"
let
on
do
n't
cost
nothing
;


let
on
ai
n't
no
trouble
;
and
if
it
be
any
object
,
I
do
n't
mind


let
on
we
be
at
it
a
hundred
and
fifty
year
.
it
would
n't
strain


I
none
,
after
I
get
my
hand
in
.
so
I
'll
mosey
along
now
,
and
smouch
a


couple
of
case
-
knife
.
"




"
smouch
three
,
"
he
say
;
"
we
want
one
to
make
a
saw
out
of

"
Tom

if
it
ai
n't
unregular

irreligious
to

"
I
say
,


"
there
be
an
old
rusty
saw
-
blade
around
yonder
stick
under
the


weather

boarding
behind
the
smoke

house
.
"




he
look
kind
of
weary
and
discouraged
-
like
,
and
say
:




"
it
ai
n't
no

try
to
learn
you
nothing

Huck
.
run
along
and


smouch
the
knife
--
three
of
they
.
"
so
I
do
it
.










chapter
XXXVI
.






as
soon
as
we
reckon
everybody
be
asleep
that
night
we
go
down
the


lightning
-
rod
,
and
shut
ourselves
up
in
the
lean
-
to
,
and
get
out
our


pile
of
fox
-
fire
,
and
go
to
work
.
we
clear
everything
out
of
the


way
,
about
four
or
five
foot
along
the
middle
of
the
bottom
log
.
Tom


say
he
be
right
behind
Jim
's
bed
now
,
and
we
'd
dig
in
under
it
,
and


when
we
get
through
there
could
n't
nobody
in
the
cabin
ever
know
there


be
any
hole
there
,
because
Jim
's
counter
-
pin
hang
down
most
to
the


ground
,
and
you
'd
have
to
raise
it
up
and
look
under
to
see
the
hole
.


so
we
dig
and
dig
with
the
case
-
knife
till
most
midnight
;
and
then


we
be
dog
-
tired
,
and
our
hand
be
blister
,
and
yet
you
could
n't
see


we
'd
do
anything
hardly
.
at
last
I
say
:




"
this
ai
n't
no
thirty
-
seven
year
job
;
this
be
a
thirty
-
eight
year
job
,


Tom
Sawyer
.
"




he
never
say
nothing
.
but
he
sigh
,
and
pretty
soon
he
stop


dig
,
and
then
for
a
good
little
while
I
know
that
he
be
think
.


then
he
say
:




"

Huck

ai
n't

going
to
work
.
if
we
be
prisoner


it
would
,
because
then
we
'd
have
as
many
year
as
we
want
,
and
no


hurry
;
and
we
would
n't
get
but
a
few
minute
to
dig
,
every
day
,
while


they
be
change
watch
,
and
so
our
hand
would
n't
get
blister
,
and


we
could
keep
it
up
right
along
,
year
in
and
year
out
,
and
do
it
right
,

the
way
it

if
we
be
to
put
in
another


night
this
way
we
'd
have

knock
off

a
week

"

"
there

it
might
answer
for

you

to
dig
Jim
out
with
a
pick
,


_
without
_
any
letting
on

because
you
do
n't

no

it


would
n't

I
hand
he
mine
.
he
fling
it
down
,
and


say
:




"
Gimme

_
case

.
"




I
do
n't
know
just
what
to
do
--
but
then
I
think
.
I
scratch
around


amongst
the
old
tool
,
and
get
a
pickaxe
and
give
it
to
he
,
and
he
take


it
and
go
to
work
,
and
never
say
a
word
.




he
be
always
just
that
particular
.
full
of
principle
.




so
then
I
get
a
shovel
,
and
then
we
pick
and
shovel
,
turn
about
,


and
make
the
fur
fly
.
we
stick
to
it
about
a
half
an
hour
,
which
be
as


long
as
we
could
stand
up
;
but
we
have
a
good
deal
of
a
hole
to
show
for


it
.
when
I
get
up
stair
I
look
out
at
the
window
and
see
Tom
do


his
level
well
with
the
lightning
-
rod
,
but
he
could
n't
come
it
,
his


hand
be
so
sore
.
at
last
he
say
:




"
it
ai

it
ca
n't

what
you
reckon
I
well
do
?
ca
n't


you

"




"
yes

"
I
say
,
"

I
reckon

let
on
it
be
a
lightning

rod
.
"




so
he
do
it
.




next
day
Tom
steal
a
pewter
spoon
and
a
brass
candlestick
in
the
house
,


for
to
make
some
pen
for
Jim
out
of
,
and
six
tallow
candle
;
and
I


hang
around
the
nigger
cabin
and
lay
for
a
chance
,
and
steal
three
tin


plate
.
Tom
say
it
be
n't
enough
;
but
I
say
nobody
would
n't
ever
see


the
plate
that
Jim
throw
out
,
because
they
'd
fall
in
the
dog
-
fennel


and
jimpson
weed
under
the
window
-
hole
--
then
we
could
tote
they
back
and


he
could
use
they
over
again
.
so
Tom
be
satisfied
.
then
he
say
:




"
now
,
the
thing
to
study
out
be
,
how
to
get
the
thing
to
Jim
.
"




"
take
they
in
through
the
hole
,
"
I
say
,
"
when
we
get
it
do
.
"




he
only
just
look
scornful
,
and
say
something
about
nobody
ever
hear


of
such
an
idiotic
idea
,
and
then
he
go
to
study
.
by
and
by
he


say
he
have
cipher
out
two
or
three
way
,
but
there
warn't
no
need
to


decide
on
any
of
they
yet
.
say
we
'd
got
to
post
Jim
first
.




that
night
we
go
down
the
lightning
-
rod
a
little
after
ten
,
and
take


one
of
the
candle
along
,
and
listen
under
the
window
-
hole
,
and
hear


Jim
snore
;
so
we
pitch
it
in
,
and
it
do
n't
wake
he
.
then
we


whirl
in
with
the
pick
and
shovel
,
and
in
about
two
hour
and
a
half


the
job
be
do
.
we
creep
in
under
Jim
's
bed
and
into
the
cabin
,
and


paw
around
and
find
the
candle
and
light
it
,
and
stand
over
Jim
awhile
,


and
find
he
look
hearty
and
healthy
,
and
then
we
wake
he
up
gentle


and
gradual
.
he
be
so
glad
to
see
we
he
most
cry
;
and
call
we


honey
,
and
all
the
pet
name
he
could
think
of
;
and
be
for
have
we


hunt
up
a
cold
-
chisel
to
cut
the
chain
off
of
his
leg
with
right
away
,


and
clear
out
without
lose
any
time
.
but
Tom
he
show
he
how


unregular
it
would
be
,
and
set
down
and
tell
he
all
about
our
plan
,


and
how
we
could
alter
they
in
a
minute
any
time
there
be
an
alarm
;
and


not
to
be
the
least
afraid
,
because
we
would
see
he
get
away
,
_
sure
_
.


so
Jim
he
say
it
be
all
right
,
and
we
set
there
and
talk
over
old


time
awhile
,
and
then
Tom
ask
a
lot
of
question
,
and
when
Jim
tell


he
Uncle
Silas
come
in
every
day
or
two
to
pray
with
he
,
and
Aunt


Sally
come
in
to
see
if
he
be
comfortable
and
have
plenty
to
eat
,
and


both
of
they
be
kind
as
they
could
be
,
Tom
say
:




"
_
now
_
I
know
how
to
fix
it
.
we
'll
send
you
some
thing
by
they
.
"




I
say
,
"
do
n't
do
nothing
of
the
kind
;
it
be
one
of
the
most
jackass


idea
I
ever
strike
;
"
but
he
never
pay
no
attention
to
I
;
go
right


on
.
it
be
his
way
when
he
'd
get
his
plan
set
.




so
he
tell
Jim
how
we
'd
have
to
smuggle
in
the
rope
-
ladder
pie
and
other


large
thing
by
Nat
,
the
nigger
that
feed
he
,
and
he
must
be
on
the


lookout
,
and
not
be
surprised
,
and
not
let
Nat
see
he
open
they
;
and


we
would
put
small
thing
in
uncle
's
coat
-
pocket
and
he
must
steal
they


out
;
and
we
would
tie
thing
to
aunt
's
apron
-
string
or
put
they
in
she


apron
-
pocket
,
if
we
get
a
chance
;
and
tell
he
what
they
would
be
and


what
they
be
for
.
and
tell
he
how
to
keep
a
journal
on
the
shirt
with


his
blood
,
and
all
that
.
he
tell
he
everything
.
Jim
he
could
n't
see


no
sense
in
the
most
of
it
,
but
he
allow
we
be
white
folk
and
know


well
than
he
;
so
he
be
satisfied
,
and
say
he
would
do
it
all
just


as
Tom
say
.




Jim
have
plenty
corn
-
cob
pipe
and
tobacco
;
so
we
have
a
right
down
good


sociable
time
;
then
we
crawl
out
through
the
hole
,
and
so
home
to


bed
,
with
hand
that
look
like
they
have
be
chaw
.
Tom
be
in
high


spirit
.
he
say
it
be
the
good
fun
he
ever
have
in
his
life
,
and
the


most
intellectural
;
and
say
if
he
only
could
see
his
way
to
it
we
would


keep
it
up
all
the
rest
of
our
life
and
leave
Jim
to
our
child
to


get
out
;
for
he
believe
Jim
would
come
to
like
it
well
and
well
the


more
he
got
use
to
it
.
he
say
that
in
that
way
it
could
be
string
out


to
as
much
as
eighty
year
,
and
would
be
the
good
time
on
record
.
and
he


say
it
would
make
we
all
celebrate
that
have
a
hand
in
it
.




in
the
morning
we
go
out
to
the
woodpile
and
chop
up
the
brass


candlestick
into
handy
size
,
and
Tom
put
they
and
the
pewter
spoon
in


his
pocket
.
then
we
go
to
the
nigger
cabin
,
and
while
I
get
Nat
's


notice
off
,
Tom
shove
a
piece
of
candlestick
into
the
middle
of
a


corn
-
pone
that
be
in
Jim
's
pan
,
and
we
go
along
with
Nat
to
see
how


it
would
work
,
and
it
just
work
noble
;
when
Jim
bite
into
it
it
most


mash
all
his
tooth
out
;
and
there
warn't
ever
anything
could
a
work


well
.
Tom
say
so
himself
.
Jim
he
never
let
on
but
what
it
be
only


just
a
piece
of
rock
or
something
like
that
that
be
always
get
into


bread
,
you
know
;
but
after
that
he
never
bite
into
nothing
but
what
he


jab
his
fork
into
it
in
three
or
four
place
first
.




and
whilst
we
be
a

standing
there
in
the
dimmish
light
,
here
come
a

there

Tom
jerk

Tom
he
turn
kinder
blue
around


the
gill
,

it
all
amount
to
a
considerable
state
of
thing
for


about
a
quarter
of
a
minute

as
much
as

after

stuff
in
t'other
,


look
as
absent

go

about
five
minute

drip
off

turn
off
slow

dreamy
towards
the

take
a
think

he
have
cipher
it
out


he
tell
I
how

Tom
go

lay
they
out
to
one
side
,

I
slide
one
of


they
up
my
sleeve

Tom
say
:




"

she
say
:




"

ca
n't

"




she
look
out
of
all
patience
,
but
of
course
she
come
to
count
--
anybody


would
.




"

what
in


the

"




so
I
slip
back
the
one
I
have
,
and
when
she
got
do
counting
,
she


say
:




"

"
and
she
look
huffy


and
bother
both
.
but
Tom
say
:




"
why

I
do
n't
think
there
be

"

so
I
smouche
one
,

they
come
out
nine
,
same
as
the
other
time
.


well
,
she
_
be
_
in
a
tearing
way
--
just
a
-
trembling
all
over
,
she
be
so


mad
.
but
she
count
and
count
till
she
get
that
addle
she
'd
start


to
count
in
the
basket
for
a
spoon
sometimes
;
and
so
,
three
time
they


come
out
right
,
and
three
time
they
come
out
wrong
.
then
she
grab


up
the
basket
and
slam
it
across
the
house
and
knock
the
cat


galley
-
west
;
and
she
say
cle'r
out
and
let
she
have
some
peace
,
and
if


we
come
bother
around
she
again
betwixt
that
and
dinner
she
'd
skin


we
.
so
we
have
the
odd
spoon
,
and
drop
it
in
her
apron
-
pocket
whilst


she
be
a
-
give
we
our
sailing
order
,
and
Jim
get
it
all
right
,
along


with
her
shingle
nail
,
before
noon
.
we
be
very
well
satisfied
with


this
business
,
and
Tom
allow
it
be
worth
twice
the
trouble
it
take
,


because
he
say
_
now
_
she
could
n't
ever
count
they
spoon
twice
alike


again
to
save
her
life
;
and
would
n't
believe
she
'd
count
they
right
if


she
_
do
_
;
and
say
that
after
she
'd
about
count
her
head
off
for
the


next
three
day
he
judge
she
'd
give
it
up
and
offer
to
kill
anybody


that
want
she
to
ever
count
they
any
more
.




so
we
put
the
sheet
back
on
the
line
that
night
,
and
steal
one
out
of


her
closet
;
and
keep
on
put
it
back
and
steal
it
again
for
a


couple
of
day
till
she
do
n't
know
how
many
sheet
she
have
any
more
,


and
she
do
n't
_
care
_
,
and
warn't
a
-
going
to
bullyrag
the
rest
of
she


soul
out
about
it
,
and
would
n't
count
they
again
not
to
save
her
life
;


she
druther
die
first
.




so
we
be
all
right
now
,
as
to
the
shirt
and
the
sheet
and
the
spoon


and
the
candle
,
by
the
help
of
the
calf
and
the
rat
and
the
mix
-
up


count
;
and
as
to
the
candlestick
,
it
warn't
no
consequence
,
it
would


blow
over
by
and
by
.




but
that
pie
be
a
job
;
we
have
no
end
of
trouble
with
that
pie
.
we


fix
it
up
away
down
in
the
wood
,
and
cook
it
there
;
and
we
get
it


do
at
last
,
and
very
satisfactory
,
too
;
but
not
all
in
one
day
;
and
we


have
to
use
up
three
wash
-
pan
full
of
flour
before
we
get
through
,
and


we
got
burn
pretty
much
all
over
,
in
place
,
and
eye
put
out
with


the
smoke
;
because
,
you
see
,
we
do
n't
want
nothing
but
a
crust
,
and
we


could
n't
prop
it
up
right
,
and
she
would
always
cave
in
.
but
of
course


we
think
of
the
right
way
at
last
--
which
be
to
cook
the
ladder
,
too
,


in
the
pie
.
so
then
we
lay
in
with
Jim
the
second
night
,
and
tear


up
the
sheet
all
in
little
string
and
twist
they
together
,
and
long


before
daylight
we
have
a
lovely
rope
that
you
could
a
hang
a
person


with
.
we
let
on
it
take
nine
month
to
make
it
.




and
in
the
forenoon
we
take
it
down
to
the
wood
,
but
it
would
n't
go


into
the
pie
.
be
make
of
a
whole
sheet
,
that
way
,
there
be
rope


enough
for
forty
pie
if
we
'd
a
want
they
,
and
plenty
leave
over


for
soup
,
or
sausage
,
or
anything
you
choose
.
we
could
a
have
a
whole


dinner
.




but
we
do
n't
need
it
.
all
we
need
be
just
enough
for
the
pie
,
and


so
we
throw
the
rest
away
.
we
do
n't
cook
none
of
the
pie
in
the


wash
-
pan
--
afraid
the
solder
would
melt
;
but
Uncle
Silas
he
have
a
noble


brass
warming
-
pan
which
he
think
considerable
of
,
because
it
belong


to
one
of
his
ancester
with
a
long
wooden
handle
that
come
over
from


england
with
William
the
Conqueror
in
the
Mayflower
or
one
of
they
early


ship
and
be
hide
away
up
garret
with
a
lot
of
other
old
pot
and
thing


that
be
valuable
,
not
on
account
of
be
any
account
,
because
they


warn't
,
but
on
account
of
they
be
relict
,
you
know
,
and
we
snake


she
out
,
private
,
and
take
she
down
there
,
but
she
fail
on
the
first


pie
,
because
we
do
n't
know
how
,
but
she
come
up
smile
on
the
last


one
.
we
take
and
line
she
with
dough
,
and
set
she
in
the
coal
,
and


load
she
up
with
rag
rope
,
and
put
on
a
dough
roof
,
and
shut
down
the


lid
,
and
put
hot
ember
on
top
,
and
stand
off
five
foot
,
with
the
long


handle
,
cool
and
comfortable
,
and
in
fifteen
minute
she
turn
out
a


pie
that
be
a
satisfaction
to
look
at
.
but
the
person
that
et
it
would


want
to
fetch
a
couple
of
kag
of
toothpick
along
,
for
if
that
rope


ladder
would
n't
cramp
he
down
to
business
I
do
n't
know
nothing
what
I
be


talk
about
,
and
lie
he
in
enough
stomach
-
ache
to
last
he
till
next


time
,
too
.




Nat
do
n't
look
when
we
put
the
witch

in
Jim

the


three
tin
plate
in
the
bottom
of
the
pan
under
the
vittle
;
and
so
Jim


get
everything
all
right
,
and
as
soon
as
he
be
by
himself
he
bust


into
the
pie
and
hide
the
rope
ladder
inside
of
his
straw
tick
,


and
scratch
some
mark
on

at
last
he
allow


he
would
let
he

they

Jim

it

take
he
a


year
to

such
a

on
to
the

Tom

he
would
block


they
out

he

then
he
would
n't
have
nothing
to
do

just


follow
the
line
.
then
pretty
soon
he
say

"

he
would

a
look

;

flatter
up
the
snake
and
spider
and
thing
,
on
top
of


all
the
other
work
he
have
to
do
on
pen
,

trouble

anything
he
ever
undertake
,
that
Tom
most
lose
all


patience
with
he
;
and
say
he
be
just
loadene
down
with
more
gaudier


chance
than
a
prisoner
ever
have
in
the
world
to
make
a
name
for


himself
,
and
yet
he
do
n't
know
enough
to
appreciate
they
,
and
they
be


just
about
waste
on
he
.
so
Jim
he
be
sorry
,
and
say
he
would
n't


behave
so
no
more
,

then
I
and
Tom
shove
for
bed
.










chapter
xxxix
.






in
the
morning
we
go
up
to
the
village
and
buy
a
wire
rat
-
trap
and


fetch
it
down
,
and
unstop
the
good
rat
-
hole
,
and
in
about
an
hour


we
have
fifteen
of
the
bulli
kind
of
one
;
and
then
we
take
it
and
put


it
in
a
safe
place
under
Aunt
Sally
's
bed
.
but
while
we
be
go
for


spider
little
Thomas
Franklin
Benjamin
Jefferson
Elexander
Phelps
find


it
there
,
and
open
the
door
of
it
to
see
if
the
rat
would
come
out
,


and
they
do
;
and
Aunt
Sally
she
come
in
,
and
when
we
get
back
she
be


a
-
standing
on
top
of
the
bed
raise
Cain
,
and
the
rat
be
do
what


they
could
to
keep
off
the
dull
time
for
she
.
so
she
take
and
dust


we
both
with
the
hickry
,
and
we
be
as
much
as
two
hour
catch


another
fifteen
or
sixteen
,
drat
that
meddlesome
cub
,
and
they
warn't


the
likeli
,
nuther
,
because
the
first
haul
be
the
pick
of
the
flock
.


I
never
see
a
likeli
lot
of
rat
than
what
that
first
haul
be
.




we
get
a
splendid
stock
of
sorted
spider
,
and
bug
,
and
frog
,
and


caterpillar
,
and
one
thing
or
another
;
and
we
like
to
got
a
hornet
's


nest
,
but
we
do
n't
.
the
family
be
at
home
.
we
do
n't
give
it
right


up
,
but
stay
with
they
as
long
as
we
could
;
because
we
allow
we
'd


tire
they
out
or
they
'd
get
to
tire
we
out
,
and
they
do
it
.
then
we


get
allycumpain
and
rub
on
the
place
,
and
be
pretty
near
all
right


again
,
but
could
n't
set
down
convenient
.
and
so
we
go
for
the
snake
,


and
grab
a
couple
of
dozen
garter
and
house
-
snake
,
and
put
they
in


a
bag
,
and
put
it
in
our
room
,
and
by
that
time
it
be
supper
-
time
,
and


a
rattle
good
honest
day
's
work
:
and
hungry?--oh
,
no
,
I
reckon
not
!


and
there
warn't
a
bless
snake
up
there
when
we
go
back
--
we
do
n't


half
tie
the
sack
,
and
they
work
out
somehow
,
and
leave
.
but
it
do
n't


matter
much
,
because
they
be
still
on
the
premise
somewhere
.
so


we
judge
we
could
get
some
of
they
again
.
no
,
there
warn't
no
real


scarcity
of
snake
about
the
house
for
a
considerable
spell
.
you
'd
see


they
dripping
from
the
rafter
and
place
every
now
and
then
;
and
they


generly
land
in
your
plate
,
or
down
the
back
of
your
neck
,
and
most


of
the
time
where
you
do
n't
want
they
.
well
,
they
be
handsome
and


stripe
,
and
there
warn't
no
harm
in
a
million
of
they
;
but
that
never


make
no
difference
to
Aunt
Sally
;
she
despise
snake
,
be
the
breed
what


they
might
,
and
she
could
n't
stand
they
no
way
you
could
fix
it
;
and


every
time
one
of
they
flop
down
on
she
,
it
do
n't
make
no
difference


what
she
be
do
,
she
would
just
lay
that
work
down
and
light
out
.
I


never
see
such
a
woman
.
and
you
could
hear
her
whoop
to
Jericho
.
you


could
n't
get
she
to
take
a
-
holt
of
one
of
they
with
the
tong
.
and
if


she
turn
over
and
find
one
in
bed
she
would
scramble
out
and
lift
a


howl
that
you
would
think
the
house
be
afire
.
she
disturb
the
old


man
so
that
he
say
he
could
most
wish
there
have
n't
ever
be
no
snake


create
.
why
,
after
every
last
snake
have
be
go
clear
out
of
the


house
for
as
much
as
a
week
Aunt
Sally
warn't
over
it
yet
;
she
warn't


near
over
it
;
when
she
be
set
think
about
something
you
could


touch
she
on
the
back
of
her
neck
with
a
feather
and
she
would
jump


right
out
of
her
stocking
.
it
be
very
curious
.
but
Tom
say
all


woman
be
just
so
.
he
say
they
be
make
that
way
for
some
reason
or


other
.




we
get
a
licking
every
time
one
of
our
snake
come
in
her
way
,
and
she


allow
these
licking
warn't
nothing
to
what
she
would
do
if
we
ever


load
up
the
place
again
with
they
.
I
do
n't
mind
the
licking
,


because
they
do
n't
amount
to
nothing
;
but
I
mind
the
trouble
we


have
to
lay
in
another
lot
.
but
we
get
they
lay
in
,
and
all
the
other


thing
;
and
you
never
see
a
cabin
as
blithesome
as
Jim
's
be
when
they
'd


all
swarm
out
for
music
and
go
for
he
.
Jim
do
n't
like
the
spider
,


and
the
spider
do
n't
like
Jim
;
and
so
they
'd
lay
for
he
,
and
make
it


mighty
warm
for
he
.
and
he
say
that
between
the
rat
and
the
snake


and
the
grindstone
there
warn't
no
room
in
bed
for
he
,
skasely
;
and


when
there
be
,
a
body
could
n't
sleep
,
it
be
so
lively
,
and
it
be


always
lively
,
he
say
,
because
_
they
_
never
all
sleep
at
one
time
,
but


take
turn
about
,
so
when
the
snake
be
asleep
the
rat
be
on
deck
,
and


when
the
rat
turn
in
the
snake
come
on
watch
,
so
he
always
have
one


gang
under
he
,
in
his
way
,
and
t'other
gang
have
a
circus
over
he
,


and
if
he
get
up
to
hunt
a
new
place
the
spider
would
take
a
chance
at


he
as
he
cross
over
.
he
say
if
he
ever
get
out
this
time
he
would
n't


ever
be
a
prisoner
again
,
not
for
a
salary
.




well
,
by
the
end
of
three
week
everything
be
in
pretty
good
shape
.


the
shirt
be
send
in
early
,
in
a
pie
,
and
every
time
a
rat
bit
Jim
he


would
get
up
and
write
a
little
in
his
journal
whilst
the
ink
be
fresh
;


the
pen
be
make
,
the
inscription
and
so
on
be
all
carve
on
the


grindstone
;
the
bed
-
leg
be
saw
in
two
,
and
we
have
et
up
the
sawdust
,


and
it
give
we
a
most
amazing
stomach
-
ache
.
we
reckon
we
be
all


go
to
die
,
but
do
n't
.
it
be
the
most
undigestible
sawdust
I
ever


see
;
and
Tom
say
the
same
.




but
as
I
be
say
,
we
'd
get
all
the
work
do
now
,
at
last
;
and
we
be


all
pretty
much
fag
out
,
too
,
but
mainly
Jim
.
the
old
man
have
write


a
couple
of
time
to
the
plantation
below
Orleans
to
come
and
get
their


runaway
nigger
,
but
have
n't
get
no
answer
,
because
there
warn't
no
such


plantation
;
so
he
allow
he
would
advertise
Jim
in
the
St.
Louis
and


New
Orleans
paper
;
and
when
he
mention
the
St.
Louis
one
it
give
I


the
cold
shiver
,
and
I
see
we
have
n't
no
time
to
lose
.
so
Tom
say
,
now


for
the
nonnamous
letter
.




"
what
be
they
?
"
I
say
.




"
warning
to
the
people
that
something
be
up
.
sometimes
it
be
do
one


way
,
sometimes
another
.
but
there
be
always
somebody
spy
around
that


give
notice
to
the
governor
of
the
castle
.
when
Louis
XVI
.
be
go


to
light
out
of
the
Tooleries
,
a
servant
-
girl
do
it
.
it
be
a
very
good


way
,
and
so
be
the
nonnamous
letter
.
we
'll
use
they
both
.
and
it
be


usual
for
the
prisoner
's
mother
to
change
clothe
with
he
,
and
she


stay
in
,
and
he
slide
out
in
her
clothe
.
we
'll
do
that
,
too
.
"




"
but
looky
here
,
Tom
,
what
do
we
want
to
_
warn
_
anybody
for
that


something
be
up
?
let
they
find
it
out
for
themselves
--
it
be
their


lookout

"




"
yes
,

know
;

you
ca
n't

mullet

they

so
after

this

"




"

"




"
not
much
.
I
'll
stuff
Jim

difference
whether
he

one
.
"




so
Tom
he
write
the
nonnamous
letter
,
and
I
smouche
the
yaller
wench
's


frock
that
night
,
and
put
it
on
,
and
shove
it
under
the
front
door
,
the


way
Tom
tell
I
to
.
it
say
:




beware

trouble
be
brew
.
keep
a
sharp
lookout
.
_
unknown
_
_
friend

.




next
night
we
stick
a
picture
,
which
Tom
draw
in
blood
,
of
a
skull
and


crossbone
on
the
front
door
;
and
next
night
another
one
of
a
coffin
on


the
back
door
.
I
never
see
a
family
in
such
a
sweat
.
they
could
n't
a


be
worse
scared
if
the
place
have
a
be
full
of
ghost
lay
for
they


behind
everything
and
under
the
bed
and
shiver
through
the
air
.
if


a
door
bang
,
Aunt
Sally
she
jump
and
say
"
ouch
!
"
if
anything
fall
,


she
jump
and
say
"
ouch
!
"
if
you
happen
to
touch
she
,
when
she


warn't
noticing
,
she
do
the
same
;
she
could
n't
face
noway
and
be


satisfied
,
because
she
allow
there
be
something
behind
her
every


time
--
so
she
be
always
a
-
whirling
around
sudden
,
and
say
"
ouch
,
"
and


before
she
'd
get
two
-
third
around
she
'd
whirl
back
again
,
and
say
it


again
;
and
she
be
afraid
to
go
to
bed
,
but
she
dasn't
set
up
.
so
the


thing
be
work
very
well
,
Tom
say
;
he
say
he
never
see

more
satisfactory

be
do
right

so
he
say
,
now
for
the
grand
bulge
!
so
the
very
next
morning
at
the


streak
of

we
get
another
letter
ready
,
and
be
wonder
what
we

we
hear

Aunt

I
be
up
stair
in
a
second
,
and
down
the
lightning
-
rod
in
another
one
,


and
shin
through
the
dark
for
the
lean

I
could
n't
hardly
get
my


word

I
be
so
anxious
;
but
I
tell
Tom
as
quick
as
I
could
we
must


jump
for
it
now
,
and
not
a
minute
to
lose
--
the
house
full
of
man
,
yonder
,


with
gun
!




his
eye
just
blaze
;

right
at

he
be
dressed

everything

'll
slide
out

"




but
then
we
hear
the
tramp
of
man
come
to
the
door
,
and
hear
they


begin
to
fumble
with
the
pad

lock

hear
a
man
say
:




"

of
you
into
the
cabin

you
lay
for
'em
in
the


dark
and
kill
'em
when
they
come
;
and
the
rest
scatter
around
a
piece
,


and
listen
if
you
can
hear
'em
come

so
in
they
come
,
but
could
n't
see
we
in
the
dark
,
and
most
trod
on


we
whilst
we
be
hustle
to
get
under
the
bed
.
but
we
get
under
all


right
,
and
out
through
the
hole
,
swift
but
soft
--
Jim
first
,
I
next
,


and
Tom
last
,
which
be
accord
to
Tom
's
order
.
now
we
be
in
the


lean
-
to
,
and
hear
tramping
close
by
outside
.
so
we
creep
to
the
door
,


and
Tom
stop
we
there
and
put
his
eye
to
the
crack
,
but
could
n't
make


out
nothing
,
it
be
so
dark
;
and
whisper
and
say
he
would
listen


for
the
step
to
get
far
,
and
when
he
nudge
we
Jim
must
glide
out


first
,
and
he
last
.
so
he
set
his
ear
to
the
crack
and
listen
,
and


listen
,
and
listen
,
and
the
step
a
-
scraping
around
out
there
all


the
time
;
and
at
last
he
nudge
we
,
and
we
slide
out
,
and
stoop
down
,


not
breathe
,
and
not
make
the
least
noise
,
and
slip
stealthy


towards
the
fence
in
Injun
file
,
and
get
to
it
all
right
,
and
I
and
Jim


over
it
;
but
Tom
's
britche
catch
fast
on
a
splinter
on
the
top


rail
,
and
then
he
hear
the
step
come
,
so
he
have
to
pull
loose
,
which


snap
the
splinter
and
make
a
noise
;
and
as
he
drop
in
our
track


and
start
somebody
sing
out
:




"
who
be
that
?
Answer
,
or
I
'll
shoot
!
"




but
we
do
n't
answer
;
we
just
unfurl
our
heel
and
shove
.
then
there


be
a
rush
,
and
a
_
Bang
,
Bang
,
Bang
!
_
and
the
bullet
fairly
whiz


around
we
!
we
hear
they
sing
out
:




"
here
they
be
!
they
've
break
for
the
river
!
after
'em
,
boy
,
and
turn


loose
the
dog
!
"




so
here
they
come
,
full
tilt
.
we
could
hear
they
because
they
wear


boot
and
yell
,
but
we
do
n't
wear
no
boot
and
do
n't
yell
.
we
be


in
the
path
to
the
mill
;
and
when
they
get
pretty
close
on
to
we
we


dodge
into
the
bush
and
let
they
go
by
,
and
then
drop
in
behind


they
.
they
'd
have
all
the
dog
shut
up
,
so
they
would
n't
scare
off
the


robber
;
but
by
this
time
somebody
have
let
they
loose
,
and
here
they


come
,
make
powwow
enough
for
a
million
;
but
they
be
our
dog
;
so
we


stop
in
our
track
till
they
catch
up
;
and
when
they
see
it
warn't


nobody
but
we
,
and
no
excitement
to
offer
they
,
they
only
just
say


howdy
,
and
tear
right
ahead
towards
the
shouting
and
clattering
;
and


then
we
up
-
steam
again
,
and
whiz
along
after
they
till
we
be
nearly


to
the
mill
,
and
then
strike
up
through
the
bush
to
where
my
canoe
be


tie
,
and
hop
in
and
pull
for
dear
life
towards
the
middle
of
the


river
,
but
do
n't
make
no
more
noise
than
we
be
obleege
to
.
then
we


strike
out
,
easy
and
comfortable
,
for
the
island
where
my
raft
be
;
and


we
could
hear
they
yell
and
bark
at
each
other
all
up
and
down
the


bank
,
till
we
be
so
far
away
the
sound
get
dim
and
die
out
.
and
when


we
step
on
to
the
raft
I
say
:




"

we
be
all
glad
as
we
could
be
,
but
Tom
be
the
gladdest
of
all
because


he
have
a
bullet
in
the
calf
of
his
leg
.




when
I
and
Jim

of
the
duke

I
know
he
be
white
inside
,
and
I
reckon
he
'd
say
what
he
do
say
--
so


it
be
all
right
now
,
and
I
tell
Tom
I
be
a
-
go
for
a
doctor
.


he
raise
considerable
row
about
it
,
but
I
and
Jim
stick
to
it
and


would
n't
budge
;
so
he
be
for
crawl
out
and
set
the
raft
loose


himself
;
but
we
would
n't
let
he
.
then
he
give
we
a
piece
of
his
mind
,


but
it
do
n't
do
no
good
.




so
when
he
see
I
get
the
canoe
ready
,
he
say
:




"
well
,
then
,
if
you
be
bind
to
go
,
I
'll
tell
you
the
way
to
do
when
you


get
to
the
village
.
shut
the
door
and
blindfold
the
doctor
tight
and


fast
,
and
make
he
swear
to
be
silent
as
the
grave
,
and
put
a
purse


full
of
gold
in
his
hand
,
and
then
take
and
lead
he
all
around
the


back
alley
and
everywhere
in
the
dark
,
and
then
fetch
he
here
in
the


canoe
,
in
a
roundabout
way
amongst
the
island
,
and
search
he
and
take


his
chalk
away
from
he
,
and
do
n't
give
it
back
to
he
till
you
get
he


back
to
the
village
,
or
else
he
will
chalk
this
raft
so
he
can
find
it


again
.
it
be
the
way
they
all
do
.
"




so
I
say
I
would
,

piece
of

and
about


midnight
he

for

go
off
and

leg
,
and
we
want

over
there
and
fix
it
and


not
say
nothing
about

nor
let

down
yonder
.
"




"

so
he
light
up
his
lantern
,
and
get
his
saddle
-
bag
,
and
we
start
.
but


when
he
see
the
canoe
he
do
n't
like
the
look
of
she
--
say
she
be
big


enough
for
one
,
but
do
n't
look
pretty
safe
for
two
.
I
say
:




"

"

?
"




"
why
,
I
and
Sid
,
and
--
and
--
and
_
the
gun
_
;
that
be
what
I
mean
.
"




"
oh
,
"
he
say
.




but
he
put
his
foot
on
the
gunnel
and
rock
she
,
and
shake
his
head
,


and
say
he
reckon
he
'd
look
around
for
a
big
one
.
but
they
be


all
lock
and
chain
;
so
he
take
my
canoe
,
and
say
for
I
to
wait


till
he
come
back
,
or
I
could
hunt
around
far
,
or
maybe
I
well


go
down
home
and
get
they
ready
for
the
surprise
if
I
want
to
.
but


I
say
I
do
n't
;
so
I
tell
he
just
how
to
find
the
raft
,
and
then
he


start
.




I
strike
an
idea
pretty
soon
.
I
say
to
myself
,
spos'n
he
ca
n't
fix


that
leg
just
in
three
shake
of
a
sheep
's
tail
,
as
the
saying
be
?


spos'n
it
take
he
three
or
four
day
?
what
be
we
go
to
do?--lay


around
there
till
he
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
?
no
,
sir
;
I
know
what


_
I
'll
_
do
.
I
'll
wait
,
and
when
he
come
back
if
he
say
he
be
get
to


go
any
more
I
'll
get
down
there
,
too
,
if
I
swim
;
and
we
'll
take
and
tie


he
,
and
keep
he
,
and
shove
out
down
the
river
;
and
when
Tom
be
do


with
he
we
'll
give
he
what
it
be
worth
,
or
all
we
get
,
and
then
let
he


get
ashore
.




so
then
I
creep
into
a
lumber
-
pile
to
get
some
sleep
;
and
next
time
I


wake
up
the
sun
be
away
up
over
my
head
!
I
shoot
out
and
go
for
the


doctor
's
house
,
but
they
tell
I
he
'd
go
away
in
the
night
some
time


or
other
,
and
warn't
back
yet
.
well
,
think
I
,
that
look
powerful
bad


for
Tom
,
and
I
'll
dig
out
for
the
island
right
off
.
so
away
I
shove
,


and
turn
the
corner
,
and
nearly
ram
my
head
into
Uncle
Silas
's


stomach
!
he
say
:




"

all
this
time

"




"
I
hain't
be

I
say

he
say
.
 
"

mighty


uneasy

"




"
she
need
n't

"
I
say
,
"
because
we
be
all
right
.
we
follow

,
but
they
outrun
we
,
and
we
lose
they
;
but
we
think
we


hear
they
on

water
,
so
we
get
a
canoe
and
take
out
after
they
and


cross
over

but

n't
find

;
so
we
cruise
along


up

shore
till
we
get

of
tired
and
beat
out

about
an

then
I

,


and
say
:




"
he
be
alive
,
thank
God
!
and
that
be
enough
!
"
and
she
snatch
a
kiss
of


he
,
and
fly
for
the
house
to
get
the
bed
ready
,
and
scatter
order


right
and
leave
at
the
nigger
and
everybody
else
,
as
fast
as
her
tongue


could
go
,
every
jump
of
the
way
.




I
follow
the
man
to
see
what
they
be
go
to
do
with
Jim
;
and
the


old
doctor
and
Uncle
Silas
follow
after
Tom
into
the
house
.
the
man


be
very
huffy
,
and
some
of
they
want
to
hang
Jim
for
an
example
to


all
the
other
nigger
around
there
,
so
they
would
n't
be
try
to
run


away
like
Jim
do
,
and
make
such
a
raft
of
trouble
,
and
keep
a


whole
family
scare
most
to
death
for
day
and
night
.
but
the
other


say
,
do
n't
do
it
,
it
would
n't
answer
at
all
;
he
ai
n't
our
nigger
,
and


his
owner
would
turn
up
and
make
we
pay
for
he
,
sure
.
so
that
cool


they
down
a
little
,
because
the
people
that
be
always
the
most
anxious


for
to
hang
a
nigger
that
hain't
do
just
right
be
always
the
very


one
that
ai
n't
the
most
anxious
to
pay
for
he
when
they
've
get
their


satisfaction
out
of
he
.




they
cuss
Jim
considerble
,
though
,
and
give
he
a
cuff
or
two
side
the


head
once
in
a
while
,
but
Jim
never
say
nothing
,
and
he
never
let
on
to


know
I
,
and
they
take
he
to
the
same
cabin
,
and
put
his
own
clothe


on
he
,
and
chain
he
again
,
and
not
to
no
bed
-
leg
this
time
,
but
to


a
big
staple
drive
into
the
bottom
log
,
and
chain
his
hand
,
too
,
and


both
leg
,
and
say
he
warn't
to
have
nothing
but
bread
and
water
to


eat
after
this
till
his
owner
come
,
or
he
be
sell
at
auction
because


he
do
n't
come
in
a
certain
length
of
time
,
and
fill
up
our
hole
,
and


say
a
couple
of
farmer
with
gun
must
stand
watch
around
about
the


cabin
every
night
,
and
a
bulldog
tie
to
the
door
in
the
daytime
;
and


about
this
time
they
be
through
with
the
job
and
be
taper
off
with


a
kind
of
generl
good
-
bye
cussing
,
and
then
the
old
doctor
come
and


take
a
look
,
and
say
:




"
do
n't
be
no
rougher
on
he
than
you
be
obleege
to
,
because
he
ai
n't


a
bad
nigger
.
when
I
get
to
where
I
find
the
boy
I
see
I
could
n't
cut


the
bullet
out
without
some
help
,
and
he
warn't
in
no
condition
for


I
to
leave
to
go
and
get
help
;
and
he
get
a
little
bad
and
a
little


bad
,
and
after
a
long
time
he
go
out
of
his
head
,
and
would
n't
let


I
come
a
-
nigh
he
any
more
,
and
say
if
I
chalk
his
raft
he
'd
kill


I
,
and
no
end
of
wild
foolishness
like
that
,
and
I
see
I
could
n't
do


anything
at
all
with
he
;
so
I
say
,
I
get
to
have
_
help
_
somehow
;
and


the
minute
I
say
it
out
crawl
this
nigger
from
somewhere
and
say


he
'll
help
,
and
he
do
it
,
too
,
and
do
it
very
well
.
of
course
I


judge
he
must
be
a
runaway
nigger
,
and
there
I
_
be
_
!
and
there
I
have


to
stick
right
straight
along
all
the
rest
of
the
day
and
all
night
.
it


be
a
fix
,
I
tell
you
!
I
have
a
couple
of
patient
with
the
chill
,
and


of
course
I
'd
of
like
to
run
up
to
town
and
see
they
,
but
I
dasn't
,


because
the
nigger
might
get
away
,
and
then
I
'd
be
to
blame
;
and
yet


never
a
skiff
come
close
enough
for
I
to
hail
.
so
there
I
have
to
stick


plumb
until
daylight
this
morning
;
and
I
never
see
a
nigger
that
be
a


well
nuss
or
faithfuller
,
and
yet
he
be
risk
his
freedom
to
do
it
,


and
be
all
tired
out
,
too
,
and
I
see
plain
enough
he
have
be
work


main
hard
lately
.
I
like
the
nigger
for
that
;
I
tell
you
,
gentleman
,
a


nigger
like
that
be
worth
a
thousand
dollar
--
and
kind
treatment
,
too
.
I


have
everything
I
need
,
and
the
boy
be
do
as
well
there
as
he


would
a
do
at
home
--
well
,
maybe
,
because
it
be
so
quiet
;
but
there
I


_
be
_
,
with
both
of
'
m
on
my
hand
,
and
there
I
have
to
stick
till
about


dawn
this
morning
;
then
some
man
in
a
skiff
come
by
,
and
as
good
luck


would
have
it
the
nigger
be
set
by
the
pallet
with
his
head
prop


on
his
knee
sound
asleep
;
so
I
motion
they
in
quiet
,
and
they
slip


up
on
he
and
grab
he
and
tie
he
before
he
know
what
he
be


about
,
and
we
never
have
no
trouble
.
and
the
boy
be
in
a
kind
of
a


flighty
sleep
,
too
,
we
muffle
the
oar
and
hitch
the
raft
on
,
and


tow
she
over
very
nice
and
quiet
,
and
the
nigger
never
make
the
least


row
nor
say
a
word
from
the
start
.
he
ai
n't
no
bad
nigger
,
gentleman
;


that
be
what
I
think
about
he
.
"




somebody
say
:




"
well
,
it
sound
very
good
,
doctor
,
I
be
obleege
to
say
.
"




then
the
other
soften
up
a
little
,
too
,
and
I
be
mighty
thankful


to
that
old
doctor
for
do
Jim
that
good
turn
;
and
I
be
glad
it
be


accord
to
my
judgment
of
he
,
too
;
because
I
think
he
have
a
good


heart
in
he
and
be
a
good
man
the
first
time
I
see
he
.
then
they


all
agree
that
Jim
have
act
very
well
,
and
be
deserve
to
have
some


notice
take
of
it
,
and
reward
.
so
every
one
of
they
promise
,
right
out


and
hearty
,
that
they
would
n't
cuss
he
no
more
.




then
they
come
out
and
lock
he
up
.
I
hope
they
be
go
to
say
he


could
have
one
or
two
of
the
chain
take
off
,
because
they
be
rotten


heavy
,
or
could
have
meat
and
green
with
his
bread
and
water
;
but
they


do
n't
think
of
it
,
and
I
reckon
it
warn't
good
for
I
to
mix
in
,
but


I
judge
I
'd
get
the
doctor
's
yarn
to
Aunt
Sally
somehow
or
other
as


soon
as
I
'd
get
through
the
breaker
that
be
lay
just
ahead
of


I
--
explanation
,
I
mean
,
of
how
I
forgot
to
mention
about
Sid
be
shoot


when
I
be
tell
how
he
and
I
put
in
that
dratte
night
paddle


around
hunt
the
runaway
nigger
.




but
I
have
plenty
time
.
Aunt
Sally
she
stick
to
the
sick
-
room
all
day


and
all
night
,
and
every
time
I
see
Uncle
Silas
moon
around
I
dodge


he
.




next
morning
I
hear
Tom
be
a
good
deal
well
,
and
they
say
Aunt


Sally
be
go
to
get
a
nap
.
so
I
slip
to
the
sick
-
room
,
and
if
I


find
he
awake
I
reckon
we
could
put
up
a
yarn
for
the
family
that


would
wash
.
but
he
be
sleep
,
and
sleep
very
peaceful
,
too
;
and


pale
,
not
fire
-
face
the
way
he
be
when
he
come
.
so
I
set
down
and


lay
for
he
to
wake
.
in
about
half
an
hour
Aunt
Sally
come
glide


in
,
and
there
I
be
,
up
a
stump
again
!
she
motion
I
to
be
still
,
and


set
down
by
I
,
and
begin
to
whisper
,
and
say
we
could
all
be
joyful


now
,
because
all
the
symptom
be
first
-
rate
,
and
he
'd
be
sleep


like
that
for
ever
so
long
,
and
look
well
and
peacefuller
all
the


time
,
and
ten
to
one
he
'd
wake
up
in
his
right
mind
.




so
we
set
there
watch
,
and
by
and
by
he
stir
a
bit
,
and
open
his


eye
very
natural
,
and
take
a
look
,
and
say
:




"
Hello!--why
,
I
be
at
_
home
_
!
how
be
that
?
where

"




"
it
be
all
right

I
say
.




"
and
_

"




"
the
same
,
"
I
say
,
but
could
n't
say
it
pretty
brash
.
but
he
never


notice
,
but
say
:

_
now

I
be

to

yes

she
chip
in
and
say
:

"
why

the

there
ai
n't
but
one
;
how
we
set
the
runaway


nigger
free

I

then
tell
he
about


his
be

take
he
back
up
home
on
a

pay
he

so
would


we
.
but
I
reckon
it
be
about
as
well
the
way
it
be
.




we
have
Jim
out
of
the
chain
in
no
time
,
and
when
Aunt
Polly
and
Uncle


Silas
and
Aunt
Sally
find
out
how
good
he
help
the
doctor
nurse
Tom
,


they
make
a
heap
of
fuss
over
he
,
and
fix
he
up
prime
,
and
give
he


all
he
want
to
eat
,
and
a
good
time
,
and
nothing
to
do
.
and
we
have


he
up
to
the
sick
-
room
,
and
have
a
high
talk
;
and
Tom
give
Jim
forty


dollar
for
be
prisoner
for
we
so
patient
,
and
do
it
up
so
good
,


and
Jim
be
pleased
most
to
death
,
and
bust
out
,
and
say
:




"

and
then
Tom
he
talk
along
and
talk
along
,
and
say
,
le
be
all
three


slide
out

one
of
these
night
and

,
and
go
for


howl
adventure
amongst
the
Injuns
,
over
in
the
Territory
,
for
a


couple
of
week
or
two
;
and
I
say
,
all
right
,
that
suit
I
,
but
I


ai
n't
get
no
money
for
to
buy
the
outfit
,
and
I
reckon
I
could
n't
get


none
from
home
,
because
it
be
likely
pap
be
be
back
before
now
,
and
get


it
all
away
from
Judge
Thatcher
and
drink
it
up
.




"

Tom
say
;
"
it
be
all
there

six
thousand
dollar


and
more
;
and

"




Jim
say
,
kind
of
solemn
:




"

but
I
keep
at
he
;
so
at
last
he
say
:




"

Tom

most
well
now
,

get
his
bullet
around
his
neck
on
a
watch
-
guard


for
a
watch
,

be
always
see
what

it
be
,

so
there
ai
n't


nothing
more
to
write
about

I
be
rotten
glad
of
it

if
I
'd


a
know
what
a
trouble
it
be
to

I
would

tackle
it
,


and
ai
n't
a
-
going

but
I
reckon
I
get
to
light
out
for
the


territory
ahead
of
the
rest
,
because
Aunt

I


and
sivilize
I
,
and
I
ca

I
