the
winter
of


despair

have
everything

have
nothing

we
be


all

to
Heaven
,
we
be
all
go
direct
the
other
way

in


short
,
the
period
be
so
far
like
the
present
period
,
that
some

its


noisy
authority

on
its
be
receive

for
good
or
for


evil
,
in
the
superlative
degree
of
comparison
only
.




there

a
king

plain

and
a
queen
with


a
fair

,
on
the
throne
of
France
.
in
both

than
crystal
to
the
lord
of
the
State
preserve
of
loaf
and
fish
,


that
thing
in
general
be
settle
for
ever
.




it
be
the
year
of
our
Lord
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
seventy
-
five
.


spiritual
revelation

concede
to
England
at
that
favour
period
,


as
at
this
.
Mrs.

have
recently
attain
she

twentieth

,
of

a
prophetic
private
in

have


herald
the
sublime
appearance
by

that
arrangement
be


make
for
the
swallowing
up
of
London
and
Westminster
.
even
the
Cock

lane


ghost
have
be
lay
only
a
round
dozen
of
year
,
after
rap
out
its


message
,
as
the
spirit
of
this
very
year
last
past
(
supernaturally


deficient
in
originality
)
rap
out
theirs
.
mere
message
in
the


earthly
order
of
event
have
lately
come
to
the
English
Crown
and
People
,


from
a
congress
of
british
subject
in
America
:
which
,
strange


to
relate
,
have
prove
more
important
to
the
human
race
than
any


communication
yet
receive
through
any
of
the
chicken
of
the
Cock

lane


brood
.




France
,
less
favour
on
the
whole
as
to
matter
spiritual
than
she


sister
of
the
shield
and
trident
,
roll
with
exceed
smoothness
down


hill
,
make
paper
money
and
spend
it
.
under
the
guidance
of
she


christian
pastor
,
she
entertain
herself
,
besides
,
with
such
humane


achievement
as
sentence
a
youth
to
have
his
hand
cut
off
,
his
tongue


tear
out
with
pincer
,
and
his
body
burn
alive
,
because
he
have
not


kneel
down
in
the
rain
to
do
honour
to
a
dirty
procession
of
monk


which
pass
within
his
view
,
at
a
distance
of
some
fifty
or
sixty


yard
.
it
be
likely
enough
that
,
root
in
the
wood
of
France

there
be

that
sufferer
be
put
to
death

by
the
Woodman
,
Fate
,
to
come
down
and
be

into

,
to
make
a
certain
movable
framework
with
a
sack
and
a
knife
in


it
,
terrible
in
history
.
it
be
likely
enough
that
in
the
rough
outhouse


of
some
tiller
of
the
heavy
land
adjacent
to
Paris

there
be


shelter

the
Farmer

already
set

in
England

be
scarcely
an

water

wherein
,
as
momentary
light
glance
into
it

have
glimpse


of
bury

in
an


eternal
frost

the
light
be
play
on

I
stand

which
I
shall
carry
in
mine

end

in


any
of
the
burial

place
of
this
city

which
I
pass
,

there


a

more
inscrutable

with
the


three
passenger
shut
up
in
the
narrow
compass
of
one
lumber
old

mystery
to
one
another

complete
as

pretty
often
at


ale
-
house
by
the
way
to
drink
,
but
evince
a
tendency
to
keep
his


own
counsel
,
and
to
keep
his
hat
cock
over
his
eye
.
he
have
eye
that


assort
very
well
with

of
a

black
,
with


no
depth
in
the
colour

much

near
together

as

out
in
something
,
singly
,
if
they
keep
too


far
apart
.
they
have
a
sinister
expression
,
under
an
old
cock
-
hat
like


a
three
-
cornered
spittoon
,
and
over
a
great
muffler
for
the
chin
and


throat
,
which
descend
nearly
to
the
wearer
’s
knee
.
when
he
stop


for
drink
,
he
move
this
muffler
with
his
left
hand
,
only
while
he


pour
his
liquor
in
with
his
right

as
soon
as
that

"

the

his
message
perplex
his
mind
to
that
degree
that
he
be
fain
,
several


time
,
to
take
off

more

a

of
five

-
forty
by

they
differ
principally
in
the
passion
they
express
,

in
the
ghastliness
of
their

down

raise
for
a
moment
,
and
a
very
faint
voice
respond
to
the


salutation
,
as
if
it
be
at
a
distance
:




"

"

still
hard

"




after
a
long
silence
,
the
head
be
lift
for
another
moment
,
and
the


voice
reply
,
"
yes

I

"
this
time
,
a
pair
of
haggard
eye


have
look
at
the
questioner
,
before
the
face
have
drop
again
.




the
faintness
of
the
voice
be
pitiable
and
dreadful
.
it
be
not
the


faintness
of
physical
weakness
,
though
confinement
and
hard
fare
no


doubt
have
their
part
in
it
.
its
deplorable
peculiarity
be
,
that
it
be


the
faintness
of
solitude
and
disuse
.
it
be
like
the
last
feeble
echo


of
a
sound
make
long
and
long
ago

so
entirely
have
it
lose
the
life
and


resonance
of
the
human
voice
,
that
it
affect
the
sense
like
a
once


beautiful
colour
fade
away
into
a
poor
weak
stain
.
so
sunken
and


suppress
it
be
,
that
it
be
like
a
voice
underground
.
so
expressive


it
be
,
of
a
hopeless
and
lose
creature
,
that
a
famished
traveller
,


weary
out
by
lonely
wandering
in
a
wilderness
,
would
have
remember


home
and
friend

such
a
tone
before
lie
down
to
die
.




some
minute
of
silent
work
have
pass
:

the
haggard
eye
have
look


up
again
:
not
with
any
interest
or
curiosity
,

with
a
dull
mechanical


perception

the
spot

only
visitor

a
vacant
air

secure
at
that


angle

the
time

a
broad
ray
of
light
fall
into
the
garret
,
and


show
the
workman
with
an
unfinished
shoe
upon
his
lap
,
pause
in
his


labour
.
his
few
common
tool

various
scrap
of
leather
be
at
his


foot

on
his
bench

he
have
a
white
beard
,
raggedly
cut
,
but
not
very


long
,
a
hollow
face
,
and
exceedingly
bright
eye
.
the
hollowness
and


thinness
of
his
face
would
have
cause
they
to
look
large
,
under
his
yet


dark
eyebrow
and
his
confused
white
hair
,
though
they
have
be
really


otherwise
;
but
,
they
be
naturally
large
,
and
look
unnaturally
so
.


his
yellow
rag
of
shirt
lie
open
at
the
throat
,

show
his
body


to
be
wither

old
canvas

loose


stocking

all
his
poor
tatter
of
clothe

have
,
in
a
long
seclusion


from
direct
light
and
air

fade
down
to
such
a
dull
uniformity
of


parchment

yellow
,
that
it
would
have
be
hard
to
say
which

he
have
put
up
a

very
bone

transparent

a
steadfastly
vacant
gaze

down
on
this
side

lose
the
habit

place
with
sound

he
never
speak

in
this
manner

turn

an

place

the

thousand

hundred

eighty
.
it
be
very
small
,
very


dark
,
very
ugly
,
very
incommodious
.
it
be
an
old
-
fashioned
place
,


moreover
,
in
the
moral
attribute
that
the
partner
in
the
House
be


proud
of
its
smallness
,
proud
of
its
darkness
,
proud
of
its
ugliness
,


proud
of
its
incommodiousness
.
they
be
even
boastful
of
its
eminence


in
those
particular
,
and
be
fire
by
an
express
conviction
that
,
if


it
be
less
objectionable
,
it
would
be
less
respectable
.
this
be


no
passive
belief
,
but
an
active
weapon
which
they
flash
at
more


convenient
place
of
business
.
Tellson
’s
(
they
say
)
want


no
elbow

Tellson

but


Tellson
’s
,
thank
heaven--
!




any
one
of
these
partner
would
have
disinherit
his
son
on
the


question
of
rebuild
Tellson
’s
.
in
this
respect
the
House
be
much


on
a
par
with
the
Country
;
which
do
very
often
disinherit
its
son
for


suggest
improvement
in
law
and
custom
that
have
long
be
highly


objectionable
,
but
be
only
the
more
respectable
.




thus
it
have
come
to
pass
,
that
Tellson
’s
be
the
triumphant
perfection


of
inconvenience
.
after
burst
open
a
door
of
idiotic
obstinacy
with


a
weak
rattle
in
its
throat
,
you
fall
into
Tellson
’s
down
two
step
,


and
come
to
your
sense
in
a
miserable
little
shop
,
with
two
little


counter
,
where
the
old
of
man
make
your
cheque

as

wind
rustle
it

the
signature
by
the
dingy
of


window

which
be
always
under

"
you
be
put
into

an
insensate
brutality

ferocity
worthy
of


Abyssinia

Ashantee
.




but
indeed
,
at
that
time
,
put
to
death
be
a
recipe
much
in
vogue


with
all
trade
and
profession
,
and
not
least
of
all
with
Tellson

.


death
be
Nature
’s
remedy
for
all
thing
,
and
why
not
legislation
’s
?


accordingly
,
the
forger
be
put
to
Death
;
the
utterer
of
a
bad
note


be
put
to
Death
;
the
unlawful
opener
of
a
letter
be
put
to
Death
;
the


purloiner
of
forty
shilling
and
sixpence
be
put
to
Death
;
the
holder


of
a
horse
at
Tellson
’s
door
,
who
make
off
with
it
,
be
put
to


death
;
the
coiner
of
a
bad
shilling
be
put
to
Death
;
the
sounder
of


three

fourth
of
the
note
in
the
whole
gamut
of
Crime
,
be
put
to


death
.
not
that
it
do
the
least
good
in
the
way
of
prevention
--
it


might
almost
have
be
worth
remark
that
the
fact
be
exactly
the


reverse
--
but
,
it
clear
off
(
as
to
this
world
)
the
trouble
of
each


particular
case

leave
nothing
else

with
it
to

Tellson
’s
,
in
its
day
,
like
great
place
of
business
,


its
contemporary

be
range
on
Temple
Bar
instead
of
be
privately


disposed

would
probably
have
exclude
what
little
light
the


ground
floor
have
,
in
a
rather
significant
manner
.




cramp
in
all
kind
of
dim
cupboard
and
hutch
at
Tellson
’s
,
the


old
of
man

on
the
business
gravely
.
when
they
take
a
young


man
into
Tellson
’s
London
house
,
they
hide
he
somewhere
till
he
be


old

they
keep
he
in
a
dark
place
,

a

,
until
he
have
the
full


Tellson
flavour

mould
upon

to


be

,
spectacularly
pore
over
large
book
,
and
cast
his
breech


and
gaiter
into
the
general
weight
of
the
establishment
.




outside
Tellson’s

any
mean
in
it
,
unless
call
in
--

odd

job

man
,
an
occasional
porter
and
messenger

who
serve
as
the
live


sign
of
the
house
.
he
be
never
absent
during

hour

unless

then
he

his
son

a
grisly
urchin


of
twelve

People
understand
that
Tellson

,


in
a
stately
way
,
tolerate
the
odd

job

man
.
the
house
have
always


tolerate
some
person
in
that
capacity
,
and
time
and
tide
have
drift


this
person
to
the
post
.
his
surname

Cruncher

on
the
youthful


occasion
of
his
renouncing

impression

from

,
the
Old
Bailey
be
famous
as
a
kind
of
deadly
inn
-
yard
,


from
which
pale
traveller
set
out
continually
,
in
cart
and
coach
,
on


a
violent
passage
into
the
other
world
:
traverse
some
two
mile
and
a


half
of
public
street
and
road
,
and
shame
few
good
citizen
,
if
any
.


so
powerful
be
use
,
and
so
desirable
to
be
good
use
in
the
beginning
.
it


be
famous
,
too
,
for
the
pillory
,
a
wise
old
institution
,
that
inflict


a
punishment
of
which
no
one
could
foresee
the
extent
;
also
,
for


the
whipping
-
post
,
another
dear
old
institution
,
very
humanising
and


soften
to
behold
in
action
;
also
,
for
extensive
transaction
in


blood
-
money
,
another
fragment
of
ancestral
wisdom
,
systematically


lead
to
the
most
frightful
mercenary
crime
that
could
be
commit


under
Heaven
.
altogether
,
the
Old
Bailey
,
at
that
date
,
be
a
choice


illustration
of
the
precept
,
that
"
whatever
be
be
right
;
"
an
aphorism


that
would
be
as
final
as
it
be
lazy
,

it
not
include
the
troublesome


consequence
,
that
nothing
that

,
be
wrong
.




make
his
way
through
the
tainted
crowd
,
disperse
up
and
down
this


hideous
scene
of
action
,
with
the
skill
of
a
man
accustomed
to
make
his


way
quietly
,

a
disappointment






Mr.
Attorney
-
General
have
to
inform
the
jury
,
that
the
prisoner
before


they
,
though
young
in
year
,
be
old
in
the
treasonable
practice
which


claim
the
forfeit
of
his
life
.
that
this
correspondence
with
the


public
enemy
be
not
a
correspondence
of
to
-
day
,
or
of
yesterday
,
or


even
of
last
year
,
or
of
the
year
before
.
that
,
it
be
certain
the


prisoner
have
,
for
long
than
that
,
be
in
the
habit
of
passing
and


repasse
between
France
and
England
,
on
secret
business
of
which


he
could
give
no
honest
account
.
that
,
if
it
be
in
the
nature
of


traitorous
way
to
thrive
(
which
happily
it
never
be
)
,
the
real


wickedness
and
guilt
of
his
business
might
have
remain
undiscovered
.


that
Providence
,
however
,
have
put
it
into
the
heart
of
a
person
who


be
beyond
fear
and
beyond
reproach
,
to
ferret
out
the
nature
of
the


prisoner
’s
scheme
,
and
,
strike
with
horror
,
to
disclose
they
to
his


Majesty
’s
Chief
Secretary
of
State
and
most
honourable
Privy
Council
.


that
,
this
patriot
would
be
produce
before
they
.
that
,
his
position
and


attitude
be
,
on
the
whole
,
sublime
.
that
,
he
have
be
the
prisoner
’s


friend
,
but
,
at
once
in
an
auspicious
and
an
evil
hour
detect
his


infamy
,
have
resolve
to
immolate
the
traitor
he
could
no
long
cherish


in
his
bosom
,
on
the
sacred
altar
of
his
country
.
that
,
if
statue


be
decree
in
Britain
,
as
in
ancient
Greece
and
Rome
,
to
public


benefactor
,
this
shine
citizen
would
assuredly
have
have
one
.
that
,
as


they
be
not
so
decreed
,
he
probably
would
not
have
one
.
that
,
Virtue
,


as
have
be
observe
by
the
poet
(
in
many
passage
which
he
well

guilty
consciousness
that


they

in
a
manner
contagious
;
more

the
bright
virtue

as
patriotism
,

love
of

,

lofty
example
of
this
immaculate
and
unimpeachable
witness


for
the
Crown
,
to
refer
to
whom
however
unworthily
be
an
honour
,
have


communicate
itself
to
the
prisoner
’s
servant
,
and
have
engender
in
he


a
holy
determination
to
examine
his
master
’s
table
-
drawer
and
pocket
,


and
secrete
his
paper
.
that
,
he
(
Mr.
Attorney
-
General
)
be
prepared
to


hear
some
disparagement
attempt
of
this
admirable
servant
;
but
that
,


in
a
general
way
,
he
prefer
he
to
his
(
Mr.
Attorney
-
General
’s
)


brother
and
sister
,
and
honour
he
more
than
his
(
Mr.


Attorney
-
General
’s
)
father
and
mother
.
that
,
he
call
with
confidence


on
the
jury
to
come
and
do
likewise
.
that
,
the
evidence
of
these
two


witness
,
couple
with
the
document
of
their
discovering
that
would
be


produce
,
would
show
the
prisoner
to
have
be
furnish
with
list
of


his
Majesty
’s
force
,
and
of
their
disposition
and
preparation
,
both
by


sea
and
land
,
and
would
leave
no
doubt
that
he
have
habitually
convey


such
information
to
a
hostile
power
.
that
,
these
list
could
not
be


prove
to
be
in
the
prisoner
’s
handwriting
;
but
that
it
be
all
the


same
;
that
,
indeed
,
it
be
rather
the
well
for
the
prosecution
,
as


show
the
prisoner
to
be
artful
in
his
precaution
.
that
,
the
proof


would
go
back
five
year
,
and
would
show
the
prisoner
already
engage


in
these
pernicious
mission
,
within
a
few
week
before
the
date
of
the


very
first
action
fight
between
the
british
troop
and
the
Americans
.


that
,
for
these
reason
,
the
jury
,
be
a
loyal
jury
(
as
he
know
they


be
)
,
and
be
a
responsible
jury
(
as
_
they
_
know
they
be
)
,
must


positively
find
the
prisoner
Guilty
,
and
make
an
end
of
he
,
whether


they
like
it
or
not
.
that
,
they
never
could
lay
their
head
upon
their


pillow
;
that
,
they
never
could
tolerate
the
idea
of
their
wife
lay


their
head
upon
their
pillow
;
that
,
they
never
could
endure
the
notion


of
their
child
lay
their
head
upon
their
pillow
;
in
short
,
that


there
never
more
could
be
,
for
they
or
theirs
,
any
laying
of
head
upon


pillow
at
all
,
unless
the
prisoner
’s
head
be
take
off
.
that
head


Mr.
Attorney
-
General
conclude
by
demand
of
they
,
in
the
name
of


everything
he
could
think
of
with
a
round
turn
in
it
,
and
on
the
faith


of
his
solemn
asseveration
that
he
already
consider
the
prisoner
as


good
as
dead
and
go
.




when

about
the
prisoner
,
in


anticipation
of
what
he
be
soon
to

.

treason
?
but
,
Mr.
Stryver
reply
to
my
Lord
,
no
;
but
he


would
ask
the
witness
to
tell
he
whether
what
happen
once
,
might


happen
twice
;
whether
he
would
have
be
so
confident
if
he
have
see


this
illustration
of
his
rashness
soon
,
whether
he
would
be
so


confident
,
having
see
it
;
and
more
.
the
upshot
of
which
,
be
,
to
smash


this
witness
like
a
crockery
vessel
,
and
shiver
his
part
of
the
case
to


useless
lumber
.




Mr.
Cruncher
have
by
this
time
take
quite
a
lunch
of
rust
off
his


finger
in
his
following
of
the
evidence
.
he
have
now
to
attend
while
Mr.


Stryver
fit
the
prisoner
’s
case
on
the
jury
,
like
a
compact
suit


of
clothe
;
show
they
how
the
patriot
,
Barsad
,
be
a
hire
spy
and


traitor
,
an
unblushing
trafficker
in
blood
,
and
one
of
the
great


scoundrel
upon
earth
since
accurse
Judas
--
which
he
certainly
do
look


rather
like
.
how
the
virtuous
servant
,
Cly
,
be
his
friend
and
partner
,


and
be
worthy
to
be
;
how
the
watchful
eye
of
those
forger
and
false


swearer
have
rest
on
the
prisoner
as
a
victim
,
because
some
family


affair
in
France
,
he
be
of
french
extraction
,
do
require
his
making


those
passage
across
the
Channel
--
though
what
those
affair
be
,
a


consideration
for
other
who
be
near
and
dear
to
he
,
forbid
he
,


even
for
his
life
,
to
disclose
.
how
the
evidence
that
have
be
warp


and
wrest
from
the
young
lady
,
whose
anguish
in
give
it
they


have
witness
,
come
to
nothing
,
involve
the
mere
little
innocent


gallantry
and
politeness
likely
to
pass
between
any
young
gentleman


and
young
lady
so
throw
together;--with
the
exception
of
that


reference
to
George
Washington
,
which
be
altogether
too
extravagant
and


impossible
to
be
regard
in
any
other
light
than
as
a
monstrous
joke
.


how
it
would
be
a
weakness
in
the
government
to
break
down
in
this


attempt
to
practise
for
popularity
on
the
low
national
antipathy


and
fear
,
and
therefore
Mr.
Attorney
-
General
have
make
the
most
of
it
;


how
,
nevertheless
,
it
rest
upon
nothing
,
save
that
vile
and
infamous


character
of
evidence
too
often
disfigure
such
case
,
and
of
which
the


State
Trials
of
this
country
be
full
.
but
,
there
my
Lord
interpose


(
with
as
grave
a
face
as
if
it
have
not
be
true
)
,
say
that
he
could


not
sit
upon
that
Bench
and
suffer
those
allusion
.




Mr.
Stryver
then
call
his
few
witness
,
and
Mr.
Cruncher
have
next
to


attend
while
Mr.
Attorney
-
General
turn
the
whole
suit
of
clothe
Mr.


Stryver
have
fit
on
the
jury
,
inside
out
;
show
how
Barsad
and


Cly
be
even
a
hundred
time
well
than
he
have
think
they
,
and
the


prisoner
a
hundred
time
bad
.
lastly
,
come
my
Lord
himself
,
turn


the
suit
of
clothe
,
now
inside
out
,
now
outside
in
,
but
on
the
whole


decidedly
trim
and
shape
they
into
grave
-
clothe
for
the
prisoner
.




and
now
,
the
jury
turn
to
consider
,
and
the
great
fly
swarm
again
.




Mr.
Carton
,
who
have
so
long
sat
look
at
the
ceiling
of
the
court
,


change
neither
his
place
nor
his
attitude
,
even
in
this
excitement
.


while
his
learn
friend
,
Mr.
Stryver
,
mass
his
paper
before
he
,


whisper
with
those
who
sit
near
,
and
from
time
to
time
glance


anxiously
at
the
jury
;
while
all
the
spectator
move
more
or
less
,
and


group
themselves
anew
;
while
even
my
Lord
himself
arise
from
his
seat
,


and
slowly
pace
up
and
down
his
platform
,
not
unattended
by
a
suspicion


in
the
mind
of
the
audience
that
his
state
be
feverish
;
this
one
man


sat
lean
back
,
with
his
torn
gown
half
off
he
,
his
untidy
wig
put


on
just
as
it
have
happen
to
light
on
his
head
after
its
removal
,
his


hand
in
his
pocket
,
and
his
eye
on
the
ceiling
as
they
have
be
all


day
.
something
especially
reckless
in
his
demeanour
,
not
only
give
he


a
disreputable
look
,
but
so
diminish
the
strong
resemblance
he


undoubtedly
bore
to
the
prisoner
(
which
his
momentary
earnestness
,


when
they
be
compare
together
,
have
strengthen
)
,
that
many
of
the


looker
-
on
,
take
note
of
he
now
,
say
to
one
another
they
would


hardly
have
think
the
two
be
so
alike
.
Mr.
Cruncher
make
the


observation
to
his
next
neighbour
,
and
add
,
"
I
’d
hold
half
a
guinea


that
_
he
_
do
n’t
get
no
law
-
work
to
do
.
do
n’t
look
like
the
sort
of
one


to
get
any
,
do
he
?
"




yet
,
this
Mr.
Carton
take
in
more
of
the
detail
of
the
scene
than
he


appear
to
take
in
;
for
now
,
when
Miss
Manette
’s
head
drop
upon


her
father
’s
breast
,
he
be
the
first
to
see
it
,
and
to
say
audibly
:


"
officer
!
look
to
that
young
lady
.
help
the
gentleman
to
take
she
out
.


do
n’t
you
see
she
will
fall
!
"




there
be
much
commiseration
for
she
as
she
be
remove
,
and
much


sympathy
with
her
father
.
it
have
evidently
be
a
great
distress
to


he
,
to
have
the
day
of
his
imprisonment
recall
.
he
have
show


strong
internal
agitation
when
he
be
question
,
and
that
pondering
or


brood
look
which
make
he
old
,

be
upon
he
,
like
a
heavy
cloud

ever
since

jury

have
turn
back
and
pause
a


moment

,
through
their
foreman
.




they
be
not
agree
,
and
wish
to
retire
.
my
Lord
(
perhaps
with
George


Washington
on
his
mind
)
show
some
surprise
that
they
be
not
agree
,


but
signify
his
pleasure
that
they
should
retire
under
watch
and
ward
,


and
retire
himself
.

the
lamp
in


the

.
it
begin
to
be
rumour
that
the


jury
would
be
out
a
long
while
.
the
spectator
drop
off
to
get


refreshment
,
and
the
prisoner
withdraw
to
the
back
of
the
dock
,

sit


down
.

not

to
the
mournful
cadence

depth

his
soul

also
in
its
nature

arise

itself

to
draw
a
gloom
over
he
,
as
incomprehensible
to

unacquainted

shadow

a
strong
beneficial


influence
with
he
almost

shake
the


dust
from
his
foot
,
and
quietly
walk
downstairs
.




he
be
a
man
of
about
sixty
,
handsomely
dress
,
haughty
in
manner
,
and


with
a
face
like
a
fine
mask
.

transparent
paleness

only
little


change
that
the
face
ever
show

reside
.
they
persist
in
change


colour
sometimes
,
and
they
would
be
occasionally
dilate
and
contract


by
something
like
a
faint
pulsation
;
then
,
they
give
a
look
of


treachery
,
and
cruelty
,
to
the
whole
countenance
.
examine
with


attention
,
its
capacity
of
help
such
a
look
be
to
be
find
in
the


line
of
the
mouth
,
and
the
line
of
the
orbit
of
the
eye
,
be
much


too
horizontal
and
thin
;
still
,
in
the
effect
of
the
face
make
,
it
be
a


handsome
face
,
and
a
remarkable
one
.




its
owner
go
downstairs
into
the
courtyard
,
get
into
his
carriage
,
and


drive
away
.
not
many
people
have
talk
with
he
at
the
reception
;
he
have


stand
in
a
little
space
apart
,
and
Monseigneur
might
have
be
warm


in
his
manner
.
it
appear
,
under
the
circumstance
,
rather
agreeable


to
he
to
see
the
common
people
disperse
before
his
horse
,
and


often
barely
escape
from
be
run
down
.
his
man
drive
as
if
he
be


charge
an
enemy
,
and
the
furious
recklessness
of
the
man
bring
no


check
into
the
face
,
or
to
the
lip
,
of
the
master
.
the
complaint
have


sometimes
make
itself
audible
,
even
in
that
deaf
city
and
dumb
age
,


that
,
in
the
narrow
street
without
footway
,
the
fierce
patrician


custom
of
hard
driving
endanger
and
maim
the
mere
vulgar
in
a


barbarous
manner

enough

with
a
wild
rattle
and
clatter

an
inhuman
abandonment
of


consideration
not
easy
to
be
understand
in
these

carriage

number

the
latter

Stryver
,
I
be
about
to
say:--it
might
be


painful
to
you
to
find
yourself
mistaken
,
it
might
be
painful
to
doctor


Manette
to
have
the
task
of
be
explicit
with
you
,
it
might
be
very


painful
to
Miss
Manette
to
have
the
task
of
be
explicit
with
you
.
you


know
the
term
upon
which
I
have
the
honour
and
happiness
to
stand
with


the
family
.
if
you
please
,
commit
you
in
no
way
,
represent
you


in
no
way
,
I
will
undertake
to
correct
my
advice
by
the
exercise
of
a


little
new
observation
and
judgment
expressly
bring
to
bear
upon


it
.
if
you
should
then
be
dissatisfy
with
it
,
you
can
but
test
its


soundness
for
yourself
;
if
,
on
the
other
hand
,
you
should
be
satisfied


with
it
,
and
it
should
be
what
it
now
be
,
it
may
spare
all
side
what
be


well
spare
.
what
do
you
say
?
"




"
how
long
would
you
keep
I
in
town
?
"




"
oh
!
it
be
only
a
question
of
a
few
hour
.
I
could
go
to
Soho
in
the


evening
,
and
come
to
your
chamber
afterwards
.
"




"
then
I
say
yes
,
"
say
Stryver
:
"
I
wo
n’t
go
up
there
now
,
I
be
not
so


hot
upon
it
as
that
come
to
;
I
say
yes
,
and
I
shall
expect
you
to
look


in
to
-
night
.
good
morning
.
"




then
Mr.
Stryver
turn
and
burst
out
of
the
Bank
,
cause
such
a


concussion
of
air
on
his
passage
through
,
that
to
stand
up
against
it


bow
behind
the
two
counter
,
require
the
utmost
remain
strength


of
the
two
ancient
clerk
.
those
venerable
and
feeble
person
be


always
see
by
the
public
in
the
act
of
bowing
,
and
be
popularly


believe
,
when
they
have
bow
a
customer
out
,
still
to
keep
on
bow
in


the
empty
office
until
they
bow
another
customer
in
.




the
barrister
be
keen
enough
to
divine
that
the
banker
would
not
have


go
so
far
in
his
expression
of
opinion
on
any
less
solid
ground
than


moral
certainty
.
unprepared
as
he

it

Old

softly
on
the

there
a
little
--

now

his
breath

down
again
in

in

out
the

gravestone
in
the
churchyard
--
it
be
a
large
churchyard


that
they
be
in
--
look
on
like
ghost
in
white
,
while
the
church


tower
itself
look
on
like
the
ghost
of
a
monstrous
giant
.
they
do
not


creep
far
,
before
they
stop
and
stand
upright
.
and
then
they
begin
to


fish
.




they
fish
with
a
spade
,
at
first
.
presently
the
honoured
parent


appear
to
be
adjust
some
instrument
like
a
great
corkscrew
.


whatever
tool
they
work
with
,
they
work
hard
,
until
the
awful


striking
of
the
church
clock
so
terrify
Young
Jerry
,
that
he
make
off
,


with
his
hair
as
stiff
as
his
father
’s
.




but
,
his
long
-
cherish
desire
to
know
more
about
these
matter
,
not


only
stop
he
in
his
run
away
,
but
lure
he
back
again
.
they


be
still
fish
perseveringly
,
when
he
peep
in
at
the
gate
for


the
second
time
;
but
,
now
they
seem
to
have
get
a
bite
.
there
be
a


screw
and
complain
sound
down
below
,
and
their
bent
figure
be


strained
,
as
if
by
a
weight
.
by
slow
degree
the
weight
break
away
the


earth
upon
it
,
and
come
to
the
surface
.
Young
Jerry
very
well
know
what


it
would
be
;
but
,
when
he
see
it
,
and
see
his
honoured
parent
about
to


wrench
it
open
,
he
be
so
frightened
,
be
new
to
the
sight
,
that
he


make
off
again
,
and
never
stop
until
he
have
run
a
mile
or
more
.




he
would
not
have
stop
then
,
for
anything
less
necessary
than
breath
,


it
be
a
spectral
sort
of
race
that
he
run
,
and
one
highly
desirable


to
get
to
the
end
of
.
he
have
a
strong
idea
that
the
coffin
he
have
see


be
run
after
he
;
and
,
picture
as
hop
on
behind
he
,
bolt


upright
,
upon
its
narrow
end
,
always
on
the
point
of
overtake
he


and
hop
on
at
his
side
--
perhaps
take
his
arm
--
it
be
a
pursuer
to


shun
.
it
be
an
inconsistent
and
ubiquitous
fiend
too
,
for
,
while
it


be
make
the
whole
night
behind
he
dreadful
,
he
dart
out
into
the


roadway
to
avoid
dark
alley
,
fearful
of
its
come
hop
out
of
they


like
a
dropsical
boy
’s
kite
without
tail
and
wing
.
it
hide
in
doorway


too
,
rub
its
horrible
shoulder
against
door
,
and
draw
they
up


to
its
ear
,
as
if
it
be
laugh
.
it
get
into
shadow
on
the
road
,


and
lie
cunningly
on
its
back
to
trip
he
up
.
all
this
time
it
be


incessantly
hop
on
behind
and
gain
on
he
,
so
that
when
the
boy


get
to
his
own
door

have
reason
for

half
dead
.

even
then


it

not

upstairs
with
a
bump

forward
on
his
bench
in
the
dusk
,


with
his
elbow
on
his
knee
and
his
head
in
his
hand
,
that
he
be
in


some
misty
way
ask
himself
,
"

pace
up

down
for
a
long


time

be
of
late
familiar
to

he


return
no
reply
,
but
it
be
evident
that
he
hear
what

that
he
think
about
it
,
however
confusedly

be

without
any
demonstrative
accompaniment
,
not
long


enough
,

often
enough
to
harass

it
lighten
Mr.

’s


friendly
heart
to

to


observe
that

little
out

asleep
at
his
post
.
on
the


tenth
morning
of
his
suspense
,
he
be
startle
by
the
shining
of
the
sun


into
the
room
where
a
heavy
slumber
have
overtake
he
when
it
be
dark


night
.




he
rub
his
eye
and
rouse
himself
;
but
he
doubt
,
when
he
have


do
so
,
whether
he
be
not
still
asleep
.
for
,
go
to
the
door
of
the


doctor
’s
room
and
look
in
,
he
perceive
that
the
shoemaker
’s
bench


and
tool
be
put
aside
again
,
and
that
the
doctor
himself
sit
read


at
the
window
.
he
be
in
his
usual
morning
dress
,
and
his
face
(
which


Mr.

could
distinctly
see

,
though
still
very
pale
,
be
calmly


studious

attentive

even
when
he
have
satisfy
himself
that
he
be
awake
,
Mr.
Lorry
feel


giddily
uncertain
for
some
few
moment
whether
the
late
shoemaking
might


not
be
a
disturbed
dream
of
his
own
;
for
,
do
not
his
eye
show
he
his


friend
before
he
in
his
accustomed
clothing
and
aspect
,
and
employ


as
usual
;
and
be
there
any
sign
within
their
range
,
that
the
change
of


which
he
have
so
strong
an
impression
have
actually
happen
?




it
be
but
the
inquiry
of
his
first
confusion
and
astonishment
,
the


answer
be
obvious
.
if
the
impression
be
not
produce
by
a
real


corresponding
and
sufficient
cause
,
how
come
he
,
Jarvis

there

how
come
he
to
have
fall

,
and
her
old
directress
and


companion
,
in
a
life
of
quiet
bliss
,
Lucie
sit
in
the
still
house
in


the
tranquilly
resounding
corner
,
listen
to
the
echo
footstep
of


year
.




at
first
,
there
be
time
,
though
she
be
a
perfectly
happy
young
wife
,


when
her
work
would
slowly
fall
from
her
hand
,
and
her
eye
would
be


dim
.
for
,
there
be
something
come
in
the
echo
,
something
light
,


afar
off
,
and
scarcely
audible
yet
,
that
stir
her
heart
too
much
.


flutter
hope
and
doubt
--
hope
,
of
a
love
as
yet
unknown
to
she
:


doubt
,
of
she
remain
upon
earth
,
to
enjoy
that
new
delight
--
divide


her
breast
.
among
the
echo
then
,
there
would
arise
the
sound
of


footstep
at
her
own
early
grave
;
and
thought
of
the
husband
who
would


be
leave
so
desolate
,
and
who
would
mourn
for
she
so
much
,
swell
to
she


eye
,
and
break
like
wave
.




that
time
pass
,
and
her
little
Lucie
lie
on
her
bosom
.
then
,
among
the


advance
echo
,
there
be
the
tread
of
her
tiny
foot
and
the
sound
of


her
prattle
word
.
let
great
echo
resound
as
they
would
,
the
young


mother
at
the
cradle
side
could
always
hear
those
come
.
they
come
,
and


the
shady
house
be
sunny
with
a
child
’s
laugh
,
and
the
divine
friend
of


child
,
to
whom
in
her
trouble
she
have
confide
her
,
seem
to
take


her
child
in
his
arm
,
as
he
take
the
child
of
old
,
and
make
it
a
sacred


joy
to
she
.




ever
busily
wind
the
golden
thread
that
bind
they
all
together
,


weave
the
service
of
her
happy
influence
through
the
tissue
of
all


their
life
,
and
make
it
predominate
nowhere
,
Lucie
hear
in
the


echo
of
year
none
but
friendly
and
soothing
sound
.
her
husband
’s


step
be
strong
and
prosperous
among
they
;
her
father
’s
firm
and
equal

Lo
,
Miss
Pross
,
in
harness
of

the

the
earth

the

even
when
there
be
sound
of
sorrow
among
the
rest
,
they
be
not


harsh
nor
cruel
.
even
when
golden
hair
,
like
her
own
,
lie
in
a
halo
on
a


pillow
round
the
worn
face
of
a
little
boy
,
and
he
say
,
with
a
radiant


smile
,
"

papa

very
sorry

not

Angel

with
the
other

in

that
breath

with
they
also
,

both
be
audible
to
Lucie
,
in
a
hushed


murmur
--
like
the
breathing
of
a
summer
sea
asleep
upon
a
sandy
shore
--
as


the
little
Lucie
,
comically
studious
at
the
task
of
the
morning

tongue
of


the
two

life

Echoes

forth
daily

hammer
out
of
the
stone
on
the

for
patch
to
hold
his

ignorant
soul

reduced
body
together

beyond

that
it

Monseigneur
(
often
a
most
worthy
individual
gentleman
)
be
a
national


blessing
,
give
a
chivalrous
tone
to
thing
,
be
a
polite
example
of


luxurious
and
shine
life
,
and
a
great
deal
more
to
equal
purpose
;


nevertheless
,
Monseigneur
as
a
class
have
,
somehow
or
other
,
bring


thing
to
this
.
strange
that
Creation
,
design
expressly
for


Monseigneur
,
should
be
so
soon
wrung
dry
and
squeeze
out
!
there
must


be
something
short
-
sighted
in
the
eternal
arrangement
,
surely
!
thus
it


be
,
however
;
and
the
last
drop
of
blood
having
be
extract
from
the


flint
,
and
the
last
screw
of
the
rack
having
be
turn
so
often
that


its
purchase
crumble
,
and
it
now
turn
and
turn
with
nothing


to
bite
,
Monseigneur
begin
to
run
away
from
a
phenomenon
so
low
and


unaccountable
.




but
,
this
be
not
the
change
on
the
village
,
and
on
many
a
village
like


it
.
for
score
of
year
go
by
,
Monseigneur
have
squeeze
it
and
wring


it
,
and
have
seldom
grace
it
with
his
presence
except
for
the
pleasure


of
the
chase
--
now
,
find
in
hunt
the
people
;
now
,
find
in
hunt


the
beast
,
for
whose
preservation
Monseigneur
make
edify
space


of
barbarous
and
barren
wilderness
.
no
.
the
change
consist
in


the
appearance
of
strange
face
of
low
caste
,
rather
than
in
the


disappearance
of
the
high
caste
,
chisel
,
and
otherwise
beautify
and


beautify
feature
of
Monseigneur
.




for
,
in
these
time
,
as
the
mender
of
road
work
,
solitary
,
in
the


dust
,
not
often
trouble
himself
to
reflect
that
dust
he
be
and


to
dust
he
must
return
,
be
for
the
most
part
too
much
occupy
in


think
how
little
he
have
for
supper
and
how
much
more
he
would
eat
if


he
have
it
--
in
these
time
,
as
he
raise
his
eye
from
his
lonely
labour
,


and
view
the
prospect
,
he
would
see
some
rough
figure
approach
on


foot
,
the
like
of
which
be
once
a
rarity
in
those
part
,
but
be
now


a
frequent
presence
.
as
it
advance
,
the
mender
of
road
would
discern


without
surprise
,
that
it
be
a
shaggy
-
haired
man
,
of
almost
barbarian


aspect
,
tall
,
in
wooden
shoe
that
be
clumsy
even
to
the
eye
of
a


mender
of
road
,
grim
,
rough
,
swart
,
steep
in
the
mud
and
dust
of
many


highway
,
dank
with
the
marshy
moisture
of
many
low
ground
,
sprinkle


with
the
thorn
and
leave
and
moss
of
many
byway
through
wood
.




such
a
man
come
upon
he
,
like
a
ghost
,
at
noon
in
the
July

,


as

on
his
heap
of
stone
under
a

such
shelter

at
the

in
the
hollow
,
at
the
mill

at
the
prison
on
the
crag
.
when

in
what
benighted

safety

would
have
hazard


for
Lucie

her
child

without
a
moment
’s
demur
;
but
the
great
trust


he
hold
be
not
his
own
,

as
to
that
business
charge
he
be
a
strict


man
of
business
.




at
first
,
his
mind
revert

,
repudiate
he
;
he
live
in

most
violent
Quarter

doubtless
be
influential
there

deep
in

some
not

.
that
,
in
the
first
frantic
greeting
lavish
on
himself
as


a
notable
sufferer
under
the
overthrown
system
,
it
have
be
accord


to
he
to
have
Charles
Darnay
bring
before
the
lawless
Court
,
and


examine
.
that
,
he
seem
on
the
point
of
be
at
once
release
,
when


the
tide
in
his
favour
meet
with
some
unexplained
check
(
not
intelligible


to
the
Doctor
)
,
which
lead
to
a
few
word
of
secret
conference
.
that
,


the
man
sit
as
President
have
then
inform
Doctor
Manette
that


the
prisoner
must
remain
in
custody
,
but
should
,
for
his
sake
,
be
hold


inviolate
in
safe
custody
.
that
,
immediately
,
on
a
signal
,
the
prisoner


be
remove
to
the
interior
of
the
prison
again
;
but
,
that
he
,
the


doctor
,
have
then
so
strongly
plead
for
permission
to
remain
and


assure
himself
that

son
-
in
-
law

through
no
malice
or
mischance
,

to
the
concourse
whose
murderous
yell
outside
the
gate
have


often
drown
the
proceeding
,
that
he
have
obtain
the
permission
,
and


have
remain
in
that
Hall
of
blood
until
the
danger
be
over
.




the
sight
he
have
see
there
,
with
brief
snatch
of
food
and
sleep
by


interval
,
shall
remain
untold
.
the
mad
joy
over
the
prisoner
who
be


save
,
have
astound
he
scarcely
less
than
the
mad
ferocity
against


those
who
be
cut
to
piece
.
one
prisoner
there
be
,
he
say
,
who
have


be
discharge
into
the
street
free
,
but
at
whom
a
mistaken
savage
have


thrust
a
pike
as
he
pass
out
.
be
beseech
to
go
to
he
and
dress


the
wound
,
the
Doctor
have
pass
out
at
the
same
gate
,
and
have
find
he


in
the
arm
of
a
company
of
Samaritans
,
who
be
seat
on
the
body


of
their
victim
.
with
an
inconsistency
as
monstrous
as
anything
in
this


awful
nightmare
,
they
have
help
the
healer
,
and
tend
the
wound
man


with
the
gentle
solicitude
--
have
make
a
litter
for
he
and
escort
he


carefully
from
the
spot
--
have
then
catch
up
their
weapon
and
plunge


anew
into
a
butchery
so
dreadful
,
that
the
Doctor
have
cover
his
eye


with
his
hand
,
and
swoon
away
in
the
midst
of
it
.




as
Mr.
Lorry
receive
these
confidence
,
and
as
he
watch
the
face
of


his
friend
now
sixty
-
two
year
of
age
,
a
misgiving
arise
within
he
that


such
dread
experience
would
revive
the
old
danger
.




but
,
he
have
never
see
his
friend
in
his
present
aspect
:
he
have
never


at
all
know
he
in
his
present
character
.
for
the
first
time
the
Doctor


feel
,
now
,
that
his
suffering
be
strength
and
power
.
for
the
first
time


he
feel
that
in
that
sharp
fire
,
he
have
slowly
forge
the
iron
which


could
break
the
prison
door
of
his
daughter
’s
husband
,
and
deliver
he
.


"
it
all
tend
to
a
good
end
,
my
friend
;
it
be
not
mere
waste
and
ruin
.


as
my
beloved
child
be
helpful
in
restore
I
to
myself
,
I
will
be


helpful
now
in
restore
the
dear
part
of
herself
to
she
;
by
the
aid


of
Heaven
I
will
do
it
!
"
thus
,
Doctor
Manette
.
and
when
Jarvis
Lorry
see


the
kindle
eye
,
the
resolute
face
,
the
calm
strong
look
and
bear


of
the
man
whose
life
always
seem
to
he
to
have
be
stop
,
like
a


clock
,
for
so
many
year
,
and
then
set
go
again
with
an
energy
which


have
lain
dormant
during
the
cessation
of
its
usefulness
,
he
believe
.




greater
thing
than
the
doctor
have
at
that
time
to
contend
with
,
would


have
yield
before
his
persevering
purpose
.
while
he
keep
himself


in
his
place
,
as
a
physician
,
whose
business

he
use
his


personal
influence
so
wisely
,
that
he
be
soon
the
inspect
physician


of
three

and
among
they
of
La
Force
.
he
could
now
assure
Lucie


that
her
husband
be
no
long
confine
alone
,
but
be
mix
with
the


general
body
of

;
he
see
her
husband
weekly
,
and
bring
sweet


message
to
she
,
straight
from
his
lip
;
sometimes
her
husband
himself


send
a
letter
to
she
(
though
never
by
the
Doctor
’s
hand
)
,
but
she
be


not
permit
to
write
to
he
:
for
,
among
the
many
wild
suspicion
of

in
the
prison
,

be
an
anxious
life
,
no
doubt
;
still
,
the


sagacious
Mr.

see
that
there
be
a

nothing
unbecoming

the
pride
;
it
be
a
natural

;


but
he
observe
it
as

few


syllable
that
she

my

faintly
shake
she


head

she
secret

the

do

no

there

all
his
thought

a
turbulent
and
heat
working

contend
against


resignation
.
if
,
for
a
moment
,
he
do
feel
resign
,

his
wife

child
who
have
to
live
after
he
,
seem
to
protest
and
to
make
it

selfish
thing

,
all
this
be
at
first
.

the
consideration

no

high

draw
comfort
down
.




before
it

set
in
dark
on

night
of

condemnation

travel

allow
to

lamp

write

know
nothing


of
her
father
’s
imprisonment

until
he
have
hear
of
it
from
herself
,


and
that
he
have
be
as
ignorant
as
she
of
his
father
’s
and
uncle
’s


responsibility
for
that
misery
,
until
the
paper
have
be
read
.
he
have


already
explain
to
she
that
his
concealment
from
herself
of
the
name


he
have
relinquish
,

the
one
condition
--
fully
intelligible
now
--
that


her
father
have
attach
to
their
betrothal
,
and
be
the
one
promise
he


have
still
exact
on
the
morning
of
their
marriage
.
he
entreat
she
,


for
her
father
’s
sake
,
never
to
seek
to
know
whether
her
father
have


become
oblivious
of
the
existence
of
the
paper
,
or
have
have
it
recall


to
he
(
for
the
moment
,

for
good
)
,
by
the
story
of
the
Tower
,
on


that
old
Sunday
under
the
dear
old
plane
-
tree
in
the
garden

if
he
have


preserve
any
definite
remembrance
of
it
,
there
could
be
no
doubt
that


he
have
suppose
it
destroy
with
the
Bastille
,
when
he
have
find
no


mention
of
it
among
the
relic
of
prisoner
which
the
populace
have


discover
there
,
and
which
have
be
describe
to
all
the
world
.
he


besought
she
--
though
he
add
that
he
know
it
be
needless
--
to
console


her
father
,
by
impress
he
through
every
tender
mean
she
could
think


of
,
with
the
truth
that
he
have
do
nothing
for
which
he
could
justly


reproach
himself
,
but
have
uniformly
forget
himself
for
their
joint


sake
.
next
to
her
preservation
of
his
own
last
grateful
love
and


blessing
,

her
overcome
of
her
sorrow
,

devote
herself
to

dear
child

they
would
meet
in
Heaven
,

comfort
she


father
.




to
her
father
himself
,
he
write
in
the

strain
;

,
he
tell
she


father

expressly
confide
his
wife

child

his
care

he
tell

the
hope

rouse
he
from

dangerous
retrospect

it
beckon

back

show
itself
in
shine


form
.
free
and
happy
,
back
in
the
old
house
in

nothing
in
it

real
house

unaccountably
release

heart

all
a
dream

never

away

forgetfulness

even


suffer
,

have
come
back

dead

at
peace

there


be
no
difference
in
he
.
another
pause

oblivion

he
awake
in
the


sombre
morning
,
unconscious
where
he
be
or
what
have
happen
,
until
it


flash
upon
his
mind
,
"
this
be
the
day
of
my
death
!
"




thus
,
have
he
come
through
the
hour
,
to
the
day
when
the
fifty
-
two
head


be
to
fall
.
and
now
,
while
he
be
compose
,
and
hope
that
he
could


meet
the
end
with
quiet
heroism
,
a
new
action
begin
in
his
waking


thought
,
which
be
very
difficult
to
master
.




he
have
never
see
the
instrument
that
be
to
terminate
his
life
.
how


high
it
be
from
the
ground
,
how
many
step
it
have
,
where
he
would
be


stand
,
how
he
would
be
touch
,
whether
the
touch
hand
would
be
dye


red
,
which
way
his
face
would
be
turn
,
whether
he
would
be
the
first
,


or
might
be
the
last
:
these
and
many
similar
question
,
in
nowise


direct
by
his
will
,
obtrude
themselves
over
and
over
again
,
countless


time
.
neither
be
they
connect
with
fear
:
he
be
conscious
of
no


fear
.
rather
,
they
originate
in
a
strange
besetting
desire
to
know
what


to
do
when
the
time
come
;
a
desire
gigantically
disproportionate
to
the


few
swift
moment
to
which
it
refer
;
a
wondering
that
be
more
like


the
wondering
of
some
other
spirit
within
his
,
than
his
own
.




the
hour
go
on
as
he
walk
to
and
fro
,
and
the
clock
strike
the


number
he
would
never
hear
again
.
nine
go
for
ever
,
ten
go
for


ever
,
eleven
go
for
ever
,
twelve
come
on
to
pass
away
.
after
a
hard


contest
with
that
eccentric
action
of
thought
which
have
last
perplex


he
,
he
have
get
the
well
of
it
.
he
walk
up
and
down
,
softly


repeat
their
name
to
himself
.
the
bad
of
the
strife
be
over
.


he
could
walk
up
and
down
,
free
from
distract
fancy
,
pray
for


himself
and
for
they
.




twelve
go
for
ever
.




he
have
be
apprise
that
the
final
hour
be
three
