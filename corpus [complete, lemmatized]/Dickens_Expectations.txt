chapter
i


my
father
's
family
name
be
Pirrip
,
and
my
christian
name
Philip
,
my


infant
tongue
could
make
of
both
name
nothing
long
or
more
explicit


than
Pip
.
so
,
I
call
myself
Pip
,
and
come
to
be
call
Pip
.


I
give
Pirrip
as
my
father
's
family
name
,
on
the
authority
of
his


tombstone
and
my
sister
,
-
Mrs.
Joe
Gargery
,
who
marry
the
blacksmith
.


as
I
never
see
my
father
or
my
mother
,
and
never
see
any
likeness


of
either
of
they
 
for
their
day
be
long
before
the
day
of


photograph
,
my
first
fancy
regard
what
they
be
like
be


unreasonably
derive
from
their
tombstone
.
the
shape
of
the
letter
on


my
father
's
,
give
I
an
odd
idea
that
he
be
a
square
,
stout
,
dark
man
,


with
curly
black
hair
.
from
the
character
and
turn
of
the
inscription
,


"
also
Georgiana
Wife
of
the
Above
,
"
I
draw
a
childish
conclusion
that


my
mother
be
freckle
and
sickly
.
to
five
little
stone
lozenge
,
each


about
a
foot
and
a
half
long
,
which
be
arrange
in
a
neat
row
beside


their
grave
,
and
be
sacred
to
the
memory
of
five
little
brother
of


mine
,
-
who
give
up
try
to
get
a
living
,
exceedingly
early
in


that
universal
struggle
,
-
I
be
indebted
for
a
belief
I
religiously


entertain
that
they
have
all
be
bear
on
their
back
with
their
hand


in
their
trouser
-
pocket
,
and
have
never
take
they
out
in
this
state
of


existence
.


Ours
be
the
marsh
country
,
down
by
the
river
,
within
,
as
the
river


wound
,
twenty
mile
of
the
sea
.
my
first
most
vivid
and
broad
impression


of
the
identity
of
thing
seem
to
I
to
have
be
gain
on
a
memorable


raw
afternoon
towards
evening
.
at
such
a
time
I
find
out
for
certain


that
this
bleak
place
overgrown
with
nettle
be
the
churchyard
;
and


that
Philip
Pirrip
,
late
of
this
parish
,
and
also
Georgiana
wife
of
the


above
,
be
dead
and
bury
;
and
that
Alexander
,
Bartholomew
,
Abraham
,


Tobias
,
and
Roger
,
infant
child
of
the
aforesaid
,
be
also
dead


and
bury
;
and
that
the
dark
flat
wilderness
beyond
the
churchyard
,


intersect
with
dike
and
mound
and
gate
,
with
scatter
cattle


feed
on
it
,
be
the
marsh
;
and
that
the
low
leaden
line
beyond


be
the
river
;
and
that
the
distant
savage
lair
from
which
the
wind
be


rush
be
the
sea
;
and
that
the
small
bundle
of
shiver
grow
afraid


of
it
all
and
begin
to
cry
,
be
Pip

look
for
I
.
when
I


see
he
turn
,
I
set
my
face
towards
home
,
and
make
the
good
use
of


my
leg
.
but
presently
I
look
over
my
shoulder
,
and
see
he
go
on


again
towards
the
river
,
still
hug
himself
in
both
arm
,
and
pick


his
way
with
his
sore
foot
among
the
great
stone
drop
into
the


marsh
here
and
there
,
for
stepping
-
place
when
the
rain
be
heavy
or


the
tide
be
in
.


the
marsh
be
just
a
long
black
horizontal
line
then
,
as
I
stop


to
look
after
he
;
and
the
river
be
just
another
horizontal
line
,
not


nearly
so
broad
nor
yet
so
black
;
and
the
sky
be
just
a
row
of
long


angry
red
line
and
dense
black
line
intermix
.
on
the
edge
of
the


river
I
could
faintly
make
out
the
only
two
black
thing
in
all
the


prospect
that
seem
to
be
stand
upright
;
one
of
these
be
the
beacon


by
which
the
sailor
steer
,
-
like
an
unhooped
cask
upon
a
pole
,
-
an


ugly
thing
when
you
be
near
it
;
the
other
,
a
gibbet
,
with
some
chain


hang
to
it
which
have
once
hold
a
pirate
.
the
man
be
limp
on


towards
this
latter
,
as
if
he
be
the
pirate
come
to
life
,
and
come


down
,
and
go
back
to
hook
himself
up
again
.
it
give
I
a
terrible


turn
when
I
think
so
;
and
as
I
see
the
cattle
lift
their
head
to


gaze
after
he
,
I
wonder
whether
they
think
so
too
.
I
look
all


round
for
the
horrible
young
man
,
and
could
see
no
sign
of
he
.
but
now


I
be
frightened
again
,
and
run
home
without
stop
.

II


my
sister
,
Mrs.
Joe
Gargery
,
be
more
than
twenty
year
old
than
I
,


and
have
establish
a
great
reputation
with
herself
and
the
neighbor


because
she
have
bring
I
up
"
by
hand
.
"
have
at
that
time
to
find
out


for
myself
what
the
expression
mean
,
and
know
she
to
have
a
hard
and


heavy
hand
,
and
to
be
much
in
the
habit
of
lay
it
upon
her
husband
as


well
as
upon
I
,
I
suppose
that
Joe
Gargery
and
I
be
both
bring
up


by
hand
.


she
be
not
a
good
-
look
woman
,
my
sister
;
and
I
have
a
general


impression
that
she
must
have
make
Joe
Gargery
marry
she
by
hand
.
Joe


be
a
fair
man
,
with
curl
of
flaxen
hair
on
each
side
of
his
smooth


face
,
and
with
eye
of
such
a
very
undecided
blue
that
they
seem


to
have
somehow
got
mix
with
their
own
white
.

a
mild
,


good
-
natured
,
sweet
-
temper
,
easy

go
,
foolish
,
dear
fellow
,
-
a
sort


of
Hercules
in
strength
,
and
also
in
weakness
.


my
sister
,
Mrs.
Joe
,
with
black
hair
and
eye
,
have
such
a
prevail


redness
of
skin
that
I
sometimes
use
to
wonder
whether
it
be
possible


she
wash
herself
with
a
nutmeg
-
grater
instead
of
soap
.
she
be
tall


and
bony
,
and
almost
always
wear
a
coarse
apron
,
fasten
over
she


figure
behind
with
two
loop
,
and
have
a
square
impregnable
bib
in


front
,
that
be
stick
full
of
pin
and
needle
.
she
make
it
a
powerful


merit
in
herself
,
and
a
strong
reproach
against
Joe
,
that
she
wear
this


apron
so
much
.
though
I
really
see
no
reason
why
she
should
have
wear
it


at
all
;
or
why
,
if
she
do
wear
it
at
all
,
she
should
not
have
take
it


off

day
of
her
life

down

if
he
be
mentally
cast

himself
up

calculate
what
kind

my

have
a
trenchant
way
of
cut
our
bread

butter
for
we
,


that
never
varied
.
first
,
with
her
left
hand
she
jam
the
loaf
hard


and
fast
against
her
bib
,
-
where
it
sometimes
get
a
pin
into
it
,
and


sometimes
a
needle
,
which
we
afterwards
get
into
our
mouth
.
then
she


take
some
butter
 
not
too
much
 
on
a
knife
and
spread
it
on
the
loaf
,
in


an
apothecary
kind
of
way
,
as
if
she
be
make
a
plaster
,
-
use
both


side
of
the
knife
with
a
slapping
dexterity
,
and
trim
and
mould


the
butter
off
round
the
crust
.
then
,
she
give
the
knife
a
final
smart


wipe
on
the
edge
of
the
plaster
,
and
then
saw
a
very
thick
round
off


the
loaf
:
which
she
finally
,
before
separate
from
the
loaf
,
hew
into


two
half
,
of
which
Joe
get
one
,
and
I
the
other
.


on
the
present
occasion
,
though
I
be
hungry
,
I
dared
not
eat
my


slice
.
I
feel
that
I
must
have
something
in
reserve
for
my
dreadful


acquaintance
,
and
his
ally
the
still
more
dreadful
young
man
.
I
know


Mrs.
Joe
's
housekeeping
to
be
of
the
strict
kind
,
and
that
my


larcenous
research
might
find
nothing
available
in
the
safe
.
therefore


I
resolve
to
put
my
hunk
of
bread
and
butter
down
the
leg
of
my


trouser
.


the
effort
of
resolution
necessary
to
the
achievement
of
this
purpose
I


find
to
be
quite
awful
.
it
be
as
if
I
have
to
make
up
my
mind
to
leap


from
the
top
of
a
high
house
,
or
plunge
into
a
great
depth
of
water
.


and
it
be
make
the
more
difficult
by
the
unconscious
Joe
.
in


our
already

mention
freemasonry
as
fellow

sufferer
,
and
in
his


good

natured
companionship
with
I
,
it
be
our
evening
habit
to
compare


the
way
we
bit
through
our
slice
,
by
silently
hold
they
up
to
each


other
's
admiration
now
and
then
,
-
which
stimulate
we
to
new
exertion
.


to
-
night
,
Joe
several
time
invite
I
,
by
the
display
of
his
fast


diminish
slice
,
to
enter
upon
our
usual
friendly
competition
;
but


he
find
I
,
each
time
,
with
my
yellow
mug
of
tea
on
one
knee
,

my
untouched
bread
and
butter
on
the
other
.
at
last
,
I
desperately


consider
that
the
thing
I
contemplate
must
be
do
,
and
that
it


have
well
be
do
in
the
least
improbable
manner
consistent
with
the


circumstance
.
I
take
advantage
of
a
moment
when
Joe
have
just
look
at


I
,
and
get
my
bread
and
butter
down
my
leg
.


Joe
be
evidently
make
uncomfortable
by
what
he
suppose
to
be
my
loss


of
appetite
,
and
take
a
thoughtful
bite
out
of
his
slice
,
which
he


do
n't
 
seem
to
enjoy
.
he
turn
it
about
in
his
mouth
much
long
than


usual
,
ponder
over
it
a
good
deal
,
and
after
all
gulp
it
down
like


a
pill
.
he
be
about
to
take
another
bite
,
and
have
just
get
his
head
on


one
side
for
a
good
purchase
on
it
,
when
his
eye
fall
on
I
,
and
he
see


that
my
bread
and
butter
be
go
.


the
wonder
and
consternation
with
which
Joe
stop
on
the
threshold


of
his
bite

stare
at

find
the
tendency

to
bring
the

out

,
which
be
far
enough
away
now
,
I
have
often
think


that
few
people
know
what
secrecy
there
be
in
the
young
under
terror
.


no
matter
how
unreasonable
the
terror
,
so
that
it
be
terror
.
I
be
in


mortal
terror
of
the
young
man
who
want
my
heart
and
liver
;
I
be


in
mortal
terror
of
my
interlocutor
with
the
iron
leg
;
I
be
in
mortal


terror
of
myself
,
from
whom
an
awful
promise
have
be
extract
;
I
have


no
hope
of
deliverance
through
my
all
-
powerful
sister
,
who
repulse


I
at
every
turn
;
I
be
afraid
to
think
of
what
I
might
have
do
on


requirement
,
in
the
secrecy
of
my
terror
.


if
I
sleep
at
all
that
night
,
it
be
only
to
imagine
myself
drift


down
the
river
on
a
strong
spring
-
tide
,
to
the
Hulks
;
a
ghostly


pirate
call
out
to
I
through
a
speak
-
trumpet
,
as
I
pass
the


gibbet
-
station
,
that
I
have
well
come
ashore
and
be
hang
there
at


once
,
and
not
put
it
off
.
I
be
afraid
to
sleep
,
even
if
I
have
be


incline
,
for
I
know
that
at
the
first
faint
dawn
of
morning
I
must
rob


the
pantry

easy
friction

;
to
have

must
have
strike
it
out


of
flint
and
steel
,
and
have
make
a
noise
like
the
very
pirate
himself


rattle
his
chain
.


as
soon
as
the
great
black
velvet
pall
outside
my
little
window
be
shoot


with
gray

I
get
up

down

I
be
very

I

no

I
have
no

I
steal
some
bread
,


some
rind
of
cheese
,
about
half
a
jar
of
mincemeat
 
which
I
tie
up
in


my

with
my
last
night
's
slice

some
brandy
from
a


stone

which
I
decant
into
a

have
secretly

for

intoxicate
fluid

a
meat
bone
with
very
little

and
a
beautiful
round
compact
pork


pie
.
I
be
nearly
go
away
without
the
pie
,
but
I
be
tempt
to
mount


upon
a
shelf

to
look
what
it

be
put
away

carefully

I
find
it

I
take
it
in
the
hope
that
it
be
not

for
early
use

would


not

there
be
a
door
in
the

with
the
forge

I


unlocked
and
unbolted
that
door
,
and
get
a
file
from
among
Joe
's
tool

then
I
put
the
fastening
as
I
have
find
they
,
open
the
door
at
which


I
have
enter
when
I
run
home
last
night
,
shut
it
,
and
run
for
the
misty


marsh
.


chapter
III


it
be
a
rimy
morning
,
and
very
damp
.
I
have
see
the
damp
lie
on
the


outside
of
my
little
window
,
as
if
some
goblin
have
be
cry
there
all


night
,
and
use
the
window
for
a
pocket
-
handkerchief
.
now
,
I
see
the


damp
lie
on
the
bare
hedge
and
spare
grass
,
like
a
coarser
sort
of


spider
'
webs
;
hang
itself
from
twig
to
twig
and
blade
to
blade
.
on


every
rail
and
gate
,
wet
lie
clammy
,
and
the
marsh
mist
be
so
thick
,


that
the
wooden
finger
on
the
post
direct
people
to
our
village
-
a


direction
which
they
never
accept
,
for
they
never
come
there
-
be


invisible
to
I
until
I
be
quite
close
under
it
.
then
,
as
I
look
up


at
it
,
while
it
drip
,
it
seem
to
my
oppressed
conscience
like
a


phantom
devote
I
to
the
Hulks
.


the
mist
be
heavy
yet
when
I
get
out
upon
the
marsh
,
so
that


instead
of
my
running
at
everything
,
everything
seem
to
run
at
I
.


this
be
very
disagreeable
to
a
guilty
mind
.
the
gate
and
dike
and


bank
came
burst
at
I
through
the
mist
,
as
if
they
cry
as
plainly


as
could
be
,
"

"
the


cattle
come
upon
I
with
like
suddenness
,
stare
out
of
their
eye
,


and
steam
out
of
their
nostril
,
"
Halloa
,

thief

black


ox

a
white
cravat

even
have
to
my
awakened
conscience


something
of
a
clerical
air
,
-
fix
I
so
obstinately
with
his
eye
,


and
move
his
blunt
head
round
in
such
an
accusatory
manner
as
I
move


round
,
that
I
blubber
out
to
he
,

a
cloud

smoke
out
of
his
nose
,
and
vanish
with
a
kick
-
up
of
his
hind
-
leg
and


a
flourish
of
his
tail
.


all
this
time
,
I
be
get
on
towards
the
river
;
but
however
fast
I


go
,
I
could
n't
 
warm
my
foot
,
to
which
the
damp
cold
seem
rivet
,
as


the
iron
be
rivet
to
the
leg
of
the
man
I
be
run
to
meet
.
I
know


my
way
to
the
Battery
,
pretty
straight
,
for
I
have
be
down
there
on
a


Sunday
with
Joe
,
and
Joe
,
sit
on
an
old
gun
,
have
tell
I
that
when


I
be
'
prentice
to
he
,
regularly
bind
,
we
would
have
such
lark
there
!


however
,
in
the
confusion
of
the
mist
,
I
find
myself
at
last
too
far
to


the
right
,
and
consequently
have
to
try
back
along
the
river
-
side
,
on
the


bank
of
loose
stone
above
the
mud
and
the
stake
that
stake
the
tide


out
.
make
my
way
along
here
with
all
despatch
,
I
have
just
cross
a


ditch
which
I
know
to
be
very
near
the
Battery
,
and
have
just
scramble


up
the
mound
beyond
the
ditch
,
when
I
see
the
man
sit
before
I
.


his
back
be
towards
I
,
and
he
have
his
arm
fold
,
and
be
nod


forward
,
heavy
with
sleep
.


I
think
he
would
be
more
glad
if
I
come
upon
he
with
his
breakfast
,


in
that
unexpected
manner
,
so
I
go
forward
softly
and
touch
he
on


the
shoulder
.
he
instantly
jump
up
,
and
it
be
not
the
same
man
,
but


another
man
!


and
yet
this
man
be
dress
in
coarse
gray
,
too
,
and
have
a
great
iron


on
his
leg
,
and
be
lame
,
and
hoarse
,
and
cold
,
and
be
everything
that


the
other
man
be
;
except
that
he
have
not
the
same
face
,
and
have
a
flat


broad
-
brim
low
-
crown
feel
that
on
.
all
this
I
see
in
a
moment
,
for


I
have
only
a
moment
to
see
it
in
:
he
swear
an
oath
at
I
,
make
a
hit
at


I
,
-
it
be
a
round
weak
blow
that
miss
I
and
almost
knock
himself


down
,
for
it
make
he
stumble
,
-
and
then
he
run
into
the
mist
,
stumble


twice
as
he
go
,
and
I
lose
he
.


"
it
be
the
young
man
!
"
I
think
,
feel
my
heart
shoot
as
I
identify


he
.
I
dare
say
I
should
have
feel
a
pain
in
my
liver
,
too
,
if
I
have


know
where
it
be
.


I
be
soon
at
the
Battery
after
that
,
and
there
be
the
right


man
,
-
hug
himself
and
limp
to
and
fro
,
as
if
he
have
never
all


night
leave
off
hugging
and
limp
,
-
wait
for
I
.
he
be
awfully


cold
,
to
be
sure
.
I
half
expect
to
see
he
drop
down
before
my
face


and
die
of
deadly
cold
.
his
eye
look
so
awfully
hungry
too
,
that
when


I
hand
he
the
file

he
lay
it
down
on
the
grass
,

occur
to


I
he
would
have
try
to
eat
it
,

he
have
not

do


not
turn
I
upside
down
this
time
to
get
at
what
I
have
,

my
good
friend
.
even
when
I
be
take
to
have


a
new
suit
of
clothe
,
the
tailor
have
order
to
make
they
like
a
kind
of


reformatory
,
and
on
no
account
to
let
I
have
the
free
use
of
my
limb
.


Joe
and
I
go
to
church
,
therefore
,
must
have
be
a
move
spectacle


for
compassionate
mind
.
yet
,
what
I
suffer
outside
be
nothing
to


what
I
undergo
within
.
the
terror
that
have
assail
I
whenever


Mrs.
Joe
have
go
near
the
pantry
,

out
of
the
room
,
be
only
to
be


equal
by
the
remorse
with
which
my
mind
dwell
on
what
my
hand
have


do
.
under
the
weight
of
my
wicked
secret
,
I
ponder
whether
the


church
would
be
powerful
enough
to
shield
I
from
the
vengeance
of
the


terrible
young
man
,
if
I
divulge
to
that
establishment
.
I
conceive
the


idea
that
the
time
when
the
bann
be
read
and
when
the
clergyman
say
,


"
ye
be
now
to
declare
it
!
"
would
be
the
time
for
I
to
rise
and
propose


a
private
conference
in
the
vestry
.
I
be
far
from
be
sure
that
I


might
not
have
astonish
our
small
congregation
by
resort
to
this


extreme
measure

its

be
a

very
like


Joe
's
change
from
his
working
-
clothe
to
his
Sunday
dress
.
my
sister
be


uncommonly
lively
on
the
present
occasion
,
and
indeed
be
generally
more


gracious
in
the
society
of
Mrs.
Hubble
than
in
other
company
.
I
remember


Mrs.
Hubble
as
a
little
curly
sharp
-
edge
person
in
sky
-
blue
,
who
hold
a


conventionally
juvenile
position
,
because
she
have
marry
Mr.
Hubble
,
-
I


do
n't
 
know
at
what
remote
period
,
-
when
she
be
much
young
than
he
.
I


remember
Mr
Hubble
as
a
tough
,
high
-
shoulder
,
stoop
old
man
,
of
a


sawdusty
fragrance
,
with
his
leg
extraordinarily
wide
apart
:
so
that
in


my
short
day
I
always
see
some
mile
of
open
country
between
they
when


I
meet
he
come
up
the
lane
.


among
this
good
company
I
should
have
feel
myself
,
even
if
I
have
n't


rob
the
pantry
,
in
a
false
position
.
not
because
I
be
squeeze
in


at
an
acute
angle
of
the
tablecloth
,
with
the
table
in
my
chest
,
and
the


pumblechookian
elbow
in
my
eye
,
nor
because
I
be
not
allow
to
speak


 
I
do
n't
 
want
to
speak
,
nor
because
I
be
regale
with
the
scaly
tip


of
the
drumstick
of
the
fowl
,
and
with
those
obscure
corner
of
pork


of
which
the
pig
,
when
live
,
have
have
the
least
reason
to
be
vain
.
no
;


I
should
not
have
mind
that
,
if
they
would
only
have
leave
I
alone
.


but
they
would
n't
 
leave
I
alone
.
they
seem
to
think
the
opportunity


lose
,
if
they
fail
to
point
the
conversation
at
I
,
every
now
and


then
,
and
stick
the
point
into
I
.
I
might
have
be
an
unfortunate


little
bull
in
a
spanish
arena
,
I
got
so
smartingly
touch
up
by
these


moral
goad
.


it
begin
the
moment
we
sit
down
to
dinner
.
Mr.
Wopsle
say
grace
with


theatrical
declamation
,
-
as
it
now
appear
to
I
,
something
like
a


religious
cross
of
the
Ghost
in
Hamlet
with
Richard
the
third
,
-
and


end
with
the
very
proper
aspiration
that
we
might
be
truly
grateful
.


upon
which
my
sister
fix
I
with
her
eye
,
and
say
,
in
a
low


reproachful
voice
,
"
do
you
hear
that
?
be
grateful
.
"


"
especially
,
"
say
Mr.
Pumblechook
,
"
be
grateful
,
boy
,
to
they
which


bring
you
up
by
hand
.
"


Mrs.
Hubble
shake
her
head
,
and
contemplate
I
with
a
mournful


presentiment
that
I
should
come
to
no
good
,
ask
,
"
why
be
it
that
the


young
be
never
grateful
?
"
this
moral
mystery
seem
too
much
for


the
company
until
Mr.
Hubble
tersely
solve
it
by
say
,
"
naterally


wicious
.
"
everybody
then
murmur
"
true

look
at

in
a


particularly
unpleasant

feebler

with
the
excitement
he
furnish
.

now
,

they
be
all
in
lively


anticipation
of
"
the
two
villain

be
take

the
bellow


seem
to
roar
for

sink

the
red

hot
spark
drop

die

pale


afternoon
outside
almost
seem
in
my
pity
young
fancy
to
have
turn


pale
on

account

poor
wretch
.


at
last
,
Joe
's
job
be
do
,

the
ringing
and
roaring
stop
.
as
Joe


get
on
his
coat
,
he
muster
courage
to
propose
that
some
of
we
should


go
down
with
the
soldier
and
see
what
come
of
the
hunt

Mr.
Pumblechook

on
the
plea
of
a
pipe

lady
'
society
;

Mr.
Wopsle
say
he
would
go
,
if
Joe
would
.
Joe
say
he
be
agreeable
,


and
would
take
I
,
if
Mrs.
Joe
approve
.
we
never
should
have
get
leave


to
go
,
I
be
sure
,
but
for
Mrs.
Joe
's
curiosity
to
know
all
about
it
and


how
it
end
.
as
it
be
,
she
merely
stipulate
,

together
again

"


the
sergeant
take
a
polite
leave
of
the
lady
,
and
part
from
Mr.


Pumblechook
as
from
a
comrade
;
though
I
doubt
if
he
be
quite
as
fully


sensible
of
that
gentleman
's
merit
under
arid
condition

something
moist

in

speak
no
word

reach
the
marsh
.
when
we
be
all
out
in


the
raw
air
and
be
steadily
move
towards
our
business
,
I
treasonably


whisper
to
Joe
,
"

hurry
to

window

look
after
we
,

none
come


out
.
we
pass
the
finger

post
,
and
hold
straight
on
to
the
churchyard
.


there
we
be
stop
a
few
minute
by
a
signal
from
the
sergeant
's


hand
,
while
two
or
three
of
his
man
disperse
themselves
among
the


grave
,
and
also
examine
the
porch
.
they
come
in
again
without
find


anything
,
and
then
we
strike
out
on
the
open
marsh
,
through
the
gate


at
the
side
of
the
churchyard
.
a
bitter
sleet
came
rattle
against
we


here
on
the
east
wind
,
and
Joe
take
I
on
his
back
.


now
that
we
be
out
upon
the
dismal
wilderness
where
they
little


think
I
have
be
within
eight
or
nine
hour
and
have
see
both
man


hide
,
I
consider
for
the
first
time
,
with
great
dread
,
if
we
should


come
upon
they
,
would
my
particular
convict
suppose
that
it
be
I
who


have
bring
the
soldier
there
?
he
have
ask
I
if
I
be
a
deceive


imp
,
and
he
have
say
I
should
be
a
fierce
young
hound
if
I
join
the


hunt
against
he
.
would
he
believe
that
I
be
both
imp
and
hound
in


treacherous
earnest
,
and
have
betray
he
?


it
be
of
no
use
ask
myself
this
question
now
.
there
I
be
,
on
Joe
's


back
,
and
there
be
Joe
beneath
I
,
charge
at
the
ditch
like
a


hunter
,
and
stimulate
Mr.
Wopsle
not
to
tumble
on
his
roman
nose
,
and


to
keep
up
with
we
.
the
soldier
be
in
front
of
we
,
extend
into
a


pretty
wide
line
with
an
interval
between
man
and
man
.
we
be
take


the
course
I
have
begin
with
,
and
from
which
I
have
diverge
in
the
mist
.


either
the
mist
be
not
out
again
yet
,
or
the
wind
have
dispel
it
.


under
the
low
red
glare
of
sunset
,
the
beacon
,
and
the
gibbet
,
and

mound
of
the
Battery

the
opposite
shore
of
the
river
,
be
plain
,


though
all
of
a
watery
lead
color
.


with
my
heart
thump
like
a
blacksmith
at
Joe
's
broad
shoulder
,
I


look
all
about
for
any
sign
of
the
convict
.
I
could
see
none
,
I
could


hear
none
.
Mr.
Wopsle
have
greatly
alarm
I
more
than
once
,
by
his


blow
and
hard
breathing
;
but
I
know
the
sound
by
this
time
,
and


could
dissociate
they
from
the
object
of
pursuit
.
I
get
a
dreadful


start
,
when
I
think
I
hear
the
file
still
go
;
but
it
be
only
a


sheep
-
bell
.
the
sheep
stop
in
their
eating
and
look
timidly
at


we
;
and
the
cattle
,
their
head
turn
from
the
wind
and
sleet
,
stare


angrily
as
if
they
hold
we
responsible
for
both
annoyance
;
but
,
except


these
thing
,
and
the
shudder
of
the
die
day
in
every
blade
of
grass
,


there
be
no
break
in
the
bleak
stillness
of
the
marsh
.


the
soldier
be
move
on
in
the
direction
of
the
old
Battery
,
and
we


be
move
on
a
little
way
behind
they
,
when
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
we
all


stop
.
for
there
have
reach
we
on
the
wing
of
the
wind
and
rain
,
a


long
shout
.
it
be
repeat
.
it
be
at
a
distance
towards
the
east
,
but


it
be
long
and
loud
.
nay
,
there
seem
to
be
two
or
more
shout
raise


together
,
-
if
one
might
judge
from
a
confusion
in
the
sound
.


to
this
effect
the
sergeant
and
the
near
man
be
speak
under


their
breath
,
when
Joe
and
I
come
up
.
after
another
moment
's
listening
,


Joe
 
who
be
a
good
judge
 
agree
,
and
Mr.
Wopsle
 
who
be
a
bad
judge


agree
.
the
sergeant
,
a
decisive
man
,
order
that
the
sound
should
not


be
answer
,
but
that
the
course
should
be
change
,
and
that
his
man


should

there
be
a
reasonably
good
path
now

on
the
edge

carry
drop
great
blotch
of
fire
upon
the
track

I
could
see
those
,

lie
smoking

flaring

nothing


else

black
darkness

their


pitchy
blaze

rather
to

that
,

they


limp
along
in
the
midst
of
the
musket
.
we
could
not
go
fast
,
because


of
their
lameness
;
and
they
be
so
spend
,
that
two

three
time
we


have
to
halt
while
they
rest
.


after
an
hour

this
travelling

bright
fire

low
wooden
bedstead

an


overgrown
mangle

not
much
interested

just
lift
their
head

take
a
sleepy
stare
,

lie
down
again

sergeant
make
some


kind
of
report
,

I
have
be
so


unexpectedly
exonerate
do
not
impel
I
to
frank
disclosure

but
I
hope


it
have
some
dreg
of
good
at
the
bottom
of
it
.


I
do
not
recall
that
I
feel
any
tenderness
of
conscience
in
reference


to
Mrs.
Joe
,
when
the
fear
of
be
find
out
be
lift
off
I
.
but


I
love
Joe
,
-
perhaps
for
no
well
reason
in
those
early
day
than


because
the
dear
fellow
let
I
love
he
,
-
and
,
as
to
he
,
my
inner
self


be
not
so
easily
compose
.
it
be
much
upon
my
mind
 
particularly
when


I
first
see
he
look
about
for
his
file
 
that
I
ought
to
tell
Joe
the


whole
truth
.
yet
I
do
not
,
and
for
the
reason
that
I
mistrust
that


if
I
do
,
he
would
think
I
bad
than
I
be
.
the
fear
of
lose
Joe
's


confidence
,
and
of
thenceforth
sit
in
the
chimney
corner
at
night


stare
drearily
at
my
forever
lose
companion
and
friend
,
tie
up
my


tongue
.
I
morbidly
represent
to
myself
that
if
Joe
know
it
,
I
never


afterwards
could
see
he
at
the
fireside
feel
his
fair
whisker
,


without
think
that
he
be
meditate
on
it

that
,

Joe
know
it
,
I


never
afterwards
could
see
he
glance
,
however
casually
,
at
yesterday
's


meat
or
pudding
when
it
come
on
to
-
day
's
table
,
without
think
that
he


be
debate
whether
I
have
be
in
the
pantry
.
that
,
if
Joe
know
it
,
and


at
any
subsequent
period
of
our
joint
domestic
life
remark
that
his


beer
be
flat
or
thick
,
the
conviction
that
he
suspect
tar
in
it
,


would
bring
a
rush
of
blood
to
my
face
.
in
a
word
,
I
be
too
cowardly


to
do
what
I
know
to
be
right
,
as
I
have
be
too
cowardly
to
avoid
do


what
I
know
to
be
wrong
.
I
have
have
no
intercourse
with
the
world
at


that
time
,
and
I
imitate
none
of
its
many
inhabitant
who
act
in
this


manner
.
quite
an
untaught
genius
,
I
make
the
discovery
of
the
line
of


action
for
myself

sleepy

far
away

I
on
his
back
again

carry
I
home
.
he
must
have
have
a
tiresome


journey
of
it
,
for
Mr.
Wopsle
,
be
knock
up
,
be
in
such
a
very
bad


temper
that
if
the
Church
have
be
throw
open
,
he
would
probably
have


excommunicate
the
whole
expedition
,
begin
with
Joe
and
myself
.
in


his
lay
capacity
,
he
persist
in
sit
down
in
the
damp
to
such


an
insane
extent
,
that
when
his
coat
be
take
off
to
be
dry
at
the


kitchen
fire

the
circumstantial
evidence
on
his
trouser
would
have


hang
he
,
if
it
have
be
a
capital
offence
.


by
that
time
,
I
be
stagger
on
the
kitchen
floor

a
little


drunkard

having
be
newly

I
come
to
myself
 
with
the
aid
of
a
heavy
thump
between
the


shoulder
,

the
restorative
exclamation

Joe
tell
they
about
the


convict

all
the
visitor
suggest
different
way


by
which
he
have
get
into
the
pantry
.
Mr.
Pumblechook
make
out
,
after


carefully
survey
the
premise
,
that
he
have
first
get
upon
the
roof
of


the
forge
,
and
have
then
get
upon
the
roof

the
house
,

have
then
let


himself
down
the
kitchen
chimney
by
a
rope
make
of
his
bed
cut


into
strip
;

as
Mr.
Pumblechook
be
very
positive
and
drive
his


own
chaise

cart
-
over
everybody
-
it
be
agree
that
it
must
be
so
.
Mr.


Wopsle
,
indeed
,
wildly
cry
out
,
"
no
!
"
with
the
feeble
malice
of
a


tired
man
;
but
,
as
he
have
no
theory
,
and
no
coat
on
,
he
be
unanimously


set
at
naught

not
to
mention
his
smoking
hard
behind

he
stand


with
his
back

kitchen
fire

draw
the
damp
out
:
which
be
not


calculate
to
inspire
confidence
.


this
be
all
I
hear
that
night
before
my
sister
clutch
I
,
as
a


slumberous
offence
to
the
company

chapter
VIII


Mr.
Pumblechook
's
premise
in
the
High
Street
of
the
market
town
,


be
of
a
peppercorny
and
farinaceous
character
,
as
the
premise
of
a


cornchandler
and
seedsman
should
be
.
it
appear
to
I
that
he
must
be
a


very
happy
man
indeed
,
to
have
so
many
little
drawer
in
his
shop
;
and


I
wonder
when
I
peep
into
one
or
two
on
the
low
tier
,
and
see
the


tie
-
up
brown
paper
packet
inside
,
whether
the
flower
-
seed
and
bulb


ever
want
of
a
fine
day
to
break
out
of
those
jail
,
and
bloom
.


it
be
in
the
early
morning
after
my
arrival
that
I
entertain
this


speculation
.
on
the
previous
night
,
I
have
be
send
straight
to
bed
in


an
attic
with
a
sloping
roof
,
which
be
so
low
in
the
corner
where
the


bedstead
be
,
that
I
calculate
the
tile
as
be
within
a
foot
of
my


eyebrow
.
in
the
same
early
morning
,
I
discover
a
singular
affinity


between
seed
and
corduroy
.
Mr.
Pumblechook
wear
corduroy
,
and
so
do


his
shopman
;
and
somehow
,
there
be
a
general
air
and
flavor
about
the


corduroy
,
so
much
in
the
nature
of
seed
,
and
a
general
air
and
flavor


about
the
seed
,
so
much
in
the
nature
of
corduroy
,
that
I
hardly
know


which
be
which
.
the
same
opportunity
serve
I
for
notice
that
Mr.


Pumblechook
appear
to
conduct
his
business
by
look
across
the


street
at
the
saddler
,
who
appear
to
transact
his
business
by
keep


his
eye
on
the
coachmaker
,
who
appear
to
get
on
in
life
by
put
his


hand
in
his
pocket
and
contemplate
the
baker
,
who
in
his
turn
fold


his
arm
and
stare
at
the
grocer
,
who
stand
at
his
door
and
yawn
at


the
chemist
.
the
watchmaker
,
always
pore
over
a
little
desk
with


a
magnifying
-
glass
at
his
eye
,
and
always
inspect
by
a
group
of


smock
-
frock
pore
over
he
through
the
glass
of
his
shop
-
window
,


seem
to
be
about
the
only
person
in
the
High
Street
whose
trade


engage
his
attention
.


Mr.
Pumblechook
and
I
breakfast
at
eight
o'clock
in
the
parlor
behind


the
shop
,
while
the
shopman
take
his
mug
of
tea
and
hunch
of
bread


and
butter
on
a
sack
of
pea
in
the
front
premise
.
I
consider
Mr.


pumblechook
wretched
company
.
besides
be
possess
by
my
sister
's


idea
that
a
mortifying
and
penitential
character
ought
to
be
impart


to
my
diet
,
-
besides
give
I
as
much
crumb
as
possible
in
combination


with
as
little
butter
,
and
put
such
a
quantity
of
warm
water
into


my
milk
that
it
would
have
be
more
candid
to
have
leave
the
milk
out


altogether
,
-
his
conversation
consist
of
nothing
but
arithmetic
.
on


my
politely
bid
he

pompously

a
strange
place
,
on
an
empty
stomach

I
be
hungry

before
I
have

disposed

it
be
as
much


as
I
could
do
to
get
a
bite

a
sup
,
before
the
next

while
he
sit


at
his
ease
guess
nothing

and
eat
bacon
and
hot
roll
,
in
 
if
I


may
be
allow
the
expression
 
a
gorging
and
gormandize
manner
.


for
such
reason
,
I
be
very
glad
when
ten
o'clock
come
and
we

I

the


manner
in
which
I
should
acquit
myself
under
that
lady
's
roof
.
within


a
quarter
of
an
hour
we
come
to
Miss
Havisham
's
house
,
which
be
of
old

"


I
think
I
overhear
Miss
Havisham
answer
,
-
only
it
seem
so


unlikely
,
-
"
well
?
you
can
break
his
heart
.
"


"
what
do
you
play
,
boy
?
"
ask
Estella
of
myself
,
with
the
great


disdain
.


"
nothing
but
beggar
my
neighbor
,
miss
.
"


"
beggar
he
,
"
say
Miss
Havisham
to
Estella
.
so
we
sit
down
to
card
.


it
be
then
I
begin
to
understand
that
everything
in
the
room
have


stop
,
like
the
watch
and
the
clock
,
a
long
time
ago
.
I
notice
that


Miss
Havisham
put
down
the
jewel
exactly
on
the
spot
from
which
she
have


take
it
up
.
as
Estella
deal
the
card
,
I
glance
at
the
dressing
-
table


again
,
and
see
that
the
shoe
upon
it
,
once
white
,
now
yellow
,
have
never


be
wear
.
I
glance
down
at
the
foot
from
which
the
shoe
be
absent
,


and
see
that
the
silk
stocking
on
it
,
once
white
,
now
yellow
,
have
be


trodden
ragged
.
without
this
arrest
of
everything
,
this
standing
still


of
all
the
pale
decayed
object
,
not
even
the
withered
bridal
dress
on


the
collapse
form
could
have
look
so
like
grave
-
clothe
,
or
the
long


veil
so
like
a
shroud
.


so
she
sit
,
corpse
-
like
,
as
we
play
at
card
;
the
frilling
and


trimming
on
her
bridal
dress
,
look
like
earthy
paper
.
I
know
nothing


then
of
the
discovery
that
be
occasionally
make
of
body
bury
in


ancient
time
,
which
fall
to
powder
in
the
moment
of
be
distinctly


see
;
but
,
I
have
often
think
since
,
that
she
must
have
look
as
if


the
admission
of
the
natural
light
of
day
would
have
strike
she
to
dust
.


"
he
call
the
knave
Jacks
,
this
boy
!
"
say
Estella
with
disdain
,
before


our
first
game
be
out
.
"
and
what
coarse
hand
he
have
!
and
what
thick


boot
!
"


I
have
never
think
of
be
ashamed
of
my
hand
before
;
but
I
begin


to
consider
they
a
very
indifferent
pair
.
her
contempt
for
I
be
so


strong
,
that
it
become
infectious
,
and
I
catch
it
.


she
win
the
game
,
and
I
deal
.
I
misdealt
,
as
be
only
natural
,
when
I


know
she
be
lie
in
wait
for
I
to
do
wrong
;
and
she
denounce
I
for


a
stupid
,
clumsy
labor
-
boy
.


"

Miss
Havisham

I
reply
,
in
a
whisper
.

save
for
the
one
weird
smile
at

should
have
feel
almost


sure
that
Miss
Havisham
's
face
could
not
smile
.
it
have
drop
into
a


watchful
and
brood
expression
,
-
most
likely
when
all
the
thing
about


she
have
become
transfixed
,
-
and
it
look
as
if
nothing
could
ever
lift


it
up
again
.
her
chest
have
drop
,
so
that
she
stoop
;
and
her
voice


have
drop
,
so
that
she
speak
low
,
and
with
a
dead
lull
upon
she
;


altogether
,
she
have
the
appearance
of
having
drop
body
and
soul
,


within
and
without
,
under
the
weight
of
a
crush
blow

I
play
the
game
to
an
end
with
Estella
,

she
beggar
I

she


throw
the
card
down
on
the
table
when
she

despise

I
be
begin
to
remind
she
that
to

day
be
Wednesday
,
when
she


check
I
with
her
former
impatient
movement
of
the
finger
of
she


right
hand
.


"

"


I
follow
the
candle
down

I
have
follow
the
candle
up
,
and
she


stand
it
in
the
place
where
we
have
find
it
.
until
she
open
the


side
entrance
,
I
have
fancy
,
without
think
about
it
,
that
it
must


necessarily
be
night
-
time
.
the
rush
of
the
daylight
quite
confound
I
,


and
make
I
feel
as
if
I
have
be
in
the
candlelight
of
the
strange
room


many
hour
.


"
you
be
to
wait
here
,
you
boy
,
"
say
Estella
;
and
disappear
and


close
the
door
.


I
take
the
opportunity
of
be
alone
in
the
courtyard
to
look
at
my


coarse
hand
and
my
common
boot
.
my
opinion
of
those
accessory
be


not
favorable
.
they
have
never
trouble
I
before
,
but
they
trouble


I
now
,
as
vulgar
appendage
.
I
determine
to
ask
Joe
why
he
have
ever


teach
I
to
call
those
picture
-
card
Jacks
,
which
ought
to
be
call


knave
.
I
wish
Joe
have
be
rather
more
genteelly
bring
up
,
and
then


I
should
have
be
so
too
.


she
come
back
,
with
some
bread
and
meat
and
a
little
mug
of
beer
.
she


put
the
mug
down
on
the
stone
of
the
yard
,
and
give
I
the
bread


and
meat
without
look
at
I
,
as
insolently
as
if
I
be
a
dog
in


disgrace
.
I
be
so
humiliated
,
hurt
,
spurn
,
offended
,
angry
,
sorry
,
-
I


can
not
hit
upon
the
right
name
for
the
smart
-
God
know
what
its
name


be
,
-
that
tear
start
to
my
eye
.
the
moment
they
spring
there
,
the


girl
look
at
I
with
a
quick
delight
in
having
be
the
cause
of
they
.


this
give
I
power
to
keep
they
back
and
to
look
at
she
:
so
,
she
give
a


contemptuous
toss
-
but
with
a
sense
,
I
think
,
of
having
make
too
sure


that
I
be
so
wound
-
and
leave
I
.


but
when
she
be
go
,
I
look
about
I
for
a
place
to
hide
my
face


in
,
and
get
behind
one
of
the
gate
in
the
brewery
-
lane
,
and
lean
my


sleeve
against
the
wall
there
,
and
lean
my
forehead
on
it
and
cry
.


as
I
cry
,
I
kick
the
wall
,
and
take
a
hard
twist
at
my
hair
;
so


bitter
be
my
feeling
,
and
so
sharp
be
the
smart
without
a
name
,
that


need
counteraction
.


my
sister
's
bringing
up
have
make
I
sensitive
.
in
the
little
world
in


which
child
have
their
existence
whosoever
bring
they
up
,
there
be


nothing
so
finely
perceive
and
so
finely
feel
as
injustice
.
it
may
be


only
small
injustice
that
the
child
can
be
expose
to
;
but
the
child


be
small
,
and
its
world
be
small
,
and
its
rocking
-
horse
stand
as
many


hand
high
,
accord
to
scale
,
as
a
big
-
boned
irish
hunter
.
within


myself
,
I
have
sustain
,
from
my
babyhood
,
a
perpetual
conflict
with


injustice
.
I
have
know
,
from
the
time
when
I
could
speak
,
that
my


sister
,
in
her
capricious
and
violent
coercion
,
be
unjust
to
I
.
I
have


cherish
a
profound
conviction
that
she
bring
I
up
by
hand
give
she


no
right
to
bring
I
up
by
jerk
.
through
all
my
punishment
,
disgrace
,


fast
,
and
vigil
,
and
other
penitential
performance
,
I
have
nurse


this
assurance
;
and
to
my
communing
so
much
with
it
,
in
a
solitary
and


unprotected
way
,
I
in
great
part
refer
the
fact
that
I
be
morally
timid


and
very
sensitive
.


I
got
rid
of
my
injure
feeling
for
the
time
by
kick
they
into
the


brewery
wall
,
and
twist
they
out
of
my
hair
,
and
then
I
smooth
my


face
with
my
sleeve
,
and
come
from
behind
the
gate
.
the
bread
and
meat


be
acceptable
,
and
the
beer
be
warm
and
tingle
,
and
I
be
soon


in
spirit
to
look
about
I
.


to
be
sure
,
it
be
a
deserted
place
,
down
to
the
pigeon
-
house
in
the


brewery
-
yard
,
which
have
be
blow
crooked
on
its
pole
by
some
high


wind
,
and
would
have
make
the
pigeon
think
themselves
at
sea
,
if
there


have
be
any
pigeon
there
to
be
rock
by
it
.
but
there
be
no
pigeon


in
the
dove
-
cot
,
no
horse
in
the
stable
,
no
pig
in
the
sty
,
no
malt
in


the
storehouse
,
no
smell
of
grain
and
beer
in
the
copper
or
the
vat
.


all
the
use
and
scent
of
the
brewery
might
have
evaporate
with
its


last
reek
of
smoke
.
in
a
by
-
yard
,
there
be
a
wilderness
of
empty
cask
,


which
have
a
certain
sour
remembrance
of
well
day
linger
about


they
;
but
it
be
too
sour
to
be
accept
as
a
sample
of
the
beer
that


be
go
,
-
and
in
this
respect
I
remember
those
recluse
as
be
like


most
other
.


behind
the
furth
end
of
the
brewery
,
be
a
rank
garden
with
an
old


wall
;
not
so
high
but
that
I
could
struggle
up
and
hold
on
long
enough


to
look
over
it
,
and
see
that
the
rank
garden
be
the
garden
of
the


house
,
and
that
it
be
overgrown
with
tangled
weed
,
but
that
there
be


a
track
upon
the
green
and
yellow
path
,
as
if
some
one
sometimes
walk


there
,
and
that
Estella
be
walk
away
from
I
even
then
.
but
she


seem
to
be
everywhere
.
for
when
I
yield
to
the
temptation
present


by
the
cask
,
and
begin
to
walk
on
they
,
I
see
she
walk
on
they
at


the
end
of
the
yard
of
cask
.
she
have
she
back
towards
I
,
and
hold
she


pretty
brown
hair
spread
out
in
her
two
hand
,
and
never
look
round
,


and
pass
out
of
my
view
directly
.
so
,
in
the
brewery
itself
,
-
by
which


I
mean
the
large
paved
lofty
place
in
which
they
use
to
make
the
beer
,


and
where
the
brewing
utensil
still
be
.
when
I
first
go
into
it
,


and
,
rather
oppress
by
its
gloom
,
stand
near
the
door
look
about


I
,
I
see
her
pass
among
the
extinguished
fire
,
and
ascend
some
light


iron
stair
,
and
go
out
by
a
gallery
high
overhead
,
as
if
she
be
go


out
into
the
sky
.


it
be
in
this
place
,
and
at
this
moment
,
that
a
strange
thing
happen


to
my
fancy
.
I
think
it
a
strange
thing
then
,
and
I
think
it
a


strange
thing
long
afterwards
.
I
turn
my
eye
-
a
little
dim
by


look
up
at
the
frosty
light
-
towards
a
great
wooden
beam
in
a
low


nook
of
the
building
near
I
on
my
right
hand
,
and
I
see
a
figure


hang
there
by
the
neck
.
a
figure
all
in
yellow
white
,
with
but


one
shoe
to
the
foot
;
and
it
hang
so
,
that
I
could
see
that
the
faded


trimming
of
the
dress
be
like
earthy
paper
,
and
that
the
face
be


Miss
Havisham
's
,
with
a
movement
go
over
the
whole
countenance
as
if


she
be
try
to
call
to
I
.
in
the
terror
of
see
the
figure
,


and
in
the
terror
of
be
certain
that
it
have
not
be
there
a
moment


before
,
I
at
first
run
from
it
,
and
then
run
towards
it
.
and
my
terror


be
great
of
all
when
I
find
no
figure
there
.


nothing
less
than
the
frosty
light
of
the
cheerful
sky
,
the
sight
of


people
pass
beyond
the
bar
of
the
court
-
yard
gate
,
and
the
revive


influence
of
the
rest
of
the
bread
and
meat
and
beer
,
would
have
bring


I
round
.
even
with
those
aid
,
I
might
not
have
come
to
myself
as
soon


as
I
do
,
but
that
I
see
Estella
approach
with
the
key
,
to
let


I
out
.
she
would
have
some
fair
reason
for
look
down
upon
I
,
I


think
,
if
she
see
I
frightened
;
and
she
would
have
no
fair
reason
.


she
give
I
a
triumphant
glance
in
pass
I
,
as
if
she
rejoice
that


my
hand
be
so
coarse
and
my
boot
be
so
thick
,
and
she
open
the


gate
,
and
stand
hold
it
.
I
be
pass
out
without
look
at
she
,


when
she
touch
I
with
a
taunting
hand
.


"
why
do
n't
 
you
cry
?
"


"
because
I
do
n't
 
want
to

"


"
you
do
,
"
say
she
.
"
you
have
be

till
you
be
half
blind
,
and


you
be
near

again
now
.
"


she
laugh
contemptuously
,
push
I
out
,
and
lock
the
gate
upon
I
.


I
go
straight
to
Mr.
Pumblechook
's
,
and
be
immensely
relieved
to
find


he
not
at
home
.
so
,
leave
word
with
the
shopman
on
what
day
I
be


want
at
Miss
Havisham
's
again
,
I
set
off
on
the
four
-
mile
walk
to


our
forge
;
ponder
,
as
I
go
along
,
on
all
I
have
see
,
and
deeply


revolve
that
I
be
a
common
laboring
-
boy
;
that
my
hand
be
coarse
;


that
my
boot
be
thick
;
that
I
have
fall
into
a
despicable
habit


of
call
knave
Jacks
;
that
I
be
much
more
ignorant
than
I
have


consider
myself
last
night
,
and
generally
that
I
be
in
a
low
-
live


bad
way
.


chapter
ix


when
I
reach
home
,
my
sister
be
very
curious
to
know
all
about
Miss


Havisham
's
,
and
ask
a
number
of
question
.
and
I
soon
find
myself


getting
heavily
bump
from
behind
in
the
nape
of
the
neck
and
the
small


of
the
back
,
and
have
my
face
ignominiously
shove
against
the
kitchen


wall
,
because
I
do
not
answer
those
question
at
sufficient
length
.


if
a
dread
of
not
be
understand
be
hide
in
the
breast
of
other


young
people
to
anything
like
the
extent
to
which
it
use
to
be
hide


in
mine
,
-
which
I
consider
probable
,
as
I
have
no
particular
reason


to
suspect
myself
of
having
be
a
monstrosity
,
-
it
be
the
key
to
many


reservation
.
I
feel
convinced
that
if
I
describe
Miss
Havisham
's
as
my


eye
have
see
it
,
I
should
not
be
understand
.
not
only
that
,
but
I
feel


convince
that
Miss
Havisham
too
would
not
be
understand
;
and
although


she
be
perfectly
incomprehensible
to
I
,
I
entertain
an
impression


that
there
would
be
something
coarse
and
treacherous
in
my
dragging


she
as
she
really
be
 
to
say
nothing
of
Miss
Estella
 
before
the


contemplation
of
Mrs.
Joe
.
consequently
,
I
say
as
little
as
I
could
,


and
have
my
face
shove
against
the
kitchen
wall
.


the
bad
of
it
be
that
that
bully
old
Pumblechook
,
prey
upon
by


a
devouring
curiosity
to
be

sandy

inquisitively

and
how
I
have
come
up
to
bed
from
the
kitchen
,
and
how


Miss
Havisham
and
Estella
never
sit
in
a
kitchen
,
but
be
far
above
the


level
of
such
common
doing
.
I
fall
asleep
recall
what
I
"
use
to


do
"
when
I
be
at
Miss
Havisham
's
;
as
though
I
have
be
there
week
or


month
,
instead
of
hour
;
and
as
though
it
be
quite
an
old
subject
of


remembrance
,
instead
of
one
that
have
arise
only
that
day
.


that
be
a
memorable
day
to
I
,
for
it
make
great
change
in
I
.
but
it


be
the
same
with
any
life
.
imagine
one
select
day
strike
out
of
it
,


and
think
how
different
its
course
would
have
be
.
pause
you
who
read


this
,
and
think
for
a
moment
of
the
long
chain
of
iron
or
gold
,


of
thorn
or
flower
,
that
would
never
have
bind
you
,
but
for
the


formation
of
the
first
link
on
one
memorable
day
.


chapter
x


the
felicitous
idea
occur
to
I
a
morning
or
two
later
when
I
wake
,


that
the
good
step
I
could
take
towards
make
myself
uncommon
be
to


get
out
of
Biddy
everything
she
know
.
in
pursuance
of
this
luminous


conception
I
mention
to
Biddy
when
I
go
to
Mr.
Wopsle
's
great
-
aunt
's


at
night
,
that
I
have
a
particular
reason
for
wish
to
get
on
in
life
,


and
that
I
should
feel
very
much
oblige
to
she
if
she
would
impart


all
her
learn
to
I
.
Biddy
,
who
be
the
most
obliging
of
girl
,


immediately
say
she
would
,
and
indeed
begin
to
carry
out
her
promise


within
five
minute
.


the
educational
scheme
or
course
establish
by
Mr.
Wopsle
's
great
-
aunt


may
be
resolve
into
the
following
synopsis
.
the
pupil
eat
apple


and
put
straw
down
one
another
's
back
,
until
Mr.
Wopsle
's
great
-
aunt


collect
her
energy
,
and
make
an
indiscriminate
totter
at
they
with


a
birch
-
rod
.
after
receive
the
charge
with
every
mark
of
derision
,
the


pupil
form
in
line
and
buzzingly
pass
a
ragged
book
from
hand
to


hand
.
the
book
have
an
alphabet
in
it
,
some
figure
and
table
,
and


a
little
spelling
,
-
that
be
to
say
,
it
have
have
once
.
as
soon
as
this


volume
begin
to
circulate
,
Mr.
Wopsle
's
great
-
aunt
fall
into
a
state
of


coma
,
arise
either
from
sleep
or
a
rheumatic
paroxysm
.
the
pupil
then


enter
among
themselves
upon
a
competitive
examination
on
the
subject


of
Boots
,
with
the
view
of
ascertaining
who
could
tread
the
hard
upon


whose
toe
.
this
mental
exercise
last
until
Biddy
make
a
rush
at


they
and
distribute
three
defaced
Bibles
 
shape
as
if
they
have
be


unskilfully
cut
off
the
chump
end
of
something
,
more
illegibly
print


at
the
good
than
any
curiosity
of
literature
I
have
since
meet
with
,


speckle
all
over
with
ironmould
,
and
have
various
specimen
of
the


insect
world
smash
between
their
leave
.
this
part
of
the
course
be


usually
lighten
by
several
single
combat
between
Biddy
and
refractory


student
.
when
the
fight
be
over
,
Biddy
give
out
the
number
of
a


page
,
and
then
we
all
read
aloud
what
we
could
,
-
or
what
we
could
n't
 
-
in


a
frightful
chorus
;
Biddy
lead
with
a
high
,
shrill
,
monotonous
voice
,


and
none
of
we
have
the
least
notion
of
,
or
reverence
for
,
what
we


be
read
about
.
when
this
horrible
din
have
last
a
certain
time
,


it
mechanically
awake
Mr.
Wopsle
's
great
-
aunt
,
who
stagger
at
a
boy


fortuitously
,
and
pull
his
ear
.
this
be
understand
to
terminate


the
course
for
the
evening
,
and
we
emerge
into
the
air
with
shriek
of


intellectual
victory
.
it
be
fair
to
remark
that
there
be
no
prohibition


against
any
pupil
's
entertain
himself
with
a
slate
or
even
with
the


ink
 
when
there
be
any
,
but
that
it
be
not
easy
to
pursue
that
branch


of
study
in
the
winter
season
,
on
account
of
the
little
general
shop


in
which
the
class
be
holden
-
and
which
be
also
Mr.
Wopsle
's


great
-
aunt
's
sitting
-
room
and
bedchamber
-
be
but
faintly
illuminate


through
the
agency
of
one
low
-
spirited
dip
-
candle
and
no
snuffer
.


it
appear
to
I
that
it
would
take
time
to
become
uncommon
,
under


these
circumstance
:
nevertheless
,
I
resolve
to
try
it
,
and
that


very
evening
Biddy
enter
on
our
special
agreement
,
by
impart
some


information
from
her
little
catalogue
of
Prices
,
under
the
head
of
moist


sugar
,
and
lend
I
,
to
copy
at
home
,
a
large
old
English
D
which
she


have
imitate
from
the
heading
of
some
newspaper
,
and
which
I
suppose
,


until
she
tell
I
what
it
be
,
to
be
a
design
for
a
buckle
.


of
course
there
be
a
public
-
house
in
the
village
,
and
of
course
Joe


like
sometimes
to
smoke
his
pipe
there
.
I
have
receive
strict
order


from
my
sister
to
call
for
he
at
the
Three
Jolly
Bargemen
,
that


evening
,
on
my
way
from
school
,
and
bring
he
home
at
my
peril
.
to
the


three
Jolly
Bargemen
,
therefore
,
I
direct
my
step
.


there
be
a
bar
at
the
Jolly
Bargemen
,
with
some
alarmingly
long
chalk


score
in
it
on
the
wall
at
the
side
of
the
door
,
which
seem
to
I
to


be
never
pay
off
.
they
have
be
there
ever
since
I
could
remember
,
and


have
grow
more
than
I
have
.
but
there
be
a
quantity
of
chalk
about
our


country
,
and
perhaps
the
people
neglect
no
opportunity
of
turn
it


to
account
.


it
be
Saturday
night
,
I
find
the
landlord
look
rather
grimly


at
these
record
;
but
as
my
business
be
with
Joe
and
not
with
he
,
I


merely
wish
he
good
evening
,
and
pass
into
the
common
room
at
the


end
of
the
passage
,
where
there
be
a
bright
large
kitchen
fire
,


and
where
Joe
be
smoke
his
pipe
in
company
with
Mr.
Wopsle
and
a


strange

Joe
greet

with

the

I

with
an
invisible

.
he
have
a
pipe
in
his


mouth
,
and
he
take
it
out
,
and
,
after
slowly
blow
all
his
smoke
away


and
look
hard
at

all
the
time

so

I
nod

then

nod
again
,

make
room
on
the
settle
beside
he
that
I
might
sit

there

Mr.

in

as
one
who
know
all
about

have
professional
occasion

in

what
female

his

Mr.
Wopsle
finish
off
with
a
most
terrifically
snarl


passage
from
Richard
the
Third
,
and
seem
to
think
he
have
do
quite


enough
to
account
for
it
when
he
add
,
"
-
as
the
poet

.
"


and
here
I
may
remark
that
when
Mr.
Wopsle
refer
to
I
,
he
consider


it
a
necessary
part
of
such
reference
to
rumple
my
hair
and
poke
it
into


my
eye
.
I
can
not
conceive
why
everybody
of
his
standing
who
visit


at
our
house
should
always
have
put
I
through
the
same
inflammatory


process
under
similar
circumstance
.
yet
I
do
not
call
to
mind
that
I


be
ever
in
my
early
youth
the
subject
of
remark
in
our
social
family


circle
,

some
large

handed
person
take
some
such
ophthalmic
step
to


patronize
I
.


all
this
while

the
strange
man
look
at
nobody

I

look
at


I
as
if
he
be
determined
to
have
a
shot
at
I
at
last
,

bring
I


down

he
say
nothing

his
Blue
Blazes
observation

until
the
glass
of
rum
and
water
be
bring
;
and
then
he
make
his


shoot
,
and
a
most
extraordinary
shot
it
be
.


it
be
not
a
verbal
remark
,
but
a
proceeding
in
dumb
-
show
,

be


pointedly
address
to
I

nobody

do
it


he
wipe
the

put
it
in
a
breast

it

the
state

there
they
remain
,
a
nightmare
to
I
,
many
and
many


a
night
and
day
.


I
have
sadly
break
sleep
when
I
get
to
bed
,
through
thinking
of
the


strange
man
take
aim
at
I
with
his
invisible
gun
,

of
the
guiltily


coarse
and
common
thing
it
be
,
to
be
on
secret
term
of
conspiracy
with


convict

a
feature
in
my
low
career

I
have
previously
forget
.


I
be
haunt
by
the
file
too

a
dread
possess
I
that
when
I
least


expect
it
,
the
file
would
reappear
.
I
coax
myself
to
sleep
by


thinking
of
Miss
Havisham
's
,
next
Wednesday
;
and
in
my
sleep
I
see


the
file
come
at
I
out
of
a
door
,
without
see
who
hold
it
,

I


scream
myself
awake

chapter

at
the

I
return

my

ring
at
the
gate
bring
out
Estella

she
lock
it
after
admit


I
,
as
she
have
do
before
,
and
again
precede
I
into
the
dark
passage


where
her
candle
stand
.
she
take
no
notice

I
until
she
have
the


candle
in
her
hand

she
look
over
her
shoulder

superciliously

,

and
take
I
to
quite
another


part
of
the
house
.


the
passage
be
a
long
one
,
and
seem
to
pervade
the
whole
square


basement
of
the
Manor
House
.
we
traverse
but
one
side
of
the
square
,


however
,
and
at
the
end
of
it
she
stop
,

put
she
candle
down

open
a
door

here
,
the
daylight
reappear
,

I
find
myself
in


a
small
paved
courtyard
,
the
opposite
side
of
which
be
form
by
a


detach
dwelling

house
,
that
look
as
if
it
have
once
belong
to
the


manager
or
head
clerk
of
the
extinct
brewery
.
there
be
a
clock
in
the


outer
wall
of
this
house
.
like
the
clock
in
Miss
Havisham
's
room
,
and


like
Miss
Havisham
's
watch
,
it
have
stop
at
twenty
minute
to
nine
.


we
go
in
at
the
door
,
which
stand
open
,
and
into
a
gloomy
room
with
a


low
ceiling
,
on
the
ground
-
floor
at
the
back
.
there
be
some
company
in


the
room
,
and
Estella
say
to
I
as
she
join
it
,

the
window

I


cross
to
it
,
and
stand
"
there
,
"
in
a
very
uncomfortable
state
of
mind
,


look
out
.


it
open
to
the
ground
,
and
look
into
a
most
miserable
corner
of
the


neglect
garden
,
upon
a
rank
ruin
of
cabbage
-
stalk
,
and
one
box
-
tree


that
have
be
clip
round
long
ago
,
like
a
pudding
,
and
have
a
new


growth
at
the
top
of
it
,
out
of
shape
and
of
a
different
color
,
as
if


that
part
of
the
pudding
have
stick
to
the
saucepan
and
got
burn
.
this


be
my
homely
think
,
as
I
contemplate
the
box
-
tree
.
there
have
be


some
light
snow
,
overnight
,
and
it
lie
nowhere
else
to
my
knowledge
;


but
,
it
have
not
quite
melt
from
the
cold
shadow
of
this
bit
of
garden
,


and
the
wind
catch
it
up
in
little
eddy
and
throw
it
at
the
window
,


as
if
it
pelt
I
for
come
there
.


I
divine
that
my
coming
have
stop
conversation
in
the
room
,
and
that


its
other
occupant
be
look
at
I
.
I
could
see
nothing
of
the
room


except
the
shining
of
the
fire
in
the
window
-
glass
,
but
I
stiffen
in


all
my
joint
with
the
consciousness
that
I
be
under
close
inspection
.


there
be
three
lady
in
the
room
and
one
gentleman
.
before
I
have
be


stand
at
the
window
five
minute
,
they
somehow
convey
to
I
that


they
be
all
toady
and
humbug
,
but
that
each
of
they
pretend
not


to
know
that
the
other
be
toady
and
humbug
:
because
the
admission


that
he
or
she
do
know
it
,
would
have
make
he
or
she
out
to
be
a
toady


and
humbug
.


they
all
have
a
listless
and
dreary
air
of
wait
somebody
's

blunter
cast
of
feature
.
indeed
,
when


I
know
she
well
I
begin
to

it
be
a
mercy

any
feature


at
all

very
blank
and

large
head

large
hand

he
take
my
chin


in

turn
up
my
face

have
a
look
at
I
by
the


light
of
the

be
prematurely
bald

the
top
of
his
head

have
bushy
black
eyebrow
that
would
n't
 
lie
down

stand
up
bristle
.


his
eye
be
set
very
deep
in
his
head
,

be
disagreeably
sharp
and


suspicious

he
have
a
large
watch

chain
,

strong
black
dot

his

nothing

I
could
have
have
no
foresight
then
,
that
he
ever
would
be


anything
to
I
,
but
it
happen
that
I
have
this
opportunity
of
observe


he
well
.

no

I

he
could

he


would
have
a
quieter

more
persuasive
manner

be
not
much
time

eye
upon
I
from
the
dressing

table
.


"

a
well
heart

I
have
be

find
for

be
lately

in


the
damp
old

fashioned
grate
,

it
be
more
disposed
to
go
out
than


to
burn
up
,

the
reluctant
smoke
which
hang
in
the
room
seem
cold

the
clear
air

wintry
branch


of

high
chimney

chamber

it


would
be
more
expressive
to

,
faintly
trouble
its
darkness
.
it
be


spacious
,

I
dare
say
have
once
be
handsome

discernible


thing
in
it

cover
with
dust

drop
to

most
prominent
object

a
long
table
with
a
tablecloth
spread
on
it

if
a
feast

clock
all


stop
together

piece
of
some
kind

in
the


middle

this
cloth

it
be
so
heavily
overhung
with
cobwebs
that
its


form
be
quite
undistinguishable
;
and
,
as
I
look
along
the
yellow


expanse
out
of
which
I
remember
its
seeming
to
grow
,
like
a
black


fungus
,
I
see
speckle
-
legged
spider
with
blotchy
body
run
home


to
it
,

run
out
from
it

if
some
circumstance
of
the
great


public
importance
have
just
transpire
in
the
spider
community

hear
the
mouse
too

rattle
behind
the
panel

if
the
same


occurrence
be
important
to
their
interest
.

the
black
beetle
take


no
notice
of
the
agitation
,
and
grope
about
the
hearth
in
a
ponderous


elderly
way

if
they
be
short

sighted

hard

hearing
,

not


on

another

a
hand
upon

I
dead
,
in

at

there

I
remain
quiet
.
Estella
return
,
and
she
too
remain


quiet
.
it
seem
to
I
that
we
continue
thus
for
a
long
time
.
in


the
heavy
air
of
the
room
,
and
the
heavy
darkness
that
brood
in
its


remoter
corner
,
I
even
have
an
alarming
fancy
that
Estella
and
I
might


presently
begin
to
decay
.


at
length
,
not
come
out
of
her
distraught
state
by
degree
,
but
in
an


instant
,
Miss
Havisham
say
,
"
let
I
see
you
two
play
card

have


you
not
begin

with
that
,
we
return
to
her
room

sit
down
as


before

I
be
beggar
,
as
before
;
and
again
,
as
before
,
Miss
Havisham


watch
we
all
the
time
,
direct
my
attention
to
Estella
's
beauty
,

make
I
notice
it
the
more
by
try
her
jewel
on
Estella
's
breast
and


hair

Estella
,
for
her
part
,
likewise
treat
I
as
before
,
except
that
she


do
not
condescend
to
speak

we
have
play
some
half

dozen
game

day

for
my
return

take
down
into
the
yard


to
be
feed
in
the
former
dog

like
manner
.
there
,
too
,
I
be
again
leave
to


wander
about
as
I
like
.


it
be
not
much
to
the
purpose
whether
a
gate
in
that
garden
wall
which


I
have
scramble
up
to
peep
over
on
the
last
occasion
be
,
on
that
last


occasion
,
open
or
shut
.
enough
that
I
see
no
gate
then
,
and
that
I


see
one
now
.
as
it
stand
open
,
and
as
I
know
that
Estella
have
let


the
visitor
out
,

for
she
have
return
with
the
key
in
her
hand
,
-
I


stroll
into
the
garden
,
and
stroll
all
over
it
.
it
be
quite
a


wilderness
,
and
there
be
old
melon
-
frame
and
cucumber
-
frame
in
it
,


which
seem
in
their
decline
to
have
produce
a
spontaneous
growth
of


weak
attempt
at
piece
of
old
hat
and
boot
,
with
now
and
then
a
weedy


offshoot
into
the
likeness
of
a
batter
saucepan
.


when
I
have
exhaust
the
garden
and
a
greenhouse
with
nothing
in
it
but


a
fall
-
down
grape
-
vine
and
some
bottle
,
I
find
myself
in
the
dismal


corner
upon
which
I
have
look
out
of
the
window
.
never
question
for


a
moment
that
the
house
be
now
empty
,
I
look
in
at
another
window
,

find
myself
,
to
my
great
surprise
,
exchange
a
broad
stare
with
a


pale
young
gentleman
with
red
eyelid

light
hair

pale
young

quickly
disappear

have
be
at
his
book

I
have
find
myself

at

I


now

itself

I
do

I
have
often
ask
myself
the
question


since
;
but
what
else
could
I
do
?
his
manner
be
so
final
,

I
be


so
astonished
,

I
follow
where
he
lead
,
as
if
I
have
be
under
a


spell

he
say
,
wheel
round
before
we
have
go
many


pace
.
"

there
it
be

"


in
a
most
irritating
manner
he
instantly
slap
his
hand
against
one


another
,
daintily
fling
one
of
his
leg
up
behind
he
,
pull
my
hair
,


slap
his
hand
again
,
dip
his
head

butt
it
into
my
stomach

unquestionably

the
light
of
a
liberty

particularly
disagreeable
just
after
bread

meat
.
I
therefore
hit
out


at
he
and
be
go
to
hit
out
again
,
when
he
say
,

"


and
begin
dance
backwards
and
forwards
in
a
manner
quite
unparalleled


within
my
limited
experience

backwards

all
sort

thing
while
I


look
helplessly
at
he
.


I
be
secretly
afraid
of
he
when
I
see
he
so
dexterous
;
but
I
feel


morally
and
physically
convince
that
his
light
head
of
hair
could
have


have
no
business
in
the
pit
of
my
stomach

that
I
have
a
right
to


consider
it
irrelevant
when
so
obtrude
on
my
attention
.
therefore
,
I


follow
he
without
a
word
,
to
a
retired
nook
of
the
garden
,
form
by


the
junction
of
two
wall
and
screen
by
some
rubbish
.
on
his
ask
I


if
I
be
satisfied
with
the
ground
,
and
on
my
replying
yes
,
he
beg
my


leave
to
absent
himself
for
a
moment
,
and
quickly
return
with
a
bottle


of
water
and
a
sponge
dip
in
vinegar
.
"
available
for
both
,
"
he
say
,


place
these
against
the
wall
.
and
then
fall
to
pull
off
,
not


only
his
jacket
and
waistcoat
,
but
his
shirt
too
,
in
a
manner
at
once


light
-
hearted
,
business
-
like
,
and
bloodthirsty
.


although
he
do
not
look
very
healthy
,
-
have
pimple
on
his
face
,
and


a
breaking
out
at
his
mouth
,
-
these
dreadful
preparation
quite
appalled


I
.
I
judge
he
to
be
about
my
own
age
,
but
he
be
much
tall
,
and
he


have
a
way
of
spin
himself
about
that
be
full
of
appearance
.
for


the
rest
,
he
be
a
young
gentleman
in
a
gray
suit
 
when
not
denude


for
battle
,
with
his
elbow
,
knee
,
wrist
,
and
heel
considerably
in


advance
of
the
rest
of
he
as
to
development
.


my
heart
fail
I
when
I
see
he
square
at
I
with
every


demonstration
of
mechanical
nicety
,
and
eye
my
anatomy
as
if
he
be


minutely
choose
his
bone
.
I
never
have
be
so
surprised
in
my
life
,


as
I
be
when
I
let
out
the
first
blow
,
and
see
he
lie
on
his


back
,
look
up
at
I
with
a
bloody
nose
and
his
face
exceedingly


fore
-
shorten
.


but
,
he
be
on
his
foot
directly
,
and
after
sponge
himself
with


a
great
show
of
dexterity
begin
square
again
.
the
second
great


surprise
I
have
ever
have
in
my
life
be
see
he
on
his
back
again
,


look
up
at
I
out
of
a
black
eye
.


his
spirit
inspire
I
with
great
respect
.
he
seem
to
have
no


strength
,
and
he
never
once
hit
I
hard
,
and
he
be
always
knock
down
;


but
he
would
be
up
again
in
a
moment
,
sponge
himself
or
drink
out


of
the
water
-
bottle
,
with
the
great
satisfaction
in
second
himself


accord
to
form
,
and
then
come
at
I
with
an
air
and
a
show
that
make


I
believe
he
really
be
go
to
do
for
I
at
last
.
he
get
heavily


bruise
,
for
I
be
sorry
to
record
that
the
more
I
hit
he
,
the
hard
I


hit
he
;
but
he
come
up
again
and
again
and
again
,
until
at
last
he
get


a
bad
fall
with
the
back
of
his
head
against
the
wall
.
even
after
that


crisis
in
our
affair
,
he
get
up
and
turn
round
and
round
confusedly
a


few
time
,
not
know
where
I
be
;
but
finally
go
on
his
knee
to
his


sponge
and
throw
it
up
:
at
the
same
time
pant
out
,
"
that
mean
you


have
win
.
"


he
seem
so
brave
and
innocent
,
that
although
I
have
not
propose
the


contest
,
I
feel
but
a
gloomy
satisfaction
in
my
victory
.
indeed
,
I
go


so
far
as
to
hope
that
I
regard
myself
while
dress
as
a
species
of


savage
young
wolf
or
other
wild
beast
.
however
,
I
get
dress
,
darkly


wipe
my
sanguinary
face
at
interval
,
and
I
say
,
"
can
I
help
you
?
"


and
he
say
"
no
thankee
,
"
and
I
say
"
good
afternoon
,
"
and
he
say
"
same


to
you
.
"


when
I
get
into
the
courtyard
,
I
find
Estella
wait
with
the
key
.


but
she
neither
ask
I
where
I
have
be
,
nor
why
I
have
keep
she


wait
;
and
there
be
a
bright
flush
upon
her
face
,
as
though
something


have
happen
to
delight
she
.
instead
of
go
straight
to
the
gate
,
too
,


she
step
back
into
the
passage
,
and
beckon
I
.


"
come
here
!
you
may
kiss
I
,
if
you
like
.
"


I
kiss
her
cheek
as
she
turn
it
to
I
.
I
think
I
would
have
go


through
a
great
deal
to
kiss
her
cheek
.
but
I
feel
that
the
kiss
be


give
to
the
coarse
common
boy
as
a
piece
of
money
might
have
be
,
and


that
it
be
worth
nothing
.


what
with
the
birthday
visitor
,
and
what
with
the
card
,
and
what
with


the
fight
,
my
stay
have
last
so
long
,
that
when
I
near
home
the
light


on
the
spit
of
sand
off
the
point
on
the
marsh
be
gleam
against


a
black
night
-
sky
,
and
Joe
's
furnace
be
fling
a
path
of
fire
across


the
road
.


chapter
xii


my
mind
grow
very
uneasy
on
the
subject
of
the
pale
young
gentleman
.
the


more
I
think
of
the
fight
,
and
recall
the
pale
young
gentleman
on


his
back
in
various
stage
of
puffy
and
incrimsoned
countenance
,
the


more
certain
it
appear
that
something
would
be
do
to
I
.
I
feel
that


the
pale
young
gentleman
's
blood
be
on
my
head
,
and
that
the
Law
would


avenge
it
.
without
have
any
definite
idea
of
the
penalty
I
have


incur
,
it
be
clear
to
I
that
village
boy
could
not
go
stalk


about
the
country
,
ravage
the
house
of
gentlefolk
and
pitch
into


the
studious
youth
of
England
,
without
lay
themselves
open
to
severe


punishment
.
for
some
day
,
I
even
keep
close
at
home
,
and
look
out
at


the
kitchen
door
with
the
great
caution
and
trepidation
before
go


on
an
errand
,
lest
the
officer
of
the
County
Jail
should
pounce
upon


I
.
the
pale
young
gentleman
's
nose
have
stain
my
trouser
,
and
I
try


to
wash
out
that
evidence
of
my
guilt
in
the
dead
of
night
.
I
have
cut


my
knuckle
against
the
pale
young
gentleman
's
tooth
,
and
I
twist
my


imagination
into
a
thousand
tangle
,
as
I
devise
incredible
way
of


account
for
that
damnatory
circumstance
when
I
should
be
hale
before


the
Judges
.


when
the
day
come
round
for
my
return
to
the
scene
of
the
deed
of


violence
,
my
terror
reach
their
height
.
whether
myrmidon
of
Justice
,


specially
send
down
from
London
,
would
be
lie
in
ambush
behind
the


gate
;
-
whether
Miss
Havisham
,
prefer
to
take
personal
vengeance
for


an
outrage
do
to
her
house
,
might
rise
in
those
grave
-
clothe
of
hers
,


draw
a
pistol
,
and
shoot
I
dead
:
-
whether
suborn
boy
-
a
numerous


band
of
mercenary
-
might
be
engage
to
fall
upon
I
in
the
brewery
,


and
cuff
I
until
I
be
no
more
;
-
it
be
high
testimony
to
my
confidence


in
the
spirit
of
the
pale
young
gentleman
,
that
I
never
imagine
he


accessory
to
these
retaliation
;
they
always
come
into
my
mind
as
the


act
of
injudicious
relative
of
his
,
goad
on
by
the
state
of
his


visage
and
an
indignant
sympathy
with
the
family
feature
.


however
,
go
to
Miss
Havisham
's
I
must
,
and
go
I
do
.
and
behold
!
nothing


come
of
the
late
struggle
.
it
be
not
allude
to
in
any
way
,
and
no
pale


young
gentleman
be
to
be
discover
on
the
premise
.
I
find
the
same


gate
open
,
and
I
explore
the
garden
,
and
even
look
in
at
the
window


of
the
detach
house
;
but
my
view
be
suddenly
stop
by
the
closed


shutter
within
,
and
all
be
lifeless
.
only
in
the
corner
where


the
combat
have
take
place
could
I
detect
any
evidence
of
the
young


gentleman
's
existence
.
there
be
trace
of
his
gore
in
that
spot
,
and
I


cover
they
with
garden
-
mould
from
the
eye
of
man
.


on
the
broad
landing
between
Miss
Havisham
's
own
room
and
that
other


room
in
which
the
long
table
be
lay
out
,
I
see
a
garden
-
chair
,
-
a


light
chair
on
wheel
,
that
you
push
from
behind
.
it
have
be
place


there
since
my
last
visit
,
and
I
enter
,
that
same
day
,
on
a
regular


occupation
of
push
Miss
Havisham
in
this
chair
 
when
she
be
tired
of


walk
with
her
hand
upon
my
shoulder
 
round
her
own
room
,
and
across


the
landing
,
and
round
the
other
room
.
over
and
over
and
over
again
,


we
would
make
these
journey
,
and
sometimes
they
would
last
as
long
as


three
hour
at
a
stretch
.
I
insensibly
fall
into
a
general
mention
of


these
journey
as
numerous
,
because
it
be
at
once
settle
that
I
should


return
every
alternate
day
at
noon
for
these
purpose
,
and
because
I
be


now
go
to
sum
up
a
period
of
at
least
eight
or
ten
month
.


as
we
begin
to
be
more
used
to
one
another
,
Miss
Havisham
talk
more


to
I
,
and
ask
I
such
question
as
what
have
I
learn
and
what
be


I
go
to
be
?
I
tell
she
I
be
go
to
be
apprentice
to
Joe
,
I


believe
;
and
I
enlarge
upon
my
know
nothing
and
want
to
know


everything
,
in
the
hope
that
she
might
offer
some
help
towards
that


desirable
end
.
but
she
do
not
;
on
the
contrary
,
she
seem
to
prefer
my


be
ignorant
.
neither
do
she
ever
give
I
any
money
,
-
or
anything


but
my
daily
dinner
,
-
nor
ever
stipulate
that
I
should
be
pay
for
my


service
.


Estella
be
always
about
,
and
always
let
I
in
and
out
,
but
never
tell


I
I
might
kiss
she
again
.
sometimes
,
she
would
coldly
tolerate
I
;


sometimes
,
she
would
condescend
to
I
;
sometimes
,
she
would
be
quite


familiar
with
I
;
sometimes
,
she
would
tell
I
energetically
that
she


hate
I
.
Miss
Havisham
would
often
ask
I
in
a
whisper
,
or
when
we
be


alone
,
"
do
she
grow
pretty
and
pretty
,
Pip
?
"
and
when
I
say
yes


 
for
indeed
she
do
,
would
seem
to
enjoy
it
greedily
.
also
,
when
we


play
at
card
Miss
Havisham
would
look
on
,
with
a
miserly
relish
of


Estella
's
mood
,
whatever
they
be
.
and
sometimes
,
when
her
mood
be


so
many
and
so
contradictory
of
one
another
that
I
be
puzzle
what


to
say
or
do
,
Miss
Havisham
would
embrace
she
with
lavish
fondness
,


murmur
something
in
her
ear
that
sound
like
"
break
their
heart
my


pride
and
hope
,
break
their
heart
and
have
no
mercy
!
"


there
be
a
song
Joe
use
to
hum
fragment
of
at
the
forge
,
of
which
the


burden
be
Old
Clem
.
this
be
not
a
very
ceremonious
way
of
render


homage
to
a
patron
saint
,
but
I
believe
Old
Clem
stand
in
that
relation


towards
smith
.
it
be
a
song
that
imitate
the
measure
of
beat
upon


iron
,
and
be
a
mere
lyrical
excuse
for
the
introduction
of
Old
Clem
's


respected
name
.
thus
,
you
be
to
hammer
boy
round
-
Old
Clem
!
with
a


thump
and
a
sound
-
old
Clem
!
beat
it
out
,
beat
it
out
-
Old
Clem
!
with
a


clink
for
the
stout
-
old
Clem
!
blow
the
fire
,
blow
the
fire
-
old


Clem
!
roar
dryer
,
soar
high
-
old
Clem
!
one
day
soon
after
the


appearance
of
the
chair
,
Miss
Havisham
suddenly
say
to
I
,
with
the


impatient
movement
of
her
finger
,
"
there
,
there
,
there
!
sing
!
"
I
be


surprised
into
croon
this
ditty
as
I
push
she
over
the
floor
.
it


happen
so
to
catch
her
fancy
that
she
take
it
up
in
a
low
brooding


voice
as
if
she
be
singe
in
her
sleep
.
after
that
,
it
become


customary
with
we
to
have
it
as
we
move
about
,
and
Estella
would
often


join
in
;
though
the
whole
strain
be
so
subdue
,
even
when
there
be


three
of
we
,
that
it
make
less
noise
in
the
grim
old
house
than
the


light
breath
of
wind
.


what
could
I
become
with
these
surrounding
?
how
could
my
character
fail


to
be
influence
by
they
?
be
it
to
be
wonder
at
if
my
thought
be


daze
,
as
my
eye
be
,
when
I
come
out
into
the
natural
light
from
the


misty
yellow
room
?


perhaps
I
might
have
tell
Joe
about
the
pale
young
gentleman
,
if
I
have


not
previously
be
betray
into
those
enormous
invention
to
which


I
have
confess
.
under
the
circumstance
,
I
feel
that
Joe
could
hardly


fail
to
discern
in
the
pale
young
gentleman
,
an
appropriate
passenger


to
be
put
into
the
black
velvet
coach
;
therefore
,
I
say
nothing
of
he
.


besides
,
that
shrink
from
have
Miss
Havisham
and
Estella
discuss
,


which
have
come
upon
I
in
the
beginning
,
grow
much
more
potent
as
time


go
on
.
I
repose
complete
confidence
in
no
one
but
Biddy
;
but
I
tell


poor
Biddy
everything
.
why
it
come
natural
to
I
to
do
so
,
and
why
Biddy


have
a
deep
concern
in
everything
I
tell
she
,
I
do
not
know
then
,
though


I
think
I
know
now
.


meanwhile
,
council
go
on
in
the
kitchen
at
home
,
fraught
with


almost
insupportable
aggravation
to
my
exasperate
spirit
.
that
ass
,


Pumblechook
,
use
often
to
come
over
of
a
night
for
the
purpose
of


discuss
my
prospect
with
my
sister
;
and
I
really
do
believe
 
to


this
hour
with
less
penitence
than
I
ought
to
feel
,
that
if
these
hand


could
have
take
a
linchpin
out
of
his
chaise
-
cart
,
they
would
have
do


it
.
the
miserable
man
be
a
man
of
that
confine
stolidity
of
mind
,
that


he
could
not
discuss
my
prospect
without
have
I
before
he
,
-
as
it


be
,
to
operate
upon
,
-
and
he
would
drag
I
up
from
my
stool
 
usually


by
the
collar
 
where
I
be
quiet
in
a
corner
,
and
,
put
I
before
the


fire
as
if
I
be
go
to
be
cook
,
would
begin
by
say
,
"
now
,
Mum
,


here
be
this
boy
!
here
be
this
boy
which
you
bring
up
by
hand
.
hold
up


your
head
,
boy
,
and
be
forever
grateful
unto
they
which
so
do
do
.
now
,


mum
,
with
respection
to
this
boy
!
"
and
then
he
would
rumple
my
hair


the
wrong
way
,
-
which
from
my
early
remembrance
,
as
already
hint
,


I
have
in
my
soul
deny
the
right
of
any
fellow
-
creature
to
do
,
-
and


would
hold
I
before
he
by
the
sleeve
,
-
a
spectacle
of
imbecility
only


to
be
equal
by
himself
.


then
,
he
and
my
sister
would
pair
off
in
such
nonsensical
speculation


about
Miss
Havisham
,
and
about
what
she
would
do
with
I
and
for
I
,


that
I
use
to
want
-
quite
painfully
-
to
burst
into
spiteful
tear
,
fly


at
Pumblechook
,
and
pummel
he
all
over
.
in
these
dialogue
,
my
sister


speak
to
I
as
if
she
be
morally
wrench
one
of
my
tooth
out
at


every
reference
;
while
Pumblechook
himself
,
self
-
constitute
my
patron
,


would
sit
supervise
I
with
a
depreciatory
eye
,
like
the
architect
of


my
fortune
who
think
himself
engage
on
a
very
unremunerative
job
.


in
these
discussion
,
Joe
bear
no
part
.
but
he
be
often
talk
at
,


while
they
be
in
progress
,
by
reason
of
Mrs.
Joe
's
perceive
that


he
be
not
favorable
to
my
be
take
from
the
forge
.
I
be
fully
old


enough
now
to
be
apprentice
to
Joe
;
and
when
Joe
sit
with
the
poker
on


his
knee
thoughtfully
rake
out
the
ashe
between
the
low
bar
,
my


sister
would
so
distinctly
construe
that
innocent
action
into
opposition


on
his
part
,
that
she
would
dive
at
he
,
take
the
poker
out
of
his


hand
,
shake
he
,
and
put
it
away
.
there
be
a
most
irritating
end
to


every
one
of
these
debate
.
all
in
a
moment
,
with
nothing
to
lead
up
to


it
,
my
sister
would
stop
herself
in
a
yawn
,
and
catch
sight
of
I
as


it
be
incidentally
,
would
swoop
upon
I
with
,
"

out

we
go
on
in
this
way
for
a
long
time
,

it
seem
likely
that
we


should
continue
to
go
on
in
this
way
for
a
long
time
,

one
day
Miss


Havisham

short

she

I

some
displeasure

think
it
well
to

the
medium

a
meditative
look

this
might
be
occasion

circumstance

I

no
control

she

no
more

the

she
presently
stop

at

that
it

pull


up

high

a
basket

be
not
quite
clear
whether
these
article
be


carry
penitentially

ostentatiously

I
rather
think
they
be


display
as
article
of
property
,

much
as
Cleopatra

any
other


sovereign
lady
on
the
Rampage
might
exhibit
her
wealth

procession

Estella

the

as
usual
,
and
,
the
moment
she
appear
,
Joe
take


his
hat
off
and
stand
weigh
it
by
the
brim
in
both
his
hand
;
as
if


he
have
some
urgent
reason
in
his
mind

particular
to
half
a


quarter

Estella
take
no
notice

we

lead
we
the
way

I
know


so
well
.
I
follow
next
to
she
,

Joe
come
last
.
when
I
look
back


at
Joe
in
the
long
passage

he
be
still

his

the


great
care

be
an
excrescence
on
the
entertainment
.
and
to
make
it


bad
,
they
all
ask
I
from
time
to
time
,
-
in
short
,
whenever
they


have
nothing
else
to
do
,
-
why
I
do
n't
 
enjoy
myself
?
and
what
could
I


possibly
do
then
,
but
say
I
be
enjoy
myself
,
-
when
I
be
n't
!


however
,
they
be
grow
up
and
have
their
own
way
,
and
they
make
the


most
of
it
.
that
swindle
Pumblechook
,
exalt
into
the
beneficent


contriver
of
the
whole
occasion
,
actually
take
the
top
of
the
table
;


and
,
when
he
address
they
on
the
subject
of
my
be
bind
,
and
have


fiendishly
congratulate
they
on
my
be
liable
to
imprisonment
if
I


play
at
card
,
drank
strong
liquor
,
keep
late
hour
or
bad
company
,


or
indulge
in
other
vagary
which
the
form
of
my
indenture
appear


to
contemplate
as
next
to
inevitable
,
he
place
I
stand
on
a
chair


beside
he
to
illustrate
his
remark
.


my
only
other
remembrance
of
the
great
festival
be
,
that
they
would
n't


let
I
go
to
sleep
,
but
whenever
they
see
I
drop
off
,
wake
I
up


and
tell
I
to
enjoy
myself
.
that
,
rather
late
in
the
evening
Mr.
Wopsle


give
we
Collins
's
ode
,
and
throw
his
bloodstained
sword
in
thunder


down
,
with
such
effect
,
that
a
waiter
come
in
and
say
,
"
the
Commercials


underneath
send
up
their
compliment
,
and
it
be
n't
 
the
Tumblers
'
arm
.
"


that
,
they
be
all
in
excellent
spirit
on
the
road
home
,
and
sing
,
o


Lady
Fair
!
Mr.
Wopsle
take
the
bass
,
and
assert
with
a
tremendously


strong
voice
 
in
reply
to
the
inquisitive
bore
who
lead
that
piece


of
music
in
a
most
impertinent
manner
,
by
want
to
know
all
about


everybody
's
private
affair
 
that
he
be
the
man
with
his
white
lock


flow
,
and
that
he
be
upon
the
whole
the
weak
pilgrim
go
.


finally
,
I
remember
that
when
I
get
into
my
little
bedroom
,
I
be
truly


wretched
,
and
have
a
strong
conviction
on
I
that
I
should
never
like


Joe
's
trade
.
I
have
like
it
once
,
but
once
be
not
now
.


chapter
XIV


it
be
a
most
miserable
thing
to
feel
ashamed
of
home
.
there
may
be
black


ingratitude
in
the
thing
,
and
the
punishment
may
be
retributive
and
well


deserve
;
but
that
it
be
a
miserable
thing
,
I
can
testify
.


home
have
never
be
a
very
pleasant
place
to
I
,
because
of
my
sister
's


temper
.
but
,
Joe
have
sanctify
it
,
and
I
have
believe
in
it
.
I
have


believe
in
the
good
parlor
as
a
most
elegant
saloon
;
I
have
believe


in
the
front
door
,
as
a
mysterious
portal
of
the
Temple
of
State
whose


solemn
opening
be
attend
with
a
sacrifice
of
roast
fowl
;
I
have


believe
in
the
kitchen
as
a
chaste
though
not
magnificent
apartment
;


I
have
believe
in
the
forge
as
the
glowing
road
to
manhood
and


independence
.
within
a
single
year
all
this
be
change
.
now
it
be
all


coarse
and
common
,
and
I
would
not
have
have
Miss
Havisham
and
Estella


see
it
on
any
account
.


how
much
of
my
ungracious
condition
of
mind
may
have
be
my
own
fault
,


how
much
Miss
Havisham
's
,
how
much
my
sister
's
,
be
now
of
no
moment
to


I
or
to
any
one
.
the
change
be
make
in
I
;
the
thing
be
do
.
well
or


ill
do
,
excusably
or
inexcusably
,
it
be
do
.


once
,
it
have
seem
to
I
that
when
I
should
at
last
roll
up
my


shirt
-
sleeve
and
go
into
the
forge
,
Joe
's
'
prentice
,
I
should
be


distinguished
and
happy
.
now
the
reality
be
in
my
hold
,
I
only
feel


that
I
be
dusty
with
the
dust
of
small
-
coal
,
and
that
I
have
a
weight


upon
my
daily
remembrance
to
which
the
anvil
be
a
feather
.
there
have


be
occasion
in
my
later
life
 
I
suppose
as
in
most
life
 
when
I
have


feel
for
a
time
as
if
a
thick
curtain
have
fall
on
all
its
interest


and
romance
,
to
shut
I
out
from
anything
save
dull
endurance
any
more
.


never
have
that
curtain
drop
so
heavy
and
blank
,
as
when
my
way
in


life
lie
stretch
out
straight
before
I
through
the
newly
enter
road


of
apprenticeship
to
Joe
.


I
remember
that
at
a
later
period
of
my
"
time
,
"
I
use
to
stand
about


the
churchyard
on
Sunday
evening
when
night
be
fall
,
compare
my


own
perspective
with
the
windy
marsh
view
,
and
make
out
some
likeness


between
they
by
think
how
flat
and
low
both
be
,
and
how
on
both


there
come
an
unknown
way
and
a
dark
mist
and
then
the
sea
.
I
be
quite


as
deject
on
the
first
working
-
day
of
my
apprenticeship
as
in
that


after
-
time
;
but
I
be
glad
to
know
that
I
never
breathe
a
murmur
to
Joe


while
my
indenture
last
.
it
be
about
the
only
thing
I
be
glad
to
know


of
myself
in
that
connection
.


for
,
though
it
include
what
I
proceed
to
add
,
all
the
merit
of
what
I


proceed
to
add
be
Joe
's
.
it
be
not
because
I
be
faithful
,
but
because


Joe
be
faithful
,
that
I
never
run
away
and
go
for
a
soldier
or


a
sailor
.
it
be
not
because
I
have
a
strong
sense
of
the
virtue
of


industry
,
but
because
Joe
have
a
strong
sense
of
the
virtue
of
industry
,


that
I
work
with
tolerable
zeal
against
the
grain
.
it
be
not
possible


to
know
how
far
the
influence
of
any
amiable
honest
-
hearte
duty
-
do


man
fly
out
into
the
world
;
but
it
be
very
possible
to
know
how
it
have


touch
one
's
self
in
go
by
,
and
I
know
right
well
that
any
good
that


intermix
itself
with
my
apprenticeship
come
of
plain
content
Joe
,


and
not
of
restlessly
aspire
discontent
I
.


what
I
want
,
who
can
say
?
how
can
I
say
,
when
I
never
know
?
what


I
dread
be
,
that
in
some
unlucky
hour
I
,
be
at
my
grimi
and


commonest
,
should
lift
up
my
eye
and
see
Estella
look
in
at
one


of
the
wooden
window
of
the
forge
.
I
be
haunt
by
the
fear
that
she


would
,
soon
or
later
,
find
I
out
,
with
a
black
face
and
hand
,
do


the
coarse
part
of
my
work
,
and
would
exult
over
I
and
despise
I
.


often
after
dark
,
when
I
be
pull
the
bellow
for
Joe
,
and
we
be


singe
Old
Clem
,
and
when
the
thought
how
we
use
to
sing
it
at
Miss


Havisham
's
would
seem
to
show
I
Estella
's
face
in
the
fire
,
with
she


pretty
hair
flutter
in
the
wind
and
her
eye
scorn
I
,
-
often
at


such
a
time
I
would
look
towards
those
panel
of
black
night
in
the
wall


which
the
wooden
window
then
be
,
and
would
fancy
that
I
see
she
just


draw
her
face
away
,
and
would
believe
that
she
have
come
at
last
.


after
that
,
when
we
go
in
to
supper
,
the
place
and
the
meal
would
have


a
more
homely
look
than
ever
,
and
I
would
feel
more
ashamed
of
home
than


ever
,
in
my
own
ungracious
breast
.


chapter
XV


as
I
be
get
too
big
for
Mr.
Wopsle
's
great
-
aunt
's
room
,
my


education
under
that
preposterous
female
terminate
.
not
,
however
,
until


Biddy
have
impart
to
I
everything
she
know
,
from
the
little
catalogue


of
price
,
to
a
comic
song
she
have
once
buy
for
a
half
-
penny
.


although
the
only
coherent
part
of
the
latter
piece
of
literature
be


the
opening
line
,


when
I
go
to
Lunnon
town
sir
,
too
rul
loo
rul
too
rul

I
do
very
brown
sir
?
too
rul
loo
rul
too
rul
loo
rul
-
still
,
in


my
desire
to
be
wise
,
I
get
this
composition
by
heart
with
the
utmost


gravity
;
nor
do
I
recollect
that
I
question
its
merit
,
except
that
I


think
 
as
I
still
do
 
the
amount
of
Too
rul
somewhat
in
excess
of
the


poetry
.
in
my
hunger
for
information
,
I
make
proposal
to
Mr.
Wopsle
to


bestow
some
intellectual
crumb
upon
I
,
with
which
he
kindly
comply
.


as
it
turn
out
,
however
,
that
he
only
want
I
for
a
dramatic


lay
-
figure
,
to
be
contradict
and
embrace
and
weep
over
and
bully


and
clutched
and
stab
and
knock
about
in
a
variety
of
way
,
I
soon


decline
that
course
of
instruction
;
though
not
until
Mr.
Wopsle
in
his


poetic
fury
have
severely
maul
I
.


whatever
I
acquire
,
I
try
to
impart
to
Joe
.
this
statement
sound
so


well
,
that
I
can
not
in
my
conscience
let
it
pass
unexplained
.
I
want


to
make
Joe
less
ignorant
and
common
,
that
he
might
be
worthy
of
my


society
and
less
open
to
Estella
's
reproach
.


the
old
Battery
out
on
the
marsh
be
our
place
of
study
,
and
a
break


slate
and
a
short
piece
of
slate
-
pencil
be
our
educational
implement
:


to
which
Joe
always
add
a
pipe
of
tobacco
.
I
never
know
Joe
to


remember
anything
from
one
Sunday
to
another
,
or
to
acquire
,
under
my


tuition
,
any
piece
of
information
whatever
.
yet
he
would
smoke
his
pipe


at
the
Battery
with
a
far
more
sagacious
air
than
anywhere
else
,
-
even


with
a
learn
air
,
-
as
if
he
consider
himself
to
be
advance


immensely
.
dear
fellow
,
I
hope
he
do
.


it
be
pleasant
and
quiet
,
out
there
with
the
sail
on
the
river
pass


beyond
the
earthwork
,
and
sometimes
,
when
the
tide
be
low
,
look


as
if
they
belong
to
sink
ship
that
be
still
sail
on
at
the


bottom
of
the
water
.
whenever
I
watch
the
vessel
stand
out
to
sea


with
their
white
sail
spread
,
I
somehow
think
of
Miss
Havisham
and


Estella
;
and
whenever
the
light
strike
aslant
,
afar
off
,
upon
a
cloud


or
sail
or
green
hillside
or
water
-
line
,
it
be
just
the
same
.
-
Miss


Havisham
and
Estella
and
the
strange
house
and
the
strange
life
appear


to
have
something
to
do
with
everything
that
be
picturesque
.


one
Sunday
when
Joe
,
greatly
enjoy
his
pipe
,
have
so
plume
himself
on


be
"
most
awful
dull
,
"
that
I
have
give
he
up
for
the
day
,
I
lie
on


the
earthwork
for
some
time
with
my
chin

I

keep
a
journeyman
at
weekly
wage
whose
name
be
Orlick

he
pretend
that
his
christian
name
be
Dolge
,

a
clear


impossibility
,

he
be
a
fellow
of
that
obstinate
disposition
that
I


believe
he
to
have
be
the
prey
of
no
delusion
in
this
particular

wilfully
to
have
impose
that
name
upon
the

an
affront

understanding

loose

limbe
swarthy
fellow
of


great
strength

never
in

always
slouch
.
he
never
even


seem
to
come
to
his
work
on
purpose
,

would
slouch
in
as
if
by
mere


accident
;
and
when
he
go
to
the
Jolly
Bargemen
to
eat
his
dinner
,
or


go
away
at
night
,
he
would
slouch
out
,
like
Cain
or
the
Wandering
Jew
,


as
if
he
have
no
idea
where
he
be
go
and
no
intention
of
ever


come
back

he
lodge
at
a
sluice

keeper
's
out
on
the
marsh
,

on


work

day
would
come
slouch
from
his
hermitage

with
his
hand
in


his
pocket

his
dinner
loosely
tie
in
a
bundle
round
his

lie
all
day

sluice

against
rick

otherwise
require

he
look
up
in
a
half
-
resentful
,


half

puzzle
way

though
the
only
think
he
ever
have
be
,
that
it


be
rather
an
odd
and
injurious
fact
that
he
should
never
be
think
.


this
morose
journeyman
have
no
liking
for
I
.
when
I
be
very
small
and


timid
,
he
give
I
to
understand
that
the
Devil
live
in
a
black
corner


of
the
forge
,

that
he
know
the
fiend
very
well

also
that
it
be


necessary
to
make
up
the
fire
,
once
in
seven
year
,
with
a
live
boy
,

that
I
might
consider
myself
fuel

when
I
become
Joe

'

Orlick


be
perhaps
confirm
in
some
suspicion
that
I
should
displace
he

,
he
like
I
still
less
.
not
that
he
ever
say
anything
,

do


anything
,
openly
import
hostility
;
I
only
notice
that
he
always
beat


his
spark

my

nothing
less

come
on

on
his
defence
straightway

so
much

pull
off

apron

go


at
one
another

two
giant

,
if
any
man
in
that
neighborhood


could
stand
uplong
against
Joe

I
never

the
man

if
he


have
be
of
no
more
account

the
pale
young
gentleman

very


soon
among
the
coal

dust
,

in
no
hurry
to
come
out
of
it
.
then
Joe


unlock
the
door

pick
up
my
sister
,
who
have
drop
insensible


at
the
window

who
have
see
the
fight
first

carry
into

down

recommend
to

nothing

clench
her
hand

,
come
that
singular
calm
and
silence
which
succeed
all
uproar
;
and


then
,
with
the
vague
sensation
which
I
have
always
connect
with
such


a
lull
,
-
namely
,
that
it
be
Sunday
,

somebody
be
dead
,

I
go
up


stair

I
find
Joe

up

without
any


other
trace
of
discomposure
than
a
slit
in
one
of
Orlick
's
nostril

be
neither
expressive

Jolly
Bargemen

peaceable
manner

the
lull
have
a
sedative
and
philosophical
influence
on


Joe
,
who
follow
I
out
into
the
road
to
say
,

a
parting

serious

the
walnut

shell
countenance

I


feel
more
than
ever
dissatisfy
with
my
home
and
with
my
trade
and
with


everything
;
and
that
be
all
I
take
by
that
motion
.


as
I
be
loiter
along
the
High
Street
,
look
in
disconsolately
at


the
shop
window
,
and
think
what
I
would
buy
if
I
be
a
gentleman
,


who
should
come
out
of
the
bookshop
but
Mr.
Wopsle
.
Mr.
Wopsle
have
in


his
hand
the
affect
tragedy
of
George
Barnwell
,
in
which
he
have
that


moment
invest
sixpence
,
with
the
view
of
heap
every
word
of
it
on


the
head
of
Pumblechook
,
with
whom
he
be
go
to
drink
tea
.
no
soon


do
he
see
I
,
than
he
appear
to
consider
that
a
special
providence


have
put
a
'
prentice
in
his
way
to
be
read
at
;
and
he
lay
hold
of
I
,


and
insist
on
my
accompany
he
to
the
pumblechookian
parlor
.
as
I


know
it
would
be
miserable
at
home
,
and
as
the
night
be
dark
and
the


way
be
dreary
,
and
almost
any
companionship
on
the
road
be
well


than
none
,
I
make
no
great
resistance
;
consequently
,
we
turn
into


Pumblechook
's
just
as
the
street
and
the
shop
be
light
up
.


as
I
never
assist
at
any
other
representation
of
George
Barnwell
,
I


do
n't
 
know
how
long
it
may
usually
take
;
but
I
know
very
well
that
it


take
until
half
-
past
nine
o
'
clock
that
night
,
and
that
when
Mr.
Wopsle


get
into
Newgate
,
I
think
he
never
would
go
to
the
scaffold
,
he
become


so
much
slow
than
at
any
former
period
of
his
disgraceful
career
.
I


think
it
a
little
too
much
that
he
should
complain
of
be
cut
short


in
his
flower
after
all
,
as
if
he
have
not
be
run
to
seed
,
leaf


after
leaf
,
ever
since
his
course
begin
.
this
,
however
,
be
a


mere
question
of
length
and
wearisomeness
.
what
sting
I
,
be
the


identification
of
the
whole
affair
with
my
unoffending
self
.
when


barnwell
begin
to
go
wrong
,
I
declare
that
I
feel
positively
apologetic
,


Pumblechook
's
indignant
stare
so
tax
I
with
it
.
Wopsle
,
too
,
take


pain
to
present
I
in
the
bad
light
.
at
once
ferocious
and
maudlin
,
I


be
make
to
murder
my
uncle
with
no
extenuate
circumstance
whatever
;


Millwood
put
I
down
in
argument
,
on
every
occasion
;
it
become
sheer


monomania
in
my
master
's
daughter
to
care
a
button
for
I
;
and
all
I
can


say
for
my
gasping
and
procrastinating
conduct
on
the
fatal
morning
,
be
,


that
it
be
worthy
of
the
general
feebleness
of
my
character
.
even
after


I
be
happily
hang
and
Wopsle
have
close
the
book
,
Pumblechook
sit


stare
at
I
,
and
shake
his
head
,
and
say
,
"
take
warning
,
boy

take
warning

"
as
if
it
be
a
well

I

dark
night

out

Mr.
Wopsle

the
walk

beyond

no

chapter
XVI


with
my
head
full
of
George
Barnwell
,
I
be
at
first
disposed
to
believe


that
I
must
have
have
some
hand
in
the
attack
upon
my
sister
,
or
at


all
event
that
as
her
near
relation
,
popularly
know
to
be
under


obligation
to
she
,
I
be
a
more
legitimate
object
of
suspicion
than


any
one
else
.
but
when
,
in
the
clear
light
of
next
morning
,
I
begin
to


reconsider
the
matter
and
to
hear
it
discuss
around
I
on
all
side
,
I


take
another
view
of
the
case
,
which
be
more
reasonable
.


Joe
have
be
at
the
Three
Jolly
Bargemen
,
smoke
his
pipe
,
from
a


quarter
after
eight
o'clock
to
a
quarter
before
ten
.
while
he
be
there
,


my
sister
have
be
see
stand
at
the
kitchen
door
,
and
have
exchange


Good
Night
with
a
farm
-
laborer
go
home
.
the
man
could
not
be
more


particular
as
to
the
time
at
which
he
see
her
 
he
get
into
dense


confusion
when
he
try
to
be
,
than
that
it
must
have
be
before
nine
.


when
Joe
go
home
at
five
minute
before
ten
,
he
find
she
strike
down


on
the
floor
,
and
promptly
call
in
assistance
.
the
fire
have
not
then


burn
unusually
low
,
nor
be
the
snuff
of
the
candle
very
long
;
the


candle
,
however
,
have
be
blow
out
.


nothing
have
be
take
away
from
any
part
of
the
house
.
neither
,
beyond


the
blowing
out
of
the
candle
,
-
which
stand
on
a
table
between
the
door


and
my
sister
,
and
be
behind
she
when
she
stand
face
the
fire
and
be


strike
,
-
be
there
any
disarrangement
of
the
kitchen
,
except
such


as
she
herself
have
make
,
in
fall
and
bleed
.
but
,
there
be
one


remarkable
piece
of
evidence
on
the
spot
.
she
have
be
strike
with


something
blunt
and
heavy
,
on
the
head
and
spine
;
after
the
blow
be


deal
,
something
heavy
have
be
throw
down
at
she
with
considerable


violence
,
as
she
lie
on
her
face
.
and
on
the
ground
beside
she
,
when
Joe


pick
she
up
,
be
a
convict
's
leg
-
iron
which
have
be
file
asunder
.


now
,
Joe
,
examine
this
iron
with
a
smith
's
eye
,
declare
it
to
have


be
file
asunder
some
time
ago
.
the
hue
and
cry
go
off
to
the


Hulks
,
and
people
come
thence
to
examine
the
iron
,
Joe
's
opinion


be
corroborate
.
they
do
not
undertake
to
say
when
it
have
leave
the


prison
-
ship
to
which
it
undoubtedly
have
once
belong
;
but
they
claim


to
know
for
certain
that
that
particular
manacle
have
not
be
wear
by


either
of
the
two
convict
who
have
escape
last
night
.
far
,
one
of


those
two
be
already
retake
,
and
have
not
free
himself
of
his
iron
.


know
what
I
know
,
I
set
up
an
inference
of
my
own
here
.
I
believe


the
iron
to
be
my
convict
's
iron
,
-
the
iron
I
have
see
and
hear
he


file
at
,
on
the
marsh
,
-
but
my
mind
do
not
accuse
he
of
having
put


it
to
its
late
use
.
for
I
believe
one
of
two
other
person
to
have


become
possess
of
it
,
and
to
have
turn
it
to
this
cruel
account
.


either
Orlick
,
or
the
strange
man
who
have
show
I
the
file
.


now
,
as
to
Orlick
;
he
have
go
to
town
exactly
as
he
tell
we
when
we


pick
he
up
at
the
turnpike
,
he
have
be
see
about
town
all
the


evening
,
he
have
be
in
diver
company
in
several
public
-
house
,
and


he
have
come
back
with
myself
and
Mr.
Wopsle
.
there
be
nothing
against


he
,
save
the
quarrel
;
and
my
sister
have
quarrel
with
he
,
and
with


everybody
else
about
she
,
ten
thousand
time
.
as
to
the
strange
man
;
if


he
have
come
back
for
his
two
bank
-
note
there
could
have
be
no
dispute


about
they
,
because
my
sister
be
fully
prepared
to
restore
they
.


besides
,
there
have
be
no
altercation
;
the
assailant
have
come
in
so


silently
and
suddenly
,
that
she
have
be
fell
before
she
could
look


round
.


it
be
horrible
to
think
that
I
have
provide
the
weapon
,
however


undesignedly
,
but
I
could
hardly
think
otherwise
.
I
suffer
unspeakable


trouble
while
I
consider
and
reconsider
whether
I
should
at
last


dissolve
that
spell
of
my
childhood
and
tell
Joe
all
the
story
.
for


month
afterwards
,
I
every
day
settle
the
question
finally
in
the


negative
,
and
reopen
and
reargue
it
next
morning
.
the
contention


come
,
after
all
,
to
this
;
-
the
secret
be
such
an
old
one
now
,
have
so


grow
into
I
and
become
a
part
of
myself
,
that
I
could
not
tear
it


away
.
in
addition
to
the
dread
that
,
having
lead
up
to
so
much
mischief
,


it
would
be
now
more
likely
than
ever
to
alienate
Joe
from
I
if
he


believe
it
,
I
have
a
further
restrain
dread
that
he
would
not
believe


it
,
but
would
assort
it
with
the
fabulous
dog
and
veal
-
cutlet
as
a


monstrous
invention
.
however
,
I
temporize
with
myself
,
of
course
-
for
,


be
I
not
waver
between
right
and
wrong
,
when
the
thing
be
always


do
?
-
and
resolve
to
make
a
full
disclosure
if
I
should
see
any


such
new
occasion
as
a
new
chance
of
help
in
the
discovery
of
the


assailant
.


the
Constables
and
the
Bow
Street
man
from
London
-
for
,
this
happen
in


the
day
of
the
extinct
red
-
waistcoate
police
-
be
about
the
house
for


a
week
or
two
,
and
do
pretty
much
what
I
have
hear
and
read
of
like


authority
do
in
other
such
case
.
they
take
up
several
obviously


wrong
people
,
and
they
run
their
head
very
hard
against
wrong
idea
,


and
persist
in
try
to
fit
the
circumstance
to
the
idea
,
instead


of
try
to
extract
idea
from
the
circumstance
.
also
,
they
stand


about
the
door
of
the
Jolly
Bargemen
,
with
know
and
reserve
look


that
fill
the
whole
neighborhood
with
admiration
;
and
they
have
a


mysterious
manner
of
take
their
drink
,
that
be
almost
as
good
as


take
the
culprit
.
but
not
quite
,
for
they
never
do
it
.


long
after
these
constitutional
power
have
disperse
,
my
sister
lie
very


ill
in
bed
.
her
sight
be
disturb
,
so
that
she
see
object
multiply
,


and
grasp
at
visionary
teacup
and
wineglass
instead
of
the


reality
;
her
hearing
be
greatly
impaired
;
her
memory
also
;
and
she


speech
be
unintelligible
.
when
,
at
last
,
she
come
round
so
far
as
to


be
help
down
stair
,
it
be
still
necessary
to
keep
my
slate
always
by


she
,
that
she
might
indicate
in
write
what
she
could
not
indicate
in


speech
.
as
she
be
 
very
bad
handwriting
apart
 
a
more
than
indifferent


speller
,
and
as
Joe
be
a
more
than
indifferent
reader
,
extraordinary


complication
arise
between
they
which
I
be
always
call
in
to
solve
.


the
administration
of
mutton
instead
of
medicine
,
the
substitution
of


tea
for
Joe
,
and
the
baker
for
bacon
,
be
among
the
mild
of
my
own


mistake
.


however
,
her
temper
be
greatly
improve
,
and
she
be
patient
.
a


tremulous
uncertainty
of
the
action
of
all
her
limb
soon
become
a


part
of
her
regular
state
,
and
afterwards
,
at
interval
of
two
or
three


month
,
she
would
often
put
her
hand
to
her
head
,
and
would
then
remain


for
about
a
week
at
a
time
in
some
gloomy
aberration
of
mind
.
we
be


at
a
loss
to
find
a
suitable
attendant
for
she
,
until
a
circumstance


happen
conveniently
to
relieve
we
.
Mr.
Wopsle
's
great
-
aunt
conquer
a


confirm
habit
of
live
into
which
she
have
fall
,
and
Biddy
become
a


part
of
our
establishment
.


it
may
have
be
about
a
month
after
my
sister
's
reappearance
in
the


kitchen
,
when
Biddy
come
to
we
with
a
small
speckled
box
contain
the


whole
of
her
worldly
effect
,
and
become
a
blessing
to
the
household
.


above
all
,
she
be
a
blessing
to
Joe
,
for
the
dear
old
fellow
be
sadly


cut
up
by
the
constant
contemplation
of
the
wreck
of
his
wife
,
and
have


be
accustom
,
while
attend
on
she
of
an
evening
,
to
turn
to
I


every
now
and
then
and
say
,
with
his
blue
eye
moisten
,
"
such
a
fine


figure
of
a
woman
as
she
once
be
,
Pip
!
"
Biddy
instantly
take
the


clever
charge
of
she
as
though
she
have
study
she
from
infancy
;
Joe


become
able
in
some
sort
to
appreciate
the
great
quiet
of
his
life
,


and
to
get
down
to
the
Jolly
Bargemen
now
and
then
for
a
change
that
do


he
good
.
it
be
characteristic
of
the
police
people
that
they
have
all


more
or
less
suspect
poor
Joe
 
though
he
never
know
it
,
and
that
they


have
to
a
man
concur
in
regard
he
as
one
of
the
deep
spirit


they
have
ever
encounter
.


Biddy
's
first
triumph
in
her
new
office
,
be
to
solve
a
difficulty


that
have
completely
vanquish
I
.
I
have
try
hard
at
it
,
but
have
make


nothing
of
it
.
thus
it
be
:
-


again
and
again
and
again
,
my
sister
have
trace
upon
the
slate
,
a


character
that
look
like
a
curious
t
,
and
then
with
the
utmost


eagerness
have
call
our
attention
to
it
as
something
she
particularly


want
.
I
have
in
vain
try
everything
producible
that
begin
with
a
t
,


from
tar
to
toast
and
tub
.
at
length
it
have
come
into
my
head
that
the


sign
look
like
a
hammer
,
and
on
my
lustily
call
that
word
in
my


sister
's
ear
,
she
have
begin
to
hammer
on
the
table
and
have
express
a


qualified
assent
.
thereupon
,
I
have
bring
in
all
our
hammer
,
one
after


another
,
but
without
avail
.
then
I
bethink
I
of
a
crutch
,
the
shape


be
much
the
same
,
and
I
borrow
one
in
the
village
,
and
display


it
to
my
sister
with
considerable
confidence
.
but
she
shake
her
head
to


that
extent
when
she
be
show
it
,
that
we
be
terrify
lest
in
she


weak
and
shattered
state
she
should
dislocate
her
neck
.


when
my
sister
find
that
Biddy
be
very
quick
to
understand
she
,
this


mysterious
sign
reappear
on
the
slate
.
Biddy
look
thoughtfully


at
it
,
hear
my
explanation
,
look
thoughtfully
at
my
sister
,
look


thoughtfully
at
Joe
 
who
be
always
represent
on
the
slate
by
his


initial
letter
,
and
run
into
the
forge
,
follow
by
Joe
and
I
.


"
why
,
of
course
!
"
cry
Biddy
,
with
an
exultant
face
.
"
do
n't
 
you
see
?


it
be
he
!
"


Orlick
,
without
a
doubt
!
she
have
lose
his
name
,
and
could
only
signify


he
by
his
hammer
.
we
tell
he
why
we
want
he
to
come
into
the


kitchen
,
and
he
slowly
lay
down
his
hammer
,
wipe
his
brow
with
his


arm
,
take
another
wipe
at
it
with
his
apron
,
and
come
slouch


out
,
with
a
curious
loose
vagabond
bend
in
the
knee
that
strongly


distinguish
he
.


I
confess
that
I
expect
to
see
my
sister
denounce
he
,
and
that
I


be
disappoint
by
the
different
result
.
she
manifest
the
great


anxiety
to
be
on
good
term
with
he
,
be
evidently
much
pleased
by
his


be
at
length
produce
,
and
motion
that
she
would
have
he


give
something
to
drink
.
she
watch
his
countenance
as
if
she
be


particularly
wishful
to
be
assure
that
he
take
kindly
to
his
reception
,


she
show
every
possible
desire
to
conciliate
he
,
and
there
be
an
air


of
humble
propitiation
in
all
she
do
,
such
as
I
have
see
pervade
the


bearing
of
a
child
towards
a
hard
master
.
after
that
day
,
a
day
rarely


pass
without
she
draw
the
hammer
on
her
slate
,
and
without
Orlick
's


slouch
in
and
stand
doggedly
before
she
,
as
if
he
know
no
more


than
I
do
what
to
make
of
it
.


chapter
XVII


I
now
fall
into
a
regular
routine
of
apprenticeship
life
,
which
be


varied
beyond
the
limit
of
the
village
and
the
marsh
,
by
no
more


remarkable
circumstance
than
the
arrival
of
my
birthday
and
my
pay


another
visit
to
Miss
Havisham
.
I
find
Miss
Sarah
Pocket
still
on
duty


at
the
gate
;
I
find
Miss
Havisham
just
as
I
have
leave
she
,
and
she
speak


of
Estella
in
the
very
same
way
,
if
not
in
the
very
same
word
.
the


interview
last
but
a
few
minute
,
and
she
give
I
a
guinea
when
I
be


go
,
and
tell
I
to
come
again
on
my
next
birthday
.
I
may
mention
at


once
that
this
become
an
annual
custom
.
I
try
to
decline
take
the


guinea
on
the
first
occasion
,
but
with
no
well
effect
than
cause
she


to
ask
I
very
angrily
,
if
I
expect
more
?
then
,
and
after
that
,
I
take


it
.


so
unchanging
be
the
dull
old
house
,
the
yellow
light
in
the
darken


room
,
the
faded
spectre
in
the
chair
by
the
dressing
-
table
glass
,
that


I
feel
as
if
the
stopping
of
the
clock
have
stop
Time
in
that


mysterious
place
,
and
,
while
I
and
everything
else
outside
it
grow


old
,
it
stand
still
.
Daylight
never
enter
the
house
as
to
my


thought
and
remembrance
of
it
,
any
more
than
as
to
the
actual
fact
.
it


bewilder
I
,
and
under
its
influence
I
continue
at
heart
to
hate
my


trade
and
to
be
ashamed
of
home
.


imperceptibly
I
become
conscious
of
a
change
in
Biddy
,
however
.
she


shoe
come
up
at
the
heel
,
her
hair
grow
bright
and
neat
,
her
hand
be


always
clean
.
she
be
not
beautiful
,
-
she
be
common
,
and
could
not
be


like
Estella
,
-
but
she
be
pleasant
and
wholesome
and
sweet
-
temper
.


she
have
not
be
with
we
more
than
a
year
 
I
remember
she
be
newly


out
of
mourning
at
the
time
it
strike
I
,
when
I
observe
to
myself
one


evening
that
she
have
curiously
thoughtful
and
attentive
eye
;
eye
that


be
very
pretty
and
very
good
.


it
come
of
my
lifting
up
my
own
eye
from
a
task
I
be
pore


at
-
write
some
passage
from
a
book
,
to
improve
myself
in
two
way
at


once
by
a
sort
of
stratagem
-
and
see
Biddy
observant
of
what
I
be


about
.
I
lay
down
my
pen
,
and
Biddy
stop
in
her
needlework
without


lay
it
down
.


"
Biddy
,
"
say
I
,
"
how
do
you
manage
it
?
either
I
be
very
stupid
,
or
you


be
very
clever
.
"


"
what
be
it
that
I
manage
?
I
do
n't
 
know
,
"
return
Biddy
,
smile
.


she
manage
our
whole
domestic
life
,
and
wonderfully
too
;
but
I
do
not


mean
that
,
though
that
make
what
I
do
mean
more
surprising
.


"
how
do
you
manage
,
Biddy
,
"
say
I
,
"
to
learn
everything
that
I
learn
,


and
always
to
keep
up
with
I
?
"
I
be
begin
to
be
rather
vain
of


my
knowledge
,
for
I
spend
my
birthday
guineas
on
it
,
and
set
aside
the


great
part
of
my
pocket
-
money
for
similar
investment
;
though
I
have
no


doubt
,
now
,
that
the
little
I
know
be
extremely
dear
at
the
price
.


"
I
might
as
well
ask
you
,
"
say
Biddy
,
"
how
you
manage
?
"


"
no
;
because
when
I
come
in
from
the
forge
of
a
night
,
any
one
can
see


I
turn
to
at
it
.
but
you
never
turn
to
at
it
,
Biddy
.
"


"
I
suppose
I
must
catch
it
like
a
cough
,
"
say
Biddy
,
quietly
;
and
go


on
with
her
sewing
.


pursue
my
idea
as
I
lean
back
in
my
wooden
chair
,
and
look
at


biddy
sew
away
with
her
head
on
one
side
,
I
begin
to
think
she
rather


an
extraordinary
girl
.
for
I
call
to
mind
now
,
that
she
be
equally


accomplish
in
the
term
of
our
trade
,
and
the
name
of
our
different


sort
of
work
,
and
our
various
tool
.
in
short
,
whatever
I
know
,
Biddy


know
.
theoretically
,
she
be
already
as
good
a
blacksmith
as
I
,

well
.


"
you
be
one

those

I
,
"
who
make
the
most
of
every


chance

you
never

a
chance

"


Biddy
look
at
I
for
an
instant

on
with
her
sewing

sit
silent

a
drudge
she
have
be


until
Mr.

's
great

aunt
successfully

that
bad
habit
of


live
,
so
highly
desirable
to
be
got
rid
of
by
some
people
.
I
recall


the
hopeless
circumstance
by
which
she
have
be
surround
in
the


miserable
little
shop
and
the
miserable
little
noisy
evening
school
,


with
that
miserable
old
bundle
of
incompetence
always
to
be
drag

reflect

be
latent

uneasiness

discontent

a
matter

sit
quietly

no

tear

I


look
at
she

think
about

all

it
occur
to
I

perhaps


I
have
not
be
sufficiently
grateful
to
Biddy

I
might
have
be
too


reserve
,

should
have
patronize
she
more
 
though
I
do
not
use
that


precise
word
in
my
meditation
 
with
my
confidence

far
,
and
we
do
so
,
and
the


summer
afternoon
tone
down
into
the
summer
evening
,
and
it
be
very


beautiful
.
I
begin
to
consider
whether
I
be
not
more
naturally
and


wholesomely
situate
,
after
all
,
in
these
circumstance
,
than
play


beggar
my
neighbor
by
candle
-
light
in
the
room
with
the
stop
clock
,


and
be
despise
by
Estella
.
I
think
it
would
be
very
good
for
I
if


I
could
get
she
out
of
my
head
,
with
all
the
rest
of
those
remembrance


and
fancy
,
and
could
go
to
work
determine
to
relish
what
I
have
to
do
,


and
stick
to
it
,
and
make
the
good
of
it
.
I
ask
myself
the
question


whether
I
do
not
surely
know
that
if
Estella
be
beside
I
at
that


moment
instead
of
Biddy
,
she
would
make
I
miserable
?
I
be
oblige
to


admit
that
I
do
know
it
for
a
certainty
,
and
I
say
to
myself
,
"
Pip
,


what
a
fool
you
be
!
"


we
talk
a
good
deal
as
we
walk
,
and
all
that
Biddy
say
seem


right
.
Biddy
be
never
insult
,

capricious
,
or
Biddy
to

day
and


somebody
else
to

she
would
have
derive
only
pain
,

no


pleasure
,
from
give
I
pain

she
would
far
rather
have
wound
her
own


breast
than
mine
.
how
could
it
be
,
then
,
that
I
do
not
like
she
much


the
well
of
the

Biddy

I
,

walk
homeward

right

Biddy

I
could
only
get
myself
to
fall
in
love
with
you

you

my


speak
so
openly

an
old

I

"
but
you
never
will

you

say
Biddy
.


it
do
not
appear
quite
so
unlikely
to
I
that
evening
,
as
it
would
have


do
if
we
have
discuss
it
a
few
hour
before
.
I
therefore
observe


I
be
not
quite
sure
of
that
.
but
Biddy
say
she
be
,
and
she
say
it


decisively
.
in
my
heart
I
believe
she
to
be
right
;
and
yet
I
take
it


rather
ill
,
too
,
that
she
should
be
so
positive
on
the
point
.


when
we
come
near
the
churchyard
,
we
have
to
cross
an
embankment
,
and


get
over
a
stile
near
a
sluice
-
gate
.
there
start
up
,
from
the
gate
,

from
the
rush
,

from
the
ooze
 
which
be
quite
in
his
stagnant
way

Old
Orlick

"


this
penalty
of
be
jiggere
be
a
favorite
supposititious
case
of


his
.
he
attach
no
definite
meaning
to
the
word
that
I
be
aware
of
,
but


use
it
,
like
his
own
pretend
christian
name
,
to
affront
mankind
,
and


convey
an
idea
of
something
savagely
damaging
.
when
I
be
young
,
I


have
have
a
general
belief
that
if
he
have
jiggere
I
personally
,
he
would


have
do
it
with
a
sharp

Biddy
be
much
against
his

to
I
in
a

receive
that
piece
of
information
with
a
yell
of


laughter
,
and
drop
back
,

came
slouch
after
we
at
a
little


distance

curious
to
know
whether
Biddy
suspect
he
of
having
have
a
hand
in


that
murderous
attack
of
which
my
sister

never

any


account

I
ask
she
why

over

now
,

my

not
confused
enough

I
complicate


its
confusion
fifty
thousand

fold

by
have
state

season
when
I

immeasurably
well
than
Estella

that
the


plain
honest
work

to
which
I
be
bear
have
nothing
in

be
ashamed
of

offer
I
sufficient
mean
of
self

respect


and
happiness
.
at
those
time

I
would
decide
conclusively

my


disaffection

go

I
be


grow
up
in
a
fair
way
to
be
partner
with
Joe

to
keep
company


with

when
all
in
a
moment
some
confound
remembrance
of
the


Havisham
day
would
fall
upon
I

a
destructive

scatter

.
scatter

a
long
time

up

often

well
together

they
would
be
disperse
in
all


direction

one
stray
thought

perhaps
after
all
Miss

go

a


Saturday
night

gloat
over
every
abhorrent
adjective


in
the
description

pointed
imitation

our
local
practitioner
;

he
pipe

aged
turnpike

keeper
who
have
hear
blow

to


an
extent
so
very
paralytic

a
doubt

mental


competency

there
be
a
certain
touch

sadness

congratulation

resent

nothing

nod
her

thoughtfully
at
the
fire

she
take
up

then
they


congratulate
I
again
,

go
on
to
express
so
much
wonder
at
the


notion
of
my

a
gentleman

I
do
n't

the
good

my

but
I
doubt
if


they
have
more
meaning
in
they
than
an
election
cry
,
and
I
can
not
suggest


a
dark
picture
of
her
state
of
mind
.


I
never
could
have
believe
it
without
experience
,

as
Joe
and


Biddy
become
more
at
their
cheerful
ease
again
,
I
become
quite
gloomy
.


dissatisfy
with
my
fortune
,
of
course
I
could
not
be

it
be


possible
that
I
may
have
be
,
without
quite
know
it

dissatisfied


with
myself

any
how

I
sit
with
my

my

my
face

my

look
into
the
fire

those
two
talk
about
my
go
away
,
and


about
what
they
should
do
without
I
,

all
that
.

whenever
I


catch
one

never
so
pleasantly

they


often
look
at
I

Biddy

I
feel
offended

into

I
sit
down

a
long
look

a
mean


little
room

the

fall
into
much
the

confused
division

mind

it
and
the
well
room

which
I

the

brightly

warm

I
put
the
window
open

stand
look
out
,
I
see


Joe
come
slowly
forth
at
the
dark
door
,
below
,
and
take
a
turn
or
two


in
the
air
;
and
then
I
see
Biddy
come
,
and
bring
he
a
pipe
and
light


it
for
he
.
he
never
smoke
so
late
,
and
it
seem
to
hint
to
I
that
he


want
comforting
,
for
some
reason
or
other
.


he
presently
stand
at
the
door
immediately
beneath
I
,
smoke
his
pipe
,


and
Biddy
stand
there
too
,
quietly
talk
to
he
,
and
I
know
that
they


talk
of
I
,
for
I
hear
my
name
mention
in
an
endear
tone

both

not

listen

more

I
could


have
hear
more

I
draw
away
from
the
window
,

sit
down
in
my
one


chair
by
the
bedside
,
feel
it
very
sorrowful
and
strange
that
this


first
night
of
my
bright
fortune
should
be
the
lonely
I
have
ever


know

the
open
window

I
see
light
wreath
from
Joe

float
there

I
fancy
it
be
like
a
blessing
from
Joe
,

not


obtrude
on
I
or
parade
before
I
,

pervade
the
air
we
share


together
.
I
put
my
light
out
,
and
creep
into
bed
;
and
it
be
an
uneasy


bed
now

I
never
sleep
the
old
sound

more

a
considerable
difference

Life

it
so
much
that
it
scarcely
seem
the

what
lie


heaviest
on
my
mind
be
,
the
consideration
that
six
day
intervene


between
I
and
the
day
of
departure
;
for
I
could
not
divest
myself
of


a
misgiving
that
something
might
happen
to
London
in
the
meanwhile
,
and


that
,
when
I
get
there
,
it
would
be
either
greatly
deteriorate
or
clean


go
.


Joe

Biddy
be
very
sympathetic
and
pleasant
when
I
speak
of
our


approach
separation
;
but
they
only
refer
to
it
when
I
do
.
after


breakfast
,
Joe
bring
out
my
indenture
from
the
press
in
the
good


parlor
,
and
we
put
they
in
the
fire
,
and
I
feel
that
I
be
free
.
with


all
the
novelty
of
my
emancipation
on
I
,
I
go
to
church
with
Joe
,
and


think
perhaps
the
clergyman
would
n't
 
have
read
that
about
the
rich
man


and
the
kingdom
of
Heaven
,
if
he
have
know
all
.


after
our
early
dinner
,
I
stroll
out
alone
,
purpose
to
finish
off


the
marsh
at
once
,
and
get
they
do
with
.
as
I
pass
the
church
,
I


feel
 
as
I
have
feel
during
service
in
the
morning
 
a
sublime
compassion


for
the
poor
creature
who
be
destine
to
go
there
,
Sunday
after


Sunday
,
all
their
life
through
,
and
to
lie
obscurely
at
last
among
the

he
laud
it
to
the
sky
.
there
be
nobody
but
himself
,
he


intimate
,
worthy
of
my
confidence
,
and
-
in
short
,
might
he
?
then
he


ask
I
tenderly
if
I
remember
our
boyish
game
at
sum
,
and
how
we


have
go
together
to
have
I
bind
apprentice
,
and
,
in
effect
,
how
he


have
ever
be
my
favorite
fancy
and
my
choose
friend
?
if
I
have
take


ten
time
as
many
glass
of
wine
as
I
have
,
I
should
have
know
that
he


never
have
stand
in
that
relation
towards
I
,
and
should
in
my
heart
of


heart
have
repudiate
the
idea
.
yet
for
all
that
,
I
remember
feel


convince
that
I
have
be
much
mistaken
in
he
,
and
that
he
be
a


sensible
,
practical
,
good
-
hearted
prime
fellow
.


by
degree
he
fall
to
repose
such
great
confidence
in
I
,
as
to
ask
my


advice
in
reference
to
his
own
affair
.
he
mention
that
there
be
an


opportunity
for
a
great
amalgamation
and
monopoly
of
the
corn
and
seed


trade
on
those
premise
,
if
enlarge
,
such
as
have
never
occur


before
in
that
or
any
other
neighborhood
.
what
alone
be
want
to
the


realization
of
a
vast
fortune
,
he
consider
to
be
More
capital
.


those
be
the
two
little
word
,
more
capital
.
now
it
appear
to
he


 
Pumblechook
 
that
if
that
capital
be
get
into
the
business
,
through
a


sleep
partner
,
sir
,
-
which
sleep
partner
would
have
nothing
to


do
but
walk
in
,
by
self
or
deputy
,
whenever
he
please
,
and
examine


the
book
,
-
and
walk
in
twice
a
year
and
take
his
profit
away
in
his


pocket
,
to
the
tune
of
fifty
per
cent
,
-
it
appear
to
he
that
that


might
be
an
opening
for
a
young
gentleman
of
spirit
combine
with


property
,
which
would
be
worthy
of
his
attention
.
but
what
do
I
think
?


he
have
great
confidence
in
my
opinion
,
and
what
do
I
think
?
I
give
it


as
my
opinion
.
"
wait
a
bit
!
"
the
united
vastness
and
distinctness
of


this
view
so
strike
he
,
that
he
no
long
ask
if
he
might
shake
hand


with
I
,
but
say
he
really
must
,
-
and
do
.


we
drink
all
the
wine
,
and
Mr.
Pumblechook
pledge
himself
over
and
over


again
to
keep
Joseph
up
to
the
mark
 
I
do
n't
 
know
what
mark
,
and
to


render
I
efficient
and
constant
service
 
I
do
n't
 
know
what
service
.
he


also
make
known
to
I
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
,
and
certainly
after


having
keep
his
secret
wonderfully
well
,
that
he
have
always
say
of
I
,


"
that
boy
be
no
common
boy
,
and
mark
I
,
his
fortun
'
will
be
no
common


fortun
'
.
"
he
say
with
a
tearful
smile
that
it
be
a
singular
thing
to


think
of
now
,
and
I
say
so
too
.
finally
,
I
go
out
into
the
air
,
with


a
dim
perception
that
there
be
something
unwonted
in
the
conduct
of
the


sunshine
,
and
find
that
I
have
slumberously
get
to
the
turnpike
without


having
take
any
account
of
the
road
.


there
,
I
be
rouse
by
Mr.
Pumblechook
's
hail
I
.
he
be
a
long
way


down
the
sunny
street
,
and
be
make
expressive
gesture
for
I
to


stop
.
I
stop
,
and
he
come
up
breathless
.


"
no
,
my
dear
friend
,
"
say
he
,
when
he
have
recover
wind
for
speech
.


"
not
if
I
can
help
it
.
this
occasion
shall
not
entirely
pass
without


that
affability
on
your
part
.
-
may
I
,

an
old
friend
and
well

wisher

may
I

"


we
shake
hand
for
the
hundredth
time
at
least
,
and
he
order
a
young


carter
out
of
my
way
with
the
great
indignation
.
then
,
he
bless


I
and
stand
wave
his
hand
to
I
until
I
have
pass
the
crook
in
the


road
;
and
then
I
turn
into
a
field
and
have
a
long
nap
under
a
hedge


before
I
pursue
my
way
home
.


I
have
scant
luggage
to
take
with
I
to
London
,
for
little
of
the
little


I
possess
be
adapt
to
my
new
station
.
but
I
begin
pack
that
same


afternoon
,
and
wildly
pack
up
thing
that
I
know
I
should
want
next


morning
,
in
a
fiction
that
there
be
not
a
moment
to
be
lose
.


so
,
Tuesday
,
Wednesday
,
and
Thursday
,
pass
;
and
on
Friday
morning
I


go
to
Mr.

to
put
on
my
new
clothe
and
pay
my
visit
to


Miss

.
Mr.
Pumblechook
's
own
room
be
give
up
to
I
to
dress


in
,
and
be
decorate
with
clean
towel
expressly
for
the
event
.
my


clothe
be
rather
a
disappointment
,
of
course
.
probably
every
new


and
eagerly
expect
garment
ever
put
on
since
clothe
come
in
,
fall


a
trifle
short
of
the
wearer
's
expectation
.
but
after
I
have
have
my


new
suit
on
some
half
an
hour
,
and
have
go
through
an
immensity
of


posture
with
Mr.
Pumblechook
's
very
limited
dressing
-
glass
,
in
the


futile
endeavor
to
see
my
leg
,

seem
to
fit
I
well
.
it
be

ten
mile
off

.
I
have
not
tell
he
exactly
when
I
mean
to
leave
,

be
not
likely
to
shake
hand
with
he
again
before
depart
.
this
be


all
as
it
should
be
,
and
I
go
out
in
my
new
array
,
fearfully
ashamed


of
have
to
pass
the
shopman
,
and
suspicious
after
all
that
I
be
at
a


personal
disadvantage

five
in
the
morning
,
carry
my
little


hand
-
portmanteau
,
and
I
have
tell
Joe
that
I
wish
to
walk
away
all


alone
.
I
be
afraid
-
sore
afraid
-
that
this
purpose
originate
in
my


sense
of
the
contrast
there
would
be
between
I
and
Joe
,
if
we
go
to


the
coach
together
.
I
have
pretend
with
myself
that
there
be
nothing


of
this
taint
in
the
arrangement
;
but
when
I
go
up
to
my
little
room


on
this
last
night
,
I
feel
compel
to
admit
that
it
might
be
so
,
and


have
an
impulse
upon
I
to
go
down
again
and
entreat
Joe
to
walk
with
I


in
the
morning
.
I
do
not
.


all
night
there
be
coach
in
my
broken
sleep
,
go
to
wrong
place


instead
of
to
London
,
and
have
in
the
trace
,
now
dog
,
now
cat
,
now


pig
,
now
man
,
-
never
horse
.
fantastic
failure
of
journey
occupy


I
until
the
day
dawn
and
the
bird
be
singe
.
then
,
I
get
up
and


partly
dress
,
and
sit
at
the
window
to
take
a
last
look
out
,
and
in


take
it
fall
asleep
.


Biddy
be
astir
so
early
to
get
my
breakfast
,
that
,
although
I
do
not


sleep
at
the
window
an
hour
,
I
smell
the
smoke
of
the
kitchen
fire
when


I
start
up
with
a
terrible
idea
that
it
must
be
late
in
the
afternoon
.


but
long
after
that
,
and
long
after
I
have
hear
the
clinking
of
the


teacup
and
be
quite
ready
,
I
want
the
resolution
to
go
down
stair
.


after
all
,
I
remain
up
there
,
repeatedly
unlock
and
unstrappe


my
small
portmanteau
and
lock
and
strap
it
up
again
,
until
Biddy


call
to
I
that
I
be
late
.


it
be
a
hurried
breakfast
with
no
taste
in
it
.
I
get
up
from
the
meal
,


say
with
a
sort
of
briskness
,
as
if
it
have
only
just
occur
to
I
,


"
well
!
I
suppose
I
must
be
off
!
"
and
then
I
kiss
my
sister
who
be


laugh
and
nodding
and
shake
in
her
usual
chair
,
and
kiss


Biddy
,
and
throw
my
arm
around
Joe
's
neck
.
then
I
take
up
my
little


portmanteau
and
walk
out
.
the
last
I
see
of
they
be
,
when
I
presently


hear
a
scuffle
behind
I
,
and
look
back
,
see
Joe
throw
an
old


shoe
after
I
and
Biddy
throw
another
old
shoe
.
I
stop
then
,
to


wave
my
hat
,
and
dear
old
Joe
wave
his
strong
right
arm
above
his
head
,


cry
huskily
"
Hooroar
!
"
and
Biddy
put
she
apron
to
her
face
.


I
walk
away
at
a
good
pace
,
think
it
be
easy
to
go
than
I
have


suppose
it
would
be
,
and
reflect
that
it
would
never
have
do
to


have
have
an
old
shoe
throw
after
the
coach
,
in
sight
of
all
the
high


Street
.
I
whistle
and
make
nothing
of
go
.
but
the
village
be
very


peaceful
and
quiet
,
and
the
light
mist
be
solemnly
rise
,
as
if
to


show
I
the
world
,
and
I
have
be
so
innocent
and
little
there
,
and
all


beyond
be
so
unknown
and
great
,
that
in
a
moment
with
a
strong
heave


and
sob
I
break
into
tear
.
it
be
by
the
finger
-
post
at
the
end
of
the


village
,
and
I
lay
my
hand
upon
it
,
and
say
,
"
good
by
,
o
my
dear
,
dear


friend
!
"


Heaven
know
we
need
never
be
ashamed
of
our
tear
,
for
they
be
rain


upon
the
blind
dust
of
earth
,
overlie
our
hard
heart
.
I
be


well
after
I
have
cry
than
before
,
-
more
sorry
,
more
aware
of
my
own


ingratitude
,
more
gentle
.
if
I
have
cry
before
,
I
should
have
have
Joe


with
I
then
.


so
subdue
I
be
by
those
tear
,
and
by
their
break
out
again
in
the


course
of
the
quiet
walk
,
that
when
I
be
on
the
coach
,
and
it
be
clear


of
the
town
,
I
deliberate
with
an
aching
heart
whether
I
would
not
get


down
when
we
change
horse
and
walk
back
,
and
have
another
evening
at


home
,
and
a
well
parting
.
we
change
,
and
I
have
not
make
up
my
mind
,


and
still
reflect
for
my
comfort
that
it
would
be
quite
practicable
to


get
down
and
walk
back
,
when
we
change
again
.
and
while
I
be
occupy


with
these
deliberation
,
I
would
fancy
an
exact
resemblance
to
Joe


in
some
man
come
along
the
road
towards
we
,
and
my
heart
would
beat


high
.
-
as
if
he
could
possibly
be
there
!


we
change
again
,
and
yet
again
,
and
it
be
now
too
late
and
too
far
to


go
back
,
and
I
go
on
.
and
the
mist
have
all
solemnly
rise
now
,
and


the
world
lie
spread
before
I
.


this
be
the
end
of
the
first
stage
of
Pip
's
expectation
.


chapter
XX


the
journey
from
our
town
to
the
metropolis
be
a
journey
of
about
five


hour
.
it
be
a
little
past
midday
when
the
four
-
horse

by


which
I

a
passenger

We
Britons
have
at
that
time
particularly
settle
that
it
be
treasonable


to
doubt
our
having
and
our
be
the
good
of
everything
:
otherwise
,


while
I
be
scare
by
the
immensity
of
London
,
I
think
I
might
have
have


some
faint
doubt
whether
it
be
not
rather
ugly
,
crooked
,
narrow
,
and


dirty
.


Mr.
Jaggers
have
duly
send
I

I

shake
his

eye

velveteen

knee

say
the

I
begin
to
say
that
I
hope
I
be
not
interrupt
,
when
the
clerk


shove
this
gentleman
out
with
as
little
ceremony
as
I
ever
saw
use
,


and
toss
his
fur
cap
out
after
he
,
leave
I
alone
.


Mr.
Jaggers
's
room
be
light
by
a
skylight
only
,
and
be
a
most
dismal


place
;
the
skylight
,
eccentrically
pitch
like
a
broken
head
,
and
the


distort
adjoining
house
look
as
if
they
have
twist
themselves
to


peep
down
at
I
through
it
.
there
be
not
so
many
paper
about
,
as
I


should
have
expect
to
see
;
and
there
be
some
odd
object
about
,
that


I
should
not
have
expect
to
see
,
-
such
as
an
old
rusty
pistol
,
a


sword
in
a
scabbard
,
several
strange
-
look
box
and
package
,
and


two
dreadful
cast
on
a
shelf
,
of
face
peculiarly
swollen
,
and
twitchy


about
the
nose
.
Mr.
Jaggers
's
own
high
-
back
chair
be
of
deadly
black


horsehair
,
with
row
of
brass
nail
round
it
,
like
a
coffin
;
and
I


fancy
I
could
see
how
he
lean
back
in
it
,
and
bite
his
forefinger
at


the
client
.
the
room
be
but
small
,
and
the
client
seem
to
have
have


a
habit
of
back
up
against
the
wall
;
the
wall
,
especially
opposite
to


Mr.
Jaggers
's
chair
,
be
greasy
with
shoulder
.
I
recall
,
too
,
that


the
one
-
eyed
gentleman
have
shuffle
forth
against
the
wall
when
I
be


the
innocent
cause
of
his
be
turn
out
.


I
sit
down
in
the
cliental
chair
place
over
against
Mr.
Jaggers
's


chair
,
and
become
fascinated
by
the
dismal
atmosphere
of
the
place
.
I


call
to
mind
that
the
clerk
have
the
same
air
of
know
something
to


everybody
else
's
disadvantage
,
as
his
master
have
.
I
wonder
how
many


other
clerk
there
be
up
-
stair
,
and
whether
they
all
claim
to
have


the
same
detrimental
mastery
of
their
fellow
-
creature
.
I
wonder
what


be
the
history
of
all
the
odd
litter
about
the
room
,
and
how
it
come


there
.
I
wonder
whether
the
two
swollen
face
be
of
Mr.
Jaggers
's


family
,
and
,
if
he
be
so
unfortunate
as
to
have
have
a
pair
of
such


ill
-
look
relation
,
why
he
stick
they
on
that
dusty
perch
for
the


black
and
fly
to
settle
on
,
instead
of
give
they
a
place
at
home
.


of
course
I
have
no
experience
of
a
London
summer
day
,
and
my
spirit
may


have
be
oppress
by
the
hot
exhausted
air
,
and
by
the
dust
and
grit


that
lie
thick
on
everything
.
but
I
sit
wonder
and
wait
in
Mr.


jagger
's
close
room
,
until
I
really
could
not
bear
the
two
cast
on
the


shelf
above
Mr.
Jaggers
's
chair
,
and
get
up
and
go
out
.


when
I
tell
the
clerk
that
I
would
take
a
turn
in
the
air
while
I


wait
,
he
advise
I
to
go
round
the
corner
and
I
should
come
into


Smithfield
.
so
I
come
into
Smithfield
;
and
the
shameful
place
,
be
all


asmear
with
filth
and
fat
and
blood
and
foam
,
seem
to
stick
to
I
.
so
,


I
rub
it
off
with
all
possible
speed
by
turn
into
a
street
where


I
see
the
great
black
dome
of
Saint
Paul
's
bulging
at
I
from
behind
a


grim
stone
building
which
a
bystander
say
be
Newgate
Prison
.
follow


the
wall
of
the
jail
,
I
find
the
roadway
cover
with
straw
to
deaden


the
noise
of
pass
vehicle
;
and
from
this
,
and
from
the
quantity
of


people
stand
about
smell
strongly
of
spirit
and
beer
,
I
infer


that
the
trial
be
on
.


while
I
look
about
I
here
,
an
exceedingly
dirty
and
partially
drunk


minister
of
justice
ask
I
if
I
would
like
to
step
in
and
hear
a


trial
or
so
:
inform
I
that
he
could
give
I
a
front
place
for
half
a


crown
,
whence
I
should
command
a
full
view
of
the
Lord
Chief
Justice
in


his
wig
and
robe
,
-
mention
that
awful
personage
like
waxwork
,
and


presently
offer
he
at
the
reduce
price
of
eighteen
-
pence
.
as
I


decline
the
proposal
on
the
plea
of
an
appointment
,
he
be
so
good
as


to
take
I
into
a
yard
and
show
I
where
the
gallow
be
keep
,
and
also


where
people
be
publicly
whip
,
and
then
he
show
I
the
debtor
'


door
,
out
of
which
culprit
come
to
be
hang
;
heighten
the
interest


of
that
dreadful
portal
by
give
I
to
understand
that
"
four
on
'em
"


would
come
out
at
that
door
the
day
after
to
-
morrow
at
eight
in
the


morning
,
to
be
kill
in
a
row
.
this
be
horrible
,
and
give
I
a


sicken
idea
of
London
;
the
more
so
as
the
Lord
Chief
Justice
's


proprietor
wear
 
from
his
hat
down
to
his
boot
and
up
again
to
his


pocket
-
handkerchief
inclusive
 
mildew
clothe
which
have
evidently


not
belong
to
he
originally
,
and
which
I
take
it
into
my
head
he
have


buy
cheap
of
the
executioner
.
under
these
circumstance
I
think


myself
well
rid
of
he
for
a
shilling
.


I
drop
into
the
office
to
ask
if
Mr.
Jaggers
have
come
in
yet
,
and
I


find
he
have
not
,
and
I
stroll
out
again
.
this
time
,
I
make
the
tour


of
Little
Britain
,
and
turn
into

Close
;
and
now
I
become


aware
that

linger
outside

make
a
way

coolly

decisively

chapter
XXI


cast
my
eye
on
Mr.
Wemmick
as
we
go
along
,
to
see
what
he
be


like
in
the
light
of
day
,
I
find
he
to
be
a
dry
man
,
rather
short
in


stature
,
with
a
square
wooden
face
,
whose
expression
seem
to
have
be


imperfectly
chip
out
with
a
dull
-
edge
chisel
.
there
be
some
mark


in
it
that
might
have
be
dimple
,
if
the
material
have
be
soft
and


the
instrument
finer
,
but
which
,
as
it
be
,
be
only
dint
.
the
chisel


have
make
three
or
four
of
these
attempt
at
embellishment
over
his
nose
,


but
have
give
they
up
without
an
effort
to
smooth
they
off
.
I
judge
he


to
be
a
bachelor
from
the
frayed
condition
of
his
linen
,
and
he
appear


to
have
sustain
a
good
many
bereavement
;
for
he
wear
at
least
four


mourning
ring
,
besides
a
brooch
represent
a
lady
and
a
weeping


willow
at
a
tomb
with
an
urn
on
it
.
I
notice
,
too
,
that
several
ring


and
seal
hang
at
his
watch
-
chain
,
as
if
he
be
quite
laden
with


remembrance
of
depart
friend
.
he
have
glitter
eye
,
-
small
,
keen
,


and
black
,
-
and
thin
wide
mottled
lip
.
he
have
have
they
,
to
the
good
of


my
belief
,
from
forty
to
fifty
year
.

not

by
the
announcement

I
have
suppose

be

hotel
keep
by
Mr.

to
which
the
Blue
Boar

I
now
find
Barnard
to
be
a
disembodied


spirit
,
or
a
fiction
,
and
his
inn
the
dingy
collection
of
shabby


building
ever
squeeze
together
in
a
rank
corner
as
a
club
for


Tom

enter
this
haven
through
a
wicket

gate
,

be
disgorge
by
an


introductory
passage
into
a
melancholy
little
square
that
look
to
I


like
a
flat
burying

ground
.
I
think
it
have
the
most
dismal
tree
in


it

the
most
dismal
sparrow
,

dismal

dismal

half
a
dozen

so

I

ever

there
,

the
vengeance
of
the
soul
of
Barnard
be


be
slowly
appease
by
the
gradual
suicide
of
the
present
occupant

their
unholy

cousin
;
not
that
that
imply
familiar
intercourse
between
they

he

a
bad
courtier

"


Herbert
Pocket
have
a
frank
and
easy
way
with
he
that
be
very
take
.


I
have
never
see
any
one
then
,
and
I
have
never
see
any
one
since
,


who
more
strongly
express
to
I
,
in
every
look
and
tone
,
a
natural


incapacity
to
do
anything
secret
and
mean
.
there
be
something


wonderfully
hopeful
about
his
general
air
,
and
something
that
at
the


same
time
whisper
to
I
he
would
never
be
very
successful
or
rich
.
I


do
n't
 
know
how
this
be
.
I
became
imbue
with
the
notion
on
that
first


occasion
before
we
sit
down
to
dinner
,
but
I
can
not
define
by
what


mean
.


he
be
still
a
pale
young
gentleman
,
and
have
a
certain
conquer
languor


about
he
in
the
midst
of
his
spirit
and
briskness
,
that
do
not
seem


indicative
of
natural
strength
.
he
have
not
a
handsome
face
,
but
it
be


well
than
handsome
:
be
extremely
amiable
and
cheerful
.
his
figure


be
a
little
ungainly
,
as
in
the
day
when
my
knuckle
have
take
such


liberty
with
it
,
but
it
look
as
if
it
would
always
be
light
and


young
.
whether
Mr.
Trabb
's
local
work
would
have
sit
more
gracefully
on


he
than
on
I
,
may
be
a
question
;
but
I
be
conscious
that
he
carry


off
his
rather
old
clothe
much
well
than
I
carry
off
my
new
suit
.


as
he
be
so
communicative
,
I
feel
that
reserve
on
my
part
would
be
a


bad
return
unsuited
to
our
year
.
I
therefore
tell
he
my
small
story
,


and
lay
stress
on
my
be
forbid
to
inquire
who
my
benefactor
be
.


I
far
mention
that
as
I
have
be
bring
up
a
blacksmith
in
a


country
place
,
and
know
very
little
of
the
way
of
politeness
,
I
would


take
it
as
a
great
kindness
in
he
if
he
would
give
I
a
hint
whenever


he
see
I
at
a
loss
or
go
wrong

with
pleasure

he

I
venture
to
prophesy

very
few

dare
say
we
shall
be
often
together

I
should
like


to
banish
any
needless
restraint

you

I
the

begin
at
once

I
thank
he

habit

I
'll
redeem

I
introduce
the
topic
,


Handel

by
mention
that
in
London
it
be
not
the
custom
to
put
the


knife
in
the
mouth
,

for
fear
of
accident
,

that
while
the
fork
be


reserve
for
that
use
,
it
be
not
put
far
in
than
necessary
.
it
be


scarcely
worth
mention
,
only
it
be
as
well
to
do
as
other
people
do
.


also
,
the
spoon
be
not
generally
use
over
-
hand
,
but
under
.
this
have


two
advantage
.
you
get
at
your
mouth
well
 
which
after
all
be
the


object
,
and
you
save
a
good
deal
of
the
attitude
of
opening
oyster
,
on


the
part
of
the
right
elbow
.
"


he

these
friendly
suggestion

such
a
lively
way

we

it
out

we
be
so
much
the


light

easy
for
having
broach
it
,
that
I
now
perceive
this


to
be
the
case

we
be
very
gay

sociable

I
ask

the


course

he
be

he

I
glance
about

grand
idea
of
the
wealth

importance
of
Insurers
of

the
City

I

again
there
come
upon
I
,

my
relief

odd


impression

Herbert

silently
defer

his
experience

"
then
the
time
come

Herbert

"
when
you
see
your
opening

you


go
in
,

you
swoop
upon
it

you
make
your
capital

then
there


you
be
!
when
you
have
once
make
your
capital

you
have
nothing
to
do


but
employ
it
.
"


this
be
very
like
his
way
of
conduct
that
encounter
in
the
garden
;


very
like
.
his
manner
of
bear
his
poverty
,
too
,
exactly
correspond


to
his
manner
of
bear
that
defeat
.
it
seem
to
I
that
he
take
all


blow
and
buffet
now
with
just
the
same
air
as
he
have
take
mine


then
.
it
be
evident
that
he
have
nothing
around
he

the
simple


necessary
,
for
everything
that
I
remark
upon
turn
out
to
have
be


send
in
on
my
account
from
the
coffee

house

somewhere
else

yet
,
having
already
make
his
fortune
in
his
own
mind
,
he
be
so


unassume
with
it
that
I
feel
quite
grateful
to
he
for
not
be


puff
up
.
it
be
a
pleasant
addition
to
his
naturally
pleasant
way
,


and
we
get
on
famously
.
in
the
evening
we
go
out
for
a
walk
in
the


street
,
and
go
half
-
price
to
the
Theatre
;
and
next
day
we
go
to


church
at
Westminster
Abbey
,
and
in
the
afternoon
we
walk
in
the


park
;
and
I
wonder
who
shod
all
the
horse
there
,
and
wish
Joe
do
.


on
a
moderate
computation
,
it
be
many
month
,
that
Sunday
,
since
I
have


leave
Joe
and
Biddy

the
space
interpose
between
myself

they
partook


of
that
expansion
,

our
marsh
be
any
distance
off
.
that
I
could


have
be
at
our
old
church
in
my
old
church
-
go
clothe
,
on
the
very


last
Sunday
that
ever
be
,
seem
a
combination
of
impossibility
,


geographical
and
social
,
solar
and
lunar
.
yet
in
the
London
street
so


crowd
with
people
and
so
brilliantly
light
in
the
dusk
of
evening

of
reproach
for
that
I
have
put
the
poor


old
kitchen
at
home
so
far
away
;
and
in
the
dead
of
night
,
the
footstep


of
some
incapable
impostor
of
a
porter
moon
about
Barnard
's
Inn
,


under
pretence
of
watch

,
fall
hollow
on
my
heart
.


on
the
Monday
morning
at
a
quarter
before
nine
,
Herbert
go
to


the
counting
-
house
to
report
himself
,
-
to
look
about
he
,
too
,
I


suppose
,
-
and
I
bear
he
company
.
he
be
to
come
away
in
an
hour
or


two
to
attend
I
to
Hammersmith
,
and
I
be
to
wait
about
for
he
.
it


appear
to
I
that
the
egg
from
which
young
Insurers
be
hatch
be


incubate
in
dust
and
heat
,
like
the
egg
of
ostrich
,
judge
from
the


place
to
which
those
incipient
giant
repair
on
a
Monday
morning
.
nor


do
the
counting
-
house
where
Herbert
assist
,
show
in
my
eye
as
at


all
a
good
observatory
;
be
a
back
second
floor
up
a
yard
,
of
a
grimy


presence
in
all
particular
,
and
with
a
look
into
another
back
second


floor
,
rather
than
a
look
out
.


I
wait
about
until
it
be
noon
,
and
I
go
upon
'
change
,
and
I
see


fluey
man
sit
there
under
the
bill
about
shipping
,
whom
I
take
to


be
great
merchant
,
though
I
could
n't
 
understand
why
they
should
all
be


out
of
spirit
.
when
Herbert
come
,
we
go
and
have
lunch
at
a
celebrated


house
which
I
then
quite
venerated
,
but
now
believe
to
have
be
the


most
abject
superstition
in
Europe
,
and
where
I
could
not
help
noticing
,


even
then
,
that
there
be
much
more
gravy
on
the
tablecloth
and
knife


and
waiter
'
clothe
,
than
in
the
steak

collation

of

a
moderate
price

the
grease
,
which
be
not
charge
for

we


go
back
to
Barnard
's
Inn
and
get
my
little
portmanteau
,
and
then
take


coach
for
Hammersmith
.
we
arrive
there
at
two
or
three
o'clock
in


the
afternoon
,
and
have
very
little
way
to
walk
to
Mr.

the

of
a

surprise

never

I
find
,
now
I
have
leisure
to
count
they
,
that
there
be
no
few
than


six
little
Pockets
present
,
in
various
stage
of
tumble
up
.
I
have


scarcely
arrive
at
the
total
when
a
seventh
be
hear
,
as
in
the
region


of
air
,
wail
dolefully
.


"

Flopson

to

surprising

"


miller
,
who
be
the
other
nurse

retire
into
the
house
,
and
by
degree


the
child
's
wailing
be
hush
and
stop
,
as
if
it
be
a
young


ventriloquist
with
something
in
its
mouth
.
Mrs.
Pocket
read
all
the


time
,
and
I
be
curious
to
know
what
the
book
could
be
.


we
be
wait
,
I
suppose
,
for
Mr.
Pocket
to
come
out
to
we
;
at
any


rate
we
wait
there
,
and
so
I
have
an
opportunity
of
observe
the


remarkable
family
phenomenon
that
whenever
any
of
the
child
stray


near
Mrs.
Pocket
in
their
play
,
they
always
trip
themselves
up
and


tumble
over
she
,
-
always
very
much
to
her
momentary
astonishment
,
and


their
own
more
enduring
lamentation
.
I
be
at
a
loss
to
account
for


this
surprising
circumstance
,
and
could
not
help
give
my
mind
to


speculation
about
it
,
until
by
and
by
Millers
come
down
with
the
baby
,


which
baby
be
hand
to
Flopson
,
which
Flopson
be
hand
it
to
Mrs.


Pocket
,
when
she
too
go
fairly
head
foremost
over
Mrs.
Pocket
,
baby


and
all
,
and
be
catch
by
Herbert
and
myself
.


"

I
,
Flopson
!
"
say
Mrs.
Pocket
,
look
off
her
book
for
a


moment
,
"

"
gracious

in
the
face

there

"


"

ask
Mrs.

.


"

if
it
ai
n't

footstool

"
cry
Flopson
.
"
and
if
you
keep
it


under
your
skirt
like
that
,
who
be
to
help
tumble
?
here
!
take
the


baby
,
mum
,
and
give
I
your
book
.
"


Mrs.
Pocket
act
on
the
advice
,
and
inexpertly
dance
the
infant
a


little
in
her
lap
,
while
the
other
child
play
about
it
.
this
have


last
but
a
very
short
time
,
when
Mrs.
Pocket
issue
summary
order


that
they
be
all
to
be
take
into
the
house
for
a
nap
.
thus
I
make
the


second
discovery
on
that
first
occasion
,
that
the
nurture
of
the
little


pocket
consist
of
alternately
tumble
up
and
lie
down
.


under
these
circumstance
,
when
Flopson
and
Millers
have
get
the
child


into
the
house
,
like
a
little
flock
of
sheep
,
and
Mr.
Pocket
come
out


of
it
to
make
my
acquaintance
,
I
be
not
much
surprised
to
find
that
Mr.


Pocket
be
a
gentleman
with
a
rather
perplexed
expression
of
face
,
and


with
his
very
gray
hair
disorder
on
his
head
,
as
if
he
do
n't
 
quite


see
his
way
to
put
anything
straight
.

XXIII


Mr.
Pocket
say
he
be
glad
to
see
I
,
and
he
hope
I
be
not
sorry
to


see
he
.
"
for
,
I
really

he
add
,
with
his

"
an
alarming
personage

"
he
be
a

look
man
,
in
spite
of


his
perplexity
and
his
very
gray
hair
,
and
his
manner
seem
quite


natural
.
I
use
the
word
natural
,
in
the
sense
of
its
be
unaffected
;


there
be
something
comic
in
his
distraught
way
,
as
though
it
would
have


be
downright
ludicrous
but
for
his
own
perception
that
it
be
very


near
be
so
.
when
he
have
talk
with
I
a
little
,

to
Mrs.


Pocket

a
rather
anxious
contraction

his

up
from

say
,

yes

she
then
smile
upon
I
in
an


absent
state
of
mind
,
and
ask
I
if
I
like
the
taste
of
orange

question

no
bearing
,
near

remote
,
on
any
foregone


or
subsequent
transaction

consider
it
to
have
be
throw
out
,
like


her
previous
approach
,
in
general
conversational
condescension
.


I
find
out
within
a
few
hour
,
and
may
mention
at
once
,
that
Mrs.


Pocket
be
the
only
daughter
of
a
certain
quite
accidental
deceased


Knight
,
who
have
invent
for
himself
a
conviction
that
his
deceased


father
would
have
be
make
a
Baronet
but
for
somebody
's
determine


opposition

out
of
entirely
personal
motive
,

I
forget
whose
,


if
I
ever
know
,

the
Sovereign

the
Prime
Minister

Lord


Chancellor

the
Archbishop

have


tack
himself
on
to
the
noble
of
the
earth
in
right
of
this
quite


supposititious
fact
.
I
believe
he
have
be
knight
himself
for

english
grammar
at
the
point
of

from

would


seem
to
have
want
cutting
,
and
have
marry
without
the
knowledge
of


the
judicious
parent
.
the
judicious
parent
,
have
nothing
to
bestow
or


withhold
but
his
blessing
,
have
handsomely
settle
that
dower
upon
they


after
a
short
struggle
,
and
have
inform
Mr.
Pocket
that
his
wife
be
"
a


treasure
for
a
Prince
.
"
Mr.
Pocket
have
invest
the
Prince
's
treasure


in
the
way
of
the
world
ever
since
,
and
it
be
suppose
to
have
bring


he
in
but
indifferent
interest
.
still
,
Mrs.
Pocket
be
in
general
the


object
of
a
queer
sort
of
respectful
pity
,
because
she
have
not
marry


a
title
;
while
Mr.
Pocket
be
the
object
of
a
queer
sort
of
forgive


reproach
,
because
he
have
never
get
one
.


Mr.
Pocket
take
I
into
the
house
and
show
I
my
room
:
which
be
a


pleasant
one
,
and
so
furnished
as
that
I
could
use
it
with
comfort
for


my
own
private
sitting
-
room
.
he
then
knock
at
the
door
of
two
other


similar
room
,
and
introduce
I
to
their
occupant
,
by
name
Drummle


and
Startop
.
Drummle
,
an
old
-
look
young
man
of
a
heavy
order
of


architecture
,
be
whistle
.
Startop
,
young
in
year
and
appearance
,


be
read
and
hold
his
head
,
as
if
he
think
himself
in
danger
of


explode
it
with
too
strong
a
charge
of
knowledge
.


both
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Pocket
have
such
a
noticeable
air
of
be
in
somebody


else
's
hand
,
that
I
wonder
who
really
be
in
possession
of
the
house


and
let
they
live
there
,
until
I
find
this
unknown
power
to
be
the


servant
.
it
be
a
smooth
way
of
go
on
,
perhaps
,
in
respect
of
save


trouble
;
but
it
have
the
appearance
of
be
expensive
,
for
the
servant


feel
it
a
duty
they
owe
to
themselves
to
be
nice
in
their
eating
and


drink
,
and
to
keep
a
deal
of
company
down
stair
.
they
allow
a
very


liberal
table
to
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Pocket
,
yet
it
always
appear
to
I
that


by
far
the
good
part
of
the
house
to
have
board
in
would
have
be


the
kitchen
,
-
always
suppose
the
boarder
capable
of
self
-
defence
,
for
,


before
I
have
be
there
a
week
,
a
neighboring
lady
with
whom
the
family


be
personally
unacquainted
,
write
in
to
say
that
she
have
see
Millers


slap
the
baby
.
this
greatly
distress
Mrs.
Pocket
,
who
burst
into


tear
on
receive
the
note
,
and
say
that
it
be
an
extraordinary
thing


that
the
neighbor
could
n't
 
mind
their
own
business
.


by
degree
I
learn
,
and
chiefly
from
Herbert
,
that
Mr.
Pocket
have
be


educate
at
Harrow
and
at
Cambridge
,
where
he
have
distinguish
himself
;


but
that
when
he
have
have
the
happiness
of
marry
Mrs.
Pocket
very


early
in
life
,
he
have
impair
his
prospect
and
take
up
the
calling


of
a
Grinder
.
after
grind
a
number
of
dull
blade
,
-
of
whom
it
be


remarkable
that
their
father
,
when
influential
,
be
always
go
to


help
he
to
preferment
,
but
always
forget
to
do
it
when
the
blade
have


leave
the
grindstone
,
-
he
have
weary
of
that
poor
work
and
have
come
to


London
.
here
,
after
gradually
fail
in
lofty
hope
,
he
have
"
read
"


with
diver
who
have
lack
opportunity
or
neglect
they
,
and
have


refurbish
diver
other
for
special
occasion
,
and
have
turn
his


acquirement
to
the
account
of
literary
compilation
and
correction
,


and
on
such
mean
,
add
to
some
very
moderate
private
resource
,
still


maintain
the
house
I
see
.


Mr.
and
Mrs.
Pocket
have
a
toady
neighbor
;
a
widow
lady
of
that
highly


sympathetic
nature
that
she
agree
with
everybody
,
bless
everybody
,


and
shed
smile
and
tear
on
everybody
,
accord
to
circumstance
.
this


lady
's
name
be
Mrs.
Coiler
,

I
have
the
honor
of
take
she
down
to


dinner
on
the
day
of
my
installation
.
she
give
I
to
understand
on
the


stair
,
that
it
be
a
blow
to
dear
Mrs.
Pocket
that
dear
Mr.

should
be
under
the
necessity
of
receive

with
he
.


that
do
not
extend
to
I
,
she
tell
I
in
a
gush
of
love
and
confidence


 
at
that
time
,
I
have
know
she
something
less
than
five
minute
;
if


they
be
all
like
I
,
it
would
be
quite
another
thing
.


"
but

,
"
say
Mrs.
Coiler
,
"
after
her
early


disappointment
 
not
that
dear
Mr.
Pocket
be
to
blame
in
that

so
much
luxury

elegance

I
say
,

I
be
afraid

to


cry
.

she
be
of
so
aristocratic
a
disposition
-
"


"
yes
,
ma'am
,
"
I
say
again
,
with
the
same
object
as
before
.


"
-
that
it
be
hard
,
"
say
Mrs.
Coiler
,
"
to
have
dear
Mr.
Pocket
's
time


and
attention
divert
from
dear
Mrs.
Pocket
.
"


I
could
not
help
think
that
it
might
be
hard
if
the
butcher
's
time


and
attention
be
divert
from
dear
Mrs.
Pocket
;
but
I
say
nothing
,


and
indeed
have
enough
to
do
in
keep
a
bashful
watch
upon
my
company


manner
.


it
come
to
my
knowledge
,
through
what
pass
between
Mrs.
Pocket
and


Drummle
while
I
be
attentive
to
my
knife
and
fork
,
spoon
,
glass
,
and


other
instrument
of
self
-
destruction
,
that
Drummle
,
whose
christian


name
be
Bentley
,
be
actually
the
next
heir
but
one
to
a
baronetcy
.


it
far
appear
that
the
book
I
have
see
Mrs.
Pocket
read
in
the


garden
be
all
about
title
,
and
that
she
know
the
exact
date
at
which


her
grandpapa
would
have
come
into
the
book
,
if
he
ever
have
come
at
all
.


Drummle
do
n't
 
say
much
,
but
in
his
limited
way
 
he
strike
I
as
a
sulky


kind
of
fellow
 
he
speak
as
one
of
the
elect
,
and
recognize
Mrs.
Pocket


as
a
woman
and
a
sister
.
no
one
but
themselves
and
Mrs.
Coiler
the
toady


neighbor
show
any
interest
in
this
part
of
the
conversation
,
and
it


appear
to
I
that
it
be
painful
to
Herbert
;
but
it
promise
to
last


a
long
time
,
when
the
page
come
in
with
the
announcement
of
a
domestic


affliction
.
it
be
,
in
effect
,
that
the
cook
have
mislay
the
beef
.
to
my


unutterable
amazement
,
I
now
,
for
the
first
time
,
see
Mr.
Pocket


relieve
his
mind
by
go
through
a
performance
that
strike
I
as
very


extraordinary
,
but
which
make
no
impression
on
anybody
else
,
and


with
which
I
soon
become
as
familiar
as
the
rest
.
he
lay
down
the


carving
-
knife
and
fork
,
-
be
engage
in
carving
,
at
the
moment
,
-
put


his
two
hand
into
his
disturbed
hair
,
and
appear
to
make
an


extraordinary
effort
to
lift
himself
up
by
it
.
when
he
have
do
this
,


and
have
not
lift
himself
up
at
all
,
he
quietly
go
on
with
what
he


be
about
.


Mrs.
Coiler
then
change
the
subject
and
begin
to
flatter
I
.
I
like


it
for
a
few
moment
,
but
she
flatter
I
so
very
grossly
that
the


pleasure
be
soon
over
.
she
have
a
serpentine
way
of
come
close
at


I
when
she
pretend
to
be
vitally
interested
in
the
friend
and


locality
I
have
leave
,
which
be
altogether
snaky
and
fork
-
tongue
;
and


when
she
make
an
occasional
bounce
upon
Startop
 
who
say
very
little
to


she
,
or
upon
Drummle
 
who
say
less
,
I
rather
envy
they
for
be
on


the
opposite
side
of
the
table
.


after
dinner
the
child
be
introduce
,
and
Mrs.
Coiler
make
admire


comment
on
their
eye
,
nose
,
and
leg
,
-
a
sagacious
way
of
improve


their
mind
.
there
be
four
little
girl
,
and
two
little
boy
,
besides


the
baby
who
might
have
be
either

the

neither

somewhere


for
child

have
enlist
these

Mrs.

look
at
the


young
Nobles
that
ought
to
have

as

the
pleasure

thus
advise

out

Flopson
,
by
dint
of
double
the
baby
at
the
joint
like
a
dutch
doll
,


then
get
it
safely
into
Mrs.

's
lap
,
and
give
it
the
nut

cracker


to
play
with
;
at
the

time
recommend
Mrs.

to
take
notice


that
the
handle
of
that
instrument
be
not
likely
to

with

eye

sharply
charge
Miss

a
lively
scuffle

it
gain


its
point
after

it
through

aware
of
the


mutual
relation
between
they
and
Mr.

which
be
exemplify
in


the
follow
manner

Mr.

,
with
the
normal
perplexity
of
his
face


heighten
and
his
hair
rumple
,
look
at
they
for
some
minute
,
as
if


he
could
n't
 
make
out
how
they
come
to
be
board
and
lodge
in
that


establishment
,
and
why
they
have
n't
 
be
billet
by
nature
on


somebody
else
.
then
,
in
a
distant
Missionary
way
he
ask
they
certain


question
,
-
as
why
little
Joe
have
that
hole
in
his
frill
,
who
say
,
Pa
,


Flopson
be
go
to
mend
it

time

how
little
fanny


come
by
that
whitlow
,
who
say
,
Pa
,
Millers
be
go
to
poultice
it


when
she
do
n't
 
forget
.
then
,
he
melt
into
parental
tenderness
,
and


give
they
a
shilling
apiece
and
tell
they
to
go
and
play
;
and
then
as


they
go
out
,
with
one
very
strong
effort
to
lift
himself
up
by
the


hair
he
dismiss
the
hopeless
subject
.


in
the
evening
there
be
row
on
the
river
.
as
Drummle
and
Startop
have


each
a
boat
,
I
resolve
to
set
up
mine
,

to
cut
they
both
out
.
I
be


pretty
good
at
most
exercise
in
which
country
boy
be
adept
,
but
as


I
be
conscious
of
want
elegance
of
style
for
the
Thames
,
-
not
to
say


for
other
water

I
at
once
engage

this
practical
authority
confuse
I


very
much
by

nearly
the

lose
he

pupil

doubt
if
he
would


have
pay

.


there
be
a
supper

tray
after
we
get

for
a
rather
disagreeable


domestic
occurrence

with


intelligent
assistance
I
should
meet
with
little
to

himself

confidential
term

may
state


at
once
that

mine

if
he
have
show
indifference
as

I
have
no
doubt


I
should
have
return
the
compliment
as
a

he
give
I
no
such


excuse

each
of
we

the

justice

anything
ludicrous

anything

what
be


serious
,
honest

Mr.

do


not
object
to
this
arrangement
,

urge
that
before
any
step
could


possibly
be
take
in
it
,
it
must
be
submit
to
my
guardian

I
feel


that
this
delicacy
arise
out
of
the
consideration
that
the
plan
would


save
Herbert
some
expense

Bentley
Drummle
,
who
be
so
sulky
a
fellow
that
he
even
take
up
a
book


as
if
its
writer
have
do
he
an
injury
,
do
not
take
up
an


acquaintance
in
a
more
agreeable
spirit
.
heavy
in
figure
,
movement
,


and
comprehension
,
-
in
the
sluggish
complexion
of
his
face
,
and
in


the
large
,
awkward
tongue
that
seem
to
loll
about
in
his
mouth
as


he
himself
loll
about
in
a
room
,
-
he
be
idle
,
proud
,
niggardly
,


reserve
,
and
suspicious
.
he
come
of
rich
people
down
in
Somersetshire
,


who
have
nurse
this
combination
of
quality
until
they
make
the


discovery
that
it
be
just
of
age
and
a
blockhead
.
thus
,
Bentley
Drummle


have
come
to
Mr.
Pocket
when
he
be
a
head
tall
than
that
gentleman
,


and
half
a
dozen
head
thick
than
most
gentleman
.


Startop
have
be
spoil
by
a
weak
mother
and
keep
at
home
when
he


ought
to
have
be
at
school
,
but
he
be
devotedly
attach
to
she
,
and


admire
she
beyond
measure
.
he
have
a
woman
's
delicacy
of
feature
,


and
be
-
"
as
you
may
see
,
though
you
never
see
she
,
"
say
Herbert
to


I
-
"
exactly
like
his
mother
.
"
it
be
but
natural
that
I
should
take
to


he
much
more
kindly
than
to
Drummle
,
and
that
,
even
in
the
early


evening
of
our
boating
,
he
and
I
should
pull
homeward
abreast
of
one


another
,
converse
from
boat
to
boat
,
while
Bentley
Drummle
come
up


in
our
wake
alone
,
under
the
overhang
bank
and
among
the
rush
.
he


would
always
creep
in
-
shore
like
some
uncomfortable
amphibious
creature
,


even
when
the
tide
would
have
send
he
fast
upon
his
way
;
and
I
always


think
of
he
as
come
after
we
in
the
dark
or
by
the
back
-
water
,


when
our
own
two
boat
be
break
the
sunset
or
the
moonlight
in


mid
-
stream
.


Herbert
be
my
intimate
companion
and
friend
.
I
present
he
with
a


half
-
share
in
my
boat
,
which
be
the
occasion
of
his
often
come
down


to
Hammersmith
;
and
my
possession
of
a
half
-
share
in
his
chamber
often


take
I
up
to
London
.
we
use
to
walk
between
the
two
place
at
all


hour
.
I
have
an
affection
for
the
road
yet
 
though
it
be
not
so


pleasant
a
road
as
it
be
then
,
form
in
the
impressibility
of
untried


youth
and
hope
.


when
I
have
be
in
Mr.
Pocket
's
family
a
month
or
two
,
Mr.
and
Mrs.


Camilla
turn
up
.
Camilla
be
Mr.
Pocket
's
sister
.
Georgiana
,
whom
I


have
see
at
Miss
Havisham
's
on
the
same
occasion
,
also
turn
up
.
she


be
a
cousin
,
-
an
indigestive
single
woman
,
who
call
her
rigidity


religion
,
and
her
liver
love
.
these
people
hate
I
with
the
hatred
of


cupidity
and
disappointment
.
as
a
matter
of
course
,
they
fawn
upon


I
in
my
prosperity
with
the
base
meanness
.
towards
Mr.
Pocket
,
as


a
grow
-
up
infant
with
no
notion
of
his
own
interest
,
they
show
the


complacent
forbearance
I
have
hear
they
express
.
Mrs.
Pocket
they


hold
in
contempt
;
but
they
allow
the
poor
soul
to
have
be
heavily


disappoint
in
life
,
because
that
shed
a
feeble
reflect
light
upon


themselves
.


these
be
the
surrounding
among
which
I
settle
down
,
and
apply


myself
to
my
education
.
I
soon
contract
expensive
habit
,
and
begin


to
spend
an
amount
of
money
that
within
a
few
short
month
I
should
have


think
almost
fabulous
;
but
through
good
and
evil
I
stick
to
my
book
.


there
be
no
other
merit
in
this
,
than
my
have
sense
enough
to
feel


my
deficiency
.
between
Mr.
Pocket
and
Herbert
I
get
on
fast
;
and
,
with


one
or
the
other
always
at
my
elbow
to
give
I
the
start
I
want
,
and


clear
obstruction
out
of
my
road
,
I
must
have
be
as
great
a
dolt
as


Drummle
if
I
have
do
less
.


I
have
not
see
Mr.
Wemmick
for
some
week
,
when
I
think
I
would
write


he
a
note
and
propose
to
go
home
with
he
on
a
certain
evening
.
he


reply
that
it
would
give
he
much
pleasure
,
and
that
he
would
expect


I
at
the
office
at
six
o'clock
.
Thither
I
go
,
and
there
I
find
he
,


put
the
key
of
his
safe
down
his
back
as
the
clock
strike
.


"
do
you
think
of

down
to

say
he
.


"

I

cold
roast
fowl

which
be
from
the


cook's

shop

think
it
be
tender

master

the
shop

Juryman

some

pick
we

a

it

"
massive

repeat
Wemmick
.
"
I
think
so
.

his
watch
be
a
gold


repeater

pound

there
be
about
seven
hundred
thief
in
this
town
who
know
all
about


that
watch
;
there
be
not
a
man
,
a
woman
,
or
a
child
,
among
they
,
who


would
n't
 
identify
the
small
link
in
that
chain
,
and
drop
it
as
if
it


be
red
hot
,
if
inveigle
into
touch
it
.
"


at
first
with
such
discourse
,
and
afterwards
with
conversation
of
a
more


general
nature
,
do
Mr.
Wemmick
and
I
beguile
the
time
and
the
road
,


until
he
give
I
to
understand
that
we
have
arrive
in
the
district
of


Walworth
.


it
appear
to
be
a
collection
of
back
lane
,
ditch
,
and
little


garden
,
and
to
present
the
aspect
of
a
rather
dull
retirement
.


Wemmick
's
house
be
a
little
wooden
cottage
in
the
midst
of
plot
of


garden
,
and
the
top
of
it
be
cut
out
and
paint
like
a
battery
mount


with
gun
.


"
my
own
doing
,
"
say
Wemmick
.
"
look
pretty
;
do
n't
 
it
?
"


I
highly
commend
it
,
I
think
it
be
the
small
house
I
ever
see
;


with
the
queer
gothic
window
 
by
far
the
great
part
of
they
sham
,


and
a
gothic
door
almost
too
small
to
get
in
at
.


"
that
be
a
real
flagstaff
,
you
see
,
"
say
Wemmick
,
"
and
on
Sundays
I


run
up
a
real
flag
.
then
look
here
.
after
I
have
cross
this
bridge
,
I


hoist
it
up
-
so
-
and
cut
off
the
communication
.
"


the
bridge
be
a
plank
,
and
it
cross
a
chasm
about
four
foot
wide


and
two
deep
.
but
it
be
very
pleasant
to
see
the
pride
with
which
he


hoist
it
up
and
make
it
fast
;
smile
as
he
do
so
,
with
a
relish
and


not
merely
mechanically
.


"
at
nine
o'clock
every
night
,
Greenwich
time
,
"
say
Wemmick
,
"
the
gun


fire
.
there
he
be
,
you
see
!
and
when
you
hear
he
go
,
I
think
you
'll


say
he
be
a
Stinger
.
"


the
piece
of
ordnance
refer
to
,
be
mount
in
a
separate
fortress
,


construct
of
lattice
-
work
.
it
be
protect
from
the
weather
by
an


ingenious
little
tarpaulin
contrivance
in
the
nature
of
an
umbrella
.


"
then
,
at
the
back
,
"
say
Wemmick
,
"
out
of
sight
,
so
as
not
to
impede


the
idea
of
fortification
,
-
for
it
be
a
principle
with
I
,
if
you
have


an
idea
,
carry
it
out
and
keep
it
up
,
-
I
do
n't
 
know
whether
that
be
your


opinion
-
"


I
say
,
decidedly
.


"
-
at
the
back
,
there
be
a
pig
,
and
there
be
fowl
and
rabbit
;
then
,


I
knock
together
my
own
little
frame
,
you
see
,
and
grow
cucumber
;
and


you
'll
judge
at
supper
what
sort
of
a
salad
I
can
raise
.
so
,
sir
,
"
say


wemmick
,
smile
again
,
but
seriously
too
,
as
he
shake
his
head
,
"
if
you


can
suppose
the
little
place
besiege
,
it
would
hold
out
a
devil
of
a


time
in
point
of
provision
.
"


then
,
he
conduct
I
to
a
bower
about
a
dozen
yard
off
,
but
which
be


approach
by
such
ingenious
twist
of
path
that
it
take
quite
a
long


time
to
get
at
;
and
in
this
retreat
our
glass
be
already
set
forth
.


our
punch
be
cool
in
an
ornamental
lake
,
on
whose
margin
the
bower


be
raise
.
this
piece
of
water
 
with
an
island
in
the
middle
which


might
have
be
the
salad
for
supper
 
be
of
a
circular
form
,
and
he
have


construct
a
fountain
in
it
,
which
,
when
you
set
a
little
mill
go


and
take
a
cork
out
of
a
pipe
,
play
to
that
powerful
extent
that

make
the
back

quite
wet

of

it
fall
out
as
Wemmick
have
tell
I
it
would
,
that
I
have
an
early


opportunity
of
compare
my
guardian
's
establishment
with
that
of
his


cashier
and
clerk
.
my
guardian
be
in
his
room
,
wash
his
hand
with


his
scented
soap
,
when
I
go
into
the
office
from
Walworth
;
and
he


call
I
to
he
,
and
give
I
the
invitation
for
myself
and
friend


which
Wemmick
have
prepare
I
to
receive
.
"
no
ceremony
,
"
he
stipulate
,


"
and
no
dinner
dress
,
and
say
to
-
morrow
.
"
I
ask
he
where
we
should


come
to
 
for
I
have
no
idea
where
he
live
,
and
I
believe
it
be
in
his


general
objection
to
make
anything
like
an
admission
,
that
he
reply
,


"
come
here
,
and
I
'll
take
you
home
with
I
.
"
I
embrace
this
opportunity


of
remark
that
he
wash
his
client
off
,
as
if
he
be
a
surgeon
or


a
dentist
.
he
have
a
closet
in
his
room
,
fit
up
for
the
purpose
,
which


smell
of
the
scented
soap
like
a
perfumer
's
shop
.
it
have
an
unusually


large
jack
-
towel
on
a
roller
inside
the
door
,
and
he
would
wash
his


hand
,
and
wipe
they
and
dry
they
all
over
this
towel
,
whenever
he
come


in
from
a
police
court
or
dismiss
a
client
from
his
room
.
when
I
and


my
friend
repair
to
he
at
six
o'clock
next
day
,
he
seem
to
have


be
engage
on
a
case
of
a
dark
complexion
than
usual
,
for
we
find


he
with
his
head
butt
into
this
closet
,
not
only
wash
his
hand
,


but
lave
his
face
and
gargle
his
throat
.
and
even
when
he
have


do
all
that
,
and
have
go
all
round
the
jack
-
towel
,
he
take
out
his


penknife
and
scrape
the
case
out
of
his
nail
before
he
put
his
coat


on
.


there
be
some
people
slink
about
as
usual
when
we
pass
out
into


the
street
,
who
be
evidently
anxious
to
speak
with
he
;
but
there
be


something
so
conclusive
in
the
halo
of
scented
soap
which
encircle


his
presence
,
that
they
give
it
up
for
that
day
.
as
we
walk
along


westward
,
he
be
recognize
ever
and
again
by
some
face
in
the
crowd
of


the
street
,
and
whenever
that
happen
he
talk
louder
to
I
;
but


he
never
otherwise
recognize
anybody
,
or
take
notice
that
anybody


recognize
he
.


he
conduct
we
to
Gerrard
Street
,
Soho
,
to
a
house
on
the
south
side
of


that
street
.
rather
a
stately
house
of
its
kind
,
but
dolefully
in
want


of
painting
,
and
with
dirty
window
.
he
take
out
his
key
and
open
the


door
,
and
we
all
go
into
a
stone
hall
,
bare
,
gloomy
,
and
little
use
.


so
,
up
a
dark
brown
staircase
into
a
series
of
three
dark
brown
room
on


the
first
floor
.
there
be
carve
garland
on
the
panel
wall
,
and


as
he
stand
among
they
give
we
welcome
,
I
know
what
kind
of
loop
I


think
they
look
like
.


dinner
be
lay
in
the
good
of
these
room
;
the
second
be
his


dressing
-
room
;
the
third
,
his
bedroom
.
he
tell
we
that
he
hold
the
whole


house
,
but
rarely
use
more
of
it
than
we
see
.
the
table
be
comfortably


lay
-
no
silver
in
the
service
,
of
course
-
and
at
the
side
of
his
chair


be
a
capacious
dumb
-
waiter
,
with
a
variety
of
bottle
and
decanter
on


it
,
and
four
dish
of
fruit
for
dessert
.
I
notice
throughout
,
that
he


keep
everything
under
his
own
hand
,
and
distribute
everything
himself
.


there
be
a
bookcase
in
the
room
;
I
see
from
the
back
of
the
book
,


that
they
be
about
evidence
,
criminal
law
,
criminal
biography
,
trial
,


act
of
Parliament
,
and
such
thing
.
the
furniture
be
all
very
solid


and
good
,
like
his
watch
-
chain
.
it
have
an
official
look
,
however
,
and


there
be
nothing
merely
ornamental
to
be
see
.
in
a
corner
be
a
little


table
of
paper
with
a
shaded
lamp
:
so
that
he
seem
to
bring
the


office
home
with
he
in
that
respect
too
,
and
to
wheel
it
out
of
an


evening
and
fall
to
work
.


as
he
have
scarcely
see
my
three
companion
until
now
,
-
for
he
and
I
have


walk
together
,
-
he
stand
on
the
hearth
-
rug
,
after
ring
the
bell
,


and
take
a
search
look
at
they
.
to
my
surprise
,
he
seem
at
once
to


be
principally
if
not
solely
interested
in
Drummle
.


"
Pip
,
"
say
he
,
put
his
large
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
move
I
to


the
window
,
"
I
do
n't
 
know
one
from
the
other
.
who
be
the
spider
?
"


"
the
spider

"
say
i.


"
the
blotchy
,
sprawly
,
sulky
fellow
.
"


"
that
be
Bentley

I
reply
;
"

I
like
the
look
of
that


fellow
.
"


he
immediately
begin
to
talk
to
Drummle
:
not
at
all
deter
by
his


reply
in
his
heavy
reticent
way
,
but
apparently
lead
on
by
it
to
screw


discourse
out
of
he
.
I
be
look
at
the
two
,
when
there
come
between


I
and
they
the
housekeeper
,
with
the
first
dish
for
the
table
.


she
be
a
woman
of
about
forty
,
I
suppose
,
-
but
I
may
have
think
she


young
than
she
be
.
rather
tall
,
of
a
lithe
nimble
figure
,
extremely


pale
,
with
large
faded
eye
,
and
a
quantity
of
streaming
hair
.
I
can
not


say
whether
any
diseased
affection
of
the
heart
cause
her
lip
to
be


parted
as
if
she
be
pant
,
and
her
face
to
bear
a
curious
expression


of
suddenness
and
flutter
;
but
I
know
that
I
have
be
to
see
Macbeth
at


the
theatre
,
a
night
or
two
before
,
and
that
her
face
look
to
I
as
if


it
be
all
disturb
by
fiery
air
,
like
the
face
I
have
see
rise
out


of
the
Witches
'
caldron
.


she
set
the
dish
on
,
touch
my
guardian
quietly
on
the
arm
with
a


finger
to
notify
that
dinner
be
ready
,
and
vanish
.
we
take
our
seat


at
the
round
table
,
and
my
guardian
keep
Drummle
on
one
side
of
he
,


while
Startop
sit
on
the
other
.
it
be
a
noble
dish
of
fish
that
the


housekeeper
have
put
on
table
,
and
we
have
a
joint
of
equally
choice


mutton
afterwards
,
and
then
an
equally
choice
bird
.
sauce
,
wine
,
all


the
accessory
we
want
,
and
all
of
the
good
,
be
give
out
by
our


host
from
his
dumb
-
waiter
;
and
when
they
have
make
the
circuit
of
the


table
,
he
always
put
they
back
again
.
similarly
,
he
deal
we
clean


plate
and
knife
and
fork
,
for
each
course
,
and
drop
those
just


disuse
into
two
basket
on
the
ground
by
his
chair
.
no
other
attendant


than
the
housekeeper
appear
.
she
set
on
every
dish
;
and
I
always
see


in
her
face
,
a
face
rise
out
of
the
caldron
.
year
afterwards
,
I
make


a
dreadful
likeness
of
that
woman
,
by
cause
a
face
that
have
no
other


natural
resemblance
to
it
than
it
derive
from
flow
hair
to
pass


behind
a
bowl
of
flame
spirit
in
a
dark
room
.


induce
to
take
particular
notice
of
the
housekeeper
,
both
by
she


own
striking
appearance
and
by
Wemmick
's
preparation
,
I
observe


that
whenever
she
be
in
the
room
she
keep
her
eye
attentively
on
my


guardian
,
and
that
she
would
remove
her
hand
from
any
dish
she
put


before
he
,
hesitatingly
,
as
if
she
dread
his
call
she
back
,
and


want
he
to
speak
when
she
be
nigh
,
if
he
have
anything
to
say
.
I


fancy
that
I
could
detect
in
his
manner
a
consciousness
of
this
,
and
a


purpose
of
always
hold
she
in
suspense
.


dinner
go
off
gayly
,
and
although
my
guardian
seem
to
follow
rather


than
originate
subject
,
I
know
that
he
wrench
the
weak
part
of


our
disposition
out
of
we
.
for
myself
,
I
find
that
I
be
express
my


tendency
to
lavish
expenditure
,
and
to
patronize
Herbert
,
and
to
boast


of
my
great
prospect
,
before
I
quite
know
that
I
have
open
my
lip
.


it
be
so
with
all
of
we
,
but
with
no
one
more
than
Drummle
:
the


development
of
whose
inclination
to
gird
in
a
grudging
and
suspicious


way
at
the
rest
,
be
screw
out
of
he
before
the
fish
be
take
off
.


it
be
not
then
,
but
when
we
have
get
to
the
cheese
,
that
our


conversation
turn
upon
our
rowing
feat
,
and
that
Drummle
be
rally


for
come
up
behind
of
a
night
in
that
slow
amphibious
way
of
his
.


Drummle
upon
this
,
inform
our
host
that
he
much
prefer
our
room
to


our
company
,
and
that
as
to
skill
he
be
more
than
our
master
,
and
that


as
to
strength
he
could
scatter
we
like
chaff
.
by
some
invisible
agency
,


my
guardian
wind
he
up
to
a
pitch
little
short
of
ferocity
about
this


trifle
;
and
he
fall
to
baring
and
span
his
arm
to
show
how
muscular


it
be
,
and
we
all
fall
to
baring
and
span
our
arm
in
a
ridiculous


manner
.


now
the
housekeeper
be
at
that
time
clear
the
table
;
my
guardian
,


take
no
heed
of
she
,
but
with
the
side
of
his
face
turn
from
she
,


be
lean
back
in
his
chair
bite
the
side
of
his
forefinger
and


show
an
interest
in
Drummle
,
that
,
to
I
,
be
quite
inexplicable
.


suddenly
,
he
clap
his
large
hand
on
the
housekeeper
's
,
like
a
trap
,


as
she
stretch
it
across
the
table
.
so
suddenly
and
smartly
do
he
do


this
,
that
we
all
stop
in
our
foolish
contention
.


"
if
you
talk
of
strength
,
"
say
Mr.
Jaggers
,
"
I
'll
show
you

not

agreeable

only
the

sentence

I
receive
this
letter
by
the
post
on
Monday
morning
,
and
therefore
its


appointment
be
for
next
day
.
let
I
confess
exactly
with
what
feeling


I
look
forward
to
Joe
's
come
.


not
with
pleasure
,
though
I
be
bind
to
he
by
so
many
tie
;
no
;


with
considerable
disturbance
,
some
mortification
,
and
a
keen
sense
of


incongruity
.
if
I
could
have
keep
he
away
by
pay
money
,
I
certainly


would
have
pay
money
.
my
great
reassurance
be
that
he
be
come


to
Barnard
's
Inn
,
not
to
Hammersmith
,
and
consequently
would
not
fall


in
Bentley
Drummle
's
way
.
I
have
little
objection
to
his
be
see
by


Herbert
or
his
father
,
for
both
of
whom
I
have
a
respect
;
but
I
have
the


sharp
sensitiveness
as
to
his
be
see
by

quite


unnecessary

get
on
so
fast

I
have
even
start
a
boy


in
boot
,

top
boot

in
bondage
and
slavery
to
whom
I
might
have
be


say
to

my
day
.
for

after
I
have
make

white
cravat
,
creamy
breech

the
boot


already
mention

I
have
to
find
he
a
little
to
do
and
a
great
deal


to
eat
;
and
with
both
of
those
horrible
requirement
he
haunt
my


existence

this
avenge
phantom

order
to
be
on
duty
at
eight
on
Tuesday

Herbert
suggest
certain
thing
for
breakfast
that
he


think
Joe
would
like
.
while
I
feel
sincerely
oblige
to
he
for
be


so
interested
and
considerate
,
I
have
an
odd
half
-
provoke
sense
of


suspicion
upon
I
,
that
if
Joe
have
be
come
to
see
he
,
he
would
n't


have
be
quite
so
brisk
about
it
.


however
,
I
come
into
town
on
the
Monday
night
to
be
ready
for
Joe
,

I
get
up
early
in
the
morning
,

cause
the
sitting

room
and


breakfast

table
to
assume
their
most
splendid
appearance
.
unfortunately


the
morning
be
drizzly
,
and
an
angel
could
not
have
conceal
the
fact


that
Barnard
be
shed
sooty
tear
outside
the
window
,
like
some
weak


giant
of
a
sweep

as
the
time
approach

should
have
like
to
run
away

the
Avenger


pursuant
to
order
be
in
the

presently
I
hear
Joe

the
staircase

I
know
it
be
Joe

by
his
clumsy
manner
of
come
up


stair
,

his
state
boot
be
always
too
big
for
he
,

by
the
time


it
take
he
to
read
the
name
on
the
other
floor
in
the
course
of


his
ascent
.
when
at
last
he
stop
outside
our

I
could
hear
his


finger
trace
over
the
paint
letter
of
my
name
,
and
I
afterwards


distinctly
hear
he
breathe
in
at
the
keyhole
.
finally
he
give
a


faint
single
rap
,

Pepper

such
be
the
compromise

cause
to
be
surprised


when
Herbert

meet
I
in
the
yard
,
come
up
and
tell
I
there
be
two


convict

down
with
I
.
but
I
have
a
reason
that
be
an
old
reason


now
for
constitutionally
falter
whenever
I
hear
the
word

no

I
ca
n't
 
pretend
that
I
do
like
they

I
suppose
you
do
n't


particularly
.
but
I
do
n't
 
mind
they
.
"


"
see
!
there
they
be
,
"
say
Herbert
,
"
come
out
of
the
Tap
.
what
a


degraded
and
vile
sight
it
be
!
"


they
have
be
treat
their
guard
,
I
suppose
,
for
they
have
a
gaoler


with
they
,
and
all
three
come
out
wipe
their
mouth
on
their
hand
.


the
two
convict
be
handcuff
together
,
and
have
iron
on
their


leg
,
-
iron
of
a
pattern
that
I
know
well
.
they
wear
the
dress
that
I


likewise
know
well
.
their
keeper
have
a
brace
of
pistol
,
and
carry


a
thick
-
knobbed
bludgeon
under
his
arm
;
but
he
be
on
term
of
good


understanding
with
they
,
and
stand
with
they
beside
he
,
look
on
at


the
putting
-
to
of
the
horse
,
rather
with
an
air
as
if
the
convict
be


an
interesting
exhibition
not
formally
open
at
the
moment
,
and
he
the


curator
.
one
be
a
tall
and
stouter
man
than
the
other
,
and
appear


as
a
matter
of
course
,
accord
to
the
mysterious
way
of
the
world
,


both
convict
and
free
,
to
have
had
allot
to
he
the
small
suit
of


clothe
.
his
arm
and
leg
be
like
great
pincushion
of
those
shape
,


and
his
attire
disguise
he
absurdly
;
but
I
know
his
half
-
closed
eye


at
one
glance
.
there
stand
the
man
whom
I
have
see
on
the
settle
at
the


three
Jolly
Bargemen
on
a
Saturday
night
,
and
who
have
bring
I
down


with
his
invisible
gun
!


it
be
easy
to
make
sure
that
as
yet
he
know
I
no
more
than
if
he
have


never
see
I
in
his
life
.
he
look
across
at
I
,
and
his
eye
appraise


my
watch
-
chain
,
and
then
he
incidentally
spit
and
say
something
to
the


other
convict
,
and
they
laugh
and
slue
themselves
round
with
a
clink


of
their
couple
manacle
,
and
look
at
something
else
.
the
great


number
on
their
back
,
as
if
they
be
street
door
;
their
coarse
mangy


ungainly
outer
surface
,
as
if
they
be
low
animal
;
their
iron


leg
,
apologetically
garlanded
with
pocket
-
handkerchief
;
and
the
way


in
which
all
present
look
at
they
and
keep
from
they
;
make
they
 
as


Herbert
have
say
 
a
most
disagreeable
and
degraded
spectacle
.


but
this
be
not
the
bad
of
it
.
it
come
out
that

that


there
be
no
place
for
the
two
prisoner

on
the
seat
in

behind
the
coachman

Hereupon
,
a
choleric
gentleman
,
who
have
take
the


fourth
place
on
that
seat
,
fly
into
a
most
violent
passion
,

say


that
it
be
a
breach
of
contract
to
mix
he
up
with
such
villainous

it

fortune
it
be
,
that
he
have
find
another

for
I

it
be
impossible

with
what
acuteness
I
feel
the

breathe
,

on
the

all
along
my
spine

like

in

marrow
with
some
pungent

it
set
my
very
tooth
on

he
seem
to
have
more

to
do

more

the
coincidence

our


be
together

sufficiently
strange
to
fill
I
with
a


dread

some
other
coincidence
might
at
any

connect
I

this
reason

I
resolve
to
alight
as
soon
as


we
touch
the
town

put
myself
out

down

what
point

would
be

off
to


the
river
.
in
my
fancy

I
see

wait
for

great
fear
upon
I
.
as
I
walk
on
to


the
hotel
,
I
feel
that
a
dread
,
much
exceed
the
mere
apprehension
of


a
painful
or
disagreeable
recognition
,
make
I
tremble
.
I
be
confident


that
it
take
no
distinctness
of
shape
,
and
that
it
be
the
revival
for
a


few
minute
of
the
terror
of
childhood
.


the
coffee
-
room
at
the
Blue
Boar
be
empty
,
and
I
have
not
only
order


my
dinner
there
,
but
have
sit
down
to
it
,
before
the
waiter
know
I
.
as


soon
as
he
have
apologize
for
the
remissness
of
his
memory
,
he
ask
I


if
he
should
send
Boots
for
Mr.
Pumblechook
?


"
no
,

say
I
,

certainly
not

the
waiter
 
it
be
he
who
have
bring
up
the
Great
Remonstrance
from
the


commercial
,
on
the
day
when
I
be
bind
 
appear
surprised
,
and


take
the
early
opportunity
of
put
a
dirty
old
copy
of
a
local


newspaper
so
directly
in
my
way
,
that
I
take
it
up
and
read
this


paragraph
:

our
reader
will
learn
,
not
altogether
without
interest
,

reference
to


the
recent
romantic
rise
in
fortune
of
a
young
artificer
in
iron
of
this


neighborhood
 
what
a
theme
,
by
the
way
,
for
the
magic
pen
of
our
as
yet


not
universally
acknowledge
townsman
TOOBY
,
the
poet
of
our
column
!


that
the
youth
's
early
patron
,
companion
,
and
friend
,
be
a
highly


respected
individual
not
entirely
unconnected
with
the
corn
and
seed


trade
,
and
whose
eminently
convenient
and
commodious
business
premise


be
situate
within
a
hundred
mile
of
the
High
Street
.
it
be
not
wholly


irrespective
of
our
personal
feeling
that
we
record
HIM
as
the
Mentor


of
our
young
telemachu
,
for
it
be
good
to
know
that
our
town
produce


the
founder
of
the
latter
's
fortune

do
the
thought

contract
brow


of

local
sage

the

eye
of

Quintin
Matsys

I
entertain
a
conviction
,
base
upon
large
experience
,
that
if
in
the


day
of
my
prosperity
I
have
go
to
the
North
Pole
,
I
should
have
meet


somebody
there
,
wander
Esquimaux
or
civilized
man
,
who
would
have


tell
I
that
Pumblechook
be
my
early
patron
and
the
founder
of
my


fortune
.


chapter
xxix


betime
in
the
morning
I
be
up
and
out
.
it
be
too
early
yet
to
go
to


Miss
Havisham
's
,
so
I
loiter
into
the
country
on
Miss
Havisham
's


side
of
town
,
-
which
be
not
Joe
's
side
;
I
could
go
there


to
-
morrow
,
-
think
about
my
patroness
,
and
paint
brilliant
picture


of
her
plan
for
I
.


she
have
adopt
Estella
,
she
have
as
good
as
adopt
I
,
and
it
could
not


fail
to
be
her
intention
to
bring
we
together
.
she
reserve
it
for
I
to


restore
the
desolate
house
,
admit
the
sunshine
into
the
dark
room
,


set
the
clock
a
-
going
and
the
cold
hearth
a
-
blaze
,
tear
down
the


cobwebs
,
destroy
the
vermin
,
-
in
short
,
do
all
the
shine
deed
of
the


young
Knight
of
romance
,
and
marry
the
Princess
.
I
have
stop
to


look
at
the
house
as
I
pass
;
and
its
sear
red
brick
wall
,
block


window
,
and
strong
green
ivy
clasp
even
the
stack
of
chimney
with


its
twig
and
tendon
,
as
if
with
sinewy
old
arm
,
have
make
up
a
rich


attractive
mystery
,
of
which
I
be
the
hero
.
Estella
be
the
inspiration


of
it
,
and
the
heart
of
it
,
of
course
.
but
,
though
she
have
take
such


strong
possession
of
I
,
though
my
fancy
and
my
hope
be
so
set
upon


she
,
though
her
influence
on
my
boyish
life
and
character
have
be


all
-
powerful
,
I
do
not
,
even
that
romantic
morning
,
invest
she
with
any


attribute
save
those
she
possess
.
I
mention
this
in
this
place
,
of
a


fix
purpose
,
because
it
be
the
clew
by
which
I
be
to
be
follow
into


my
poor
labyrinth
.
accord
to
my
experience
,
the
conventional
notion


of
a
lover
can
not
be
always
true
.
the
unqualified
truth
be
,
that
when
I


love
Estella
with
the
love
of
a
man
,
I
love
she
simply
because
I
find


her
irresistible
.
once
for
all
;
I
know
to
my
sorrow
,
often
and
often
,


if
not
always
,
that
I
love
she
against
reason
,
against
promise
,
against


peace
,
against
hope
,
against
happiness
,
against
all
discouragement
that


could
be
.
once
for
all
;
I
love
she
none
the
less
because
I
know
it
,


and
it
have
no
more
influence
in
restrain
I
than
if
I
have
devoutly


believe
she
to
be
human
perfection
.


I
so
shape
out
my
walk
as
to
arrive
at
the
gate
at
my
old
time
.
when


I
have
ring
at
the
bell
with
an
unsteady
hand
,
I
turn
my
back
upon
the


gate
,
while
I
try
to
get
my
breath
and
keep
the
beating
of
my
heart


moderately
quiet
.
I
hear
the
side
-
door
open
,
and
step
come
across
the


courtyard
;
but
I
pretend
not
to
hear
,
even
when
the
gate
swing
on
its


rusty
hinge
.


be
at
last
touch
on
the
shoulder
,
I
start
and
turn
.
I
start


much
more
naturally
then
,
to
find
myself
confront
by
a
man
in
a
sober


gray
dress
.
the
last
man
I
should
have
expect
to
see
in
that
place
of


porter
at
Miss
Havisham
's
door
.


"

have
leisure
to
entertain

retort
in
my


mind

slowly
lift
his
heavy
glance
from
the
pavement

by
this

we

I

to
dissociate

presence


from
all
those
wretched
hankering
after
money

gentility
that
have

it
out

the
iron

it
from
the
darkness

night

at
the
wooden


window

the
forge

away

in
a
word

it
be
impossible

past

in
the

converse

a

we
two
out

she
about
a
little

in
time
of
yore

so
,
Estella

I
go
out
into
the
garden
by
the
gate
through
which
I


have
stray
to
my
encounter
with
the
pale
young
gentleman
,
now
Herbert
;


I
,
tremble
in
spirit
and
worship
the
very
hem
of
her
dress
;
she
,


quite
composed
and
most
decidedly
not
worship
the
hem
of
mine
.
as
we


draw
near
to
the
place
of
encounter
,
she
stop
and
say
,
-


"
I
must
have
be
a
singular
little
creature

day

she
reply
,
in
an
incidental
and
forgetful
way
.
"
I
remember
I


entertain
a
great
objection

your
adversary

I

it
ill


that

make
the
admission
with
reluctance

it
seem
to
have
a
boyish


look
,

she
already
treat
I
more
than
enough
like
a
boy
.


"

your
change
of
fortune

"


in
my
conscience

very
much
whether
I
have
any
linger


intention
leave
of

Joe

if
I
have

this
observation
put


it
to
flight

no
idea

impending
good
fortune

Estella
,
with
a
slight
wave
of
her
hand
,

in
the
fighting


time
.


"
not
the

the
air
of
completeness
and
superiority
with

she
walk
at
my


side
,
and
the
air
of
youthfulness
and
submission
with
which
I
walk
at


her
,
make
a
contrast
that
I
strongly
feel

would
have
rankle
in
I


more

it
by

to
she

too
overgrown

rank
for
walk
in
with
ease
,

we
have
make
the
round
of
it
twice

thrice

come
out
again


into

she
to
a
nicety
where
I
have
see
she


walk
on
the
cask
,
that
first
old
day
,

she

,
with
a
cold
and


careless
look
in
that
direction
,

she

out

my
meat

beautiful

get
through
some
jargon

I
take
the
liberty

doubt
that

in
some
of
her
look

gesture
there
be
that
tinge
of
resemblance


to
Miss
Havisham

may
often
be
notice
to
have
be
acquire
by


child

grown
person
with

they
have

much
associate

seclude

again

frown
 
for

smooth
 
as
with
a
darkening
of

face

upon
the
ground

she
hold
it
in
one
hand


now
,
and
with
the
other
lightly
touch
my
shoulder
as
we
walk
.
we


walk
round
the
ruin
garden
twice
or
thrice
more
,
and
it
be
all
in


bloom
for
I
.
if
the
green
and
yellow
growth
of
weed
in
the
chink
of


the
old
wall
have
be
the
most
precious
flower
that
ever
blow
,
it
could


not
have
be
more
cherished
in
my
remembrance
.


there
be
no
discrepancy
of
year
between
we
to
remove
she
far
from
I
;


we
be
of
nearly
the
same
age
,
though
of
course
the
age
tell
for
more


in
her
case
than
in
mine
;
but
the
air
of
inaccessibility
which
she


beauty
and
her
manner
give
she
,
torment
I
in
the
midst
of
my
delight
,


and
at
the
height
of
the
assurance
I
feel
that
our
patroness
have
choose


we
for
one
another
.
wretched
boy
!


at
last
we
go
back
into
the
house
,
and
there
I
hear
,
with
surprise
,


that
my
guardian
have
come
down
to
see
Miss
Havisham
on
business
,
and


would
come
back
to
dinner
.
the
old
wintry
branch
of
chandelier
in


the
room
where
the
mouldering
table
be
spread
have
be
light
while
we


be
out
,
and
Miss
Havisham
be
in
her
chair
and
wait
for
I
.


it
be
like
push
the
chair
itself
back
into
the
past
,
when
we
begin


the
old
slow
circuit
round
about
the
ashe
of
the
bridal
feast
.
but
,


in
the
funereal
room
,
with
that
figure
of
the
grave
fall
back
in
the


chair
fix
its
eye
upon
she
,
Estella
look
more
bright
and
beautiful


than
before
,
and
I
be
under
strong
enchantment
.


the
time
so
melt
away
,
that
our
early
dinner
-
hour
draw
close
at
hand
,


and
Estella
leave
we
to
prepare
herself
.
we
have
stop
near
the
centre


of
the
long
table
,
and
Miss
Havisham
,
with
one
of
her
withered
arm


stretch
out
of
the
chair
,
rest
that
clenched
hand
upon
the
yellow


cloth
.
as
Estella
look
back
over
her
shoulder
before
go
out
at
the


door
,
Miss
Havisham
kiss
that
hand
to
she
,
with
a
ravenous
intensity


that
be
of
its
kind
quite
dreadful
.


then
,
Estella
be

and
we
two
leave
alone
,
she
turn
to
I
,
and


say
in
a
whisper
,
-

an
arm
round
my
neck
,
and
draw
my
head
close
down
to
hers
as

in
the
chair
.

I
could
answer
 
if
I

so
difficult
a
question


at
all
 
she
repeat

the
vehemence

she
say
the
word
often
enough
,

there
could
be
no
doubt
that
she


mean
to
say
it
;

if
the
often
repeat
word
have
be
hate
instead
of


love

despair

revenge

dire
death

it
could
not

a
wild
cry

catch


her

up

in
her
shroud
of
a


dress
,

strike
at
the

as
if
she
would
as
soon
have
strike
herself


against
the
wall
and
fall
dead
.

this
pass
in
a
few
second
.

I
draw
she
down
into

impose
proportion

be


of
great
value

so
terrify
a


client

his
nose

pause
,


as
if
he
know

should
not
have
time
to
do
it
before
such
client


or
witness
commit
himself

the
self

committal
have

plainly
,

a
momentary
and
silent
pause


in
that
attitude
,
"

Singular

"
and
then
put
the
handkerchief
to


its
right
use
with
wonderful
effect
.


Miss
Havisham
have
see

soon
as

be

even
in

his
very
look
to


himself

scarcely
direct
his
eye
to
Estella
's
face
once
during


dinner

when
she
speak

listen

never

she
often


look
at
he

interest

curiosity

not
distrust
,

his


face

show
the
least
consciousness

throughout

he
take


a
dry
delight

yellower

often


refer
in
conversation
with
I
to
my
expectation
;

here
,


again
,
he
show
no
consciousness
,
and
even
make
it
appear
that
he


extort
-
and
even
do
extort
,

I
do
n't
 
know
how

those
reference


out
of
my
innocent
self
.

when
he
and
I
be
leave
alone
together
,
he
sit
with
an
air
upon
he


of
general
lie
by
in
consequence
of
information
he
possess
,
that


really
be
too
much
for
I
.
he
cros
-
examine
his
very
wine
when
he
have


nothing
else
in
hand

hold
it
between
himself

taste


the
port

it
in

it
,
fill
again
,
and


cross
-
examine
the
glass
again
,
until
I
be
as
nervous
as
if
I
have
know


the
wine
to
be
tell
he
something
to
my
disadvantage
.
three
or
four


time
I
feebly
think
I
would
start
conversation
;
but
whenever
he
see


I
go
to
ask
he
anything
,
he
look
at
I
with
his
glass
in
his


hand

roll
his
wine
about
in
his
mouth
,

if
request

to


take
notice
that
it
be
of
no
use

he
could
n't
 
answer

I
think
Miss
Pocket
be
conscious
that
the
sight
of
I
involve
she


in
the
danger
of
be
goad
to
madness
,
and
perhaps
tear
off
she


cap
,
-
which
be
a
very
hideous
one
,
in
the
nature
of
a
muslin
mop
,
-
and


strew
the
ground
with
her
hair
,
-
which
assuredly
have
never
grow


on
her
head
.
she
do
not
appear
when
we
afterwards
go
up
to
Miss


Havisham
's
room
,
and
we
four
play
at
whist
.
in
the
interval
,
Miss


Havisham
,
in
a
fantastic
way
,
have
put
some
of
the
most
beautiful
jewel


from
her
dressing
-
table
into
Estella
's
hair
,
and
about
her
bosom
and


arm
;
and
I
see
even
my
guardian
look
at
she
from
under
his
thick


eyebrow
,
and
raise
they
a
little
,
when
her
loveliness
be
before
he
,


with
those
rich
flush
of
glitter
and
color
in
it
.


of
the
manner
and
extent
to
which
he
take
our
trump
into
custody
,
and


come
out
with
mean
little
card
at
the
end
of
hand
,
before
which
the


glory
of
our
king
and
Queens
be
utterly
abase
,
I
say
nothing
;
nor
,
of


the
feeling
that
I
have
,
respect
his
look
upon
we
personally
in
the


light
of
three
very
obvious
and
poor
riddle
that
he
have
find
out
long


ago
.
what
I
suffer
from
,
be
the
incompatibility
between
his
cold


presence
and
my
feeling
towards
Estella
.
it
be
not
that
I
know
I
could


never
bear
to
speak
to
he
about
she
,
that
I
know
I
could
never
bear
to


hear
he
creak
his
boot
at
she
,
that
I
know
I
could
never
bear
to
see


he
wash
his
hand
of
she
;
it
be
,
that
my
admiration
should
be
within


a
foot
or
two
of
he
,
-
it
be
,
that
my
feeling
should
be
in
the
same


place
with
he
,
-
that
,
be
the
agonizing
circumstance
.


we
play
until
nine
o'clock
,
and
then
it
be
arrange
that
when
Estella


come
to
London
I
should
be
forewarn
of
she
come
and
should
meet
she


at
the
coach
;
and
then
I
take
leave
of
she
,
and
touch
she
and
leave


she
.


my
guardian
lie
at
the
Boar
in
the
next
room
to
mine
.
far
into
the


night
,
Miss
Havisham
's
word
,
"
love
she
,
love
she
,
love
she
!
"
sound
in


my
ear
.
I
adapt
they
for
my
own
repetition
,
and
say
to
my
pillow
,
"
I


love
she
,
I
love
she
,
I
love
she
!
"
hundred
of
time
.
then
,
a
burst
of


gratitude
come
upon
I
,
that
she
should
be
destine
for
I
,
once
the


blacksmith
's
boy
.
then
I
think
if
she
be
,
as
I
fear
,
by
no
mean


rapturously
grateful
for
that
destiny
yet
,
when
would
she
begin
to
be


interested
in
I
?
when
should
I
awaken
the
heart
within
she
that
be


mute
and
sleep
now
?


ah
I
!
I
think
those
be
high
and
great
emotion
.
but
I
never
think


there
be
anything
low
and
small
in
my
keeping
away
from
Joe
,
because


I
know
she
would
be
contemptuous
of
he
.
it
be
but
a
day
go
,
and
Joe


have
bring
the
tear
into
my
eye
;
they
have
soon
dry
,
God
forgive
I
!


soon
dry

consider
the
matter
while
I
be
dress
at
the
Blue
Boar


in
the
morning
,
I
resolve
to
tell
my
guardian
that
I
doubt
Orlick

be
the
right
sort
of
man
to
fill
a

.


"
why
of
course
he
be
not
the
right
sort
of
man

Pip
,
"
say
my
guardian
,


comfortably
satisfied
beforehand
on
the
general
head
,
"
because
the
man


who
fill
the
post
of
trust
never
be
the
right
sort
of
man
.
"
it
seem


quite
to
put
he
into
spirit
to
find
that
this
particular
post
be


not
exceptionally
hold
by
the
right
sort
of
man
,
and
he
listen
in
a


satisfied
manner
while
I
tell
he
what
knowledge
I
have
of
Orlick
.
"
very


good

Pip

he
observe

I
have
conclude
,

'll
go
round
presently
,


and
pay
our
friend
off
.
"
rather
alarm
by
this
summary
action
,
I
be


for
a
little
delay
,
and
even
hint
that
our
friend
himself
might
be


difficult
to
deal
with
.
"
oh
no

say
my
guardian
,
make
his


pocket

,
with
perfect
confidence
;
"
I
should
like
to


see
he
argue
the
question
with
I
.
"


as
we
be
go
back
together
to
London
by
the
midday
coach
,
and
as
I


breakfast
under
such
terror
of
Pumblechook
that
I
could
scarcely
hold


my
cup
,
this
give
I
an
opportunity
of
say
that
I
want
a
walk
,
and


that
I
would
go
on
along
the
London
road
while
Mr.
Jaggers
be
occupy
,


if
he
would
let
the
coachman
know
that
I
would
get
into
my
place
when


overtaken
.
I
be
thus
enable
to
fly
from
the
Blue
Boar
immediately


after
breakfast
.
by
then
make
a
loop
of
about
a
couple
of
mile
into


the
open
country
at
the
back
of
Pumblechook
's
premise
,
I
get
round
into


the
High
Street
again
,
a
little
beyond
that
pitfall
,
and
feel
myself
in


comparative
security
.


it
be
interesting
to
be
in
the
quiet
old
town
once
more
,
and
it
be
not


disagreeable
to
be
here
and
there
suddenly
recognize
and
stare
after
.


one
or
two
of
the
tradespeople
even
dart
out
of
their
shop
and
go


a
little
way
down
the
street
before
I
,
that
they
might
turn
,
as
if
they


have
forget
something
,
and
pass
I
face
to
face
,
-
on
which
occasion
I


do
n't
 
know
whether
they
or
I
make
the
bad
pretence
;
they
of
not
do


it
,
or
I
of
not
see
it
.
still
my
position
be
a
distinguished
one
,


and
I
be
not
at
all
dissatisfied
with
it
,
until
Fate
throw
I
in
the


way
of
that
unlimited
miscreant
,
Trabb
's
boy
.


cast
my
eye
along
the
street
at
a
certain
point
of
my
progress
,
I


beheld
Trabb
's
boy
approach
,
lash
himself
with
an
empty
blue
bag
.


deeming
that
a
serene
and
unconscious
contemplation
of
he
would
well


beseem
I
,
and
would
be
most
likely
to
quell
his
evil
mind
,
I
advance


with
that
expression
of
countenance
,
and
be
rather
congratulating


myself
on
my
success
,
when
suddenly
the
knee
of
Trabb
's
boy
smite


together
,
his
hair
uprise
,
his
cap
fall
off
,
he
tremble
violently
in


every
limb
,
stagger
out
into
the
road
,
and
cry
to
the
populace
,


"
hold
I
!
I
be
so
frightened
!
"
feign
to
be
in
a
paroxysm
of
terror
and


contrition
,
occasion
by
the
dignity
of
my
appearance
.
as
I
pass
he
,


his
tooth
loudly
chatter
in
his
head
,
and
with
every
mark
of
extreme


humiliation
,
he
prostrate
himself
in
the
dust
.


this
be
a
hard
thing
to
bear
,
but
this
be
nothing
.
I
have
not
advance


another
two
hundred
yard
when
,
to
my
inexpressible
terror
,
amazement
,


and
indignation
,
I
again
behold
Trabb
's
boy
approach
.
he
be
come


round
a
narrow
corner
.
his
blue
bag
be
sling
over
his
shoulder
,
honest


industry
beam
in
his
eye
,
a
determination
to
proceed
to
Trabb
's
with


cheerful
briskness
be
indicate
in
his
gait
.
with
a
shock
he
become


aware
of
I
,
and
be
severely
visit
as
before
;
but
this
time
his


motion
be
rotatory
,
and
he
stagger
round
and
round
I
with
knee


more
afflict
,
and
with
uplifted
hand
as
if
beseech
for
mercy
.
his


suffering
be
hail
with
the
great
joy
by
a
knot
of
spectator
,


and
I
feel
utterly
confound
.


I
have
not
get
as
much
far
down
the
street
as
the
post
-
office
,
when
I


again
beheld
Trabb
's
boy
shoot
round
by
a
back
way
.
this
time
,
he
be


entirely
change
.
he
wear
the
blue
bag
in
the
manner
of
my
great
-
coat
,


and
be
strut
along
the
pavement
towards
I
on
the
opposite
side
of


the
street
,
attend
by
a
company
of
delighted
young
friend
to
whom
he


from
time
to
time
exclaim
,
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
,
"
do
n't
 
know

"


word
can
not
state
the
amount
of
aggravation
and
injury
wreak
upon


I
by
Trabb
's
boy
,
when
pass
abreast
of
I
,
he
pull
up
his


shirt

collar
,
twine
his
side

hair
,
stick
an
arm
akimbo
,
and
smirk


extravagantly
by
,
wriggle
his
elbow
and
body
,
and
drawl
to
his


attendant
,
"

"
the
disgrace
attendant
on
his
immediately
afterwards
take


to
crow
and
pursue
I
across
the
bridge
with
crow
,
as
from
an


exceedingly
deject
fowl
who
have
know
I
when
I
be
a
blacksmith
,


culminate
the
disgrace
with
which
I
leave
the
town
,
and
be
,
so
to


speak
,
eject
by
it
into
the
open
country
.


but
unless
I
have
take
the
life
of
Trabb
's
boy
on
that
occasion
,
I


really
do
not
even
now
see
what
I
could
have
do
save
endure
.
to


have
struggle
with
he
in
the
street
,
or
to
have
exact
any
low


recompense
from
he
than
his
heart
's
good
blood
,
would
have
be


futile
and
degrading
.
moreover
,
he
be
a
boy
whom
no
man
could
hurt
;
an


invulnerable
and
dodge
serpent
who
,
when
chase
into
a
corner
,
fly


out
again
between
his
captor
's
leg
,
scornfully
yelp
.
I
write
,


however
,
to
Mr.
Trabb
by
next
day
's
post
,
to
say
that
Mr.
Pip
must


decline
to
deal
far
with
one
who
could
so
far
forget
what
he
owe
to


the
good
interest
of
society
,
as
to
employ
a
boy
who
excite
loathing


in
every
respectable
mind
.


the
coach
,
with
Mr.
Jaggers
inside
,
come
up
in
due
time
,
and
I
take
my


box
-
seat
again
,
and
arrive
in
London
safe
,
-
but
not
sound
,
for
my
heart


be
go
.
as
soon
as
I
arrive
,
I
send
a
penitential
codfish
and
barrel


of
oyster
to
Joe
 
as
reparation
for
not
having
go
myself
,
and
then


go
on
to
Barnard
's
Inn
.


I
find
Herbert
dining
on
cold
meat
,
and
delight
to
welcome
I
back
.


having
despatch
the
Avenger
to
the
coffee
-
house
for
an
addition
to
the


dinner
,
I
feel
that
I
must
open
my
breast
that
very
evening
to
my
friend


and
chum
.
as
confidence
be
out
of
the
question
with
the
Avenger
in
the


hall
,
which
could
merely
be
regard
in
the
light
of
an
antechamber
to


the

XXXI


on
our
arrival
in
Denmark
,

find
the
king
and
queen
of
that
country


elevate
in
two

chair
on
a
kitchen

table
,
hold
a
Court
.
the


whole
of
the
danish
nobility
be
in
attendance
;
consist
of
a
noble


boy
in
the
wash
-
leather
boot
of
a
gigantic
ancestor
,
a
venerable
Peer


with
a
dirty
face
who
seem
to
have
rise
from
the
people
late
in
life
,


and
the
danish
chivalry
with
a
comb
in
its
hair
and
a
pair
of
white


silk
leg
,
and
present
on
the
whole
a
feminine
appearance
.
my
gifted


townsman
stand
gloomily
apart
,
with
fold
arm
,
and
I
could
have
wish


that
his
curl
and
forehead
have
be
more
probable
.


several
curious
little
circumstance
transpire
as
the
action
proceed
.


the
late
king
of
the
country
not
only
appear
to
have
be
trouble


with
a
cough
at
the
time
of
his
decease
,
but
to
have
take
it
with
he


to
the
tomb
,
and
to
have
bring
it
back
.
the
royal
phantom
also
carry


a
ghostly
manuscript
round
its
truncheon
,
to
which
it
have
the
appearance


of
occasionally
refer
,
and
that
too
,
with
an
air
of
anxiety
and
a


tendency
to
lose
the
place
of
reference
which
be
suggestive
of
a
state


of
mortality
.
it
be
this
,
I
conceive
,

note

majestic
spirit

an
air

immense
distance

her
waist
be
encircle

another

each

her
arm

another

so
that
she

openly

time
,
the
whole
thing
be
so
droll
;


and
yet
I
have
a
latent
impression
that
there
be
something
decidedly


fine
in
Mr.
Wopsle
's
elocution
,
-
not
for
old
association
'
sake
,
I
be


afraid
,
but
because
it
be
very
slow
,
very
dreary
,
very
up
-
hill
and


down
-
hill
,
and
very
unlike
any
way
in
which
any
man
in
any
natural


circumstance
of
life
or
death
ever
express
himself
about
anything

when
the
tragedy

over
,

he
have
be
call
for

I
say


to
Herbert
,

shall
meet

"


we
make
all
the
haste
we
could
down

we
be
not
quick
enough


either

at
the

a
jewish
man

an
unnatural
heavy


smear
of

catch
my
eye

we
advance
,

,

we


come
up

round

I
be
so
sorry
for
he
as
it
be

I
take
the
opportunity
of
his
turning
round
to
have
his
brace


put
on

we
out
at

Herbert

he

it
would


be
kind
to
do
so

I
invite
he

he

up

the

his
success

develop


his
plan

I
forget
in
detail
what
they
be

I
have
a
general


recollection

he
be
to
begin
with

the
Drama

to
end

crush
it

decease
would
leave
it
utterly
bereft

miserably
I
go
to
bed
after
all

miserably
thought
of

miserably
dream

order
several
suit


of

for
this
occasion
;

as
there
be
not

I
be
fain
to
be


content
with
those
I
have
.

appetite
vanish
instantly
,

I

no
peace

rest

the
day
arrive

not
that
its
arrival

be
bad
than
ever

before
the

have
leave

Blue
Boar
in
our
town

for
all
that
I
know
this
perfectly
well
,
I
still


feel
as
if
it
be
not
safe
to
let
the
coach

office
be
out
of
my
sight


long
than
five
minute
at
a
time
;
and
in
this
condition
of
unreason
I


have
perform
the
first
half

hour
of
a

complain

his

"

"


I
have
so
much
time
to
spare
,
that
the
proposal
come
as
a
relief
,


notwithstanding
its
irreconcilability
with
my
latent
desire
to
keep
my


eye
on

mutter
that
I
would
make
the
inquiry
whether


I
have
time
to
walk
with

I
go
into
the
office
,

ascertain


from
the
clerk
with
the
nice
precision
and
much
to
the
trying
of
his


temper
,
the
early
moment
at
which
the
coach
could
be
expect
,

which


I
know
beforehand
,
quite
as
well
as
he

I
then
rejoin
Mr.
Wemmick
,

affect
to
consult
my
watch
,

to
be
surprise
by
the
information
I


have
receive
,
accept
his
offer
.


we
be
at
Newgate
in
a
few
minute
,

we
pass
through
the
lodge

some
fetter

up
on
the
bare
wall
among
the
prison


rule

into
the
interior
of
the
jail

at
that
time
jail
be
much


neglect

the
period
of
exaggerated
reaction
consequent
on


all
public
wrongdoing

and
which
be
always
its
heavy
and
long


punishment

say
nothing
of
pauper
,

seldom
set
fire
to
their


prison
with
the
excusable
object
of
improve
the
flavor
of
their
soup

a
frowzy

ugly

depress


scene
it
be

it
strike
I

Wemmick

for
the


first
time
,
that
I
have
have
some
other
guardian
of
minor
ability
.


Mr.
Wemmick
and
I
part
at
the
office
in
Little
Britain
,
where


suppliant
for
Mr.
Jaggers
's
notice
be
linger
about
as
usual
,
and
I


return
to
my
watch
in
the
street
of
the
coach
-
office
,
with
some
three


hour
on
hand
.
I
consume
the
whole
time
in
think
how
strange
it


be
that
I
should
be
encompass
by
all
this
taint
of
prison
and
crime
;


that
,
in
my
childhood
out
on
our
lonely
marsh
on
a
winter
evening
,
I


should
have
first
encounter
it
;
that
,
it
should
have
reappear
on
two


occasion
,
start
out
like
a
stain
that
be
fade
but
not
go
;
that
,


it
should
in
this
new
way
pervade
my
fortune
and
advancement
.
while
my


mind
be
thus
engage
,
I
think
of
the
beautiful
young
Estella
,
proud


and
refine
,
come
towards
I
,
and
I
think
with
absolute
abhorrence


of
the
contrast
between
the
jail
and
she
.
I
wish
that
Wemmick
have
not


meet
I
,
or
that
I
have
not
yield
to
he
and
go
with
he
,
so
that
,


of
all
day
in
the
year
on
this
day
,
I
might
not
have
have
Newgate
in


my
breath
and
on
my
clothe
.
I
beat
the
prison
dust
off
my
foot
as
I


saunter
to
and
fro
,
and
I
shake
it
out
of
my
dress
,
and
I
exhale


its
air
from
my
lung
.
so
contaminate
do
I
feel
,
remember
who
be


come
,
that
the
coach
come
quickly
after
all
,
and
I
be
not
yet
free


from
the
soil
consciousness
of
Mr.
Wemmick
's
conservatory
,
when
I
see


her
face
at
the
coach
window
and
her
hand
wave
to
I
.


what
be
the
nameless
shadow
which
again
in
that
one
instant
have
pass
?

combination

no

I
should
have
go
on
with
the
subject
so
far
as
to
describe


the
dinner
in
Gerrard

,
if
we

not

come
into
a

it
last
,
to
be
all
alight

alive


with
that
inexplicable
feeling
I
have
have
before

when
we

out

so
we
fall
into
other
talk
,

it
be
principally
about
the
way
by


which
we
be
travel
,

about
what
part
of
London
lie
on
this


side
of
it
,
and
what
on
that
.
the
great
city
be
almost
new
to

never

Miss

neighborhood

she


have
go
to
France
,

she
have
merely
pass
through
London
then
in


go
and
return
.
I
ask
she
if
my
guardian
have
any
charge
of
she


while
she
remain
here
?
to
that
she
emphatically
say
"
God
forbid
!
"
and


no
more
.


it
be
impossible
for
I
to
avoid
see
that
she
care
to
attract
I
;


that
she
make
herself
win
,

would
have
win
I
even
if
the
task


have
need
pain

yet
this
make
I
none
the
happy
,

even
if
she
have


not
take
that
tone
of
our
be
dispose
of
by
other
,
I
should
have


feel
that
she
hold
my
heart
in
her
hand
because
she
wilfully
choose
to
do


it
,

not
because
it
would
have
wring
any
tenderness
in
she
to
crush


it
and
throw
it
away
.


when
we
pass
through
Hammersmith
,
I
show
she
where
Mr.
Matthew


Pocket
live
,

say
it
be
no
great
way
from

inquire
be
it
a
large
household

wonder

part

again
so
soon

Estella

a
sigh

be
tired
;
"

be
to
write

see


her
regularly

report
how
I
go
on

I

the
jewel

they
be


nearly
all
mine

it

the
first

she

ever
call
I
by
my
name

of
course
she


do
so
purposely
,

know
that
I
should
treasure
it
up
.


we
come
to
Richmond
all
too
soon
,
and
our
destination
there
be
a
house


by
the
green
,

a
staid
old
house
,
where

powder
and
patch
,


embroider
coat
,
roll
stocking
,
ruffle
and
sword

have
have
their


court
day
many
a
time
.
some
ancient
tree
before
the
house
be
still


cut
into
fashion
as
formal
and
unnatural
as
the
hoop
and
wig
and


stiff
skirt
;
but
their
own
allotted
place
in
the
great
procession
of


the
dead
be
not
far
off
,
and
they
would
soon
drop
into
they
and
go
the


silent
way
of
the
rest
.


a
bell
with
an
old
voice
-
which
I
dare
say
in
its
time
have
often
say


to
the
house
,
here
be
the
green
farthingale

here
be
the
diamond

hilte


sword

here
be
the
shoe
with
red
heel

blue
solitaire

gravely
in
the
moonlight

I
her
hand
and
a
smile
,

say
good
night
,
and
be
absorb


likewise
.
and
still
I
stand
look
at
the
house
,
think
how
happy
I


should
be
if
I
live
there
with
she
,
and
know
that
I
never
be
happy


with
she
,

always
miserable
.


I
get
into
the
carriage
to
be
take
back
to
Hammersmith

I
get
in

chapter
XXXIV


as
I
have
grow
accustomed
to
my
expectation
,
I
have
insensibly
begin
to


notice
their
effect
upon
myself
and
those
around
I
.
their
influence
on


my
own
character
I
disguise
from
my
recognition
as
much
as
possible
,


but
I
know
very
well
that
it
be
not
all
good
.
I
live
in
a
state
of


chronic
uneasiness
respect
my
behavior
to
Joe
.
my
conscience
be
not


by
any
mean
comfortable
about
Biddy
.
when
I
wake
up
in
the
night
,
-
like


Camilla
,
-
I
use
to
think
,
with
a
weariness
on
my
spirit
,
that
I
should


have
be
happy
and
well
if
I
have
never
see
Miss
Havisham
's
face
,


and
have
rise
to
manhood
content
to
be
partner
with
Joe
in
the
honest


old
forge
.
many
a
time
of
an
evening
,
when
I
sit
alone
look
at
the


fire
,
I
think
,
after
all
there
be
no
fire
like
the
forge
fire
and
the


kitchen
fire
at
home
.


yet
Estella
be
so
inseparable
from
all
my
restlessness
and
disquiet
of


mind
,
that
I
really
fall
into
confusion
as
to
the
limit
of
my
own
part


in
its
production
.
that
be
to
say
,
suppose
I
have
have
no
expectation
,


and
yet
have
have
Estella
to
think
of
,
I
could
not
make
out
to
my


satisfaction
that
I
should
have
do
much
well
.
now
,
concern
the


influence
of
my
position
on
other
,
I
be
in
no
such
difficulty
,
and
so


I
perceive
-
though
dimly
enough
perhaps
-
that
it
be
not
beneficial


to
anybody
,
and
,
above
all
,
that
it
be
not
beneficial
to
Herbert
.


my
lavish
habit
lead
his
easy
nature
into
expense
that
he
could
not


afford
,
corrupt
the
simplicity
of
his
life
,
and
disturb
his
peace


with
anxiety
and
regret
.
I
be
not
at
all
remorseful
for
have


unwittingly
set
those
other
branch
of
the
Pocket
family
to
the
poor


art
they
practise
;
because
such
littleness
be
their
natural


bent
,
and
would
have
be
evoke
by
anybody
else
,
if
I
have
leave
they


slumber
.
but
Herbert
's
be
a
very
different
case
,
and
it
often
cause


I
a
twinge
to
think
that
I
have
do
he
evil
service
in
crowd
his


sparely
furnish
chamber
with
incongruous
upholstery
work
,
and
place


the
Canary
-
breast
Avenger
at
his
disposal
.


so
now
,
as
an
infallible
way
of
make
little
ease
great
ease
,
I
begin


to
contract
a
quantity
of
debt
.
I
could
hardly
begin
but
Herbert


must
begin
too
,
so
he
soon
follow
.
at
Startop
's
suggestion
,
we
put


ourselves
down
for
election
into
a
club
call
the
finch
of
the
Grove
:


the
object
of
which
institution
I
have
never
divine
,
if
it
be
not


that
the
member
should
dine
expensively
once
a
fortnight
,
to
quarrel


among
themselves
as
much
as
possible
after
dinner
,
and
to
cause
six


waiter
to
get
drunk
on
the
stair
.
I
know
that
these
gratify
social


end
be
so
invariably
accomplish
,
that
Herbert
and
I
understand


nothing
else
to
be
refer
to
in
the
first
stand
toast
of
the


society
:
which
run
"
Gentlemen
,
may
the
present
promotion
of
good
feeling


ever
reign
predominant
among
the
finch
of
the
Grove
.
"


the
finch
spend
their
money
foolishly
 
the
Hotel
we
dine
at
be


in
Covent
Garden
,
and
the
first
Finch
I
see
when
I
have
the
honor
of


join
the
Grove
be
Bentley
Drummle
,
at
that
time
flounder
about


town
in
a
cab
of
his
own
,
and
do
a
great
deal
of
damage
to
the
post


at
the
street
corner
.
occasionally
,
he
shoot
himself
out
of
his
equipage


headforemost
over
the
apron
;
and
I
see
he
on
one
occasion
deliver


himself
at
the
door
of
the
Grove
in
this
unintentional
way
-
like
coal
.


but
here
I
anticipate
a
little
,
for
I
be
not
a
Finch
,
and
could
not
be
,


accord
to
the
sacred
law
of
the
society
,
until
I
come
of
age
.


in
my
confidence
in
my
own
resource
,
I
would
willingly
have
take


Herbert
's
expense
on
myself
;
but
Herbert
be
proud
,
and
I
could
make


no
such
proposal
to
he
.
so
he
get
into
difficulty
in
every
direction
,


and
continue
to
look
about
he
.
when
we
gradually
fall
into
keep


late
hour
and
late
company
,
I
notice
that
he
look
about
he
with
a


despond
eye
at
breakfast
-
time
;
that
he
begin
to
look
about
he
more


hopefully
about
mid
-
day
;
that
he
droop
when
he
come
into
dinner
;


that
he
seem
to
descry
capital
in
the
distance
,
rather
clearly
,
after


dinner
;
that
he
all
but
realize
Capital
towards
midnight
;
and
that
at


about
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
he
become
so
deeply
despondent
again


as
to
talk
of
buy
a
rifle
and
go
to
America
,
with
a
general


purpose
of
compelling
buffalo
to
make
his
fortune
.


I
be
usually
at
Hammersmith
about
half
the
week
,
and
when
I
be
at


hammersmith
I
haunt
Richmond
,
whereof
separately
by
and
by
.
Herbert


would
often
come
to
Hammersmith
when
I
be
there
,
and
I
think
at
those


season
his
father
would
occasionally
have
some
pass
perception
that


the
opening
he
be
look
for
,
have
not
appear
yet
.
but
in
the
general


tumble
up
of
the
family
,
his
tumble
out
in
life
somewhere
,
be


a
thing
to
transact
itself
somehow
.
in
the
meantime
Mr.
Pocket
grow


grayer
,
and
try
oftener
to
lift
himself
out
of
his
perplexity
by
the


hair
.
while
Mrs.
Pocket
trip
up
the
family
with
her
footstool
,
read


her
book
of
dignity
,
lose
her
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
tell
we
about
she


grandpapa
,
and
teach
the
young
idea
how
to
shoot
,
by
shoot
it
into


bed
whenever
it
attract
her
notice
.


as
I
be
now
generalize
a
period
of
my
life
with
the
object
of
clear


my
way
before
I
,
I
can
scarcely
do
so
well
than
by
at
once
complete


the
description
of
our
usual
manner
and
custom
at
Barnard
's
Inn
.


we
spend
as
much
money
as
we
could
,
and
get
as
little
for
it
as
people


could
make
up
their
mind
to
give
we
.
we
be
always
more
or
less


miserable
,
and
most
of
our
acquaintance
be
in
the
same
condition
.


there
be
a
gay
fiction
among
we
that
we
be
constantly
enjoy


ourselves
,
and
a
skeleton
truth
that
we
never
do
.
to
the
good
of
my


belief
,
our
case
be
in
the
last
aspect
a
rather
common
one
.


every
morning
,
with
an
air
ever
new
,
Herbert
go
into
the
City
to
look


about
he
.
I
often
pay
he
a
visit
in
the
dark
back
-
room
in
which


he
consort
with
an
ink
-
jar
,
a
hat
-
peg
,
a
coal
-
box
,
a
string
-
box
,
an


almanac
,
a
desk
and
stool
,
and
a
ruler
;
and
I
do
not
remember
that
I


ever
see
he
do
anything
else
but
look
about
he
.
if
we
all
do
what


we
undertake
to
do
,
as
faithfully
as
Herbert
do
,
we
might
live
in
a


Republic
of
the
virtue
.
he
have
nothing
else
to
do
,
poor
fellow
,
except


at
a
certain
hour
of
every
afternoon
to
"
go
to
Lloyd
's
"
-
in
observance


of
a
ceremony
of
see
his
principal
,
I
think
.
he
never
do
anything


else
in
connection
with
Lloyd
's
that
I
could
find
out
,
except
come
back


again
.
when
he
feel
his
case
unusually
serious
,
and
that
he
positively


must
find
an
opening
,
he
would
go
on
'
change
at
a
busy
time
,
and
walk
in


and
out
,
in
a
kind
of
gloomy
country
dance
figure
,
among
the
assemble


magnate
.
"
for
,
"
say
Herbert
to
I
,
come
home
to
dinner
on
one


of
those
special
occasion
,
"
I
find
the
truth
to
be
,
Handel
,
that
an


opening
wo
n't
 
come
to
one
,
but
one
must
go
to
it
,

so
I
have
be
.
"


if
we
have
be
less
attached
to
one
another
,
I
think
we
must
have
hate


one
another
regularly
every
morning
.
I
detest
the
chamber
beyond


expression
at
that
period
of
repentance
,
and
could
not
endure
the


sight
of
the
Avenger
's
livery
;
which
have
a
more
expensive
and
a


less
remunerative
appearance
then
than
at
any
other
time
in
the


four
-
and
-
twenty
hour
.
as
we
get
more
and
more
into
debt
,
breakfast


become
a
hollower
and
hollower
form
,
and
,
be
on
one
occasion
at


breakfast
-
time
threaten
 
by
letter
 
with
legal
proceeding

not

my
local
paper
might
put
it

I
go
so
far
as
to
seize
the
Avenger
by
his
blue
collar
and
shake


he
off
his
foot
,
-
so
that
he
be
actually
in
the
air
,
like
a
boot


Cupid

for
presuming
to
suppose
that
we
want
a
roll
.


at
certain
time
-
meaning
at
uncertain
time
,
for
they
depend
on
our


humor

I
would
say
to
Herbert
,
as
if
it
be
a
remarkable
discovery
,
-


"

dear
Herbert

"


"
my
dear

"
Herbert
would
say
to
I
,
in
all
sincerity
,
if
you
will


believe
I
,
those
very
word
be
on
my
lip
,
by
a
strange
coincidence
.
"


"
then
,
Herbert
,
"
I
would
respond
,
"
let
we
look
into
out
affair
.
"


we
always
derive
profound
satisfaction
from
make
an
appointment
for


this
purpose
.
I
always
think
this
be
business
,
this
be
the
way
to


confront
the
thing
,
this
be
the
way
to
take
the
foe
by
the
throat
.
and


I
know
Herbert
think
so
too
.


we
order
something
rather
special
for
dinner
,
with
a
bottle
of


something
similarly
out
of
the
common
way
,
in
order
that
our
mind
might


be
fortify
for
the
occasion
,
and
we
might
come
well
up
to
the
mark
.


dinner
over
,
we
produce
a
bundle
of
pen
,
a
copious
supply
of
ink
,
and


a
goodly
show
of
writing
and
blotting
paper
.
for
there
be
something


very
comfortable
in
have
plenty
of
stationery
.


I
would
then
take
a
sheet
of
paper
,
and
write
across
the
top
of
it
,
in
a


neat
hand
,
the
heading
,
"
Memorandum
of
Pip
's
debt
"
;
with
Barnard
's
Inn


and
the
date
very
carefully
add
.
Herbert
would
also
take
a
sheet
of


paper
,
and
write
across
it
with
similar
formality
,
"
Memorandum
of


Herbert
's
debt
.
"


each
of
we
would
then
refer
to
a
confused
heap
of
paper
at
his
side
,


which
have
be
throw
into
drawer
,
wear
into
hole
in
pocket
,
half


burn
in
lighting
candle
,
stick
for
week
into
the
look

glass
,
and


otherwise
damage
.
the
sound
of
our
pen
going
refresh
we
exceedingly
,


insomuch
that
I
sometimes
find
it
difficult
to
distinguish
between
this


edify
business
proceeding
and
actually
pay
the
money
.
in
point
of


meritorious
character
,
the
two
thing
seem
about
equal
.


when
we
have
write
a
little
while
,
I
would
ask
Herbert
how
he
get
on
?


Herbert
probably
would
have
be
scratch
his
head
in
a
most
rueful


manner
at
the
sight
of
his
accumulate
figure
.


"
they
be
mount
up
,
Handel
,
"
Herbert
would
say
;
"
upon
my
life
,
they


be
mount
up
.
"


"
be
firm
,
Herbert
,
"
I
would
retort
,
ply
my
own
pen
with
great


assiduity
.
"
look
the
thing
in
the
face
.
look
into
your
affair
.
Stare


they
out
of
countenance

"


"
so
I
would
,
Handel
,
only
they
be
stare
I
out
of
countenance
.
"


however
,
my
determined
manner
would
have
its
effect
,
and
Herbert
would


fall
to
work
again
.
after
a
time
he
would
give
up
once
more
,
on
the
plea


that
he
have
not
get
Cobbs
's
bill
,
or
Lobbs
's
,
or
Nobbs
be
,
as
the
case


might
be
.


"
then
,
Herbert
,
estimate
;
estimate
it
in
round
number
,
and
put
it


down
.
"


"
what
a
fellow
of
resource
you
be
!
"
my
friend
would
reply
,
with


admiration
.
"
really
your
business
power
be
very
remarkable
.
"


I
think
so
too
.
I
establish
with
myself
,
on
these
occasion
,


the
reputation
of
a
first

rate
man
of
business
,

prompt
,
decisive
,


energetic
,
clear

I
have
get
all
my
responsibility


down
upon
my
list
,
I
compare
each
with
the
bill
,
and
tick
it
off
.
my


self

approval
when
I
tick
an
entry
be
quite
a
luxurious
sensation
.


when
I
have
no
more
tick
to
make
,
I
fold
all
my
bill
up
uniformly
,


docket
each
on
the
back
,
and
tie
the
whole
into
a
symmetrical


bundle
.
then
I
do
the
same
for
Herbert
 
who
modestly
say
he
have
not
my


administrative
genius
,
and
feel
that
I
have
bring
his
affair
into
a


focus
for
he
.


my
business
habit
have
one
other
bright
feature
,
which
I
call
"
leave


a
Margin
.
"
for
example
;
suppose
Herbert
's
debt
to
be
one
hundred
and


sixty
-
four
pound
four
-
and
-
twopence
,
I
would
say
,
"
leave
a
margin

and


put
they
down
at
two
hundred

"
or
,
suppose
my
own
to
be
four
time
as


much
,
I
would
leave
a
margin
,
and
put
they
down
at
seven
hundred
.
I
have


the
high
opinion
of
the
wisdom
of
this
same
Margin
,
but
I
be
bind


to
acknowledge
that
on
look
back
,
I
deem
it
to
have
be
an
expensive


device
.
for
,
we
always
run
into
new
debt
immediately
,
to
the
full
extent


of
the
margin
,
and
sometimes
,
in
the
sense
of
freedom
and
solvency
it


imparted
,
get
pretty
far
on
into
another
margin
.


but
there
be
a
calm
,
a
rest
,
a
virtuous
hush
,
consequent
on
these


examination
of
our
affair
that
give
I
,
for
the
time
,
an
admirable


opinion
of
myself
.
soothe
by
my
exertion
,
my
method
,
and
Herbert
's


compliment
,
I
would
sit
with
his
symmetrical
bundle
and
my
own
on
the


table
before
I
among
the
stationary
,
and
feel
like
a
Bank
of
some
sort
,


rather
than
a
private
individual
.


we
shut
our
outer
door
on
these
solemn
occasion
,
in
order
that
we
might


not
be
interrupt
.
I
have
fall
into
my
serene
state
one
evening
,
when


we
hear
a
letter
drop
through
the
slit
in
the
said
door
,
and
fall
on


the
ground
.
"
it
be
for
you

Handel

say
Herbert
,
go
out
and
come


back
with
it
,
"
and
I
hope
there
be
nothing
the
matter

"
this
be
in


allusion
to
its
heavy
black
seal
and
border
.


the
letter
be
sign
Trabb

,
and
its
content
be
simply
,
that


I
be
an
honored
sir
,
and
that
they
beg
to
inform
I
that
Mrs.

have
depart
this
life
on
Monday

past

evening

that
my
attendance

it
be
the
first
time
that
a
grave
have
open
in
my
road
of
life
,
and


the
gap
it
make
in
the
smooth
ground
be
wonderful
.
the
figure
of
my


sister
in
her
chair
by
the
kitchen
fire
,
haunt
I
night
and
day
.
that


the
place
could
possibly
be
,
without
she
,
be
something
my
mind
seem


unable
to
compass
;
and
whereas
she
have
seldom
or
never
be
in
my


thought
of
late
,
I
have
now
the
strange
idea
that
she
be
come


towards
I
in
the
street
,
or
that
she
would
presently
knock
at
the
door
.


in
my
room
too
,
with
which
she
have
never
be
at
all
associate
,
there


be
at
once
the
blankness
of
death
and
a
perpetual
suggestion
of
the


sound
of
her
voice
or
the
turn
of
her
face
or
figure
,
as
if
she
be


still
alive
and
have
be
often
there
.


whatever
my
fortune
might
have
be
,
I
could
scarcely
have
recall
my


sister
with
much
tenderness
.
but
I
suppose
there
be
a
shock
of
regret


which
may
exist
without
much
tenderness
.
under
its
influence
 
and


perhaps
to
make
up
for
the
want
of
the
soft
feeling
 
I
be
seize
with


a
violent
indignation
against
the
assailant
from
whom
she
have
suffer


so
much
;
and
I
feel
that
on
sufficient
proof
I
could
have
revengefully


pursue
Orlick
,
or
any
one
else
,
to
the
last
extremity
.


having
write
to
Joe
,
to
offer
he
consolation
,
and
to
assure
he


that
I
would
come
to
the
funeral
,
I
pass
the
intermediate
day
in


the
curious
state
of
mind
I
have
glance
at
.
I
go
down
early
in
the


morning
,
and
alight
at
the
Blue
Boar
in
good
time
to
walk
over
to
the


forge
.


it
be
fine
summer
weather
again
,
and
,
as
I
walk
along
,
the
time


when
I
be
a
little
helpless
creature
,
and
my
sister
do
not
spare
I
,


vividly
return
.
but
they
return
with
a
gentle
tone
upon
they
that


soften
even
the
edge
of
Tickler
.
for
now
,
the
very
breath
of
the
bean


and
clover
whisper
to
my
heart
that
the
day
must
come
when
it
would


be
well
for
my
memory
that
other
walk
in
the
sunshine
should
be


soften
as
they
think
of
I
.


at
last
I
come
within
sight
of
the
house
,
and
see
that
Trabb
and
Co.
have


put
in
a
funereal
execution
and
take
possession
.
two
dismally
absurd


person
,
each
ostentatiously
exhibit
a
crutch

up
in
a
black


bandage
,

as
if
that
instrument
could
possibly
communicate
any
comfort


to
anybody
,

be
post
at
the
front
door
;
and
in
one
of
they
I


recognize
a
postboy

from
the
Boar
for
turn
a
young
couple


into
a
sawpit
on
their
bridal
morning
,
in
consequence
of
intoxication


render
it
necessary
for
he
to
ride
his
horse
clasp
round
the
neck


with
both

the
closed
window
of

as
I
come
up
,
one
of
the
two

postboy


knock
at
the
door

imply
that
I
be
far
too
much
exhaust
by


grief
to
have
strength
remain
to
knock
for
myself
.


another
sable
warder

a

I
into
the
good
parlor

here
,
Mr.


Trabb
have
take
unto
himself
the
good
table
,
and
have
get
all
the
leave


up

and
be

a
kind
of
black
Bazaar
,
with
the
aid
of
a
quantity


of
black
pin
.
at
the
moment
of
my
arrival
,
he
have
just
finish
put


somebody

have

to
Biddy

I
think
it
not
a

for

I
go

sit
down
near
Joe

there
begin
to

in
what
part

the
air

faint
with
the
smell
of
sweet

I
look


about
for
the
table
of
refreshment

it
be
scarcely
visible
until
one


have
got
accustom
to

there

a

become
conscious

delicate
attention

my
streaming
hatband
,
and
smooth


my
cloak
.
my
thought
be
far
distract
by
the
excessive
pride
of


Mr.
and
Mrs.
Hubble
,
who
be
surpassingly
conceited
and
vainglorious
in


be
member
of
so
distinguish
a
procession
.


and
now
the
range
of
marsh
lie
clear
before
we
,
with
the
sail
of
the


ship
on
the
river
grow
out
of
it
;
and
we
go
into
the
churchyard
,


close
to
the
grave
of
my
unknown
parent
,
Philip
Pirrip
,
late
of
this


parish
,
and
also
Georgiana
,
Wife
of
the
Above
.
and
there
,
my
sister
be


lay
quietly
in
the
earth
,
while
the
lark
sing
high
above
it
,
and
the


light
wind
strew
it
with
beautiful
shadow
of
cloud
and
tree
.


of
the
conduct
of
the
worldly
minded
Pumblechook
while
this
be
do
,


I
desire
to
say
no
more
than
it
be
all
address
to
I
;
and
that
even


when
those
noble
passage
be
read
which
remind
humanity
how
it
bring


nothing
into
the
world
and
can
take
nothing
out
,
and
how
it
fleeth
like


a
shadow
and
never
continueth
long
in
one
stay
,
I
hear
he
cough
a


reservation
of
the
case
of
a
young
gentleman
who
come
unexpectedly
into


large
property
.
when
we
get
back
,
he
have
the
hardihood
to
tell
I
that


he
wish
my
sister
could
have
know
I
have
do
she
so
much
honor
,
and


to
hint
that
she
would
have
consider
it
reasonably
purchase
at
the


price
of
her
death
.
after
that
,
he
drink
all
the
rest
of
the
sherry
,


and
Mr.
Hubble
drink
the
port
,
and
the
two
talk
 
which
I
have
since


observe
to
be
customary
in
such
case
 
as
if
they
be
of
quite
another


race
from
the
deceased
,
and
be
notoriously
immortal
.
finally
,
he
go


away
with
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Hubble
,
-
to
make
an
evening
of
it
,
I
feel
sure
,


and
to
tell
the
Jolly
Bargemen
that
he
be
the
founder
of
my
fortune


and
my
early
benefactor
.


when
they
be
all
go
,
and
when
Trabb
and
his
man
-
but
not
his
boy
;
I


look
for
he
-
have
cram
their
mummery
into
bag
,
and
be
go
too
,


the
house
feel
wholesomer
.
soon
afterwards
,
Biddy
,
Joe
,
and
I
,
have
a


cold
dinner
together
;
but
we
dine
in
the
good
parlor
,
not
in
the
old


kitchen
,
and
Joe
be
so
exceedingly
particular
what
he
do
with
his


knife
and
fork
and
the
saltcellar
and
what
not
,
that
there
be
great


restraint
upon
we
.
but
after
dinner
,
when
I
make
he
take
his
pipe
,


and
when
I
have
loiter
with
he
about
the
forge
,
and
when
we
sit
down


together
on
the
great
block
of
stone
outside
it
,
we
get
on
well
.
I


notice
that
after
the
funeral
Joe
change
his
clothe
so
far
,
as
to


make
a
compromise
between
his
Sunday
dress
and
working
dress
;
in
which


the
dear
fellow
look
natural
,
and
like
the
man
he
be
.


he
be
very
much
pleased
by
my
asking
if
I
might
sleep
in
my
own
little


room
,
and
I
be
pleased
too
;
for
I
feel
that
I
have
do
rather
a
great


thing
in
make
the
request
.
when
the
shadow
of
evening
be
close


in
,
I
take
an
opportunity
of
get
into
the
garden
with
Biddy
for
a


little
talk
.


"
Biddy

say
I

at

up

still

quiet
conviction

Biddy

in
,
with
a
momentary


flush
upon
her

further

glow

Herbert
and
I
go
on
from
bad
to
bad
,
in
the
way
of
increase
our


debt
,

into
our
affair

Margins

a
way
of

;


and
I
come
of
age
,
-
in
fulfilment
of
Herbert
's
prediction
,
that
I
should


do
so
before
I
know
where
I
be
.


Herbert
himself
have
come
of
age
eight
month
before
I
.
as
he
have


nothing
else
than
his
majority
to
come
into
,
the
event
do
not
make
a


profound
sensation
in
Barnard
's
Inn
.
but
we
have
look
forward
to


my
one
-
and
-
twentieth
birthday
,
with
a
crowd
of
speculation
and


anticipation
,
for
we
have
both
consider
that
my
guardian
could
hardly


help
say
something
definite
on
that
occasion
.


I
have
take
care
to
have
it
well
understand
in
little
Britain
when
my


birthday
be
.
on
the
day
before
it
,
I
receive
an
official
note
from


wemmick
,
inform
I
that
Mr.
Jaggers
would
be
glad
if
I
would
call


upon
he
at
five
in
the
afternoon
of
the
auspicious
day
.
this
convince


we
that
something
great
be
to
happen
,
and
throw
I
into
an
unusual


flutter
when
I
repair
to
my
guardian
's
office
,
a
model
of
punctuality
.


in
the
outer
office
Wemmick
offer
I
his
congratulation
,
and


incidentally
rub
the
side
of
his
nose
with
a
folded
piece
of


tissue
-
paper
that
I
like
the
look
of
.
but
he
say
nothing
respect


it
,
and
motion
I
with
a
nod
into
my
guardian
's
room

it

November
,

as

a


stupid
apoplectic
attempt

attend

the
conversation

I
withdraw
my
eye
,

look


thoughtfully
at
the
floor
.
from
this
last
speech
I
derive
the
notion


that
Miss
Havisham
,
for
some
reason

no
reason
,
have
not
take
he

he
resent


this

feel
a
jealousy
about
it

that
he
really
do
object
to


that
scheme
,

would
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
.
when
I
raise
my
eye


again
,
I
find
that
he
have
be
shrewdly
look
at
I
all
the
time

do
so
still

he
nod
assent
,

pull
out
his
thief

watch
,

ask
I


where
I
be
go
to
dine

I
reply
at
my
own
chamber
,
with
Herbert
.


as
a
necessary
sequence
,
I
ask
he
if
he
would
favor
we
with
his


company
,

he
promptly
accept
the
invitation
.

he
insist
on


walk
home
with
I

order
that
I
might
make
no
extra
preparation

he
have
a
letter

two
to
write
,

of
course
 
have


his
hand

I
say
I
would
go
into
the
outer
office

talk


to
Wemmick
.


the
fact
be
,
that
when
the
five
hundred
pound
have
come
into
my
pocket
,


a
thought
have
come
into
my
head

have
be
often
there
before

"
and
we
both
go
out
to
the


drawbridge
.


it
be
worth
any
money
to
see
Wemmick
wave
a
salute
to
I
from
the


other
side
of
the
moat
,
when
we
might
have
shake
hand
across
it
with


the
great
ease
.
the
Aged
be
so
delighted
to
work
the
drawbridge

I
make
no

quiet

Miss
Skiffins

of
a
wooden
appearance

be
,
like
her
escort
,
in


the

she
might
have
be
some
two

three
year
young
than
Wemmick
,
and
I
judge
she
to
stand
possess


of
portable
property
.
the
cut
of
her
dress
from
the
waist
upward
,
both


before
and
behind
,
make
her
figure
very
like
a
boy
's
kite
;
and
I
might


have
pronounce
she
gown
a
little
too
decidedly
orange
,
and
her
glove
a


little
too
intensely
green
.
but
she
seem
to
be
a
good
sort
of
fellow

show
a
high
regard
for
the

a
walk
with

round
the
property

see
how
the
island
look
in
wintertime
.
think
that
he
do
this


to
give
I
an
opportunity
of
take
his
walworth
sentiment
,
I
seize


the
opportunity
as
soon
as
we
be
out
of
the
Castle
.


having
think
of
the
matter
with
care
,
I
approach
my
subject
as
if
I


have
never
hint
at
it
before
.
I
inform
Wemmick
that
I
be
anxious
in


behalf
of
Herbert
Pocket
,
and
I
tell
he
how
we
have
first
meet
,
and
how


we
have
fight
.
I
glance
at
Herbert
's
home
,
and
at
his
character
,
and


at
his
have
no
means
but
such
as
he
be
dependent
on
his
father
for
;


those
,
uncertain
and
unpunctual
.
I
allude
to
the
advantage
I
have


derive
in
my
first
rawness
and
ignorance
from
his
society
,
and
I


confess
that
I
fear
I
have
but
ill
repay
they
,
and
that
he
might


have
do
well
without
I
and
my
expectation
.
keep
Miss
Havisham


in
the
background
at
a
great
distance
,
I
still
hint
at
the
possibility


of
my
having
compete
with
he
in
his
prospect
,
and
at
the
certainty
of


his
possess
a
generous
soul
,
and
be
far
above
any
mean
distrust
,


retaliation
,
or
design
.
for
all
these
reason
 
I
tell
Wemmick
,


and
because
he
be
my
young
companion
and
friend
,
and
I
have
a
great


affection
for
he
,
I
wish
my
own
good
fortune
to
reflect
some
ray


upon
he
,
and
therefore
I
seek
advice
from
Wemmick
's
experience
and


knowledge
of
man
and
affair
,
how
I
could
well
try
with
my
resource
to


help
Herbert
to
some
present
income
,
-
say
of
a
hundred
a
year
,
to
keep


he
in
good
hope
and
heart
,
-
and
gradually
to
buy
he
on
to
some
small


partnership
.
I
beg
Wemmick
,
in
conclusion
,
to
understand
that
my
help


must
always
be
render
without
Herbert
's
knowledge
or
suspicion
,
and


that
there
be
no
one
else
in
the
world
with
whom
I
could
advise
.
I


wound
up
by
lay
my
hand
upon
his
shoulder
,
and
say
,
"
I
ca

Wemmick
be
silent
for
a
little
while
,

then

with
a
kind
of


start

'll

it

be
mention
that
there


be
newgate
cobwebs
about

it
brush
they
away

"


after
a
little
further
conversation
to
the
same
effect
,
we
return
into


the
Castle
where
we
find
Miss
Skiffins
prepare
tea
.
the
responsible


duty
of
make
the
toast
be
delegate
to
the
Aged
,
and
that
excellent


old
gentleman
be
so
intent
upon
it
that
he
seem
to
I
in
some
danger


of
melt
his
eye
.
it
be
no
nominal
meal
that
we
be
go
to
make
,


but
a
vigorous
reality
.
the
Aged
prepare
such
a
hay
-
stack
of
butter


toast
,
that
I
could
scarcely
see
he
over
it
as
it
simmer
on
an
iron


stand
hook
on
to
the
top
-
bar
;
while
Miss
Skiffins
brew
such
a
jorum


of
tea
,
that
the
pig
in
the
back
premise
become
strongly
excited
,
and


repeatedly
express
his
desire
to
participate
in
the
entertainment
.


the
flag
have
be
strike
,
and
the
gun
have
be
fire
,
at
the
right


moment
of
time
,
and
I
feel
as
snugly
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
Walworth


as
if
the
moat
be
thirty
foot
wide
by
as
many
deep
.
nothing
disturb


the
tranquillity
of
the
Castle
,
but
the
occasional
tumbling
open
of


John
and
Miss
skiffin
:
which
little
door
be
a
prey
to
some
spasmodic


infirmity
that
make
I
sympathetically
uncomfortable
until
I
got
use


to
it
.
I
infer
from
the
methodical
nature
of
Miss
Skiffins
's


arrangement
that
she
make
tea
there
every
Sunday
night
;
and
I
rather


suspect
that
a
classic
brooch
she
wear
,
represent
the
profile
of
an


undesirable
female
with
a
very
straight
nose
and
a
very
new
moon
,
be
a


piece
of
portable
property
that
have
be
give
she
by
Wemmick
.


we
eat
the
whole
of
the
toast
,
and
drink
tea
in
proportion
,
and
it
be


delightful
to
see
how
warm
and
greasy
we
all
get
after
it
.
the
Aged


especially
,
might
have
pass
for
some
clean
old
chief
of
a
savage


tribe
,
just
oil
.
after
a
short
pause
of
repose
,
Miss
Skiffins
-
in
the


absence
of
the
little
servant
who
,
it
seem
,
retire
to
the
bosom
of


her
family
on
Sunday
afternoon

wash
up
the

thing
,
in
a
trifling


lady

amateur
manner

compromise
none

then
,
she
put
on


her
glove
again

we
drew
round
the
fire

that

the

infinite


satisfaction

with
the
pleasanter
peculiarity
that
it
seem
to
come


through
a
keyhole
.
as
he
want
the
candle
close
to
he

and
as
he
be


always
on
the

put
either
his
head

the
newspaper
into

he
require
as
much
watch
as
a
powder

mill
.
but
Wemmick
be


equally
untiring
and
gentle
in
his
vigilance
,
and
the
Aged
read
on
,


quite
unconscious
of
his
many
rescue
.
whenever
he
look
at
we
,
we


all
express
the
great
interest
and
amazement
,
and
nod
until
he


resume
again
.


as
Wemmick
and
Miss
Skiffins
sit
side
by
side
,
and
as
I
sit
in
a
shadowy


corner
,
I
observe
a
slow
and
gradual
elongation
of
Mr.
Wemmick
's
mouth
,


powerfully
suggestive
of
his
slowly
and
gradually
steal
his
arm
round


Miss
Skiffins
's
waist
.
in
course
of
time
I
see
his
hand
appear
on
the


other
side
of
Miss
Skiffins
;
but
at
that
moment
Miss
Skiffins
neatly


stop
he
with
the
green
glove
,
unwound
his
arm
again
as
if
it
be


an
article
of
dress
,
and
with
the
great
deliberation
lay
it
on
the


table
before
she
.
Miss
Skiffins
's
composure
while
she
do
this
be
one


of
the
most
remarkable
sight
I
have
ever
see
,
and
if
I
could
have


think
the
act
consistent
with
abstraction
of
mind
,
I
should
have


deem
that
Miss
Skiffins
perform
it
mechanically
.


by
and
by
,
I
notice
Wemmick
's
arm
begin
to
disappear
again
,
and


gradually
fade
out
of
view
.
shortly
afterwards
,
his
mouth
begin
to


widen
again
.
after
an
interval
of
suspense
on
my
part
that
be
quite


enthral
and
almost
painful
,
I
see
his
hand
appear
on
the
other
side


of
Miss
Skiffins
.
instantly
,
Miss
Skiffins
stop
it
with
the
neatness


of
a
placid
boxer
,
take
off
that
girdle
or
cestus
as
before
,
and
lay


it
on
the
table
.
take
the
table
to
represent
the
path
of
virtue
,
I
be


justify
in
state
that
during
the
whole
time
of
the
Aged
's
reading
,


Wemmick
's
arm
be
stray
from
the
path
of
virtue
and
be
recall
to


it
by
Miss
Skiffins
.


at
last
,
the
Aged
read
himself
into
a
light
slumber
.
this
be
the
time


for
Wemmick
to
produce
a
little
kettle
,
a
tray
of
glass
,
and
a


black
bottle
with
a
porcelain
-
top
cork
,
represent
some
clerical


dignitary
of
a
rubicund
and
social
aspect
.
with
the
aid
of
these


appliance
we
all
have
something
warm
to
drink
,
include
the
Aged
,
who


be
soon
awake
again
.
Miss
skiffin
mix
,
and
I
observe
that
she
and


Wemmick
drink
out
of
one
glass
.
of
course
I
know
well
than
to
offer
to


see
Miss
Skiffins
home
,
and
under
the
circumstance
I
think
I
have
good


go
first
;
which
I
do
,
take
a
cordial
leave
of
the
Aged
,
and
have


pass
a
pleasant
evening
.


before
a
week
be
out
,
I
receive
a
note
from
Wemmick
,
date
Walworth
,


state
that
he
hope
he
have
make
some
advance
in
that
matter


appertain
to
our
private
and
personal
capacity
,
and
that
he
would


be
glad
if
I
could
come
and
see
he
again
upon
it
.
so
,
I
go
out


to
Walworth
again
,
and
yet
again
,
and
yet
again
,
and
I
see
he
by


appointment
in
the
City
several
time
,
but
never
hold
any
communication


with
he
on
the
subject
in
or
near
Little
Britain
.
the
upshot
be
,


that
we
find
a
worthy
young
merchant
or
shipping
-
broker
,
not
long


establish
in
business
,
who
want
intelligent
help
,
and
who
want


capital
,
and
who
in
due
course
of
time
and
receipt
would
want
a
partner
.


between
he
and
I
,
secret
article
be
sign
of
which
Herbert
be
the


subject
,
and
I
pay
he
half
of
my
five
hundred
pound
down
,
and
engage


for
sundry
other
payment
:
some
,
to
fall
due
at
certain
date
out
of
my


income
:
some
,
contingent
on
my
come
into
my
property
.
Miss
Skiffins
's


brother
conduct
the
negotiation
.
Wemmick
pervade
it
throughout
,
but


never
appear
in
it
.


the
whole
business
be
so
cleverly
manage
,
that
Herbert
have
not
the


least
suspicion
of
my
hand
be
in
it
.
I
never
shall
forget
the
radiant


face
with
which
he
come
home
one
afternoon
,
and
tell
I
,
as
a
mighty


piece
of
news
,
of
his
having
fall
in
with
one
Clarriker
 
the
young


merchant
's
name
,
and
of
Clarriker
's
having
show
an
extraordinary


inclination
towards
he
,
and
of
his
belief
that
the
opening
have
come
at


last
.
day
by
day
as
his
hope
grow
strong
and
his
face
brighter
,
he


must
have
think
I
a
more
and
more
affectionate
friend
,
for
I
have
the


great
difficulty
in
restrain
my
tear
of
triumph
when
I
see
he
so


happy
.
at
length
,
the
thing
be
do
,
and
he
have
that
day
enter


Clarriker
's
House
,
and
he
having
talk
to
I
for
a
whole
evening
in
a


flush
of
pleasure
and
success
,
I
do
really
cry
in
good
earnest
when


I
go
to
bed
,
to
think
that
my
expectation
have
do
some
good
to


somebody
.


a
great
event
in
my
life
,
the
turning
point
of
my
life
,
now
open
on
my


view
.
but
,
before
I
proceed
to
narrate
it
,
and
before
I
pass
on
to
all


the
change
it
involve
,
I
must
give
one
chapter
to
Estella
.
it
be
not


much
to
give
to
the
theme
that
so
long
fill
my
heart
.

familiarity

,
under
the
circumstance


an
aggravation
of
my

I
think
it

"


"

the

after

morrow

if
you
please

you

all

"

say
i.


this
be
all
the
preparation
I
receive
for
that
visit
,
or
for
other


like
it
;
Miss
Havisham
never
write
to
I
,
nor
have
I
ever
so
much
as
see


her
handwriting
.
we
go
down
on
the
next
day
but
one
,
and
we
find
she


in
the
room
where
I
have
first
beheld
she
,
and
it
be
needless
to
add
that


there
be
no
change
in
Satis
House
.


she
be
even
more
dreadfully
fond
of
Estella
than
she
have
be
when


I
last
see
they
together
;
I
repeat
the
word
advisedly
,
for
there
be


something
positively
dreadful
in
the
energy
of
her
look
and
embrace
.


she
hang
upon
Estella
's
beauty
,
hang
upon
her
word
,
hang
upon
she


gesture
,
and
sit
mumble
her
own
tremble
finger
while
she
look
at


she
,
as
though
she
be
devour
the
beautiful
creature
she
have
rear
.


from
Estella
she
look
at
I
,
with
a
search
glance
that
seem
to


pry
into
my
heart
and
probe
its
wound
.
"
how
do
she
use
you
,
Pip
;
how


do
she
use
you
?
"
she
ask
I
again
,
with
her
witch
-
like
eagerness
,


even
in
Estella
's
hearing
.
but
,
when
we
sit
by
her
flickering
fire


at
night
,
she
be
most
weird
;
for
then
,
keep
Estella
's
hand
draw


through
her
arm
and
clutch
in
her
own
hand
,
she
extort
from
she
,


by
dint
of
refer
back
to
what
Estella
have
tell
she
in
her
regular


letter
,
the
name
and
condition
of
the
man
whom
she
have
fascinate
;


and
as
Miss
Havisham
dwell
upon
this
roll
,
with
the
intensity
of
a
mind


mortally
hurt
and
diseased
,
she
sit
with
her
other
hand
on
her
crutch


stick
,
and
her
chin
on
that
,
and
her
wan
bright
eye
glare
at
I
,
a


very
spectre
.


I
see
in
this
,
wretched
though
it
make
I
,
and
bitter
the
sense
of


dependence
and
even
of
degradation
that
it
awaken
,
-
I
see
in
this
that


Estella
be
set
to
wreak
Miss
Havisham
's
revenge
on
man
,
and
that
she


be
not
to
be
give
to
I
until
she
have
gratify
it
for
a
term
.
I
see


in
this
,
a
reason
for
her
be
beforehand
assign
to
I
.
send
she


out
to
attract
and
torment
and
do
mischief
,
Miss
Havisham
send
she
with


the
malicious
assurance
that
she
be
beyond
the
reach
of
all
admirer
,


and
that
all
who
stake
upon
that
cast
be
secure
to
lose
.
I
see
in


this
that
I
,
too
,
be
torment
by
a
perversion
of
ingenuity
,
even
while


the
prize
be
reserve
for
I
.
I
see
in
this
the
reason
for
my
being


stave
off
so
long
and
the
reason
for
my
late
guardian
's
decline
to


commit
himself
to
the
formal
knowledge
of
such
a
scheme
.
in
a
word
,
I


see
in
this
Miss
Havisham
as
I
have
she
then
and
there
before
my
eye
,


and
always
have
have
she
before
my
eye
;
and
I
see
in
this
,
the
distinct


shadow
of
the
darkened
and
unhealthy
house
in
which
her
life
be
hide


from
the
sun
.


the
candle
that
light
that
room
of
hers
be
place
in
sconce
on


the
wall
.
they
be
high
from
the
ground
,
and
they
burn
with
the
steady


dulness
of
artificial
light
in
air
that
be
seldom
renew
.
as
I
look


round
at
they
,
and
at
the
pale
gloom
they
make
,
and
at
the
stop


clock
,
and
at
the
withered
article
of
bridal
dress
upon
the
table
and


the
ground
,
and
at
her
own
awful
figure
with
its
ghostly
reflection


throw
large
by
the
fire
upon
the
ceiling
and
the
wall
,
I
see
in


everything
the
construction
that
my
mind
have
come
to
,
repeat
and


throw
back
to
I
.
my
thought
pass
into
the
great
room
across
the


land
where
the
table
be
spread
,
and
I
see
it
write
,
as
it
be
,
in


the
fall
of
the
cobwebs
from
the
centre
-
piece
,
in
the
crawling
of
the


spider
on
the
cloth
,
in
the
track
of
the
mouse
as
they
betook
their


little
quicken
heart
behind
the
panel
,
and
in
the
groping
and


pausing
of
the
beetle
on
the
floor
.


it
happen
on
the
occasion
of
this
visit
that
some
sharp
word
arise


between
Estella
and
Miss
Havisham
.
it
be
the
first
time
I
have
ever

Estella
's
arm
draw
through
her
own
,
and
still
clutched


Estella
's
hand
in
hers
,
when
Estella
gradually
begin
to
detach
herself
.


she
have
show
a
proud
impatience
more
than
once
before
,
and
have
rather


endure
that
fierce
affection
than
accept
or
return
it
.

bridal
relic

which

strew

advantage

the
moment

seek
one
from
the

be
a
miserable
sight
to
see
.


it
be
with
a
depressed
heart
that
I
walk
in
the
starlight
for
an


hour
and
more
,
about
the
courtyard
,
and
about
the
brewery
,
and
about


the
ruin
garden

when
I
at
last
take
courage
to
return
to
the
room

I


find
Estella
sit
at
Miss
Havisham
's
knee
,
take
up
some
stitch


in
one
of
those
old
article
of
dress
that
be
drop
to
piece
,
and


of
which
I
have
often
be
remind
since
by
the
faded
tatter
of
old


banner
that
I
have
see
hang
up
in
cathedral
.
afterwards
,
Estella


and
I
play
at
card
,
as
of
yore
,
-
only
we
be
skilful
now
,
and
play


french
game
,
-
and
so
the
evening
wear
away
,
and
I
go
to
bed
.


I
lie
in
that
separate
building
across
the
courtyard
.
it
be
the
first


time
I
have
ever
lain
down
to
rest
in
Satis
House
,
and
sleep
refuse
to


come
near
I
.
a
thousand
Miss
Havishams
haunt
I
.
she
be
on
this
side


of
my
pillow
,
on
that
,
at
the
head
of
the
bed
,
at
the
foot
,
behind
the


half

open
door

room

room
,
in
the
room


overhead
,
in
the
room
beneath
,
-
everywhere
.
at
last
,
when
the
night
be


slow
to
creep
on
towards
two
o'clock
,
I
feel
that
I
absolutely
could
no


long
bear
the
place
as
a
place
to
lie
down
in
,
and
that
I
must
get
up
.


I
therefore
get
up
and
put
on
my
clothe
,
and
go
out
across
the
yard


into
the
long
stone
passage
,
design
to
gain
the
outer
courtyard
and


walk
there
for
the
relief
of
my
mind
.
but
I
be
no
soon
in
the
passage


than
I
extinguish
my
candle
;
for
I
see
Miss
Havisham
go
along
it


in
a
ghostly
manner
,
make
a
low
cry
.
I
follow
she
at
a
distance
,


and
see
she
go
up
the
staircase
.
she
carry
a
bare
candle
in
her
hand
,


which
she
have
probably
take
from
one
of
the
sconce
in
her
own
room
,


and
be
a
most
unearthly
object
by
its
light
.
stand
at
the
bottom


of
the
staircase
,
I
feel
the
mildew
air
of
the
feast
-
chamber
,
without


see
she
open
the
door
,
and
I
hear
she
walk
there
,
and
so
across


into
her
own
room
,
and
so
across
again
into
that
,
never
cease
the
low


cry
.
after
a
time
,
I
try
in
the
dark
both
to
get
out
,
and
to
go
back
,


but
I
could
do
neither
until
some
streak
of
day
stray
in
and
show


I
where
to
lay
my
hand
.
during
the
whole
interval
,
whenever
I
go
to


the
bottom
of
the
staircase
,
I
hear
her
footstep
,
see
her
light
pass


above
,
and
hear
she
ceaseless
low
cry
.


before
we
leave
next
day
,
there
be
no
revival
of
the
difference
between


she
and
Estella
,
nor
be
it
ever
revive
on
any
similar
occasion
;
and


there
be
four
similar
occasion
,
to
the
good
of
my
remembrance
.
nor
,


do
Miss
Havisham
's
manner
towards
Estella
in
anywise
change
,
except


that
I
believe
it
to
have
something
like
fear
infuse
among
its
former


characteristic
.


it
be
impossible
to
turn
this
leaf
of
my
life
,
without
put
Bentley


Drummle
's
name
upon
it
;

I
would
,
very
gladly
.


on
a
certain
occasion

Finches

assemble
in
force

ugly

that
the
heavy


creature
be
capable

become
as
highly
incense
by
it


as

I
immediately
rise
in

place

say
that
I
could
not

regard
it
as
be
like
the
honorable


Finch
's
impudence
to
come
down
to
that
Grove

-
we
always
talk


about

down

down

nothing

Mr.

,
upon
this
,
start
up
,
demand
what
I
mean
by


that
?
Whereupon
I
make
he
the
extreme
reply
that
I
believe
he
know


where
I
be
to
be
find
.


whether
it
be
possible
in
a
christian
country
to
get
on
without
blood
,


after
this
,
be
a
question
on
which
the
Finches
be
divide
.
the
debate


upon
it
grow
so
lively
,
indeed
,
that
at
least
six
more
honorable
member


tell
six
more
,
during
the
discussion
,
that
they
believe
they
know
where


they
be
to
be
find
.
however
,
it
be
decide
at
last
 
the
grove
be


a
Court
of
Honor
 
that
if
Mr.
Drummle
would
bring
never
so
slight


a
certificate
from
the
lady
,
import
that
he
have
the
honor

she


acquaintance

Mr.

must
express
his
regret

"
having

.

next

appoint

the
production
 
lest
our
honor
should
take
cold
from


delay
,
and
next
day
Drummle
appear
with
a
polite
little
avowal
in


Estella
's
hand
,
that
she
have
have
the
honor
of
dance
with
he
several


time
.
this
leave
I
no
course
but
to
regret
that
I
have
be
"
betray


into
a
warmth
which
,
"
and
on
the
whole
to
repudiate
,
as
untenable
,
the


idea
that
I
be
to
be
find
anywhere
.
Drummle
and
I
then
sat
snort


at
one
another
for
an
hour
,
while
the
Grove
engage
in
indiscriminate


contradiction
,
and
finally
the
promotion
of
good
feeling
be
declare
to


have
go
ahead
at
an
amazing
rate
.


I
tell
this
lightly
,
but
it
be
no
light
thing
to
I
.
for
,
I
can
not


adequately
express
what
pain
it
give
I
to
think
that
Estella
should


show
any
favor
to
a
contemptible
,
clumsy
,
sulky
booby
,
so
very
far
below


the
average
.
to
the
present
moment
,
I
believe
it
to
have
be
referable


to
some
pure
fire
of
generosity
and
disinterestedness
in
my
love
for


she
,
that
I
could
not
endure
the
thought
of
she
stoop
to
that
hound
.


no
doubt
I
should
have
be
miserable
whomsoever
she
have
favor
;
but


a
worthy
object
would
have
cause
I
a
different
kind
and
degree
of


distress
.


it
be
easy
for
I
to
find
out
,
and
I
do
soon
find
out
,
that
Drummle


have
begin
to
follow
she
closely
,
and
that
she
allow
he
to
do
it
.
a


little
while
,
and
he
be
always
in
pursuit
of
she
,
and
he
and
I
cross


one
another
every
day
.
he
hold
on
,
in
a
dull
persistent
way
,
and
Estella


hold
he
on
;
now
with
encouragement
,
now
with
discouragement
,
now
almost


flatter
he
,
now
openly
despise
he
,
now
know
he
very
well
,
now


scarcely
remember
who
he
be
.


the
Spider
,
as
Mr.
Jaggers
have
call
he
,
be
use
to
lie
in
wait
,


however
,
and
have
the
patience
of
his
tribe
.
add
to
that
,
he
have
a


blockhead
confidence
in
his
money
and
in
his
family
greatness
,


which
sometimes
do
he
good
service
,
-
almost
take
the
place
of


concentration
and
determined
purpose
.
so
,
the
spider
,
doggedly
watch


Estella
,
outwatche
many
bright
insect
,
and

away

folly
make
I

roughly

ask

gratify
recognition

off
a
rough
outer
coat

furrow

silver

for
year

attract
to

by
the
strong


admiration

from

with
the


strong
repugnance

the

it


would
have
be
well
,
for
his
preservation
would
then
have
naturally


and
tenderly
address
my
heart
.


my
first
care
be
to
close
the
shutter
,
so
that
no
light
might
be
see


from
without
,
and
then
to
close
and
make
fast
the
door
.
while
I
do
so
,


he
stand
at
the
table
drinking
rum
and
eat
biscuit
;
and
when
I
see


he
thus
engage
,
I
see
my
convict
on
the
marsh
at
his
meal
again
.
it


almost
seem
to
I
as
if
he
must
stoop
down
presently
,
to
file
at
his


leg
.


when
I
have
go
into
Herbert
's
room
,
and
have
shut
off
any
other


communication
between
it
and
the
staircase
than
through
the
room
in


which
our
conversation
have
be
hold
,
I
ask
he
if
he
would
go
to
bed
?


he
say
yes
,
but
ask
I
for
some
of
my
"
gentleman
's
linen
"
to
put


on
in
the
morning
.
I
bring
it
out
,
and
lay
it
ready
for
he
,
and
my


blood
again
run
cold
when
he
again
take
I
by
both
hand
to
give
I
good


night

I
get
away
from
he
,
without
know
how
I
do
it
,
and
mend
the
fire


in
the
room
where
we
have
be
together
,
and
sit
down
by
it
,
afraid
to
go


to
bed
.
for
an
hour
or
more
,
I
remain
too
stunned
to
think
;
and
it


be
not
until
I
begin
to
think
,
that
I
begin
fully
to
know
how
wreck
I


be
,
and
how
the
ship
in
which
I
have
sail
be
go
to
piece
.


Miss
Havisham
's
intention
towards
I
,
all
a
mere
dream
;
Estella
not


design
for
I
;
I
only
suffer
in
Satis
House
as
a
convenience
,
a


ste
for
the
greedy
relation
,
a
model
with
a
mechanical
heart
to


practise
on
when
no
other
practice
be
at
hand
;
those
be
the
first


smart
I
have
.
but
,
sharp
and
deepest
pain
of
all
,
-
it
be
for
the


convict
,
guilty
of
I
know
not
what
crime
,
and
liable
to
be
take
out


of
those
room
where
I
sat
think
,
and
hang
at
the
Old
Bailey
door
,


that
I
have
desert
Joe
.


I
would
not
have
go
back
to
Joe
now
,
I
would
not
have
go
back
to


Biddy
now
,
for
any
consideration
;
simply
,
I
suppose
,
because
my
sense
of


my
own
worthless
conduct
to
they
be
great
than
every
consideration
.


no
wisdom
on
earth
could
have
give
I
the
comfort
that
I
should
have


derive
from
their
simplicity
and
fidelity
;
but
I
could
never
,
never
,


undo
what
I
have
do
.


in
every
rage
of
wind
and
rush
of
rain
,
I
hear
pursuer
.
twice
,
I
could


have
swear
there
be
a
knocking
and
whispering
at
the
outer
door
.
with


these
fear
upon
I
,
I
begin
either
to
imagine
or
recall
that
I
have
have


mysterious
warning
of
this
man
's
approach
.
that
,
for
week
go
by
,
I


have
pass
face
in
the
street
which
I
have
think
like
his
.
that
these


likeness
have
grow
more
numerous
,
as
he
,
come
over
the
sea
,
have


draw
near
.
that
his
wicked
spirit
have
somehow
send
these
messenger


to
mine
,
and
that
now
on
this
stormy
night
he
be
as
good
as
his
word
,


and
with
I
.


crowd
up
with
these
reflection
come
the
reflection
that
I
have
see


he
with
my
childish
eye
to
be
a
desperately
violent
man
;
that
I
have


hear
that
other
convict
reiterate
that
he
have
try
to
murder
he
;
that


I
have
see
he
down
in
the
ditch
tear
and
fight
like
a
wild


beast
.
out
of
such
remembrance
I
bring
into
the
light
of
the
fire
a


half
-
form
terror
that
it
might
not
be
safe
to
be
shut
up
there
with


he
in
the
dead
of
the
wild
solitary
night
.
this
dilate
until
it
fill


the
room
,
and
impel
I
to
take
a
candle
and
go
in
and
look
at
my


dreadful
burden
.


he
have
roll
a
handkerchief
round
his
head
,
and
his
face
be
set
and


lower
in
his
sleep
.
but
he
be
asleep
,
and
quietly
too
,
though
he
have


a
pistol
lie
on
the
pillow
.
assure
of
this
,
I
softly
remove
the
key


to
the
outside
of
his
door
,
and
turn
it
on
he
before
I
again
sit
down


by
the
fire
.
gradually
I
slip
from
the
chair
and
lie
on
the
floor
.


when
I
awake
without
having
part
in
my
sleep
with
the
perception
of


my
wretchedness
,
the
clock
of
the
eastward
church
be
strike
five
,


the
candle
be
waste
out
,
the
fire
be
dead
,
and
the
wind
and
rain


intensify
the
thick
black
darkness
.


this
be
the
END
of
the
second
stage
of
PIP
's
expectation
.


chapter
XL


it
be
fortunate
for
I
that
I
have
to
take
precaution
to
ensure
 
so
far


as
I
could
 
the
safety
of
my
dreaded
visitor
;
for
,
this
thought
press


on
I
when
I
awake
,
hold
other
thought
in
a
confused
concourse
at
a


distance
.


the
impossibility
of
keep
he
conceal
in
the
chamber
be


self
-
evident
.
it
could
not
be
do
,
and
the
attempt
to
do
it
would


inevitably
engender
suspicion
.
true
,
I
have
no
Avenger
in
my
service
now
,


but
I
be
look
after
by
an
inflammatory
old
female
,
assist
by
an


animate
rag
-
bag
whom
she
call
her
niece
,
and
to
keep
a
room
secret


from
they
would
be
to
invite
curiosity
and
exaggeration
.
they
both
have


weak
eye
,
which
I
have
long
attribute
to
their
chronically
look
in


at
keyhole
,
and
they
be
always
at
hand
when
not
want
;
indeed
that


be
their
only
reliable
quality
besides
larceny
.
not
to
get
up
a
mystery


with
these
people
,
I
resolve
to
announce
in
the
morning
that
my
uncle


have
unexpectedly
come
from
the
country
.


this
course
I
decide
on
while
I
be
yet
grope
about
in
the
darkness


for
the
mean
of
get
a
light
.
not
stumble
on
the
mean
after
all
,


I
be
fain
to
go
out
to
the
adjacent
Lodge
and
get
the
watchman
there
to


come
with
his
lantern
.
now
,
in
grope
my
way
down
the
black
staircase
I


fall
over
something
,
and
that
something
be
a
man
crouch
in
a
corner
.


as
the
man
make
no
answer
when
I
ask
he
what
he
do
there
,
but
elude


my
touch
in
silence
,
I
run
to
the
Lodge
and
urge
the
watchman
to
come


quickly
;
tell
he
of
the
incident
on
the
way
back
.
the
wind
be
as


fierce
as
ever
,
we
do
not
care
to
endanger
the
light
in
the
lantern
by


rekindle
the
extinguished
lamp
on
the
staircase
,
but
we
examine
the


staircase
from
the
bottom
to
the
top
and
find
no
one
there
.
it
then


occur
to
I
as
possible
that
the
man
might
have
slip
into
my


room
;
so
,
light
my
candle
at
the
watchman
's
,
and
leave
he


stand
at
the
door
,
I
examine
they
carefully
,
include
the
room
in


which
my
dread
guest
lie
asleep
.
all
be
quiet
,
and
assuredly
no
other


man
be
in
those
chamber
.


it
trouble
I
that
there
should
have
be
a
lurker
on
the
stair
,
on


that
night
of
all
night
in
the
year
,
and
I
ask
the
watchman
,
on
the


chance
of
elicit
some
hopeful
explanation
as
I
hand
he
a
dram


at
the
door
,
whether
he
have
admit
at
his
gate
any
gentleman
who
have


perceptibly
be
dine
out
?
yes
,
he
say
;
at
different
time
of
the


night
,
three
.
one
live
in
Fountain
Court
,
and
the
other
two
live
in


the
Lane
,
and
he
have
see
they
all
go
home
.
again
,
the
only
other
man


who
dwell
in
the
house
of
which
my
chamber
form
a
part
have
be
in


the
country
for
some
week
,
and
he
certainly
have
not
return
in
the


night
,
because
we
have
see
his
door
with
his
seal
on
it
as
we
come


up
-
stair
.


"
the
night
be
so
bad
,
sir
,
"
say
the
watchman
,
as
he
give
I
back


my
glass
,
"
uncommon
few
have
come
in
at
my
gate

they

have

I
do
n't
 
call
to
mind

about


eleven
o'clock
,

a
stranger

the

not

notice

a
working


person
;

the
good
of
his
belief

a

make
more
light

I


do

circumstance

together

they
be
easy
of
innocent


solution
apart

,
for
instance
,
some
diner
out
or
diner
at
home
,


who
have
not
go
near
this
watchman

gate

might
have
stray
to
my


staircase
and
drop
asleep
there
,

my
nameless
visitor
might
have


bring
some
one
with
he
to
show
he
the
way
,

still
,
join
,
they
have


an
ugly
look
to
one
as
prone
to
distrust
and
fear
as
the
change
of
a


few
hour
have
make
I
.


I
light
my
fire
,
which
burn
with
a
raw
pale
flare
at
that
time
of
the


morning
,
and
fall
into
a
doze
before
it

I
seem
to
have
be
doze
a


whole
night
when
the
clock
strike
six
.
as
there
be
full
an
hour
and


a
half
between
I
and
daylight
,
I
doze
again
;
now
,
wake
up
uneasily
,


with
prolix
conversation
about
nothing
,
in
my
ear
;
now
,
make
thunder


of
the
wind
in
the
chimney
;
at
length
,
fall
off
into
a
profound
sleep


from
which
the
daylight
wake
I
with
a
start
.


all
this
time
I
have
never
be
able
to
consider
my
own
situation
,
nor


could
I
do
so
yet
.
I
have
not
the
power
to
attend
to
it
.
I
be
greatly


deject
and
distressed
,
but
in
an
incoherent
wholesale
sort
of
way
.


as
to
form
any
plan
for
the
future
,
I
could
as
soon
have
form
an


elephant
.
when
I
open
the
shutter
and
look
out
at
the
wet
wild


morning
,
all
of
a
leaden
hue
;
when
I
walk
from
room
to
room
;
when
I


sit
down
again
shiver
,
before
the
fire
,
wait
for
my
laundress
to


appear
;
I
think
how
miserable
I
be
,
but
hardly
know
why
,
or
how
long


I
have
be
so
,
or
on
what
day
of
the
week
I
make
the
reflection
,
or
even


who
I
be
that
make
it
.


at
last
,
the
old
woman
and
the
niece
come
in
,
-
the
latter
with
a
head


not
easily
distinguishable
from
her
dusty
broom
,
-
and
testify
surprise


at
sight
of
I
and
the
fire
.
to
whom
I
impart
how
my
uncle
have
come
in


the
night
and
be
then
asleep
,
and
how
the
breakfast
preparation
be


to
be
modify
accordingly
.
then
I
wash
and
dress
while
they
knock


the
furniture
about
and
make
a
dust
;

so
,
in
a
sort
of
dream


or
sleep

waking
,
I
find
myself
sit
by
the
fire
again

to

open

out

myself

the
sight
of

a

'll

he
on

to
state
that
my
terrible
patron
carry
this
little
black
book
about


the
world
solely
to
swear
people
on
in
case
of
emergency
,
would
be
to


state
what
I
never
quite
established
;
but
this
I
can
say
,
that
I
never


know
he
put
it
to
any
other
use
.
the
book
itself
have
the
appearance
of


having
be
steal
from
some
court
of
justice
,
and
perhaps
his
knowledge


of
its
antecedent
,
combine
with
his
own
experience
in
that
wise
,
give


he
a
reliance
on
its
power
as
a
sort
of
legal
spell
or
charm
.
on
this


first
occasion
of
his
produce
it
,
I
recall
how
he
have
make
I
swear


fidelity
in
the
churchyard
long
ago
,
and
how
he
have
describe
himself


last
night
as
always
swear
to
his
resolution
in
his
solitude
.


as
he
be
at
present
dress
in
a
seafaring
slop
suit
,
in
which
he


look
as
if
he
have
some
parrot
and
cigar
to
dispose
of
,
I
next


discuss
with
he
what
dress
he
should
wear
.
he
cherish
an


extraordinary
belief
in
the
virtue
of
'
short
"
as
a
disguise
,
and
have


in
his
own
mind
sketch
a
dress
for
himself
that
would
have
make


he
something
between
a
dean
and
a
dentist
.
it
be
with
considerable


difficulty
that
I
win
he
over
to
the
assumption
of
a
dress
more
like
a


prosperous
farmer
's
;
and
we
arrange
that
he
should
cut
his
hair
close
,


and
wear
a
little
powder
.
lastly
,
as
he
have
not
yet
be
see
by
the


laundress
or
her
niece
,
he
be
to
keep
himself
out
of
their
view
until


his
change
of
dress
be
make
.


it
would
seem
a
simple
matter
to
decide
on
these
precaution
;
but
in
my


daze
,
not
to
say
distracted
,
state
,
it
take
so
long
,
that
I
do
not


get
out
to

until
two
or
three
in
the
afternoon

up
in

Provis

negro

what


he

wear
before

to
my
thinking
,
there
be
something
in
he
that
make


it
hopeless
to
attempt
to
disguise
he
.
the
more
I
dress
he

the


well
I
dress
he

the
more
he
look
like
the
slouching
fugitive
on


the
marsh

this
effect
on
my
anxious
fancy
be
partly
referable
,
no


doubt
,
to
his
old
face
and
manner
grow
more
familiar
to
I

I


believe
too
that
he
drag
one
of
his
leg
as
if
there
be
still
a


weight
of
iron
on
it
,

that
from
head
to
foot
there
be
Convict
in


the
very
grain
of
the
man
.


the
influence
of
his
solitary
hut
-
life
be
upon
he
besides
,
and


give
he
a
savage
air
that
no
dress
could
tame
;
add
to
these
be
the


influence
of
his
subsequent
brand
life
among
man
,
and
,
crown
all
,


his
consciousness
that
he
be
dodge
and
hide
now
.
in
all
his
way
of


sit
and
standing
,
and
eat
and
drink
,
-
of
brood
about
in
a


high

shoulder
reluctant
style
,

of
take
out
his
great
horn
-
handle


jackknife

wipe
it
on
his
leg
and
cut
his
food
,
-
of


lift
light
glass
and
cup
to
his
lip
,
as
if
they
be
clumsy


pannikin
,
-
of
chop
a
wedge
off
his
bread
,
and
soak
up
with
it


the
last
fragment
of
gravy
round
and
round
his
plate
,
as
if
to
make
the


most
of
an
allowance
,

then
dry
his
finger

end
on
it
,

then


swallow
it
,

in
these
way
and
a
thousand
other
small
nameless


instance

every
minute
in
the
day

there
be
Prisoner
,
Felon
,


Bondsman

as
plain
could
be
.


it
have
be
his
own
idea
to
wear
that
touch
of
powder
,
and
I
have


concede
the
powder
after
overcome
the
short
.
but
I
can
compare
the


effect
of
it
,
when
on
,
to
nothing
but
the
probable
effect
of
rouge
upon


the
dead
;
so
awful
be
the
manner
in
which
everything
in
he
that
it
be


most
desirable
to
repress
,
start
through
that
thin
layer
of
pretence
,


and
seem
to
come
blaze
out
at
the
crown
of
his
head
.
it
be


abandon
as
soon
as
try
,
and
he
wear
his
grizzled
hair
cut
short
.


word
can
not
tell
what
a
sense
I
have
,
at
the
same
time
,
of
the
dreadful


mystery
that
he
be
to
I
.
when
he
fall
asleep
of
an
evening
,
with
his


knotted
hand
clench
the
side
of
the
easy
-
chair
,
and
his
bald
head


tattoo
with
deep
wrinkle
fall
forward
on
his
breast
,
I
would
sit


and
look
at
he
,
wonder
what
he
have
do
,
and
load
he
with
all


the
crime
in
the
calendar
,
until
the
impulse
be
powerful
on
I
to


start
up
and
fly
from
he
.
every
hour
so
increase
my
abhorrence
of


he
,
that
I
even
think
I
might
have
yield
to
this
impulse
in
the
first


agony
of
be
so
haunted
,
notwithstanding
all
he
have
do
for
I
and


the
risk
he
run
,
but
for
the
knowledge
that
Herbert
must
soon
come
back
.


once
,
I
actually
do
start
out
of
bed
in
the
night
,
and
begin
to
dress


myself
in
my
bad
clothe
,
hurriedly
intend
to
leave
he
there
with


everything
else
I
possess
,
and
enlist
for
India
as
a
private
soldier
.


I
doubt
if
a
ghost
could
have
be
more
terrible
to
I
,
up
in
those


lonely
room
in
the
long
evening
and
long
night
,
with
the
wind
and
the


rain
always
rush
by
.
a
ghost
could
not
have
be
take
and
hang
on


my
account
,
and
the
consideration
that
he
could
be
,
and
the
dread
that


he
would
be
,
be
no
small
addition
to
my
horror
.
when
he
be
not


asleep
,
or
play
a
complicated
kind
of
patience
with
a
ragged
pack
of


card
of
his
own
,
-
a
game
that
I
never
see
before
or
since
,
and
in
which


he
record
his
winning
by
stick
his
jackknife
into
the
table
,
-
when


he
be
not

in
either
of
these
pursuit
,
he
would
ask
I
to

while

,

comprehend

single

stand
before
the
fire

I


with
the
air
of
an
exhibitor
,

I
would
see

the
finger


of
the
hand

I
shade
my

repulsion

be
in
a
Decline
,

be
a


shadow
to
look
at

he

Compeyson
have
be
in
a
bad
thing
with
a


rich
lady
some
year

'd
make
a

gamed

"
when
we

wi
'
his
curly
hair

on

get
the
profit
.

when

defence
come
on
,

I
see
the
plan


plainer

we
neither

XLIII


why
should
I
pause
to
ask
how
much
of
my
shrinking
from
Provis
might
be


trace
to
Estella
?
why
should
I
loiter
on
my
road
,
to
compare
the
state


of
mind
in
which
I
have
try
to
rid
myself
of
the
stain
of
the
prison


before
meet
she
at
the
coach
-
office
,
with
the
state
of
mind
in
which


I
now
reflect
on
the
abyss
between
Estella
in
her
pride
and
beauty
,


and
the
return
transport
whom
I
harbor
?
the
road
would
be
none
the


smooth
for
it
,
the
end
would
be
none
the
well
for
it
,
he
would
not


be
help
,
nor
I
extenuate
.


a
new
fear
have
be
engender
in
my
mind
by
his
narrative
;
or
rather
,


his
narrative
have
give
form
and
purpose
to
the
fear
that
be
already


there
.
if
Compeyson
be
alive
and
should
discover
his
return
,
I
could


hardly
doubt
the
consequence
.
that
,
Compeyson
stand
in
mortal
fear
of


he
,
neither
of
the
two
could
know
much
well
than
I
;
and
that
any


such
man
as
that
man
have
be
describe
to
be
would
hesitate
to
release


himself
for
good
from
a
dreaded
enemy
by
the
safe
mean
of
become
an


informer
be
scarcely
to
be
imagine
.


never
have
I
breathe
,
and
never
would
I
breathe
-
or
so
I
resolve
-
a


word
of
Estella
to
Provis
.
but
,
I
say
to
Herbert
that
,
before
I
could


go
abroad
,
I
must
see
both
Estella
and
Miss
Havisham
.
this
be
when
we


be
leave
alone
on
the
night
of
the
day
when
Provis
tell
we
his
story
.
I


resolve
to
go
out
to
Richmond
next
day
,
and
I
go
.


on
my
present
myself
at
Mrs.
Brandley
's
,
Estella
's
maid
be
call
to


tell
that
Estella
have
go
into
the
country
.
where
?
to
Satis
House
,
as


usual
.
not
as
usual
,
I
say
,
for
she
have
never
yet
go
there
without


I
;
when
be
she
come
back
?
there
be
an
air
of
reservation
in
the


answer
which
increase
my
perplexity
,
and
the
answer
be
,
that
her
maid


believe
she
be
only
come
back
at
all
for
a
little
while
.
I
could


make
nothing
of
this
,
except
that
it
be
mean
that
I
should
make


nothing
of
it
,
and
I
go
home
again
in
complete
discomfiture
.


another
night
consultation
with
Herbert
after
Provis
be
go
home
 
I


always
take
he
home
,
and
always
look
well
about
I
,
lead
we
to
the


conclusion
that
nothing
should
be
say
about
go
abroad
until
I
come


back
from
Miss
Havisham
's
.
in
the
mean
time
,
Herbert
and
I
be
to


consider
separately
what
it
would
be
good
to
say
;
whether
we
should


devise
any
pretence
of
be
afraid
that
he
be
under
suspicious


observation
;
or
whether
I
,
who
have
never
yet
be
abroad
,
should
propose


an
expedition
.
we
both
know
that
I
have
but
to
propose
anything
,
and
he


would
consent
.
we
agree
that
his
remain
many
day
in
his
present


hazard
be
not
to
be
think
of
.


next
day
I
have
the
meanness
to
feign
that
I
be
under
a
bind
promise


to
go
down
to
Joe
;
but
I
be
capable
of
almost
any
meanness
towards
Joe


or
his
name
.
Provis
be
to
be
strictly
careful
while
I
be
go
,
and


Herbert
be
to
take
the
charge
of
he
that
I
have
take
.
I
be
to
be


absent
only
one
night
,
and
,
on
my
return
,
the
gratification
of
his


impatience
for
my
starting
as
a
gentleman
on
a
great
scale
be
to


be
begin
.
it
occur
to
I
then
,
and
as
I
afterwards
find
to


Herbert
also
,
that
he
might
be
well
get
away
across
the
water
,
on
that


pretence
,
-
as
,
to
make
purchase
,
or
the
like
.


having
thus
clear
the
way
for
my
expedition
to
Miss
Havisham
's
,
I
set


off
by
the
early
morning
coach
before
it
be
yet
light
,
and
be
out


on
the
open
country
road
when
the
day
came
creep
on
,
halting
and


whimpering
and
shiver
,
and
wrap
in
patch
of
cloud
and
rag
of


mist
,
like
a
beggar
.
when
we
drive
up
to
the
Blue
Boar
after
a
drizzly


ride
,
whom
should
I
see
come
out
under
the
gateway
,
toothpick
in
hand
,


to
look
at
the
coach
,
but
Bentley
Drummle
!


as
he
pretend
not
to
see
I
,
I
pretend
not
to
see
he
.
it
be
a
very


lame
pretence
on
both
side
;
the
lamer
,
because
we
both
go
into
the


coffee
-
room
,
where
he
have
just
finish
his
breakfast
,
and
where
I


order
mine
.
it
be
poisonous
to
I
to
see
he
in
the
town
,
for
I
very


well
know
why
he
have
come
there
.


pretend
to
read
a
smeary
newspaper
long
out
of
date
,
which
have


nothing
half
so
legible
in
its
local
news
,
as
the
foreign
matter
of


coffee
,
pickle
,
fish
sauce
,
gravy
,
melt
butter
,
and
wine
with
which


it
be
sprinkle
all
over
,
as
if
it
have
take
the
measle
in
a
highly


irregular
form
,
I
sit
at
my
table
while
he
stand
before
the
fire
.
by


degree
it
become
an
enormous
injury
to
I
that
he
stand
before
the


fire
.
and
I
get
up
,
determined
to
have
my
share
of
it
.
I
have
to
put
my


hand
behind
his
leg
for
the
poker
when
I
go
up
to
the
fireplace
to


stir
the
fire
,
but
still
pretend
not
to
know
he
.


"
be
this
a
cut
?
"
say
Mr.
Drummle

who
it
be

who
keep
the
fire
off
.
"


with
that
,
I
poke
tremendously
,
and
having
do
so
,
plant
myself
side


by
side
with
Mr.
Drummle
,
my
shoulder
square
and
my
back
to
the

more
real
,
or
more
impossible
to
be
displace
by
your


hand
,
than
your
presence

influence
have
be
to
I
,
there
and


everywhere

.
Estella
,
to
the
last
hour
of
my
life
,
you


can
not
choose
but
remain
part
of
my
character
,
part
of
the
little
good


in
I
,
part
of
the
evil
.
but
,
in
this
separation
,
I
associate
you
only


with
the
good
;
and
I
will
faithfully
hold
you
to
that
always
,
for
you


must
have
do
I
far
more
good
than
harm
,
let
I
feel
now
what
sharp


distress
I
may
.
o
God
bless
you
,
God
forgive
you

"


in
what
ecstasy
of
unhappiness
I
get
these
break
word
out
of
myself
,
I


do
n't
 
know
.
the
rhapsody
well
up
within
I
,
like
blood
from
an


inward
wound
,
and
gush
out
.
I
hold
her
hand
to
my
lip
some
linger


moment
,
and
so
I
leave
she
.
but
ever
afterwards
,
I
remember
,
-
and
soon


afterwards
with
strong
reason
,
-
that
while
Estella
look
at
I
merely


with
incredulous
wonder
,
the
spectral
figure
of
Miss
Havisham
,
her
hand


still
cover
her
heart
,
seem
all
resolve
into
a
ghastly
stare
of


pity
and
remorse
.


all
do
,
all
go
!
so
much
be
do
and
go
,
that
when
I
go
out
at


the
gate
,
the
light
of
the
day
seem
of
a
dark
color
than
when
I
go


in
.
for
a
while
,
I
hide
myself
among
some
lane
and
by
-
path
,
and
then


strike
off
to
walk
all
the
way
to
London
.
for
,
I
have
by
that
time
come


to
myself
so
far
as
to
consider
that
I
could
not
go
back
to
the
inn
and


see
Drummle
there
;
that
I
could
not
bear
to
sit
upon
the
coach
and


be
speak
to
;
that
I
could
do
nothing
half
so
good
for
myself
as
tire


myself
out
.


it
be
past
midnight
when
I
cross
London
Bridge
.
pursue
the
narrow


intricacy
of
the
street
which
at
that
time
tend
westward

the

from
the

soon
as
I
have
read
the
warning

I
make


the

my

to
Fleet
Street
,

there

a
late
hackney
chariot

at

of
the

wicket

shelf
,
and
show
I
straight
into
the
bedroom
next
in
order
on
his


list
.
it
be
a
sort
of
vault
on
the
ground
floor
at
the
back
,
with
a


despotic
monster
of
a
four
-
post
bedstead
in
it
,
straddle
over
the


whole
place
,
put
one
of
his
arbitrary
leg
into
the
fireplace


and
another
into
the
doorway
,
and
squeeze
the
wretched
little


washing
-
stand
in
quite
a
divinely
righteous
manner
.


as
I
have
ask
for
a
night
-
light
,
the
chamberlain
have
bring
I
in
,


before
he
leave
I
,
the
good
old
constitutional
rushlight
of
those


virtuous
day
.
-
an
object
like
the
ghost
of
a
walking
-
cane
,
which


instantly
break
its
back
if
it
be
touch
,
which
nothing
could
ever
be


light
at
,
and
which
be
place
in
solitary
confinement
at
the
bottom


of
a
high
tin
tower
,
perforate
with
round
hole
that
make
a
staringly


wide
-
awake
pattern
on
the
wall
.
when
I
have
get
into
bed
,
and
lie
there


footsore
,
weary
,
and
wretched
,
I
find
that
I
could
no
more
close
my
own


eye
than
I
could
close
the
eye
of
this
foolish
Argus
.
and
thus
,
in
the


gloom
and
death
of
the
night
,
we
stare
at
one
another
.


what
a
doleful
night
!
how
anxious
,
how
dismal
,
how
long
!
there
be
an


inhospitable
smell
in
the
room
,
of
cold
soot
and
hot
dust
;
and
,
as
I


look
up
into
the
corner
of
the
tester
over
my
head
,
I
think
what


a
number
of
blue
-
bottle
fly
from
the
butcher
'
,
and
earwig
from
the


market
,
and
grub
from
the
country
,
must
be
hold
on
up
there
,
lie


by
for
next
summer
.
this
lead
I
to
speculate
whether
any
of
they
ever


tumble
down
,
and
then
I
fancy
that
I
feel
light
fall
on
my
face
,
-
a


disagreeable
turn
of
thought
,
suggest
other
and
more
objectionable


approach
up
my
back
.
when
I
have
lain
awake
a
little
while
,
those


extraordinary
voice
with
which
silence
teem
begin
to
make
themselves


audible
.
the
closet
whisper
,
the
fireplace
sigh
,
the
little


washing
-
stand
tick
,
and
one
guitar
-
string
play
occasionally
in
the


chest
of
drawer
.
at
about
the
same
time
,
the
eye
on
the
wall
acquire


a
new
expression
,
and
in
every
one
of
those
stare
round
I
see


write
,
don't
GO
home
.


whatever
night
-
fancy
and
night
-
noise
crowd
on
I
,
they
never
ward


off
this
don't
GO
home
.
it
plait
itself
into
whatever
I
think
of
,


as
a
bodily
pain
would
have
do
.
not
long
before
,
I
have
read
in
the


newspaper
,
how
a
gentleman
unknown
have
come
to
the
Hummums
in
the


night
,
and
have
go
to
bed
,
and
have
destroy
himself
,
and
have
be


find
in
the
morning
weltering
in
blood
.
it
come
into
my
head
that
he


must
have
occupy
this
very
vault
of
mine
,
and
I
get
out
of
bed
to


assure
myself
that
there
be
no
red
mark
about
;
then
open
the
door


to
look
out
into
the
passage
,
and
cheer
myself
with
the
companionship


of
a
distant
light
,
near
which
I
know
the
chamberlain
to
be
doze
.
but


all
this
time
,
why
I
be
not
to
go
home
,
and
what
have
happen
at
home
,


and
when
I
should
go
home
,
and
whether
Provis
be
safe
at
home
,
be


question
occupy
my
mind
so
busily
,
that
one
might
have
suppose


there
could
be
no
more
room
in
it
for
any
other
theme
.
even
when
I


thought
of
Estella
,
and
how
we
have
part
that
day
forever
,
and
when


I
recall
all
the
circumstance
of
our
parting
,
and
all
her
look
and


tone
,
and
the
action
of
her
finger
while
she
knit
,
-
even
then
I


be
pursue
,
here
and
there
and
everywhere
,
the
caution
,
do
n't
 
go
home
.


when
at
last
I
doze
,
in
sheer
exhaustion
of
mind
and
body
,
it
become


a
vast
shadowy
verb
which
I
have
to
conjugate
.
imperative
mood
,
present


tense
:
do
not
thou
go
home
,
let
he
not
go
home
,
let
we
not
go
home
,
do


not
ye
or
you
go
home
,
let
not
they
go
home
.
then
potentially
:
I
may
not


and
I
can
not
go
home
;
and
I
might
not
,
could
not
,
would
not
,
and
should


not
go
home
;
until
I
feel
that
I
be
go
distract
,
and
roll
over


on
the
pillow
,
and
look
at
the
stare
round
upon
the
wall
again
.


I
have
leave
direction
that
I
be
to
be
call
at
seven
;
for
it
be
plain


that
I
must
see
Wemmick
before
see
any
one
else
,
and
equally
plain


that
this
be
a
case
in
which
his
Walworth
sentiment
only
could
be


take
.
it
be
a
relief
to
get
out
of
the
room
where
the
night
have
be


so
miserable
,
and
I
need
no
second
knock
at
the
door
to
startle
I


from
my
uneasy
bed
.


the
Castle

arise
upon
my

be
enter

two
hot

I


pass
through
the
postern
and
cross
the
drawbridge
in
her
company
,


and
so
come
without
announcement
into
the
presence
of
Wemmick
as
he
be


make
tea
for
himself

the
Aged

an
open

afford
a
perspective


view

in

well
away

small

secondly
.

go
near

always
hear
of
the
safety
of

take
down

great
advantage

take
some
.
there


he
go
!
"
another
roar
,
with
a
prolong
shake
at
the
end
.
"
now
,
"
say


Herbert
,
as
it
be
succeed
by
silence
,
"
he
be
drink
.
now
,
"
say


Herbert
,
as
the
growl
resound
in
the
beam
once
more
,
"
he
be
down
again


on
his
back
!
"


Clara
return
soon
afterwards
,
and
Herbert
accompany
I
up
stair
to


see
our
charge
.
as
we
pass
Mr.
Barley
's
door
,
he
be
hear
hoarsely


mutter
within
,
in
a
strain
that
rise
and
fall
like
wind
,
the


follow
Refrain
,
in
which
I
substitute
good
wish
for
something
quite


the
reverse
:
-


"
Ahoy
!
bless
your
eye
,
here
be
old
Bill
Barley
.
here
be
old
Bill
Barley
,


bless
your
eye
.
here
be
old
Bill
Barley
on
the
flat
of
his
back
,
by
the


Lord
.
lie
on
the
flat
of
his
back
like
a
drift
old
dead
flounder
,


here
be
your
old
Bill
Barley
,
bless
your
eye
.
ahoy
!
bless
you
.
"


in
this
strain
of
consolation
,
Herbert
inform
I
the
invisible
Barley


would
commune
with
himself
by
the
day
and
night
together
;
often
,
while


it
be
light
,
have
,
at
the
same
time
,
one
eye
at
a
telescope
which
be


fit
on
his
bed
for
the
convenience
of
sweep
the
river
.


in
his
two
cabin
room
at
the
top
of
the
house
,
which
be
fresh
and


airy
,
and
in
which
Mr.
Barley
be
less
audible
than
below
,
I
find


Provis
comfortably
settle
.
he
express
no
alarm
,
and
seem
to


feel
none
that
be
worth
mention
;
but
it
strike
I
that
he
be


soften
,
-
indefinably
,
for
I
could
not
have
say
how
,
and
could
never


afterwards
recall
how
when
I
try
,
but
certainly
.


the
opportunity
that
the
day
's
rest
have
give
I
for
reflection
have


result
in
my
fully
determine
to
say
nothing
to
he
respect


Compeyson
.
for
anything
I
know
,
his
animosity
towards
the
man


might
otherwise
lead
to
his
seek
he
out
and
rush
on
his
own


destruction
.
therefore
,
when
Herbert
and
I
sit
down
with
he
by
his


fire
,
I
ask
he
first
of
all
whether
he
rely
on
Wemmick
's
judgment


and
source
of
information
?


"
ay
,
ay
,
dear
boy
!
"
he
answer
,
with
a
grave
nod
,
"
jagger
know
.
"


"
then
,
I
have
talk
with
Wemmick
,
"
say
I
,
"
and
have
come
to
tell
you


what
caution
he
give
I
and
what
advice
.
"


this
I
do
accurately
,
with
the
reservation
just
mention
;
and
I
tell


he
how
Wemmick
have
hear
,
in
newgate
prison
 
whether
from
officer
or


prisoner
I
could
not
say
,
that
he
be
under
some
suspicion
,
and
that


my
chamber
have
be
watch
;
how
Wemmick
have
recommend
his
keeping


close
for
a
time
,
and
my
keep
away
from
he
;
and
what
Wemmick
have


say
about
get
he
abroad
.
I
add
,
that
of
course
,
when
the
time


come
,
I
should
go
with
he
,
or
should
follow
close
upon
he
,
as
might


be
safe
in
Wemmick
's
judgment
.
what
be
to
follow
that
I
do
not
touch


upon
;
neither
,
indeed
,
be
I
at
all
clear
or
comfortable
about
it
in
my


own
mind
,
now
that
I
see
he
in
that
soft
condition
,
and
in
declare


peril
for
my
sake
.
as
to
alter
my
way
of
live
by
enlarge
my


expense
,
I
put
it
to
he
whether
in
our
present
unsettled
and
difficult


circumstance
,
it
would
not
be
simply
ridiculous
,
if
it
be
no
bad
?


he
could
not
deny
this
,
and
indeed
be
very
reasonable
throughout
.
his


come
back
be
a
venture
,
he
say
,
and
he
have
always
know
it
to
be
a


venture
.
he
would
do
nothing
to
make
it
a
desperate
venture
,
and
he
have


very
little
fear
of
his
safety
with
such
good
help
.


Herbert
,
who
have
be
look
at
the
fire
and
pondering
,
here
say


that
something
have
come
into
his
thought
arise
out
of
Wemmick
's


suggestion
,
which
it
might
be
worth
while
to
pursue
.
"
we
be
both
good


waterman
,
Handel
,
and
could
take
he
down
the
river
ourselves
when
the


right
time
come
.
no
boat
would
then
be
hire
for
the
purpose
,
and
no


boatman
;
that
would
save
at
least
a
chance
of
suspicion
,
and
any
chance


be
worth
save
.
never
mind
the
season
;
do
n't
 
you
think
it
might
be
a


good
thing
if
you
begin
at
once
to
keep
a
boat
at
the
Temple
stair
,
and


be
in
the
habit
of
row
up
and
down
the
river
?
you
fall
into
that


habit
,
and
then
who
notice
or
mind
?
do
it
twenty
or
fifty
time
,


and
there
be
nothing
special
in
your
do
it
the
twenty
-
first
or


fifty
-
first
.
"


I
like
this
scheme
,
and
Provis
be
quite
elated
by
it
.
we
agree


that
it
should
be
carry
into
execution
,
and
that
Provis
should
never


recognize
we
if
we
come
below
Bridge
,
and
row
past
Mill
Pond
Bank
.
but


we
far
agree
that
he
should
pull
down
the
blind
in
that
part
of
his


window
which
give
upon
the
east
,
whenever
he
see
we
and
all
be
right
.


our
conference
be
now
end
,
and
everything
arrange
,
I
rise
to
go
;


remark
to
Herbert
that
he
and
I
have
well
not
go
home
together
,
and


that
I
would
take
half
an
hour
's
start
of
he
.
"
I
do
n't
 
like
to
leave


you
here
,
"
I
say
to
Provis
,
"
though
I
can
not
doubt
your
be
safe


here
than
near
I
.
good
by
!
"


"
dear
boy
,
"
he
answer
,
clasp
my
hand
,
"
I
do
n't
 
know
when
we
may


meet
again
,
and
I
do
n't
 
like
good
by
.
say
good
night
!
"


"
good
night
!
Herbert
will
go
regularly
between
we
,
and
when
the
time


come
you
may
be
certain
I
shall
be
ready
.
good
night
,
good
night
!
"


we
think
it
well
that
he
should
stay
in
his
own
room
;
and
we
leave
he


on
the
landing
outside
his
door
,
hold
a
light
over
the
stair
-
rail
to


light
we
down
stair
.
look
back
at
he
,
I
think
of
the
first
night


of
his
return
,
when
our
position
be
reverse
,
and
when
I
little


suppose
my
heart
could
ever
be
as
heavy
and
anxious
at
part
from
he


as
it
be
now
.


Old
Barley
be
growl
and
swear
when
we
repasse
his
door
,
with
no


appearance
of
having
cease
or
of
meaning
to
cease
.
when
we
get
to
the


foot
of
the
stair
,
I
ask
Herbert
whether
he
have
preserve
the
name
of


Provis
.
he
reply
,
certainly
not
,
and
that
the
lodger
be
Mr.
Campbell
.


he
also
explain
that
the
utmost
know
of
Mr.
Campbell
there
be
,


that
he
 
Herbert
 
have
Mr.
Campbell
consign
to
he
,
and
feel
a
strong


personal
interest
in
his
be
well
cared
for
,
and
live
a
secluded


life
.
so
,
when
we
go
into
the
parlor
where
Mrs.
Whimple
and
Clara
be


seat
at
work
,
I
say
nothing
of
my
own
interest
in
Mr.
Campbell
,
but


keep
it
to
myself
.


when
I
have
take
leave
of
the
pretty
,
gentle
,
dark
-
eyed
girl
,
and
of
the


motherly
woman
who
have
not
outlive
her
honest
sympathy
with
a
little


affair
of
true
love
,
I
feel
as
if
the
Old
Green
Copper
Ropewalk
have


grow
quite
a
different
place
.
Old
Barley
might
be
as
old
as
the
hill
,


and
might
swear
like
a
whole
field
of
trooper
,
but
there
be
redeem


youth
and
trust
and
hope
enough
in
Chinks
's
Basin
to
fill
it
to


overflow
.
and
then
I
think
of
Estella
,
and
of
our
parting
,
and
go


home
very
sadly
.


all
thing
be
as
quiet
in
the
Temple
as
ever
I
have
see
they
.
the


window
of
the
room
on
that
side
,
lately
occupy
by
Provis
,
be
dark


and
still
,
and
there
be
no
lounger
in
Garden
Court
.
I
walk
past
the


fountain
twice
or
thrice
before
I
descend
the
step
that
be
between


I
and
my
room
,
but
I
be
quite
alone
.
Herbert
,
come
to
my


bedside
when
he
come
in
,
-
for
I
go
straight
to
bed
,
dispirited
and


fatigued
,
-
make
the
same
report
.
open
one
of
the
window
after
that
,


he
look
out
into
the
moonlight
,
and
tell
I
that
the
pavement
be
a


solemnly
empty
as
the
pavement
of
any
cathedral
at
that
same
hour
.


next
day
I
set
myself
to
get
the
boat
.
it
be
soon
do
,
and
the
boat


be
bring
round
to
the
Temple
stair
,
and
lay
where
I
could
reach


she
within
a
minute
or
two
.
then
,
I
begin
to
go
out
as
for
training
and


practice
:
sometimes
alone
,
sometimes
with
Herbert
.
I
be
often
out
in


cold
,
rain
,
and
sleet
,
but
nobody
take
much
note
of
I
after
I
have
be


out
a
few
time
.
at
first
,
I
keep
above
Blackfriars
Bridge
;
but
as
the


hour
of
the
tide
change
,
I
take
towards
London
Bridge
.
it
be
old


London
Bridge
in
those
day
,
and
at
certain
state
of
the
tide
there


be
a
race
and
fall
of
water
there
which
give
it
a
bad
reputation
.
but
I


know
well
enough
how
to
'
shoot
'
the
bridge
after
see
it
do
,
and
so


begin
to
row
about
among
the
shipping
in
the
Pool
,
and
down
to
Erith
.


the
first
time
I
pass
Mill
Pond
Bank
,
Herbert
and
I
be
pull
a


pair
of
oar
;
and
,
both
in
go
and
return
,
we
see
the
blind
towards


the
east
come
down
.
Herbert
be
rarely
there
less
frequently
than
three


time
in
a
week
,
and
he
never
bring
I
a
single
word
of
intelligence


that
be
at
all
alarming
.
still
,
I
know
that
there
be
cause
for
alarm
,


and
I
could
not
get
rid
of
the
notion
of
be
watch
.
once
receive
,


it
be
a
haunt
idea
;
how
many
undesigning
person
I
suspect
of


watch
I
,
it
would
be
hard
to
calculate
.


in
short
,
I
be
always
full
of
fear
for
the
rash
man
who
be
in
hiding
.


Herbert
have
sometimes
say
to
I
that
he
find
it
pleasant
to
stand
at


one
of
our
window
after
dark
,
when
the
tide
be
run
down
,
and
to


think
that
it
be
flow
,
with
everything
it
bear
,
towards
Clara
.
but


I
think
with
dread
that
it
be
flow
towards
Magwitch
,
and
that


any
black
mark
on
its
surface

chapter
XLVII


some
week
pass
without
bring
any
change
.
we
wait
for
Wemmick
,


and
he
make
no
sign
.
if
I
have
never
know
he
out
of
Little
Britain
,
and


have
never
enjoy
the
privilege
of
be
on
a
familiar
footing
at
the


Castle
,
I
might
have
doubt
he
;
not
so
for
a
moment
,
know
he
as
I


do
.


my
worldly
affair
begin
to
wear
a
gloomy
appearance
,
and
I
be
press


for
money
by
more
than
one
creditor
.
even
I
myself
begin
to
know
the


want
of
money
 
I
mean
of
ready
money
in
my
own
pocket
,
and
to
relieve


it
by
convert
some
easily
spare
article
of
jewelery
into
cash
.
but


I
have
quite
determined
that
it
would
be
a
heartless
fraud
to
take
more


money
from
my
patron
in
the
exist
state
of
my
uncertain
thought
and


plan
.
therefore
,
I
have
send
he
the
unopened
pocket
-
book
by
Herbert
,
to


hold
in
his
own
keeping
,
and
I
feel
a
kind
of
satisfaction
-
whether
it


be
a
false
kind
or
a
true
,
I
hardly
know
-
in
not
having
profit
by
his


generosity
since
his
revelation
of
himself
.


as
the
time
wear
on
,
an
impression
settle
heavily
upon
I
that
Estella


be
marry
.
fearful
of
have
it
confirm
,
though
it
be
all
but
a


conviction
,
I
avoid
the
newspaper
,
and
beg
Herbert
 
to
whom
I
have


confide
the
circumstance
of
our
last
interview
 
never
to
speak
of
she


to
I
.
why
I
hoard
up
this
last
wretched
little
rag
of
the
robe
of


hope
that
be
rent
and
give
to
the
wind
,
how
do
I
know
?
why
do
you


who
read
this
,
commit
that
not
dissimilar
inconsistency
of
your
own
last


year
,
last
month
,
last
week
?


it
be
an
unhappy
life
that
I
live
;
and
its
one
dominant
anxiety
,


tower
over
all
its
other
anxiety
,
like
a
high
mountain
above
a


range
of
mountain
,
never
disappear
from
my
view
.
still
,
no
new
cause


for
fear
arise
.
let
I
start
from
my
bed
as
I
would
,
with
the
terror


fresh
upon
I
that
he
be
discover
;
let
I
sit
listen
,
as
I
would


with
dread
,
for
Herbert
's
return
step
at
night
,
lest
it
should
be


fleeter
than
ordinary
,
and
wing
with
evil
news
,
-
for
all
that
,
and


much
more
to
like
purpose
,
the
round
of
thing
go
on
.
condemn
to


inaction
and
a
state
of
constant
restlessness
and
suspense
,
I
row


about
in
my
boat
,
and
wait
,
wait
,
wait
,
as
I
well
could
.


there
be
state
of
the
tide
when
,
having
be
down
the
river
,
I
could


not
get
back
through
the
eddy
-
chafe
arch
and
starling
of
old
London


bridge
;
then
,
I
leave
my
boat
at
a
wharf
near
the
Custom
House
,
to
be


bring
up
afterwards
to
the
Temple
stair
.
I
be
not
averse
to
do


this
,
as
it
serve
to
make
I
and
my
boat
a
commoner
incident
among
the


water
-
side
people
there
.
from
this
slight
occasion
spring
two
meeting


that
I
have
now
to
tell
of
.


one
afternoon
,
late
in
the
month
of
February
,
I
come
ashore
at
the
wharf


at
dusk
.
I
have
pull
down
as
far
as
Greenwich
with
the
ebb
tide
,
and


have
turn
with
the
tide
.
it
have
be
a
fine
bright
day
,
but
have
become


foggy
as
the
sun
drop
,
and
I
have
have
to
feel
my
way
back
among
the


shipping
,
pretty
carefully
.
both
in
go
and
return
,
I
have
see
the


signal
in
his
window
,
all
well
.


as
it
be
a
raw
evening
,
and
I
be
cold
,
I
think
I
would
comfort


myself
with
dinner
at
once
;
and
as
I
have
hour
of
dejection
and
solitude


before
I
if
I
go
home
to
the
Temple
,
I
think
I
would
afterwards
go


to
the
play
.
the
theatre
where
Mr.
Wopsle
have
achieve
his
questionable


triumph
be
in
that
water
-
side
neighborhood
 
it
be
nowhere
now
,
and


to
that
theatre
I
resolve
to
go
.
I
be
aware
that
Mr.
Wopsle
have


not
succeed
in
revive
the
Drama
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
have
rather


partake
of
its
decline
.
he
have
be
ominously
hear
of
,
through
the


play
-
bill
,
as
a
faithful
Black
,
in
connection
with
a
little
girl
of


noble
birth
,
and
a
monkey
.
and
Herbert
have
see
he
as
a
predatory


Tartar
of
comic
propensity
,
with
a
face
like
a
red
brick
,
and
an


outrageous
hat
all
over
bell
.


I
dine
at
what
Herbert
and
I
use
to
call
a
geographical
chop
-
house
,


where
there
be
map
of
the
world
in
porter
-
pot
rim
on
every
half
-
yard


of
the
tablecloth
,
and
chart
of
gravy
on
every
one
of
the
knife
,
-
to


this
day
there
be
scarcely
a
single
chop
-
house
within
the
Lord
Mayor
's


dominion
which
be
not
geographical
,
-
and
wear
out
the
time
in
doze


over
crumb
,
stare
at
gas
,
and
bake
in
a
hot
blast
of
dinner
.
by


and
by
,
I
rouse
myself
,
and
go
to
the
play
.


there
,
I
find
a
virtuous
boatswain
in
his
Majesty
's
service
,
-
a
most


excellent
man
,
though
I
could
have
wish
his
trouser
not
quite
so


tight
in
some
place
,
and
not
quite
so
loose
in
other
,
-
who
knock
all


the
little
man
's
hat
over
their
eye
,
though
he
be
very
generous
and


brave
,
and
who
would
n't
 
hear
of
anybody
's
pay
taxis
,
though
he
be


very
patriotic
.
he
have
a
bag
of
money
in
his
pocket
,
like
a
pudding
in


the
cloth
,
and
on
that
property
marry
a
young
person
in
bed
-
furniture
,


with
great
rejoicing
;
the
whole
population
of
Portsmouth
 
nine
in


number
at
the
last
census
 
turn
out
on
the
beach
to
rub
their
own


hand
and
shake
everybody

and
whose

by
the

to
two
other

to
get
all
mankind
into
difficulty
;
which
be
so
effectually


do
 
the
Swab
family
have
considerable
political
influence
 
that
it


take
half
the
evening
to
set
thing
right
,
and
then
it
be
only
bring


about
through
an
honest
little
grocer
with
a
white
hat
,
black
gaiter
,


and
red
nose
,
get
into
a
clock
,
with
a
gridiron
,
and
listen
,
and


come
out
,
and
knock
everybody
down
from
behind
with
the
gridiron


whom
he
could
n't
 
confute
with
what
he
have
overhear
.
this
lead
to
Mr.


Wopsle
's
 
who
have
never
be
hear
of
before
 
come
in
with
a
star


and
garter
on
,
as
a
plenipotentiary
of
great
power
direct
from
the


Admiralty
,
to
say
that
the
Swabs
be
all
to
go
to
prison
on
the
spot
,


and
that
he
have
bring
the
boatswain
down
the
Union
Jack
,
as
a
slight


acknowledgment
of
his
public
service
.
the
boatswain
,
unmanned
for
the


first
time
,
respectfully
dry
his
eye
on
the
Jack
,
and
then
cheer


up
,
and
address
Mr.
Wopsle
as
your
Honor
,
solicit
permission
to


take
he
by
the
fin

Mr.
Wopsle
,
concede
his
fin
with
a
gracious


dignity
,
be
immediately
shove
into
a
dusty
corner
,
while
everybody


dance
a
hornpipe
;
and
from
that
corner
,
survey
the
public
with
a


discontent
eye
,
become
aware
of
I
.


the
second
piece
be
the
last
new
grand
comic
Christmas
pantomime
,
in


the
first
scene
of
which
,
it
pain
I
to
suspect
that
I
detect


Mr.
Wopsle
with
red
worsted
leg
under
a
highly
magnify
phosphoric


countenance
and
a
shock
of
red
curtain
-
fringe
for
his
hair
,
engage


in
the
manufacture
of
thunderbolt
in
a
mine
,
and
display
great


cowardice
when
his
gigantic
master
come
home
 
very
hoarse
 
to
dinner
.


but
he
presently
present
himself
under
worthy
circumstance
;
for
,


the
Genius
of
Youthful
Love
be
in
want
of
assistance
,
-
on
account
of


the
parental
brutality
of
an
ignorant
farmer
who
oppose
the
choice


of
his
daughter
's
heart
,
by
purposely
fall
upon
the
object
,
in
a


flour
-
sack
,
out
of
the
first
-
floor
window
,
-
summon
a
sententious


enchanter
;
and
he
,
come
up
from
the
antipode
rather
unsteadily
,
after


an
apparently
violent
journey
,
prove
to
be
Mr.
Wopsle
in
a
high
-
crown


hat
,
with
a
necromantic
work
in
one
volume
under
his
arm
.
the
business


of
this
enchanter
on
earth
be
principally
to
be
talk
at
,
sing
at
,


butt
at
,
dance
at
,
and
flash
at
with
fire
of
various
color
,


he
have
a
good
deal
of
time
on
his
hand
.
and
I
observe
,
with
great


surprise
,
that
he
devote
it
to
stare
in
my
direction
as
if
he
be


lose
in
amazement
.


there
be
something
so
remarkable
in
the
increase
glare
of
Mr.


Wopsle
's
eye
,
and
he
seem
to
be
turn
so
many
thing
over
in
his


mind
and
to
grow
so
confused
,
that
I
could
not
make
it
out
.
I
sit


thinking
of
it
long
after
he
have
ascend
to
the
cloud
in
a
large


watch
-
case
,
and
still
I
could
not
make
it
out
.
I
be
still
think


of
it
when
I
come
out
of
the
theatre
an
hour
afterwards
,
and
find
he


wait
for
I
near
the
door
.


"
how
do
you
do
?
"
say
I
,
shake
hand
with
he
as
we
turn
down
the


street
together
.
"
I
see
that
you
see
I
.
"


"
see
you

Mr.
Pip
!

he
return
.
"
yes
,
of
course
I
see
you
.
but
who
else


be
there

"
who
else

"
it

the
strange
thing

say
Mr.
Wopsle
,
drift
into
his
lose


look
again
;
"
and
yet
I
could
swear
to
he
.
"


become
alarmed
,
I
entreat
Mr.
Wopsle
to
explain
his
meaning
.


"
whether
I
should
have
notice
he
at
first
but
for
your
be
there
,

say
Mr.
Wopsle
,
go
on
in
the
same
lose
way
,

I
ca
n't
 
be
positive
;


yet
I
think
I
should
.
"


involuntarily
I
look
round
I
,
as
I
be
accustomed
to
look
round
I


when
I
go
home
;
for
these
mysterious
word
give
I
a
chill
.

for
if

have
ever
be
out

my


thought
for
a
few
moment
together
since
the
hiding
have
begin
,
it
be


in
those
very
moment
when
he
be
close
to
I
;
and
to
think
that
I


should
be
so
unconscious
and
off
my
guard
after
all
my
care
be
as
if


I
have
shut
an
avenue
of
a
hundred
door
to
keep
he
out
,

then
have


find
he
at
my
elbow

I
could
not
doubt
,
either
,
that
he
be
there
,


because
I
be
there
,
and
that
,
however
slight
an
appearance
of
danger


there
might
be
about
we
,
danger
be
always
near
and
active
.


I
put
such
question
to
Mr.
Wopsle
as
,
when
do
the
man
come
in
?
he


could
not
tell
I
that
;
he
see
I
,
and
over
my
shoulder
he
see
the
man
.


it
be
not
until
he
have
see
he
for
some
time
that
he
begin
to
identify


he
;
but
he
have
from
the
first
vaguely
associate
he
with
I
,
and


know
he
as
somehow
belong
to
I
in
the
old
village
time
.
how
be


he
dress
?
prosperously
,
but
not
noticeably
otherwise
;
he
think
,
in


black
.
be
his
face
at
all
disfigure
?
no
,
he
believe
not
.
I
believe


not
too
,
for
,
although
in
my
brood
state
I
have
take
no
especial


notice
of
the
people
behind
I
,
I
think
it
likely
that
a
face
at
all


disfigure
would
have
attract
my
attention
.


when
Mr.
Wopsle
have
impart
to
I
all
that
he
could
recall
or
I


extract
,
and
when
I
have
treat
he
to
a
little
appropriate
refreshment
,


after
the
fatigue
of
the
evening
,
we
part
.
it
be
between
twelve
and


one
o'clock
when
I
reach
the
Temple
,
and
the
gate
be
shut
.
no
one


be
near
I
when
I
go
in
and
go
home
.


Herbert
have
come
in
,
and
we
hold
a
very
serious
council
by
the
fire
.
but


there
be
nothing
to
be
do
,
save
to
communicate
to
wemmick
what
I


have
that
night
find
out
,
and
to
remind
he
that
we
wait
for
his
hint
.


as
I
think
that
I
might
compromise
he
if
I
go
too
often
to
the


Castle
,
I
make
this
communication
by
letter
.
I
write
it
before
I
go
to


bed
,
and
go
out
and
post
it
;
and
again
no
one
be
near
I
.
Herbert


and
I
agree
that
we
could
do
nothing
else
but
be
very
cautious
.
and


we
be
very
cautious
indeed
,
-
more
cautious
than
before
,
if
that
be


possible
,
-
and
I
for
my
part
never
go
near
Chinks
's
Basin
,
except


when
I
row
by
,
and
then
I
only
look
at
Mill
Pond
Bank
as
I
look
at


anything
else

intent

have
see
exactly
such
eye

such


hand
on
a
memorable
occasion
very
lately
!


he
dismiss
she

she
glide
out

she
remain


before
I
as
plainly
as
if
she
be
still
there
.
I
look
at
those


hand
,
I
look
at
those
eye
,
I
look
at
that
flow
hair
;

I


compare
they
with
other
hand
,
other
eye
,
other
hair
,
that
I
know
of
,


and
with
what
those
might
be
after
twenty
year
of
a
brutal
husband


and
a
stormy
life
.
I
look
again
at
those
hand
and
eye
of
the


housekeeper
,
and
thought
of
the
inexplicable
feeling
that
have
come
over


I
when
I
last
walk
-
not
alone
-
in
the
ruin
garden
,
and
through
the


deserted
brewery
.
I
think
how
the
same
feeling
have
come
back
when
I


see
a
face
look
at
I
,
and
a
hand
wave
to
I
from
a
stage
-
coach


window
;
and
how
it
have
come
back
again
and
have
flash
about
I
like


lightning
,
when
I
have
pass
in
a
carriage
-
not
alone
-
through
a
sudden


glare
of
light
in
a
dark
street
.
I
think
how
one
link
of
association


have
help
that
identification
in
the
theatre
,
and
how
such
a
link
,


want
before
,
have
be
rivet
for
I
now
,
when
I
have
pass
by
a


chance
swift
from
Estella
's
name
to
the
finger
with
their
knitting


action
,
and
the
attentive
eye
.
and
I
feel
absolutely
certain
that
this


woman
be
Estella
's
mother
.


Mr.
Jaggers
have
see
I
with
Estella
,
and
be
not
likely
to
have
miss


the
sentiment
I
have
be
at
no
pain
to
conceal
.
he
nod
when
I
say


the
subject
be
painful
to
I
,
clap
I
on
the
back
,
put
round
the


wine
again
,
and
go
on
with
his
dinner
.


only
twice
more
do
the
housekeeper
reappear
,
and
then
her
stay
in
the


room
be
very
short
,
and
Mr.
Jaggers
be
sharp
with
she
.
but
her
hand


be
Estella
's
hand
,
and
her
eye
be
Estella
's
eye
,
and
if
she
have


reappear
a
hundred
time
I
could
have
be
neither
more
sure
nor
less


sure
that
my
conviction
be
the
truth
.


it
be
a
dull
evening
,
for
Wemmick
draw
his
wine
,
when
it
come
round
,


quite
as
a
matter
of
business
,
-
just
as
he
might
have
draw
his
salary


when
that
come
round
,
-
and
with
his
eye
on
his
chief
,
sit
in
a
state
of


perpetual
readiness
for
cross
-
examination
.
as
to
the
quantity
of
wine
,


his
post
-
office
be
as
indifferent
and
ready
as
any
other
post
-
office


for
its
quantity
of
letter
.
from
my
point
of
view
,
he
be
the
wrong


twin
all
the
time
,
and
only
externally
like
the
Wemmick
of
Walworth
.


we
take
our
leave
early
,
and
leave
together
.
even
when
we
be
grope


among
Mr.
Jaggers
's
stock
of
boot
for
our
hat
,
I
feel
that
the
right


twin
be
on
his
way
back
;
and
we
have
not
go
half
a
dozen
yard
down


Gerrard
Street
in
the
Walworth
direction
,
before
I
find
that
I
be


walk
arm
in
arm
with
the
right
twin
,
and
that
the
wrong
twin
have


evaporate
into
the
evening
air
.

Wemmick

myself
up

particular
,
her
sleeve
be
always
remember
to
have
be
so
skilfully


contrive
that
her
arm
have
quite
a
delicate
look
.
she
have
only
a
bruise


or
two
about
she

nothing
for
a
tramp
,

but
the
back
of
her

lacerate
,

the
question

a
great
lot
of
bramble


which
be
not
as
high
as
her
face
;

which
she
could
not
have
get


through

out
of

and
bit
of
those
bramble

actually
find
in
her

the
bramble

examination

little
spot

there
.

the
bold
point

make
be
this
:


it
be
attempt
to
be
set
up
,
in
proof
of
her
jealousy
,
that
she
be


under
strong
suspicion

some
three

XLIX


put
Miss
Havisham
's
note
in
my
pocket
,
that
it
might
serve
as


my
credential
for
so

at
Satis
House

she


waywardness
should
lead
she
to
express
any
surprise
at

I
,
I
go


down
again
by
the
coach
next
day
.
but
I
alight
at
the
Halfway
House
,


and
breakfast
there
,
and
walk
the
rest
of
the
distance
;
for
I
seek


to
get
into
the
town
quietly
by
the
unfrequented
way
,
and
to
leave
it


in
the
same
manner
.


the
good
light
of
the
day
be
go
when
I
pass
along
the
quiet
echo


court
behind
the
High
Street
.
the
nook
of
ruin
where
the
old
monk
have


once
have
their
refectory
and
garden
,
and
where
the
strong
wall
be


now
press
into
the
service
of
humble
shed
and
stable
,
be
almost


as
silent
as
the
old
monk
in
their
grave
.
the
cathedral
chime
have
at


once
a
sadder
and
a
more
remote
sound
to
I
,
as
I
hurry
on
avoid


observation
,
than
they
have
ever
have
before
;
so
,
the
swell
of
the
old


organ
be
bear
to
my
ear
like
funeral
music
;
and
the
rook
,
as
they


hover
about
the
gray
tower
and
swing
in
the
bare
high
tree
of
the


priory
garden
,
seem
to
call
to
I
that
the
place
be
change
,
and
that


Estella
be
go
out
of
it
for
ever
.


an
elderly
woman
,

I
have
see
before
as
one
of
the
servant
who


live
in
the
supplementary
house
across
the
back
courtyard
,
open
the


gate
.
the
light
candle
stand
in
the
dark
passage
within
,
as
of
old
,


and
I
take
it
up
and
ascend
the
staircase
alone
.
Miss
Havisham
be
not


in
her
own
room
,

be
in
the
large
room
across
the
landing
.
look


in
at
the
door
,
after
knock
in
vain
,
I
see
she
sit
on
the
hearth


in
a
ragged
chair
,
close
before
,
and
lose
in
the
contemplation
of
,
the


ashy
fire
.


do
as
I
have
often
do
,
I
go
in
,

stand
touch
the
old


chimney
-
piece
,
where
she
could
see
I
when
she
raise
her
eye
.
there


be
an
air
or
utter
loneliness
upon
she
,
that
would
have
move
I
to


pity
though
she
have
wilfully
do
I
a
deep
injury
than
I
could
charge


she
with
.
as
I
stand
compassionate
she
,
and
think
how
,
in
the


progress
of
time
,
I
too
have
come
to
be
a
part
of
the
wreck
fortune
of


that
house
,

eye
rest
on

stare
,

in
a
low
voice
,

I
bring
another
of
the
ragged
chair
to
the
hearth
and
sit
down
,
I


remark
a
new
expression
on
her
face
,

afraid

never

some
reassure
word

tremulous
right


hand

recall
it

the
partnership

I
have


not

far
into
it

I

from
her
look

discursive

association

wring

I
out

the
locked
gate

she
have
the
key

to
go
up

myself
that

safe

well
as

leave

take
the
latter
course

up

room

ragged
chair

with
her
back
towards


I
.
in
the
moment
when
I
be
withdraw
my
head
to
go
quietly
away
,


I
see
a
great
flame
light
spring
up
.
in
the
same
moment
I
see
she


run
at
I
,
shriek
,
with
a
whirl
of
fire
blaze
all
about
she
,


and
soar
at
least
as
many
foot
above
her
head
as
she
be
high
.


I
have
a
double
-
cap
great
-
coat
on
,
and
over
my
arm
another
thick
coat
.


that
I
get
they
off
,
close
with
she
,
throw
she
down
,
and
get
they
over


she
;
that
I
drag
the
great
cloth
from
the
table
for
the
same
purpose
,


and
with
it
drag
down
the
heap
of
rottenness
in
the
midst
,
and


all
the
ugly
thing
that
shelter
there
;
that
we
be
on
the
ground


struggle
like
desperate
enemy
,
and
that
the
close
I
cover
she
,


the
more
wildly
she
shriek
and
try
to
free
herself
,
-
that
this


occur
I
know
through
the
result
,
but
not
through
anything
I
feel
,
or


think
,
or
know
I
do
.
I
know
nothing
until
I
know
that
we
be
on
the


floor
by
the
great
table
,
and
that
patch
of
tinder
yet
alight
be


float
in
the
smoky
air
,
which
,
a
moment
ago
,
have
be
her
fade


bridal
dress
.


then
,
I
look
round
and
see
the
disturb
beetle
and
spider
run


away
over
the
floor
,
and
the
servant
come
in
with
breathless
cry


at
the
door
.
I
still
hold
she
forcibly
down
with
all
my
strength
,
like


a
prisoner
who
might
escape
;
and
I
doubt
if
I
even
know
who
she
be
,
or


why
we
have
struggle
,
or
that
she
have
be
in
flame
,
or
that
the
flame


be
out
,
until
I
see
the
patch
of
tinder
that
have
be
her
garment


no
long
alight
but
fall
in
a
black
shower
around
we
.


she
be
insensible
,
and
I
be
afraid
to
have
she
move
,
or
even


touch
.
assistance
be
send
for
,
and
I
hold
she
until
it
come
,
as
if


I
unreasonably
fancy
 
I
think
I
do
 
that
,
if
I
let
she
go
,
the
fire


would
break
out
again
and
consume
she
.
when
I
get
up
,
on
the
surgeon
's


come
to
she
with
other
aid
,
I
be
astonish
to
see
that
both
my
hand


be
burn
;
for
,
I
have
no
knowledge
of
it
through
the
sense
of
feeling
.


on
examination
it
be
pronounce
that
she
have
receive
serious
hurt
,


but
that
they
of
themselves
be
far
from
hopeless
;
the
danger
lie


mainly
in
the
nervous
shock
.
by
the
surgeon
's
direction
,
her
bed
be


carry
into
that
room
and
lay
upon
the
great
table
,
which
happen
to


be
well
suited
to
the
dressing
of
her
injury
.
when
I
see
she
again
,
an


hour
afterwards
,
she
lie
,
indeed
,
where
I
have
see
her
strike
her
stick
,


and
have
hear
she
say
that
she
would
lie
one
day
.


though
every
vestige
of
her
dress
be
burn
,
as
they
tell
I
,
she


still
have
something
of
her
old
ghastly
bridal
appearance
;
for
,
they
have


cover
she
to
the
throat
with
white
cotton
-
wool
,
and
as
she
lie
with


a
white
sheet
loosely
overlying
that
,
the
phantom
air
of
something
that


have
be
and
be
change
be
still
upon
she
.


I
find
,
on
question
the
servant
,
that
Estella
be
in
Paris
,
and
I


get
a
promise
from
the
surgeon
that
he
would
write
to
she
by
the


next
post

a

terrible

piece
on

some
four
year
later

have
no
reason

so


unexpected

Mr.

put
the
handkerchief
back
into
his
pocket


without
complete
the
usual
performance

fold
his
arm

look


with
stern
attention
at
I
,

with
an
immovable
face
.


then
I
tell
he
all
I
know
,

how
I
know
it
;
with
the
one
reservation


that
I
leave
he
to
infer
that
I
know
from
Miss
Havisham
what
I
in
fact


know
from
Wemmick
.
I
be
very
careful
indeed
as
to
that
.
nor
do
I
look


towards
Wemmick
until
I
have
finish
all
I
have
to
tell
,

have
be
for


some
time
silently
meet
Mr.

.

I
do
at
last
turn


my
eye
in
Wemmick
's
direction
,
I
find
that
he
have
unposte
his
pen
,

be
intent
upon
the
table
before
he

"
hah

Mr.

at
last
,

he
move

the

I
could
not

throw
off
in

I
make
a


passionate

almost
an
indignant
appeal
,
to
he
to
be
more
frank

manly
with
I

I
remind
he
of
the
false
hope
into
which
I
have


lapse
,
the
length
of
time
they
have
last
,

the
discovery
I
have


make
:
and
I
hint
at
the
danger
that
weigh
upon
my
spirit

I


represent
myself
as
be
surely
worthy
of
some
little
confidence
from


he
,
in
return
for
the
confidence
I
have
just
now
imparted

that


I
do
not
blame
he
,

suspect
he
,

mistrust
he
,

I
want


assurance
of
the
truth
from
he
.

if
he
ask
I
why
I
want
it
,

why
I
think
I
have
any
right
to
it

I
would
tell
he
,
little
as
he


care
for
such
poor
dream
,
that
I
have
love
Estella
dearly

long
,

that

I
have
lose
she

must
live
a
bereaved
life

whatever
concern
she
be
still
near

I

quite
still

silent

obdurate

add
the
case
that
you
have
love
she
,
Pip
,
and
have
make
she
the


subject
of
those
'
poor
dream
'
which
have
,
at
one
time
or
another
,
be


in
the
head
of
more
man
than
you
think
likely
,
then
I
tell
you
that
you


have
well
-
and
would
much
soon
when
you
have
think
well
of
it
-
chop


off
that
bandaged
left
hand
of
yours
with
your
bandaged
right
hand
,
and


then
pass
the
chopper
on
to
Wemmick
there
,
to
cut
that
off
too
.
"


I
look
at
Wemmick
,
whose
face
be
very
grave
.
he
gravely
touch
his


lip
with
his
forefinger
.
I
do
the
same
.
Mr.
Jaggers
do
the
same
.


"
now

say
the
latter
then

his
usual
manner
,

what


item
be
it
you
be
at

Mr.

come
in

"


stand
by
for
a
little
,
while
they
be
at
work
,
I
observe
that
the


odd
look
they
have
cast
at
one
another
be
repeat
several
time
:
with


this
difference
now
,
that
each
of
they
seem
suspicious
,
not
to
say


conscious
,
of
having
show
himself
in
a
weak
and
unprofessional
light
to


the
other
.
for
this
reason
,
I
suppose
,
they
be
now
inflexible
with
one


another
;
Mr.
Jaggers
be
highly
dictatorial
,
and
Wemmick
obstinately


justify
himself
whenever
there
be
the
small
point
in
abeyance
for


a
moment

I
have
never
see

such
ill

generally
they


get
on

straight

and
bring
Clarriker
to
I
,


I
have
the
great
satisfaction
of
conclude
that
arrangement
.
it
be
the


only
good
thing
I
have
do
,
and
the
only
complete
thing
I
have
do
,


since
I
be
first
apprise
of
my
great
expectation
.


clarriker
inform
I
on
that
occasion
that
the
affair
of
the
House


be
steadily
progress
,
that
he
would
now
be
able
to
establish
a


small
branch
-
house
in
the
East
which
be
much
want
for
the
extension


of
the
business
,
and
that
Herbert
in
his
new
partnership
capacity
would


go
out
and
take
charge
of
it
,
I
find
that
I
must
have
prepare
for


a
separation
from
my
friend
,
even
though
my
own
affair
have
be
more


settle
.
and
now
,
indeed
,
I
feel
as
if
my
last
anchor
be
loosen
its


hold
,
and
I
should
soon
be
drive
with
the
wind
and
wave
.


but
there
be
recompense
in
the
joy
with
which
Herbert
would
come
home


of
a
night
and
tell
I
of
these
change
,
little
imagine
that
he
tell


I
no
news
,
and
would
sketch
airy
picture
of
himself
conduct
Clara


Barley
to
the
land
of
the
Arabian
Nights
,
and
of
I
go
out
to
join


they
 
with
a
caravan
of
camel
,
I
believe
,
and
of
our
all
go
up
the


nile
and
see
wonder
.
without
be
sanguine
as
to
my
own
part
in


those
bright
plan
,
I
feel
that
Herbert
's
way
be
clear
fast
,
and


that
old
Bill
Barley
have
but
to
stick
to
his
pepper
and
rum
,
and
his


daughter
would
soon
be
happily
provide
for

we
have
now
get
into
the
month
of
March

left
arm

though
it
present


no
bad
symptom
,
take
,
in
the
natural
course
,
so
long
to
heal
that
I


be
still
unable
to
get
a
coat
on

my
right
arm
be
tolerably
restore
;


disfigure

fairly
serviceable
.


on
a
Monday
morning
,
when
Herbert

I
be
at
breakfast

I
receive

this

have
put

but
not


before
we
have
both
get
it

consider
what
to
do

"
I
have
think
it
over
again

again

say
Herbert
,
"
and
I
think
I


know
a
well
course
than
take
a
Thames
waterman
.
take
Startop
.
a
good


fellow

more
than
once

how
much
would
you
tell
he
,
Herbert
?
"


"
it
be
necessary
to
tell
he
very
little
.
let
he
suppose
it
a
mere


freak
,
but
a
secret
one
,
until
the
morning
come
:
then
let
he
know
that


there
be
urgent
reason
for
your
get
Provis
aboard
and
away
.
you
go


with
he
?
"


"
no
doubt
.
"


"
where
?
"


it
have
seem
to
I
,
in
the
many
anxious
consideration
I
have
give
the


point
,
almost
indifferent
what
port
we
make
for
,
-
Hamburg
,
Rotterdam
,


Antwerp
,
-
the
place
signify
little
,
so
that
he
be
out
of
England
.
any


foreign
steamer
that
fall
in
our
way
and
would
take
we
up
would
do
.


I
have
always
propose
to
myself
to
get
he
well
down
the
river
in
the


boat
;
certainly
well
beyond
Gravesend
,
which
be
a
critical
place
for


search
or
inquiry
if
suspicion
be
afoot
.
as
foreign
steamer
would


leave
London
at
about
the
time
of
high
-
water
,
our
plan
would
be
to
get


down
the
river
by
a
previous
ebb
-
tide
,
and
lie
by
in
some
quiet
spot


until
we
could
pull
off
to
one
.
the
time
when
one
would
be
due
where
we


lay
,
wherever
that
might
be
,
could
be
calculate
pretty
nearly
,
if
we


make
inquiry
beforehand
.


Herbert
assent
to
all
this
,
and
we
go
out
immediately
after


breakfast
to
pursue
our
investigation
.
we
find
that
a
steamer
for


Hamburg
be
likely
to
suit
our
purpose
well
,
and
we
direct
our


thought
chiefly
to
that
vessel
.
but
we
note
down
what
other
foreign


steamer
would
leave
London
with
the
same
tide
,
and
we
satisfy


ourselves
that
we
know
the
build
and
color
of
each
.
we
then
separate


for
a
few
hour
:
I
,
to
get
at
once
such
passport
as
be
necessary
;


Herbert
,
to
see
Startop
at
his
lodging
.
we
both
do
what
we
have
to
do


without
any
hindrance
,
and
when
we
meet
again
at
one
o'clock
report


it
do
.
I
,
for
my
part
,
be
prepare
with
passport
;
Herbert
have
see


Startop
,
and
he
be
more
than
ready
to
join
.


those
two
should
pull
a
pair
of
oar
,
we
settle
,
and
I
would
steer
;
our


charge
would
be
sitter
,
and
keep
quiet
;
as
speed
be
not
our
object
,
we


should
make
way
enough
.
we
arrange
that
Herbert
should
not
come
home
to


dinner
before
go
to
Mill
Pond
Bank
that
evening
;
that
he
should


not
go
there
at
all
to
-
morrow
evening
,
Tuesday
;
that
he
should
prepare


provis
to
come
down
to
some
stair
hard
by
the
house
,
on
Wednesday
,
when


he
see
we
approach
,
and
not
soon
;
that
all
the
arrangement
with


he
should
be
conclude
that
Monday
night
;
and
that
he
should
be


communicate
with
no
more
in
any
way
,
until
we
take
he
on
board
.


these
precaution
well
understand
by
both
of
we
,
I
go
home
.


on
open
the
outer
door
of
our
chamber
with
my
key
,
I
find
a
letter


in
the
box
,
direct
to
I
;
a
very
dirty
letter
,
though
not
ill
-
write
.


it
have
be
deliver
by
hand
 
of
course
,
since
I
leave
home
,
and
its


content
be
these
:
-


"
if
you
be
not
afraid
to
come
to
the
old
marsh

night

tomorrow


night
at
nine
,
and
to
come
to
the
little
sluice

house
by

you
have
well
come

you
want
information
regard
your
uncle


Provis
,
you
have
much
well
come
and
tell
no
one
,
and
lose
no
time
.
you


must
come
alone
.
bring
this
with
you
.
"


I
have
have
load
enough
upon
my
mind
before
the
receipt
of
this
strange


letter
.
what
to
do
now
,
I
could
not
tell
.
and
the
bad
be
,
that
I
must


decide
quickly
,
or
I
should
miss
the
afternoon
coach
,
which
would
take


I
down
in
time
for
to
-
night
.
to
-
morrow
night
I
could
not
think
of


go
,
for
it
would
be
too
close
upon
the
time
of
the
flight
.
and
again
,


for
anything
I
know
,
the
proffered
information
might
have
some
important


bearing
on
the
flight
itself
.


if
I
have
have
ample
time
for
consideration
,
I
believe
I
should
still
have


go
.
have
hardly
any
time
for
consideration
,
-
my
watch
show
I


that
the
coach
start
within
half
an
hour
,
-
I
resolve
to
go
.
I
should


certainly
not
have
go
,
but
for
the
reference
to
my
Uncle
Provis
.
that
,


come
on
Wemmick
's
letter
and
the
morning
's
busy
preparation
,
turn


the
scale
.


it
be
so
difficult
to
become
clearly
possess
of
the
content
of
almost


any
letter
,
in
a
violent
hurry
,
that
I
have
to
read
this
mysterious


epistle
again
twice
,
before
its
injunction
to
I
to
be
secret
get


mechanically
into
my
mind
.
yield
to
it
in
the
same
mechanical
kind
of


way
,
I
leave
a
note
in
pencil
for
Herbert
,
tell
he
that
as
I
should


be
so
soon
go
away
,
I
know
not
for
how
long
,
I
have
decide
to
hurry


down
and
back
,
to
ascertain
for
myself
how
Miss
Havisham
be
fare
.


I
have
then
barely
time
to
get
my
great
-
coat
,
lock
up
the
chamber
,


and
make
for
the
coach
-
office
by
the
short
by
-
way
.
if
I
have
take
a


hackney
-
chariot
and
go
by
the
street
,
I
should
have
miss
my
aim
;


go
as
I
do
,
I
catch
the
coach
just
as
it
come
out
of
the
yard
.
I


be
the
only
inside
passenger
,
jolt
away
knee
-
deep
in
straw
,
when
I


come
to
myself
.


for
I
really
have
not
be
myself
since
the
receipt
of
the
letter
;
it
have


so
bewilder
I
,
ensue
on
the
hurry
of
the
morning
.
the
morning
hurry


and
flutter
have
be
great
;
for
,
long
and
anxiously
as
I
have
wait
for


wemmick
,
his
hint
have
come
like
a
surprise
at
last
.
and
now
I
begin


to
wonder
at
myself
for
be
in
the
coach
,
and
to
doubt
whether
I
have


sufficient
reason
for
be
there
,
and
to
consider
whether
I
should


get
out
presently
and
go
back
,
and
to
argue
against
ever
heed
an


anonymous
communication
,
and
,
in
short
,
to
pass
through
all
those
phase


of
contradiction
and
indecision
to
which
I
suppose
very
few
hurried


people
be
stranger
.
still
,
the
reference
to
Provis
by
name
master


everything
.
I
reason
as
I
have
reason
already
without
know
it
,
-
if


that
be
reason
,
-
in
case
any
harm
should
befall
he
through
my
not


go
,
how
could
I
ever
forgive
myself
!


it
be
dark
before
we
get
down
,
and
the
journey
seem
long
and
dreary


to
I
,
who
could
see
little
of
it
inside
,
and
who
could
not
go
outside


in
my
disabled
state
.
avoid
the
Blue
Boar
,
I
put
up
at
an
inn
of


minor
reputation
down
the
town
,
and
order
some
dinner
.
while
it
be


prepare
,
I
go
to
Satis
House
and
inquire
for
Miss
Havisham
;
she
be


still
very
ill
,
though
consider
something
well
.


my
inn
have
once
be
a
part
of
an
ancient
ecclesiastical
house
,
and
I


dine
in
a
little
octagonal
common
-
room
,
like
a
font
.
as
I
be
not
able


to
cut
my
dinner
,
the
old

so
good
as
to
entertain


I
with
my

course
with
the
popular

deeply

deservedly
humble
as
I
muse
over
the
fire


for
an
hour
or
more
.
the
striking
of
the
clock
arouse
I
,
but
not
from


my
dejection
or
remorse
,

I
get
up
and
have
my
coat
fasten
round


my
neck
,
and
go
out
.
I
have
previously
seek
in
my
pocket
for
the


letter
,
that
I
might
refer
to
it
again
;
but
I
could
not
find
it
,
and


be
uneasy
to
think
that
it
must
have
be
drop
in
the
straw
of


the
coach
.
I
know
very
well
,
however
,
that
the
appoint
place
be
the


little
sluice
-
house
by
the
limekiln
on
the
marsh
,
and
the
hour
nine
.


towards
the
marsh
I
now
go
straight
,
have
no
time
to
spare
.


chapter
LIII


it
be
a
dark
night
,
though
the
full
moon
rise
as
I
leave
the
enclose


land
,
and
pass
out
upon
the
marsh
.
beyond
their
dark
line
there
be


a
ribbon
of
clear
sky
,
hardly
broad
enough
to
hold
the
red
large
moon
.


in
a
few
minute
she
have
ascend
out
of
that
clear
field
,
in
among
the


pile
mountain
of
cloud
.


there
be
a
melancholy
wind
,
and
the
marsh
be
very
dismal
.
a


stranger
would
have
find
they
insupportable
,
and
even
to
I
they
be


so
oppressive
that
I
hesitate
,
half
inclined
to
go
back
.
but
I
know


they
well
,
and
could
have
find
my
way
on
a
far
dark
night
,
and
have


no
excuse
for
return
,
be
there
.
so
,
having
come
there
against
my


inclination
,
I
go
on
against
it
.


the
direction
that
I
take
be
not
that
in
which
my
old
home
lie
,
nor


that
in
which
we
have
pursue
the
convict
.
my
back
be
turn
towards


the
distant
Hulks
as
I
walk
on
,
and
,
though
I
could
see
the
old
light


away
on
the
spit
of
sand
,
I
see
they
over
my
shoulder
.
I
know
the


limekiln
as
well
as
I
know
the
old
Battery
,
but
they
be
mile
apart
;


so
that
,
if
a
light
have
be
burn
at
each
point
that
night
,
there


would
have
be
a
long
strip
of
the
blank
horizon
between
the
two
bright


speck
.


at
first
,
I
have
to
shut
some
gate
after
I
,
and
now
and
then
to
stand


still
while
the
cattle
that
be
lie
in
the
bank
-
up
pathway
arise


and
blunder
down
among
the
grass
and
reed
.
but
after
a
little
while
I


seem
to
have
the
whole
flat
to
myself
.


it
be
another
half
-
hour
before
I
draw
near
to
the
kiln
.
the
lime
be


burn
with
a
sluggish
stifle
smell
,
but
the
fire
be
make
up
and


leave
,
and
no
workman
be
visible
.
hard
by
be
a
small
stone
-
quarry
.
it


lie
directly
in
my
way
,
and
have
be
work
that
day
,
as
I
see
by
the


tool
and
barrow
that
be
lie
about
.


come
up
again
to
the
marsh
level
out
of
this
excavation
,
-
for
the
rude


path
lie
through
it
,
-
I
see
a
light
in
the
old
sluice
-
house
.
I
quicken


my
pace
,
and
knock
at
the
door
with
my
hand
.
wait
for
some
reply
,


I
look
about
I
,
notice
how
the
sluice
be
abandon
and
break
,
and


how
the
house
-
of
wood
with
a
tile
roof
-
would
not
be
proof
against
the


weather
much
long
,
if
it
be
so
even
now
,
and
how
the
mud
and
ooze


be
coat
with
lime
,
and
how
the
choke
vapor
of
the
kiln
creep
in
a


ghostly
way
towards
I
.
still
there
be
no
answer
,
and
I
knock
again
.


no
answer
still
,
and
I
try
the
latch
.


it
rise
under
my
hand
,
and
the
door
yield
.
look
in
,
I
see
a
light


candle
on
a
table
,
a
bench
,
and
a
mattress
on
a
truckle
bedstead
.
as


there
be
a
loft
above
,
I
call
,
"
be
there
any
one
here
?
"
but
no
voice


answer
.
then
I
look
at
my
watch
,
and
,
find
that
it
be
past
nine
,


call
again
,
"
be
there
any
one
here
?
"
there
be
still
no
answer
,
I


go
out
at
the
door
,
irresolute
what
to
do
.


it
be
begin
to
rain
fast
.
see
nothing
save
what
I
have
see


already
,
I
turn
back
into
the
house
,
and
stand
just
within
the
shelter


of
the
doorway
,
look
out
into
the
night
.
while
I
be
consider
that


some
one
must
have
be
there
lately
and
must
soon
be
come
back
,
or


the
candle
would
not
be
burn
,
it
come
into
my
head
to
look
if
the


wick
be
long
.
I
turn
round
to
do
so
,
and
have
take
up
the
candle
in


my
hand
,
when
it
be
extinguish
by
some
violent
shock
;
and
the
next


thing
I
comprehend
be
,
that
I
have
be
catch
in
a
strong
running


noose
,
throw
over
my
head
from
behind
.


"
now
,
"
say
a
suppress
voice
with
an
oath
,
"
I
've
 
get

"
what
be
this

"
I
cry

"


not
only
be
my
arm
pull
close
to
my
side
,
but
the
pressure
on


my
bad
arm

I
exquisite
pain

I
strain
my
sight
upon

fall
among

I
could
only
see
his

would
do


as
he
have
do
in
my
sister

case

make
all
haste
to
the
town

slouch

pursue
he
to
the
town
,
make
a
picture
of
the
street
with
he
in
it
,


and
contrast
its
light
and
life
with
the
lonely
marsh
and
the
white


vapor
creep
over
it
,
into
which
I
should
have
dissolve
.


it
be
not
only
that
I
could
have
sum
up
year
and
year
and
year

he
say
a
dozen
word

that
what
he
do
say
presented
picture


to
I
,

not
mere
word
.
in
the
excited
and
exalted
state
of
my
brain
,


I
could
not
think
of
a
place
without
see
it
,
or
of
person
without


see
they
.
it
be
impossible
to
overstate
the
vividness
of
these


image

yet
I
be
so
intent
,
all
the
time

he
himself

who


would
not

intent
on
the
tiger

to
spring

I
know
of


the
slight
action
of
his
finger

when
he
have
drink
this
second
time

he
rise
from
the
bench
on
which


he
sit
,

push
the
table
aside

take
up
the
candle
,

shade
it
with
his
murderous
hand

throw
its

blind
I
,
and
turn
his
powerful
back
as
he
replace
the


light
on
the
table
.
I
have
think
a
prayer
,
and
have
be
with
Joe
and


Biddy
and
Herbert
,
before
he
turn
towards
I
again
.


there
be
a
clear
space
of
a
few
foot
between
the
table
and
the
opposite


wall
.
within
this
space
,
he
now
slouch
backwards
and
forwards
.
his


great
strength
seem
to
sit
strong
upon
he
than
ever
before
,
as
he


do
this
with
his
hand
hang
loose
and
heavy
at
his
side
,
and
with


his
eye
scowl
at
I
.
I
have
no
grain
of
hope
leave
.
wild
as
my
inward


hurry
be
,
and
wonderful
the
force
of
the
picture
that
rush
by
I


instead
of
thought
,
I
could
yet
clearly
understand
that
,
unless
he
have


resolve
that
I
be
within
a
few
moment
of
surely
perish
out
of
all


human
knowledge
,
he
would
never
have
tell
I
what
he
have
tell
.


of
a
sudden
,
he
stop
,
take
the
cork
out
of
his
bottle
,
and
toss


it
away
.
light
as
it
be
,
I
hear
it
fall
like
a
plummet
.
he
swallow


slowly
,
tilt
up
the
bottle
by
little
and
little
,
and
now
he
look
at


I
no
more
.
the
last
few
drop
of
liquor
he
pour
into
the
palm
of
his


hand
,
and
lick
up
.
then
,
with
a
sudden
hurry
of
violence
and
swear


horribly
,
he
throw
the
bottle
from
he
,
and
stoop
;
and
I
see
in
his


hand
a
stone
-
hammer
with
a
long
heavy
handle
.


the
resolution
I
have
make
do
not
desert
I
,
for
,
without
utter


one
vain
word
of
appeal
to
he
,
I
shout
out
with
all
my
might
,
and


struggle
with
all
my
might
.
it
be
only
my
head
and
my
leg
that
I


could
move
,
but
to
that
extent
I
struggle
with
all
the
force
,
until


then
unknown
,
that
be
within
I
.
in
the
same
instant
I
hear
responsive


shout
,
see
figure
and
a
gleam
of
light
dash
in
at
the
door
,
hear


voice
and
tumult
,
and
see
Orlick
emerge
from
a
struggle
of
man
,
as
if


it
be
tumble
water
,
clear
the
table
at
a
leap
,
and
fly
out
into
the


night
.


after
a
blank
,
I
find
that
I
be
lie
unbound
,
on
the
floor
,
in
the


same
place
,
with
my
head
on
some
one

knee

my
eye
be
fix
on
the

I

thus
as
I
recover
consciousness
,
I
know
that

I

the
light
I
have
see
come
in
at
the
door
.
but
,


the
moon
be
a
good
two
hour
high
than
when
I
have
last
see
the
sky
,


and
the
night
,
though
rainy
,
be
much
light
.
the
white
vapor
of
the


kiln
be
pass
from
we
as
we
go
by
,
and
as
I
have
think
a
prayer


before
,
I
think
a
thanksgiving
now
.


Entreating
Herbert
to
tell
I
how
he
have
come
to
my
rescue
,
-
which
at


first
he
have
flatly
refuse
to
do
,
but
have
insist
on
my
remain


quiet
,
-
I
learn
that
I
have
in
my
hurry
drop
the
letter
,
open
,
in
our


chamber
,
where
he
,
come
home
to
bring
with
he
startop
whom
he
have


meet
in
the
street
on
his
way
to
I
,
find
it
,
very
soon
after
I


be
go
.
its
tone
make
he
uneasy
,
and
the
more
so
because
of
the


inconsistency
between
it
and
the
hasty
letter
I
have
leave
for
he
.
his


uneasiness
increase
instead
of
subsiding
,
after
a
quarter
of
an


hour
's
consideration
,
he
set
off
for
the
coach
-
office
with
Startop
,
who


volunteer
his
company
,
to
make
inquiry
when
the
next
coach
go


down
.
find
that
the
afternoon
coach
be
go
,
and
find
that
his


uneasiness
grow
into
positive
alarm
,
as
obstacle
come
in
his
way
,
he


resolve
to
follow
in
a
post
-
chaise
.
so
he
and
Startop
arrive
at
the


Blue
Boar
,
fully
expect
there
to
find
I
,
or
tiding
of
I
;
but
,


find
neither
,
go
on
to
Miss
Havisham
's
,
where
they
lose
I
.


hereupon
they
go
back
to
the
hotel
 
doubtless
at
about
the
time
when


I
be
hear
the
popular
local
version
of
my
own
story
 
to
refresh


themselves
and
to
get
some
one
to
guide
they
out
upon
the
marsh
.
among


the
lounger
under
the
Boar
's
archway
happen
to
be
Trabb
's
boy
,
-
true


to
his
ancient
habit
of
happen
to
be
everywhere
where
he
have
no


business
,
-
and
Trabb
's
boy
have
see
I
pass
from
Miss
Havisham
's
in


the
direction
of
my
dining
-
place
.
thus
Trabb
's
boy
become
their
guide
,


and
with
he
they
go
out
to
the
sluice
-
house
,
though
by
the
town
way


to
the
marsh
,
which
I
have
avoid
.
now
,
as
they
go
along
,
Herbert


reflect
,
that
I
might
,
after
all
,
have
be
bring
there
on
some


genuine
and
serviceable
errand
tend
to
Provis
's
safety
,
and
,


bethink
himself
that
in
that
case
interruption
must
be
mischievous
,


leave
his
guide
and
Startop
on
the
edge
of
the
quarry
,
and
go
on
by


himself
,
and
steal
round
the
house
two
or
three
time
,
endeavour
to


ascertain
whether
all
be
right
within
.
as
he
could
hear
nothing
but


indistinct
sound
of
one
deep
rough
voice
 
this
be
while
my
mind
be
so


busy
,
he
even
at
last
begin
to
doubt
whether
I
be
there
,
when
suddenly


I
cry
out
loudly
,
and
he
answer
the
cry
,
and
rush
in
,
closely


follow
by
the
other
two
.


when
I
tell
Herbert
what
have
pass
within
the
house
,
he
be
for
our


immediately
go
before
a
magistrate
in
the
town
,
late
at
night
as
it


be
,
and
get
out
a
warrant
.
but
,
I
have
already
consider
that
such


a
course
,
by
detain
we
there
,
or
bind
we
to
come
back
,
might


be
fatal
to
Provis
.
there
be
no
gainsay
this
difficulty
,
and
we


relinquish
all
thought
of
pursue
Orlick
at
that
time
.
for
the


present
,
under
the
circumstance
,
we
deem
it
prudent
to
make
rather


light
of
the
matter
to
Trabb
's
boy
;
who
,
I
be
convince
,
would
have
be


much
affect
by
disappointment
,
if
he
have
know
that
his
intervention


save
I
from
the
limekiln
.
not
that
Trabb
's
boy
be
of
a
malignant


nature
,
but
that
he
have
too
much
spare
vivacity
,
and
that
it
be
in
his


constitution
to
want
variety
and
excitement
at
anybody
's
expense
.
when


we
part
,
I
present
he
with
two
guinea
 
which
seem
to
meet
his


view
,
and
tell
he
that
I
be
sorry
ever
to
have
have
an
ill
opinion
of


he
 
which
make
no
impression
on
he
at
all
.


Wednesday
be
so
close
upon
we
,
we
determine
to
go
back
to
London


that
night
,
three
in
the
post
-
chaise
;
the
rather
,
as
we
should
then
be


clear
away
before
the
night
's
adventure
begin
to
be
talk
of
.
Herbert


get
a
large
bottle
of
stuff
for
my
arm
;
and
by
dint
of
have
this
stuff


drop
over
it
all
the
night
through
,
I
be
just
able
to
bear
its
pain


on
the
journey
.
it
be
daylight
when
we
reach
the
Temple
,
and
I
go


at
once
to
bed
,
and
lie
in
bed
all
day
.


my
terror
,
as
I
lie
there
,
of
fall
ill
,
and
be
unfit
for


tomorrow
,
be
so
beset
,
that
I
wonder
it
do
not
disable
I
of


itself
.
it
would
have
do
so
,
pretty
surely
,
in
conjunction
with
the


mental
wear
and
tear
I
have
suffer
,
but
for
the
unnatural
strain
upon


I
that
to
-
morrow
be
.
so
anxiously
look
forward
to
,
charge
with
such


consequence
,
its
result
so
impenetrably
hide
,
though
so
near
.


no
precaution
could
have
be
more
obvious
than
our
refraining


from
communication
with
he
that
day
;
yet
this
again
increase
my


restlessness
.
I
start
at
every
footstep
and
every
sound
,
believe


that
he
be
discover
and
take
,
and
this
be
the
messenger
to
tell


I
so
.
I
persuade
myself
that
I
know
he
be
take
;
that
there
be


something
more
upon
my
mind
than
a
fear
or
a
presentiment
;
that
the
fact


have
occur
,
and
I
have
a
mysterious
knowledge
of
it
.
as
the
day
wear


on
,
and
no
ill
news
come
,
as
the
day
close
in
and
darkness
fall
,


my
overshadow
dread
of
be
disable
by
illness
before
to
-
morrow


morning
altogether
master
I
.
my
burn
arm
throbbed
,
and
my
burning


head
throbbed
,
and
I
fancy
I
be
begin
to
wander
.
I
count
up
to


high
number
,
to
make
sure
of
myself
,
and
repeat
passage
that
I
know


in
prose
and
verse
.
it
happen
sometimes
that
in
the
mere
escape
of
a


fatigued
mind
,
I
doze
for
some
moment
or
forgot
;
then
I
would
say
to


myself
with
a
start
,
"
now
it
have
come
,
and
I
be
turn
delirious

about
midnight

get
out
of

the

the
winking


light
upon
the
bridge

already
pale

by

coldly
gray

here
and
there


at
top
a
warm
touch
from
the
burning
in

look
along


the
cluster

into

LIV


it
be
one
of
those
March
day
when
the
sun
shine
hot
and
the
wind


blow
cold
:
when
it
be
summer
in
the
light
,
and
winter
in
the
shade
.


we
have
out
pea
-
coat
with
we
,
and
I
take
a
bag
.
of
all
my
worldly


possession
I
take
no
more
than
the
few
necessary
that
fill
the


bag
.
where
I
might
go
,
what
I
might
do
,
or
when
I
might
return
,
be


question
utterly
unknown
to
I
;
nor
do
I
vex
my
mind
with
they
,
for


it
be
wholly
set
on
Provis
's
safety
.
I
only
wonder
for
the
pass


moment
,
as
I
stop
at
the
door
and
look
back
,
under
what
alter


circumstance
I
should
next
see
those
room
,
if
ever
.


we
loiter
down
to
the
Temple
stair
,
and
stand
loiter
there
,
as
if


we
be
not
quite
decide
to
go
upon
the
water
at
all
.
of
course
,
I
have


take
care
that
the
boat
should
be
ready
and
everything
in
order
.
after


a
little
show
of
indecision
,
which
there
be
none
to
see
but
the
two


or
three
amphibious
creature
belong
to
our
Temple
stair
,
we
go


on
board
and
cast
off
;
Herbert
in
the
bow
,
I
steer
.
it
be
then
about


high
-
water
,
-
half
-
past
eight
.


our
plan
be
this
.
the
tide
,
begin
to
run
down
at
nine
,
and
be


with
we
until
three
,
we
intend
still
to
creep
on
after
it
have
turn
,


and
row
against
it
until
dark
.
we
should
then
be
well
in
those
long


reach
below
Gravesend
,
between
Kent
and
Essex
,
where
the
river
be


broad
and
solitary
,
where
the
water
-
side
inhabitant
be
very
few
,
and


where
lone
public
-
house
be
scatter
here
and
there
,
of
which
we
could


choose
one
for
a
resting
-
place
.
there
,
we
mean
to
lie
by
all
night
.


the
steamer
for
Hamburg
and
the
steamer
for
Rotterdam
would
start
from


London
at
about
nine
on
Thursday
morning
.
we
should
know
at
what
time


to
expect
they
,
accord
to
where
we
be
,
and
would
hail
the
first
;


so
that
,
if
by

I
have

the

by
any
boat

if
we
have
be
wait

by

I
should
have
run

have
oblige

to
go
on

to

purpose
evident

we
hold
our
own
without
any
appearance
of


molestation
.


he
have
his
boat
-
cloak
on
he
,
and
look
,
as
I
have
say
,
a
natural
part


of
the
scene
.
it
be
remarkable
 
but
perhaps
the
wretched
life
he
have


lead
account
for
it
 
that
he
be
the
least
anxious
of
any
of
we
.
he


be
not
indifferent
,
for
he
tell
I
that
he
hope
to
live
to
see
his


gentleman
one
of
the
good
of
gentleman
in
a
foreign
country
;
he
be
not


disposed
to
be
passive
or
resign
,
as
I
understand
it
;
but
he
have
no


notion
of
meet
danger
half
way
.
when
it
come
upon
he
,
he
confront


it
,
but
it
must
come
before
he
trouble
himself
.


"
if
you
know
,

"
he
say
to
I
,
"
what
it
be
to
sit
here

I

inconsistent
,

,
for
any
mastering
idea
,
he


should
have
endanger
his
freedom
,
and
even
his
life
.
but
I
reflect


that
perhaps
freedom
without
danger
be
too
much
apart
from
all
the


habit
of
his
existence
to
be
to
he
what
it
would
be
to
another
man
.
I


be
not
far
out
,
since
he
say
,
after
smoke
a
little
:
-


"

he
dip
his
hand
in
the
water
over
the
boat
's
gunwale
,
and
say
,


smile
with
that
soften
air
upon
he
which
be
not

he
put
his
pipe
back
in
his
mouth
with
an
undisturbed
expression
of


face

sit
as
compose

content
as

quietly

down
again

cold
upon
the
river

it
be
a
bright
day
,

the


sunshine
be
very
cheer
.

tide

strong
,
I
take
care
to
lose


none
of
it
,
and
our
steady
stroke
carry
we
on
thoroughly
well
.
by


imperceptible
degree
,
as
the
tide
run
out

lose
more

more
of
the


near
wood

hill

drop
low

low
between
the
muddy


bank

the
tide
be

with
we
when
we
be
off
Gravesend
.
as
our


charge
be
wrap
in
his
cloak

I
purposely
pass
within
a
boat
or


two
's
length
of
the
float
Custom
House
,

so
out
to
catch
the


stream
,
alongside
of
two
emigrant
ship
,

under
the
bow
of
a
large


transport
with
troop
on
the
forecastle
look
down
at
we

the
tide
begin
to
slacken
,

the
craft
lie
at
anchor
to
swing
,


and
presently
they
have
all
swung
round
,

the
ship
that
be
take


advantage
of
the
new
tide
to
get
up
to
the
Pool
begin
to
crowd
upon
we


in
a
fleet
,

we
keep
under
the
shore
,
as
much
out
of
the
strength
of


the
tide

carefully
off
from

oarsman

so
fresh

of
having
occasionally
let
she
drive


with
the
tide
for
a
minute
or
two
,

a
quarter
of
an
hour
's
rest


prove
full
as
much
as
they
want
.

get
ashore
among
some
slippery


stone

we
eat
and
drink
what
we
have
with
we
,
and
look
about
.


it
be
like
my
own
marsh
country
,
flat
and
monotonous
,
and
with
a


dim
horizon
;
while
the
winding
river
turn
and
turn
,
and
the
great


float
buoy
upon
it
turn
and
turn
,
and
everything
else
seem


strand
and
still
.
for
now
the
last
of
the
fleet
of
ship
be
round


the
last
low
point
we
have
head
;
and
the
last
green
barge
,
straw
-
laden
,


with
a
brown
sail
,
have
follow
;
and
some
ballast
-
lighter
,
shape
like


a
child
's
first
rude
imitation
of
a
boat
,
lay
low
in
the
mud
;
and
a


little
squat
shoal
-
lighthouse
on
open
pile
stand
crippled
in
the
mud


on
stilt
and
crutch
;
and
slimy
stake
stick
out
of
the
mud
,
and
slimy


stone
stick
out
of
the
mud
,
and
red
landmark
and
tidemark
stick


out
of
the
mud
,
and
an
old
landing
-
stage
and
an
old
roofless
building


slip
into
the
mud
,
and
all
about
we
be
stagnation
and
mud
.


we
push
off
again
,
and
make
what
way
we
could
.
it
be
much
hard
work


now
,
but
Herbert
and
Startop
persevere
,
and
row
and
row
and
row


until
the
sun
go
down
.
by
that
time
the
river
have
lift
we
a
little
,


so
that
we
could
see
above
the
bank
.
there
be
the
red
sun
,
on
the
low


level
of
the
shore
,
in
a
purple
haze
,
fast
deepen
into
black
;
and


there
be
the
solitary
flat
marsh
;
and
far
away
there
be
the
rise


ground
,
between
which
and
we
there
seem
to
be
no
life
,
save
here
and


there
in
the
foreground
a
melancholy
gull
.


as
the
night
be
fast
fall
,
and
as
the
moon
,
be
past
the
full
,


would
not
rise
early
,
we
hold
a
little
council
;
a
short
one
,
for
clearly


our
course
be
to
lie
by
at
the
first
lonely
tavern
we
could
find
.
so
,


they
ply
their
oar
once
more
,
and
I
look
out
for
anything
like
a


house
.
thus
we
hold
on
,
speak
little
,
for
four
or
five
dull
mile
.
it


be
very
cold
,
and
,
a
collier
come
by
we
,
with
her
galley
-
fire
smoking


and
flaring
,
look
like
a
comfortable
home
.
the
night
be
as
dark
by


this
time
as
it
would
be
until
morning
;
and
what
light
we
have
,
seem


to
come
more
from
the
river
than
the
sky
,
as
the
oar
in
their
dipping


strike
at
a
few
reflect
star
.


at
this
dismal
time
we
be
evidently
all
possess
by
the
idea
that


we
be
follow
.
as
the
tide
make
,
it
flap
heavily
at
irregular


interval
against
the
shore
;
and
whenever
such
a
sound
come
,
one
or


other
of
we
be
sure
to
start
,
and
look
in
that
direction
.
here
and


there
,
the
set
of
the
current
have
wear
down
the
bank
into
a
little


creek
,
and
we
be
all
suspicious
of
such
place
,
and
eye
they


nervously
.
sometimes
,
"
what
be
that
ripple
?
"
one
of
we
would
say
in
a


low
voice
.
or
another
,
"
be
that
a
boat
yonder
?
"
and
afterwards
we
would


fall
into
a
dead
silence
,
and
I
would
sit
impatiently
think
with
what


an
unusual
amount
of
noise
the
oar
work
in
the
thowel
.


at
length
we
descry
a
light
and
a
roof
,
and
presently
afterwards
run


alongside
a
little
causeway
make
of
stone
that
have
be
pick
up
hard


by
.
leave
the
rest
in
the
boat
,
I
step
ashore
,
and
find
the
light


to
be
in
a
window
of
a
public
-
house
.
it
be
a
dirty
place
enough
,
and
I


dare
say
not
unknown
to
smuggling
adventurer
;
but
there
be
a
good


fire
in
the
kitchen
,
and
there
be
egg
and
bacon
to
eat
,
and
various


liquor
to
drink
.
also
,
there

the
landlord
say
.
no
other
company
be
in
the
house
than


the
landlord
,
his
wife
,
and
a
grizzle
male
creature
,
the
"
Jack
"
of
the


little
causeway

be
as
slimy

smeary
as

he
have
be
low

water


mark
too
.


with
this
assistant
,
I
go
down
to
the
boat
again
,
and
we
all
come


ashore
,
and
bring
out
the
oar
,
and
rudder
and
boat
-
hook
,
and
all


else
,
and
haul
she
up
for
the
night
.
we
make
a
very
good
meal
by
the


kitchen
fire
,
and
then
apportion
the
bedroom
:
Herbert
and
Startop


be
to
occupy
one
;
I
and
our
charge

other

we
find
the
air
as


carefully
exclude
from
both
,
as
if
air
be
fatal
to
life
;
and
there


be
more
dirty

and
bandbox
under
the
bed
than
I
should
have


think
the
family
possess
.

we
consider
ourselves
well
off
,


notwithstanding
,
for
a
more
solitary
place

could
not

the

no

find
it
impracticable
to
pursue
the
subject

this
dialogue
make
we
all
uneasy
,

I
very
uneasy
.
the
dismal
wind


be
mutter
round
the
house
,
the
tide
be
flap
at
the
shore
,
and


I
have
a
feeling
that
we
be
cage
and
threaten
.
a
four
-
oared
galley


hover
about
in
so
unusual
a
way
as
to
attract
this
notice
be
an
ugly


circumstance
that
I
could
not
get
rid
of
.
when
I
have
induce
Provis
to


go
up
to
bed

I
go
outside
with
my
two
companion
 
Startop
by
this


time
know
the
state
of
the
case
,
and
hold
another
council
.
whether
we


should
remain
at
the
house
until
near
the
steamer
's
time
,
which
would


be
about
one
in
the
afternoon
,
or
whether
we
should
put
off
early
in
the


morning
,
be
the
question
we
discuss
.
on
the
whole
we
deem
it
the


well
course
to
lie
where
we
be
,
until
within
an
hour
or
so
of
the


steamer
's
time
,
and
then
to
get
out
in
her
track
,
and
drift
easily
with


the
tide
.
having
settle
to
do
this
,
we
return
into
the
house
and
go


to
bed
.


I
lie
down
with
the
great
part
of
my
clothe
on
,
and
sleep
well
for
a


few
hour
.
when
I
awake
,
the
wind
have
rise
,
and
the
sign
of
the
house


 
the
Ship
 
be
creak
and
bang
about
,
with
noise
that
startle


I
.
rise
softly
,
for
my
charge
lie
fast
asleep
,
I
look
out
of
the


window
.
it
command
the
causeway
where
we
have
haul
up
our
boat
,
and
,


as
my
eye
adapt
themselves
to
the
light
of
the
clouded
moon
,
I
see


two
man
look
into
she
.
they
pass
by
under
the
window
,
look
at


nothing
else
,
and
they
do
not
go
down
to
the
landing
-
place
which
I


could
discern
to
be
empty
,
but
strike
across
the
marsh
in
the
direction


of
the
Nore
.


my
first
impulse
be
to
call
up
Herbert
,
and
show
he
the
two
man
go


away
.
but
reflect
,
before
I
get
into
his
room
,
which
be
at
the
back


of
the
house
and
adjoin
mine
,
that
he
and
Startop
have
have
a
hard
day


than
I
,
and
be
fatigued
,
I
forbore
.
go
back
to
my
window
,
I
could


see
the
two
man
move
over
the
marsh
.
in
that
light
,
however
,
I
soon


lose
they
,
and
,
feel
very
cold
,
lie
down
to
think
of
the
matter
,
and


fall
asleep
again
.


we
be
up
early
.
as
we
walk
to
and
fro
,
all
four
together
,
before


breakfast
,
I
deem
it
right
to
recount
what
I
have
see
.
again
our


charge
be
the
least
anxious
of
the
party
.
it
be
very
likely
that
the


man
belong
to
the
Custom
House
,
he
say
quietly
,
and
that
they
have
no


think
of
we
.
I
try
to
persuade
myself
that
it
be
so
,
-
as
,
indeed
,


it
might
easily
be
.
however
,
I
propose
that
he
and
I
should
walk
away


together
to
a
distant
point
we
could
see
,
and
that
the
boat
should
take


we
aboard
there
,
or
as
near
there
as
might
prove
feasible
,
at
about


noon
.
this
be
consider
a
good
precaution
,
soon
after
breakfast
he


and
I
set
forth
,
without
say
anything
at
the
tavern
.


he
smoke
his
pipe
as
we
go
along
,
and
sometimes
stop
to
clap
I
on


the
shoulder
.
one
would
have
suppose
that
it
be
I
who
be
in
danger
,


not
he
,
and
that
he
be
reassure
I
.
we
speak
very
little
.
as
we


approach
the
point
,
I
beg
he
to
remain
in
a
sheltered
place
,
while


I
go
on
to
reconnoitre
;
for
it
be
towards
it
that
the
man
have
pass


in
the
night
.
he
comply
,
and
I
go
on
alone
.
there
be
no
boat
off


the
point
,
nor
any
boat
draw
up
anywhere
near
it
,
nor
be
there
any


sign
of
the
man
having
embark
there
.
but
,
to
be
sure
,
the
tide
be


high
,
and
there
might
have
be
some
footpint
under
water
.


when
he
look
out
from
his
shelter
in
the
distance
,
and
see
that
I


wave
my
hat
to
he
to
come
up
,
he
rejoin
I
,
and
there
we
wait
;


sometimes
lie
on
the
bank
,
wrap
in
our
coat
,
and
sometimes
move


about
to
warm
ourselves
,
until
we
see
our
boat
come
round
.
we
get


aboard
easily
,
and
row
out
into
the
track
of
the
steamer
.
by
that
time


it
want
but
ten
minute
of
one
o'clock
,
and
we
begin
to
look
out
for


her
smoke
.


but
,
it
be
half
-
past
one
before
we
see
her
smoke
,
and
soon
afterwards


we
see
behind
it
the
smoke
of
another
steamer
.
as
they
be
come
on


at
full
speed
,
we
get
the
two
bag
ready
,
and
take
that
opportunity


of
say
good
by
to
Herbert
and
Startop
.
we
have
all
shake
hand


cordially
,
and
neither
Herbert
's
eye
nor
mine
be
quite
dry
,
when
I


see
a
four
-
oared
galley
shoot
out
from
under
the
bank
but
a
little
way


ahead
of
we
,
and
row
out
into
the
same
track
.


a
stretch
of
shore
have
be
as
yet
between
we
and
the
steamer
's
smoke
,


by
reason
of
the
bend
and
wind
of
the
river
;
but
now
she
be
visible
,


come
head
on
.
I
call
to
Herbert
and
Startop
to
keep
before
the
tide
,


that
she
might
see
we
lie
by
for
she
,
and
I
adjure
Provis
to
sit


quite
still
,
wrap
in
his
cloak
.
he
answer
cheerily
,
"
trust
to
I
,


dear
boy
,
"
and
sit
like
a
statue
.
meantime
the
galley
,
which
be
very


skilfully
handle
,
have
cross
we
,
let
we
come
up
with
she
,
and
fall


alongside
.
leave
just
room
enough
for
the
play
of
the
oar
,
she
keep


alongside
,
drift
when
we
drift
,
and
pull
a
stroke
or
two
when
we


pull
.
of
the
two
sitter
one
hold
the
rudder
-
line
,
and
look
at
we


attentively
,
-
as
do
all
the
rower
;
the
other
sitter
be
wrap
up
,


much
as
Provis
be
,
and
seem
to
shrink
,
and
whisper
some
instruction


to
the
steerer
as
he
look
at
we
.
not
a
word
be
speak
in
either
boat
.


Startop
could
make
out
,
after
a
few
minute
,
which
steamer
be
first
,


and
give
I
the
word
"
Hamburg
,
"
in
a
low
voice
,
as
we
sit
face
to
face
.


she
be
near
we
very
fast
,
and
the
beating
of
her
peddle
grow
louder


and
louder
.
I
feel
as
if
her
shadow
be
absolutely
upon
we
,
when
the


galley
hail
we
.
I
answer
.


"
you
have
a
return
transport
there
,
"
say
the
man
who
hold
the
line
.


"
that
be
the
man
,
wrap
in
the
cloak
.
his
name
be
Abel
Magwitch
,


otherwise
Provis
.
I
apprehend
that
man
,
and
call
upon
he
to
surrender
,


and
you
to
assist
.
"


at
the
same
moment
,
without
give
any
audible
direction
to
his
crew
,


he
run
the
galley
abroad
of
we
.
they
have
pull
one
sudden
stroke
ahead
,


have
get
their
oar
in
,
have
run
athwart
we
,
and
be
hold
on
to


our
gunwale
,
before
we
know
what
they
be
do
.
this
cause
great


confusion
on
board
the
steamer
,
and
I
hear
they
call
to
we
,
and


hear
the
order
give
to
stop
the
paddle
,
and
hear
they
stop
,
but
feel


her
drive
down
upon
we
irresistibly
.
in
the
same
moment
,
I
see
the


steersman
of
the
galley
lie
his
hand
on
his
prisoner
's
shoulder
,
and
see


that
both
boat
be
swinge
round
with
the
force
of
the
tide
,
and


see
that
all
hand
on
board
the
steamer
be
run
forward
quite


frantically
.
still
,
in
the
same
moment
,
I
see
the
prisoner
start


up
,
lean
across
his
captor
,
and
pull
the
cloak
from
the
neck
of
the


shrink
sitter
in
the
galley
.
still
in
the
same
moment
,
I
see
that
the


face
disclose
,
be
the
face
of
the
other
convict
of
long
ago
.
still
,
in


the
same
moment
,
I
see
the
face
tilt
backward
with
a
white
terror
on
it


that
I
shall
never
forget
,
and
hear
a
great
cry
on
board
the
steamer
,


and
a
loud
splash
in
the
water
,
and
feel
the
boat
sink
from
under
I
.


it
be
but
for
an
instant
that
I
seem
to
struggle
with
a
thousand


mill
-
weir
and
a
thousand
flash
of
light
;
that
instant
past
,
I
be


take
on
board
the
galley
.
Herbert
be
there
,
and
Startop
be
there
;
but


our
boat
be
go
,
and
the
two
convict
be
go
.


what
with
the
cry
aboard
the
steamer
,
and
the
furious
blow
off
of


her
steam
,
and
her
drive
on
,
and
our
drive
on
,
I
could
not
at
first


distinguish
sky
from
water
or
shore
from
shore
;
but
the
crew
of
the


galley
right
she
with
great
speed
,
and
,
pull
certain
swift
strong


stroke
ahead
,
lie
upon
their
oar
,
every
man
look
silently
and


eagerly
at
the
water
astern
.
presently
a
dark
object
be
see
in
it
,


bearing
towards
we
on
the
tide
.
no
man
speak
,
but
the
steersman
hold
up


his
hand
,
and
all
softly
back
water
,
and
keep
the
boat
straight
and


true
before
it
.
as
it
come
near
,
I
see
it
to
be
Magwitch
,
swimming
,


but
not
swim
freely
.
he
be
take
on
board
,
and
instantly
manacle


at
the
wrist
and
ankle
.


the
galley
be
keep
steady
,
and
the
silent
,
eager
look
-
out
at
the
water


be
resume
.
but
,
the
Rotterdam
steamer
now
come
up
,
and
apparently
not


understand
what
have
happen
,
come
on
at
speed
.
by
the
time
she
have


be
hail
and
stop
,
both
steamer
be
drift
away
from
we
,
and


we
be
rise
and
fall
in
a
troubled
wake
of
water
.
the
look
-
out
be


keep
,
long
after
all
be
still
again
and
the
two
steamer
be
go
;
but


everybody
know
that
it
be
hopeless
now
.


at
length
we
give
it
up
,
and
pull
under
the
shore
towards
the
tavern


we
have
lately
leave
,
where
we
be
receive
with
no
little
surprise
.
here


I
be
able
to
get
some
comfort
for
Magwitch
,
-
provis
no
long
,
-
who


have
receive
some
very
severe
injury
in
the
Chest
,
and
a
deep
cut
in
the


head
.


he
tell
I
that
he
believe
himself
to
have
go
under
the
keel
of
the


steamer
,
and
to
have
be
strike
on
the
head
in
rise
.
the
injury
to


his
chest
 
which
render
his
breathing
extremely
painful
 
he
think


he
have
receive
against
the
side
of
the
galley
.
he
add
that
he
do
not


pretend
to
say
what
he
might
or
might
not
have
do
to
Compeyson
,
but


that
,
in
the
moment
of
his
lay
his
hand
on
his
cloak
to
identify
he
,


that
villain
have
stagger
up
and
stagger
back
,
and
they
have
both
go


overboard
together
,
when
the
sudden
wrenching
of
he
 
Magwitch
 
out
of


our
boat
,
and
the
endeavor
of
his
captor
to
keep
he
in
it
,
have
capsize


we
.
he
tell
I
in
a
whisper
that
they
have
go
down
fiercely
lock
in


each
other
's
arm
,
and
that
there
have
be
a
struggle
under
water
,
and


that
he
have
disengage
himself
,
strike
out
,
and
swum
away
.


I
never
have
any
reason
to
doubt
the
exact
truth
of
what
he
thus
tell
I
.


the
officer
who
steer
the
galley
give
the
same
account
of
their
go


overboard
.


when
I
ask
this
officer
's
permission
to
change
the
prisoner
's


wet
clothe
by
purchase
any
spare
garment
I
could
get
at
the


public
-
house
,
he
give
it
readily
:
merely
observe
that
he
must
take


charge
of
everything
his
prisoner
have
about
he
.
so
the
pocket
-
book


which
have
once
be
in
my
hand
pass
into
the
officer
's
.
he
far


give
I
leave
to
accompany
the
prisoner
to
London
;
but
decline
to


accord
that
grace
to
my
two
friend
.


the
Jack
at
the
Ship
be
instruct
where
the
drown
man
have
go


down
,
and
undertake
to
search
for
the
body
in
the
place
where
it
be


likeliest
to
come
ashore
.
his
interest
in
its
recovery
seem
to
I
to


be
much
heighten
when
he
hear
that
it
have
stocking
on
.
probably
,
it


take
about
a
dozen
drown
man
to
fit
he
out
completely
;
and
that
may


have
be
the
reason
why
the
different
article
of
his
dress
be
in


various
stage
of
decay
.


we
remain
at
the
public
-
house
until
the
tide
turn
,
and
then
Magwitch


be
carry
down
to
the
galley
and
put
on
board
.
Herbert
and
Startop


be
to
get
to
London
by
land
,
as
soon
as
they
could
.
we
have
a
doleful


parting
,
and
when
I
take
my
place
by
Magwitch
's
side
,
I
feel
that
that


be
my
place
henceforth
while
he
live
.


for
now
,
my
repugnance
to
he
have
all
melt
away
;
and
in
the
Hunted
,


wound
,
shackle
creature
who
hold
my
hand
in
his

I
only
see
a
man


who
have
mean
to
be
my
benefactor
,

who
have
feel
affectionately

gratefully

great
constancy

well
man

I

his
breathing
become
more
difficult

painful
as
the
night
draw
on
,


and
often
he
could
not
repress
a
groan
.
I
try
to
rest
he
on
the
arm


I
could
use
,
in
any
easy
position
;
but
it
be
dreadful
to
think
that


I
could
not
be
sorry
at
heart
for
his
be
badly
hurt
,
since
it
be


unquestionably
well
that
he
should
die
.
that
there
be
,
still
live
,


people
enough
who
be
able
and
willing
to
identify
he
,
I
could
not


doubt
.
that
he
would
be
leniently
treat
,
I
could
not
hope
.
he
who
have


be
present
in
the
bad
light
at
his
trial

be

have
return
from
transportation

who
have
occasion
the
death
of
the
man

the

having
"

he
do
not
conceal


from
I
that
,

there
might
be
many
case
in

the

would
not

exact

there
be
no
circumstance
in
this
case
to
make


it
one
of
they

that
very

be
not
relate

his

no
writing

settlement
in
my
favor
before
his
apprehension

to
do
so
now
would
be
idle

I
have
no
claim

I
finally

the
resolution

heart

never

sicken
with
the
hopeless
task
of
attempt

there
appear
to

reason
for

hope
for
a
reward

what
a
fortune
for
the
son

"


on
the
Saturday
in
that
same
week
,
I
take
my
leave
of
Herbert
,
-
full


of
bright
hope
,
but
sad
and
sorry
to
leave
I
,
-
as
he
sit
on
one
of
the


seaport
mail
coach
.
I
go
into
a
coffee
-
house
to
write
a
little
note


to
Clara
,
tell
she
he
have
go
off
,
send
his
love
to
she
over
and


over
again
,
and
then
go
to
my
lonely
home
,
-
if
it
deserve
the
name
;


for
it
be
now
no
home
to
I
,
and
I
have
no
home
anywhere
.


on
the
stair
I
encounter
Wemmick
,
who
be
come
down
,
after
an


unsuccessful
application
of
his
knuckle
to
my
door
.
I
have
not
see
he


alone
since
the
disastrous
issue
of
the
attempt
flight
;
and
he
have


come
,
in
his
private
and
personal
capacity
,
to
say
a
few
word
of


explanation
in
reference
to
that
failure
.


"
the
late
Compeyson
,
"
say
Wemmick
,
"
have
by
little
and
little
get
at
the


bottom
of
half
of
the
regular
business
now
transact
;
and
it
be
from


the
talk
of
some
of
his
people
in
trouble
 
some
of
his
people
be


always
in
trouble
 
that
I
hear
what
I
do
.
I
keep
my
ear
open
,
seem


to
have
they
shut
,
until
I
hear
that
he
be
absent
,
and
I
think
that


would
be
the
good
time
for
make
the
attempt
.
I
can
only
suppose
now
,


that
it
be
a
part
of
his
policy
,
as
a
very
clever
man
,
habitually
to


deceive
his
own
instrument

you
do
n't
 
blame
I

I
hope
,
Mr.

"
I
be

Wemmick

you
can

you
most


earnestly

your

"


"
thank
you

you
very

it

a

say
Wemmick
,


scratch
his
head
,
"
and
I
assure
you
I
have
n't
 
be
so
cut
up
for
a


long
time

what
I
look
at

the
sacrifice

so
much
portable
property

I
!
"


"
what
I
think

Wemmick

the
poor
owner

the
property

"


"
yes
,

be
sure
,
"
say
Wemmick
.
"
of
course
,
there
can
be
no
objection


to
your
be
sorry
for
he

I
'd
put
down
a
five
-
pound
note
myself


to
get
he
out
of
it
.
but
what
I
look
at
be
this
.
the
late
Compeyson


having
be
beforehand
with
he
in
intelligence
of
his
return
,
and
be


so
determined
to
bring
he
to
book
,
I
do
not
think
he
could
have
be


save
.
whereas
,
the
portable
property
certainly
could
have
be
save

that
be
the
difference
between
the
property

owner

n't
 
you


see

"


I
invite
Wemmick
to
come
up

refresh
himself
with
a
glass

on
the
Monday


morning

up

put


it
over

suddenly
,

"

there
be
nothing
very
surprising
in
that
;

again
,
I
be
rather


surprised

when
he
say
,
as
if
he
be
animate
by
a
brilliant
idea
,
-


"

we
go
in

his
fishing

in
the
porch

look
all


round

strong
suspicion

into
certainty

I
beheld
the

enter
at

so
much


difficulty

his
glove
on

that
Wemmick
find
it
necessary


to
put
he
with
his
back
against
a
pillar

behind

he
lie
in
prison
very
ill
,
during
the
whole
interval
between
his


committal
for
trial
and
the
come
round
of
the
Sessions
.
he
have
break


two
rib
,
they
have
wound
one
of
his
lung
,
and
he
breathe
with
great


pain
and
difficulty
,
which
increase
daily
.
it
be
a
consequence
of
his


hurt
that
he
speak
so
low
as
to
be
scarcely
audible
;
therefore
he
speak


very
little
.
but
he
be
ever
ready
to
listen
to
I
;
and
it
become
the


first
duty
of
my
life
to
say
to
he
,
and
read
to
he
,
what
I
know
he


ought
to
hear
.


be
far
too
ill
to
remain
in
the
common
prison
,
he
be
remove
,
after


the
first
day
or
so
,
into
the
infirmary
.
this
give
I
opportunity


of
be
with
he
that
I
could
not
otherwise
have
have
.
and
but
for


his
illness
he
would
have
be
put
in
iron
,
for
he
be
regard
as
a


determine
prison
-
breaker
,
and
I
know
not
what
else
.


although
I
see
he
every
day
,
it
be
for
only
a
short
time
;
hence
,
the


regularly
recur
space
of
our
separation
be
long
enough
to
record


on
his
face
any
slight
change
that
occur
in
his
physical
state
.
I


do
not
recollect
that
I
once
see
any
change
in
it
for
the
well
;
he


waste
,
and
become
slowly
weak
and
bad
,
day
by
day
,
from
the
day


when
the
prison
door
close
upon
he
.


the
kind
of
submission
or
resignation
that
he
show
be
that
of
a
man


who
be
tired
out
.
I
sometimes
derive
an
impression
,
from
his
manner


or
from
a
whispered
word
or
two
which
escape
he
,
that
he
ponder


over
the
question
whether
he
might
have
be
a
well
man
under
well


circumstance
.
but
he
never
justify
himself
by
a
hint
tend
that


way
,
or
try
to
bend
the
past
out
of
its
eternal
shape
.


it
happen
on
two
or
three
occasion
in
my
presence
,
that
his
desperate


reputation
be
allude
to
by
one
or
other
of
the
people
in
attendance
on


he
.
a
smile
cross
his
face
then
,
and
he
turn
his
eye
on
I
with


a
trustful
look
,
as
if
he
be
confident
that
I
have
see
some
small


redeem
touch
in
he
,
even
so
long
ago
as
when
I
be
a
little
child
.


as
to
all
the
rest
,
he
be
humble
and
contrite
,
and
I
never
know
he


complain
.


when
the
Sessions
come
round
,
Mr.
Jaggers
cause
an
application
to
be


make
for
the
postponement
of
his
trial
until
the
follow
Sessions
.
it


be
obviously
make
with
the
assurance
that
he
could
not
live
so
long
,


and
be
refuse
.
the
trial
come
on
at
once
,
and
,
when
he
be
put
to
the


bar
,
he
be
seat
in
a
chair
.
no
objection
be
make
to
my
getting


close
to
the
dock
,
on
the
outside
of
it
,
and
hold
the
hand
that
he


stretch
forth
to
I
.


the
trial
be
very
short
and
very
clear
.
such
thing
as
could
be
say


for
he
be
say
,
-
how
he
have
take
to
industrious
habit
,
and
have


thriven
lawfully
and
reputably
.
but
nothing
could
unsay
the
fact
that


he
have
return
,
and
be
there
in
presence
of
the
Judge
and
Jury
.
it
be


impossible
to
try
he
for
that
,
and
do
otherwise
than
find
he
guilty
.


at
that
time
,
it
be
the
custom
 
as
I
learn
from
my
terrible
experience


of
that
session
 
to
devote
a
concluding
day
to
the
passing
of


sentence
,
and
to
make
a
finishing
effect
with
the
Sentence
of
Death
.


but
for
the
indelible
picture
that
my
remembrance
now
hold
before
I
,


I
could
scarcely
believe
,
even
as
I
write
these
word

that
I
see


two
-

-
thirty
man

thirty

that
he

get

the
whole

start
out
again
in
the
vivid
color
of
the
moment
,
down


to
the
drop
of
April
rain
on

window
of

I
again
stand

weep

cover
their
face

stare
gloomily
about

who
,
under

of
great
violence

daring
,
have
make
his


escape
and
be
re

sentence
to

that
miserable
man

seem

a
time
to
have
become
convinced
of
his
error

far
remove

sit
down
again
.


there
be
some
hushing
,
and
the
Judge
go
on
with
what
he
have
to

to
the
rest

then
they
be
all
formally
doom
,
and
some
of
they
be


support
out
,
and
some
of
they
saunter
out
with
a
haggard
look
of


bravery
,
and
a
few
nod
to
the
gallery

two

three
shake
hand

other

the
fragment
of
herb

last
of
all

because
of
have
to


be
help
from
his
chair

to
go
very
slowly
;
and
he
hold
my
hand


while
all
the
other
be
remove
,
and
while
the
audience
get
up


 
put
their
dress
right
,
as
they
might
at
church
or
elsewhere
,
and


point
down
at
this
criminal
or
at
that
,

most
of
all
at
he

I
.


I
earnestly
hope

pray
that
he
might
die
before
the
Recorder
's


report
be
make
;
but
,
in
the
dread
of
his
linger
on
,
I
begin
that


night
to
write
out
a
petition
to
the
Home
Secretary
of
State
,
set


forth
my
knowledge
of
he
,
and
how
it
be
that
he
have
come
back
for
my


sake
.
I
write
it
as
fervently
and
pathetically
as
I
could
;
and
when
I


have
finish
it
and
send
it
in
,
I
write
out
other
petition
to
such
man


in
authority
as
I
hope
be
the
most
merciful
,
and
draw
up
one
to
the


crown
itself
.
for
several
day
and
night
after
he
be
sentence
I
take


no
rest
except
when
I
fall
asleep
in
my
chair
,
but
be
wholly
absorb


in
these
appeal
.
and
after
I
have
send
they
in
,
I
could
not
keep
away


from
the
place
where
they
be
,
but
feel
as
if
they
be
more


hopeful
and
less
desperate
when
I
be
near
they
.
in
this
unreasonable


restlessness
and
pain
of
mind
I
would
roam
the
street
of
an
evening
,


wander
by
those
office
and
house
where
I
have
leave
the
petition
.
to


the
present
hour
,
the
weary
western
street
of
London
on
a
cold
,
dusty


spring
night
,
with
their
range
of
stern
,
shut

up
mansion
,
and
their


long
row
of
lamp

melancholy

from
this
association

the
daily
visit

that
I
be
suspect
of
an
intention

poison
to
he

I
ask
to
be
search
before
I
sit
down


at
his
bedside

tell
the
officer

that
I
be


willing
to
do
anything

would

the
singleness
of
my

as
the
day

I
notice
more
and
more
that
he
would
lie
placidly


look
at
the
white
ceiling
,
with
an
absence
of
light
in
his
face


until
some
word
of
mine
brighten
it
for
an
instant
,
and
then
it
would


subside
again
.
sometimes
he
be
almost
or
quite
unable
to
speak
,
then


he
would
answer
I
with
slight
pressure
on
my
hand
,
and
I
grow
to


understand
his
meaning
very
well
.


the
number
of
the
day
have
rise
to
ten
,
when
I
see
a
great
change


in
he
than
I
have
see
yet
.
his
eye
be
turn
towards
the
door

up
as

chapter
LVII


now
that
I
be
leave
wholly
to
myself
,
I
give
notice
of
my
intention


to
quit
the
chamber
in
the
Temple
as
soon
as
my
tenancy
could
legally


determine
,
and
in
the
meanwhile
to
underlet
they
.
at
once
I
put
bill


up
in
the
window
;
for
,
I
be
in
debt
,
and
have
scarcely
any
money
,
and


begin
to
be
seriously
alarm
by
the
state
of
my
affair
.
I
ought


rather
to
write
that
I
should
have
be
alarm
if
I
have
have
energy
and


concentration
enough
to
help
I
to
the
clear
perception
of
any
truth


beyond
the
fact
that
I
be
fall
very
ill
.
the
late
stress
upon
I
have


enable
I
to
put
off
illness
,
but
not
to
put
it
away
;
I
know
that
it


be
come
on
I
now
,
and
I
know
very
little
else
,
and
be
even
careless


as
to
that
.


for
a
day
or
two
,
I
lie
on
the
sofa
,
or
on
the
floor
,
-
anywhere
,


accord
as
I
happen
to
sink
down
,
-
with
a
heavy
head
and
ache


limb
,
and
no
purpose
,
and
no
power
.
then
there
come
,
one
night
which


appear
of
great
duration
,
and
which
teem
with
anxiety
and
horror
;


and
when
in
the
morning
I
try
to
sit
up
in
my
bed
and
think
of
it
,
I


find
I
could
not
do
so
.


whether
I
really
have
be
down
in
Garden
Court
in
the
dead
of
the
night
,


grope
about
for
the
boat
that
I
suppose
to
be
there
;
whether
I
have


two
or
three
time
come
to
myself
on
the
staircase
with
great
terror
,


not
know
how
I
have
get
out
of
bed
;
whether
I
have
find
myself


light
the
lamp
,
possess
by
the
idea
that
he
be
come
up


the
stair
,
and
that
the
light
be
blow
out
;
whether
I
have
be


inexpressibly
harass
by
the
distracted
talking
,
laugh
,
and
groan


of
some
one
,
and
have
half
suspect
those
sound
to
be
of
my
own
making
;


whether
there
have
be
a
closed
iron
furnace
in
a
dark
corner
of


the
room
,
and
a
voice
have
call
out
,
over
and
over
again
,
that
Miss


Havisham
be
consume
within
it
,
-
these
be
thing
that
I
try
to


settle
with
myself
and
get
into
some
order
,
as
I
lie
that
morning
on


my
bed
.
but
the
vapor
of
a
limekiln
would
come
between
I
and
they
,


disorder
they
all
,
and
it
be
through
the
vapor
at
last
that
I
see


two
man
look
at
I
.

the
man
.

I
make
some
attempt

up

when

next
attend


to

off
from

perhaps
they
reply
,
or
argue
the
point
,
or
try
to
encourage
I
to


believe
that

well

.
forasmuch

they
hang
in


my
memory
by
only
this
one
slender
thread
,
I
do
n't
 
know
what
they
do
,


except
that
they
forbore
to
remove

I
have
a
fever

avoid

suffer
greatly

often
lose

reason

the
time
seem
interminable

I


confound
impossible
existence
with
my
own
identity
;
that
I
be
a


brick
in
the
house

,
and
yet
entreat
to
be
release
from
the


giddy
place
where
the
builder
have
set
I
;
that
I
be
a
steel
beam
of
a


vast
engine
,
clash
and
whirl
over
a
gulf
,

yet
that
I
implore


in
my
own
person

have
the
engine
stop

my
part
in
it
hammer


off

I
pass
through
these
phase
of
disease

know
of
my
own


remembrance
,

do
in
some
sort
know
at
the
time
.
that
I
sometimes


struggle
with
real
people
,
in
the
belief
that
they
be
murderer
,
and


that
I
would
all
at
once
comprehend
that
they
mean
to
do
I
good
,
and


would
then
sink
exhaust
in
their
arm
,
and
suffer
they
to
lay
I


down

I
also
know
at
the
time
.

,
above
all
,
I
know

there
be
a


constant
tendency

all
these
people
,

who
,
when
I
be
very
ill
,
would


present
all
kind
of
extraordinary
transformation
of
the
human
face
,

would
be
much
dilate
in
size
,

above
all
,
I
say
,
I
know
that
there


be
an
extraordinary
tendency

soon

later
,

settle
down

after
I
have
turn
the
bad
point

illness

begin

other
feature
change

this
one
consistent

not
change

whoever
come
about
I
,
still
settle
down
into

I
open


my
eye
in
the
night
,

I
see

great
chair

sink
back

drinking

look
so
hopefully

tenderly
upon

at

I
take
courage

I
could
hear
his

,


where
the
rich
summer
growth
be
already
on
the
tree
and
on
the
grass
,


and
sweet
summer
scent
fill
all
the
air
.
the
day
happen
to
be


Sunday
,
and
when
I
look
on
the
loveliness
around
I
,
and
think


how
it
have
grow
and
change
,
and
how
the
little
wild
-
flower
have
be


form
,
and
the
voice
of
the
bird
have
be
strengthen
,
by
day
and


by
night
,
under
the
sun
and
under
the
star
,
while
poor
I
lie
burn


and
toss
on
my
bed
,
the
mere
remembrance
of
having
burn
and
toss


there
come
like
a
check
upon
my
peace
.
but
when
I
hear
the
Sunday


bell
,
and
look
around
a
little
more
upon
the
outspread
beauty
,
I
feel


that
I
be
not
nearly
thankful
enough
,
-
that
I
be
too
weak
yet
to
be


even
that
,
-
and
I
lay
my
head
on
Joe
's
shoulder
,
as
I
have
lay
it
long


ago
when
he
have
take
I
to
the
Fair
or
where
not
,
and
it
be
too
much


for
my
young
sense
.


More
composure
come
to
I
after
a
while
,
and
we
talk
as
we
use


to
talk
,
lie
on
the
grass
at
the
old
Battery
.
there
be
no
change


whatever
in
Joe
.
exactly
what
he
have
be
in
my
eye
then
,
he
be
in
my


eye
still
;
just
as
simply
faithful
,
and
as
simply
right
.


when
we
get
back
again
,
and
he
lift
I
out
,
and
carry
I
-
so


easily
!
-
across
the
court
and
up
the
stair
,
I
think
of
that
eventful


Christmas
Day
when
he
have
carry
I
over
the
marsh
.
we
have
not
yet


make
any
allusion
to
my
change
of
fortune
,

do
I
know
how
much
of


my
late
history
he
be
acquaint
with
.
I
be
so
doubtful
of
myself
now
,


and
put
so
much
trust
in
he
,
that
I
could
not
satisfy
myself
whether
I


ought
to

you
must
be

"


the
delicacy
with
which
Joe
dismiss
this
theme
,

the
sweet
tact
and


kindness
with
which
Biddy
-
who
with
her

impression

whether

know

poor
I
be
,

how
my
great
expectation
have


all
dissolve
,
like
our
own
marsh
mist
before
the
sun
,
I
could
not


understand
.


another
thing
in
Joe
that
I
could
not
understand
when
it
first
begin
to


develop
itself
,
but
which
I
soon
arrive
at
a
sorrowful
comprehension


of
,
be
this
:
as
I
become
strong
and
well
,
Joe
become
a
little
less


easy
with
I
.
in
my
weakness
and
entire
dependence
on
he
,
the
dear


fellow
have
fall
into
the
old
tone
,
and
call
I
by
the
old
name
,


the
dear
"
old
Pip

old
chap

"
that
now
be
music
in
my
ear

I
too
have


fall
into
the
old
way
,
only
happy
and
thankful
that
he
let
I
.
but
,


imperceptibly
,
though
I
hold
by
they
fast
,
Joe
's
hold
upon
they
begin


to
slacken
;
and
whereas
I
wonder
at
this
,
at
first
,
I
soon
begin
to


understand
that
the
cause
of
it
be
in
I
,
and
that
the
fault
of
it
be


all
mine
.


ah
!
have
I
give
Joe
no
reason
to
doubt
my
constancy
,
and
to
think
that


in
prosperity
I
should
grow
cold
to
he
and
cast
he
off
?
have
I
give


Joe
's
innocent
heart
no
cause
to
feel
instinctively
that
as
I
get


strong
,
his
hold
upon
I
would
be
weak
,
and
that
he
have
well


loosen
it
in
time
and
let
I
go
,
before
I
pluck
myself
away
?


it
be
on
the
third
or
fourth
occasion
of
my
go
out
walk
in
the


Temple
Gardens
lean
on
Joe
's
arm
,
that
I
see
this
change
in
he
very


plainly
.
we
have
be
sit
in
the
bright
warm
sunlight
,
look
at
the


river
,
and
I
chance
to
say
as
we
get
up
,
-


"
see
,
Joe
!
I
can
walk
quite
strongly
.
now
,
you
shall
see
I
walk
back
by


myself
.
"


"
which
do
not
overdo
it
,
Pip

say
Joe
;
"
but
I
shall
be
happy
fur
to


see
you
able
,

.
"


the
last
word
grate
on
I
;
but
how
could
I
remonstrate
!
I
walk
no


far
than
the
gate
of
the
garden
,
and
then
pretend
to
be


weak
than
I
be
,
and
ask
Joe
for
his
arm
.
Joe
give
it
I
,
but
be


thoughtful
.


I
,
for
my
part
,
be
thoughtful
too
;
for
,
how
good
to
check
this
grow


change
in
Joe
be
a
great
perplexity
to
my
remorseful
thought
.
that
I


be
ashamed
to
tell
he
exactly
how
I
be
place
,
and
what
I
have
come


down
to
,
I
do
not
seek
to
conceal
;
but
I
hope
my
reluctance
be
not


quite
an
unworthy
one
.
he
would
want
to
help
I
out
of
his
little


saving
,
I
know
,
and
I
know
that
he
ought
not
to
help
I
,
and
that
I


must
not
suffer
he
to
do
it
.


it
be
a
thoughtful
evening
with
both
of
we
.
but
,
before
we
go
to


bed
,
I
have
resolve
that
I
would
wait
over
to
-
morrow
,
-
to
-
morrow
being


Sunday
,
-
and
would
begin
my
new
course
with
the
new
week
.
on
Monday


morning
I
would
speak
to
Joe
about
this
change
,
I
would
lay
aside
this


last
vestige
of
reserve
,
I
would
tell
he
what
I
have
in
my
thought


 
that
secondly
,
not
yet
arrive
at
,
and
why
I
have
not
decide
to
go


out
to
Herbert
,
and
then
the
change
would
be
conquer
for
ever
.
as
I


clear
,
Joe
clear
,
and
it
seem
as
though
he
have
sympathetically


arrive
at
a
resolution
too
.


we
have
a
quiet
day
on
the
Sunday
,
and
we
ride
out
into
the
country
,
and


then
walk
in
the
field
.


"
I
feel
thankful
that
I
have
be
ill
,
Joe
,

I
say

I
would
remind
she
of
our

I

to

Biddy
,

indeed
I
be
as
sorry

Biddy

and
have
as
much
need


of
a
hush
voice

hope
I
be
a
little

different
occupation
down

whether


we
shall
go
away

a
distant

an
opportunity
await
I

I
set
aside

I
know
your
answer
.

now
,


dear
Biddy
,
if
you
can
tell
I
that
you
will
go
through
the
world
with


I
,
you
will
surely
make
it
a
well
world
for
I
,

I
a
well
man


for
it

I
will
try
hard
to
make
it
a

you

the
old
place

it
in
execution

by
some

great
cruelty

a
compound

over
to
the

spot

dark

with
loitering
on
the
way
to
look
at
old
object

quite
decline

no
building
whatever
leave

the


wall
of
the
old
garden
.
the
clear
space
have
be
enclose
with
a
rough


fence

look
over
it
,
I
see
that
some
of
the
old
ivy
have
strike


root
anew
,

be
grow
green
on
low
quiet
mound
of
ruin

gate

the
fence

ajar

I
push
it
open
,

go
in
.

cold
silvery
mist

veil
the
afternoon

up
to
scatter
it

,

star
be
shine
beyond
the
mist
,

the


moon
be
come
,

the
evening
be
not
dark

I
could
trace
out
where


every
part
of
the
old
house
have
be
,

where
the
brewery
have
be
,

where
the
gate
,

where
the
cask

I
have
do
so
,

be
look


along
the
desolate
garden
walk

I

solitary
figure

still

draw
near

see
it
to
be
the


figure

a
woman

I
draw
near
yet

be
about
to
turn
away

it
stop
,

come
up
with
it

,
it
falter
,

if
much


surprised
,

utter
my

out
