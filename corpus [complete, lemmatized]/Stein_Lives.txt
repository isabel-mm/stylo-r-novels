the
summer
and
Miss
Mathilda
would
be
go
away

old


Katie
would
do
very
well
to
come
in
every

a
heavy

with
her
attempt

do
all

rough
old

never
want
her

.
no

Anna
always
have
a
humorous
sense
from
this
old

twisted
peasant


english
,
from
the
roughness
on
her
tongue
of
buzzing
s

from
the


queer
way
of
her
brutish
servile
humor
.
Anna
could
not
let
old
Katy


serve
at

old
Katy
be
too
coarsely
make
from

so
Anna
have
all
this
to
do
herself

never

pleasanter

glorious
in
the
set
sun
,

underneath
the
moon
and
clear

it
be
hard
to
have
to

anger
at
the


late

the
good
thing
Anna
make
to
eat
,

come
to
the

door
and
wonder
there
if
it

the

of
what

could
persuade

's
work

for
a
new
girl
to


take
Anna
's
place
.




Anna
's
mind
be
thus
a
little
set
at
rest

endure
the
operation
very
well
,

be
patient
,
almost
docile
,


in
the
slow
recovery
of
her
working
strength
.

when
she
be
once


more
at
work
for
her
Miss
Mary
Wadsmith
,
all
the
good
effect
of
these


several
month
of
rest
be
soon
work
and
worry
well
away
.




for
all
the
rest
of
her
strong
work
life
Anna
be
never
really


well
.
she
have
bad
headache
all
the
time
and
she
be
always
thin
and


wear
.




she
work
away
her
appetite
,
her
health
and
strength
,
and
always
for


the
sake
of
those
who
beg
she
not
to
work
so
hard
.
to
her
thinking
,


in
her
stubborn
,
faithful
,
german
soul
,
this
be
the
right
way
for
a


girl
to
do
.




Anna
's
life
with
Miss
Mary
Wadsmith
be
now
draw
to
an
end
.




Miss
Jane
,
now
altogether
a
young
lady
,
have
come
out
into
the
world
.


soon
she
would
become
engaged
and
then
be
marry
,
and
then
perhaps


Miss
Mary
Wadsmith
would
make
her
home
with
she
.




in
such
a
household
Anna
be
certain
that
she
would
never
take
a


place
.
Miss
Jane
be
always
careful
and
respectful
and
very
good
to


Anna
,
but
never
could
Anna
be
a
girl
in
a
household
where
Miss
Jane


would
be
the
head
.
this
much
be
very
certain
in
her
mind
,
and
so


these
last
two
year
with
her
Miss
Mary
be
not
as
happy
as
before
.




the
change
come
very
soon
.




Miss
Jane
become
engaged
and
in
a
few
month
be
to
marry
a
man
from


out
of
town
,
from
Curden
,
an
hour
's
railway
ride
from
Bridgepoint
.




poor
Miss
Mary
Wadsmith
do
not
know
the
strong
resolve
Anna
have
make


to
live
apart
from
she
when
this
new
household
should
be
form
.
Anna


find
it
very
hard
to
speak
to
her
Miss
Mary
of
this
change
.




the
preparation
for
the
wedding
go
on
day
and
night
.




Anna
work
and
sew
hard
to
make
it
all
go
well
.




Miss
Mary
be
much
flutter
,
but
content
and
happy
with
Anna
to
make


everything
so
easy
for
they
all
.




Anna
work
so
all
the
time
to
drown
her
sorrow
and
her
conscience


too
,
for
somehow
it
be
not
right
to
leave
Miss
Mary
so
.
but
what
else


could
she
do
?
she
could
not
live
as
her
Miss
Mary
's
girl
,
in
a
house


where
Miss
Jane
would
be
the
head
.




the
wedding
day
grow
always
near
.
at
last
it
come
and
pass
.




the
young
people
go
on
their
wedding
trip
,
and
Anna
and
Miss
Mary


be
leave
behind
to
pack
up
all
the
thing
.




even
yet
poor
Anna
have
not
have
the
strength
to
tell
Miss
Mary
she


resolve
,
but
now
it
have
to
be
.




Anna
every
spare
minute
run
to
her
friend
Mrs.
Lehntman
for
comfort


and
advice
.
she
beg
her
friend
to
be
with
she
when
she
tell
the


news
to
Miss
Mary
.




perhaps
if
Mrs.
Lehntman
have
not
be
in
Bridgepoint
,
Anna
would
have


try
to
live
in
the
new
house
.
Mrs.
Lehntman
do
not
urge
she
to
this


thing
nor
even
give
she
this
advice
,
but
feel
for
Mrs.
Lehntman
as


she
do
make
even
faithful
Anna
not
quite
so
strong
in
her
dependence


on
Miss
Mary
's
need
as
she
would
otherwise
have
be
.




remember
,
Mrs.
Lehntman
be
the
romance
in
Anna
's
life
.




all
the
packing
be
now
do
and
in
a
few
day
Miss
Mary
be
to
go
to


the
new
house
,
where
the
young
people
be
ready
for
she
come
.




at
last
Anna
have
to
speak
.




Mrs.
Lehntman
agree
to
go
with
she
and
help
to
make
the
matter
clear


to
poor
Miss
Mary
.




the
two
woman
come
together
to
Miss
Mary
Wadsmith
sit
placid
by


the
fire
in
the
empty
living
room
.
Miss
Mary
have
see
Mrs.
Lehntman


many
time
before
,
and
so
she
come
in
with
Anna
raise
no
suspicion


in
her
mind
.




it
be
very
hard
for
the
two
woman
to
begin
.




it
must
be
very
gently
do
,
this
tell
to
Miss
Mary
of
the
change
.


she
must
not
be
shock
by
suddenness
or
with
excitement
.




Anna
be
all
stiff
,
and
inside
all
a
quiver
with
shame
,
anxiety


and
grief
.
even
courageous
Mrs.
Lehntman
,
efficient
,
impulsive
and


complacent
as
she
be
and
not
deeply
concerned
in
the
event
,
feel


awkward
,
abash
and
almost
guilty
in
that
large
,
mild
,
helpless


presence
.
and
at
her
side
to
make
she
feel
the
power
of
it
all
,
be


the
intense
conviction
of
poor
Anna
,
struggle
to
be
unfeele
,
self


righteous
and
suppress
.

negro


boy
shake
in
his
shoe
and
his
eye
roll
white
in
his
agony
of
fear
.




then
Anna
would
tell
these
history
to
her
doctor
.
her
worn
,
thin
,


line
,
determined
face
would
form
for
itself
new
and
humorous
crease
,


and
her
pale
blue
eye
would
kindle
with
humour
and
with
joy
as
she


doctor
burst
into
his
hearty
laugh
.
and
the
good
Anna
full
of
the


coquetry
of
pleasing
would
bridle
with
her
angular
,
thin
,
spinster


body
,
strain
her
story
and
herself
to
please
.




these
early
day
with
jovial
Dr.
Shonjen
be
very
happy
day
with
the


good
Anna
.




all
of
Anna
's
spare
hour
in
these
early
day
she
spend
with
she


friend
,
the
widow
Mrs.
Lehntman
.
Mrs.
Lehntman
live
with
her
two


child
in
a
small
house
in
the
same
part
of
the
town
as
Dr.
Shonjen
.


the
old
of
these
two
child
be
a
girl
name
Julia
and
be
now


about
thirteen
year
of
age
.
this
Julia
Lehntman
be
an
unattractive


girl
enough
,
harsh
featured
,
dull
and
stubborn
as
have
be
her
heavy


german
father
.
Mrs.
Lehntman
do
not
trouble
much
with
she
,
but
give


she
always
all
she
want
that
she
have
,
and
let
the
girl
do
as
she


like
.
this
be
not
from
indifference
or
dislike
on
the
part
of
Mrs.


Lehntman
,
it
be
just
her
usual
way
.




her
second
child
be
a
boy
,
two
year
young
than
his
sister
,
a


bright
,
pleasant
,
cheery
fellow
,
who
too
,
do
what
he
like
with
his


money
and
his
time
.
all
this
be
so
with
Mrs.
Lehntman
because
she


have
so
much
in
her
head
and
in
her
house
that
clamour
for
she


concentration
and
her
time
.




this
slackness
and
neglect
in
the
running
of
the
house
,
and
the


indifference
in
this
mother
for
the
training
of
her
young
be
very


hard
for
our
good
Anna
to
endure
.
of
course
she
do
she
good
to
scold
,


to
save
for
Mrs.
Lehntman
,
and
to
put
thing
in
their
place
the
way


they
ought
to
be
.




even
in
the
early
day
when
Anna
be
first
win
by
the
glamour
of


Mrs.
Lehntman
's
brilliancy
and
charm
,
she
have
be
uneasy
in
Mrs.


Lehntman
's
house
with
a
need
of
put
thing
to
right
.
now
that
the


two
child
grow
up
be
of
more
importance
in
the
house
,
and
now


that
long
acquaintance
have
brush
the
dazzle
out
of
Anna
's
eye
,
she


begin
to
struggle
to
make
thing
go
here
as
she
think
be
right
.




she
watch
and
scold
hard
these
day
to
make
young
Julia
do
the
way


she
should
.
not
that
Julia
Lehntman
be
pleasant
in
the
good
Anna
's


sight
,
but
it
must
never
be
that
a
young
girl
grow
up
should
have


no
one
to
make
she
learn
to
do
thing
right
.




the
boy
be
easy
to
scold
,
for
scolding
never
sink
in
very
deep
,


and
indeed
he
like
they
very
well
for
they
bring
with
they
new


thing
to
eat
,
and
lively
teasing
,
and
good
joke
.




Julia
,
the
girl
,
grow
very
sullen
with
it
all
,
and
very
often
win
she


point
,
for
after
all
Miss
Annie
be
no
relative
of
hers
and
have
no


business
come
there
and
make
trouble
all
the
time
.
appeal
to


the
mother
be
no
use
.
it
be
wonderful
how
Mrs.
Lehntman
could
listen


and
not
hear
,
could
answer
and
yet
not
decide
,
could
say
and
do
what


she
be
ask
and
yet
leave
thing
as
they
be
before
.




one
day
it
get
almost
too
bad
for
even
Anna
's
friendship
to
bear
out
.




"
well
,
Julia

Anna
ask
,
one
Sunday
summer


afternoon
,

she
come
into
the
Lehntman
house
.




Anna
look
very
well
this
day
.
she
be
always
careful
in
her
dress


and
sparing
of
new
clothe
.
she
make
herself
always
fulfill
her
own


ideal
of
how
a
girl
should
look
when
she
take
her
sunday
out
.
Anna


know
so
well
the
kind
of
ugliness
appropriate
to
each
rank
in
life
.




it
be
interesting
to
see
how
when
she
buy
thing
for
Miss
Wadsmith


and
later
for
her
cherish
Miss
Mathilda
and
always
entirely
from
she


own
taste
and
often
as
cheaply
as
she
buy
thing
for
her
friend


or
for
herself
,
that
on
the
one
hand
she
choose
the
thing
have
the


right
air
for
a
member
of
the
upper
class
,

for
the
other
always


the
thing
have
the
awkward
ugliness
that
we
call
Dutch
.
she
know


the
good
thing
in
each
kind
,
and
she
never
in
the
course
of
her
strong


life
compromise
her
sense
of
what
be
the
right
thing
for
a
girl
to


wear
.

Julia
,
nobody

when
I

,
and
who
be
go
to
tell
she
now
how
to
do
thing


for
that
baby
?
she
ai
n't
get
no
sense
what
be
the
right
way
to
do
with


child
,
and
you
out
all
the
time
,
and
you
ai
n't
get
no
time
for
your


own
neither
,
and
now
you
want
to
be
takin
'
up
with
stranger
.
I
know


you
be
careless
,
Mrs.
Lehntman
,
but
I
do
n't
think
that
you
could


do
this
so
.
no
,
Mrs.
Lehntman
,
it
ai
n't
your
duty
to
take
up
with
no


other
,
when
you
get
two
child
of
your
own
,
that
get
to
get
along


just
any
way
they
can
,

you
know
you
ai
n't
get
any
too
much
money


all
the
time
,
and
you
be
all
so
careless
here
and
spend
it
all
the


time
,
and
Julia
and
Willie
growin
'
big
.
it
ai
n't
right
,
Mrs.
Lehntman
,


to
do
so
.
"




this
be
as
bad
as
it
could
be
.
Anna
have
never
speak
her
mind
so
to


her
friend
before
.
now
it
be
too
harsh
for
Mrs.
Lehntman
to
allow


herself
to
really
hear
.
if
she
really
take
the
meaning
in
these
word


she
could
never
ask
Anna
to
come
into
her
house
again
,
and
she


like
Anna
very
well
,
and
be
use
to
depend
on
her
saving
and
she


strength
.
and
then
too
Mrs.
Lehntman
could
not
really
take
in
harsh


idea
.
she
be
too
well
diffused
to
catch
the
feel
of
any
sharp
firm


edge
.




now
she
manage
to
understand
all
this
in
a
way
that
make
it
easy
for


she
to
say
,
"
why
,
Anna
,
I
think
you

too
bad

each
a


large
,
sweet
,
raisined
loaf
of
caky
bread
.
at
every
house
with
many


groan
and
gasp
he
would
descend
his
heavy
weight
out
of
the
wagon
,


his
good
featured
,
black
haired
,
flat
,
good
natured
face
shine
with


oily
perspiration
,
with
pride
in
labor
and
with
generous
kindness
.


up
each
stoop
he
hobble
with
the
help
of
his
big
stick
,
and
into
the


near
chair
in
the
kitchen
or
in
the
parlour
,
as
the
fashion
of
the


house
demand
,
and
there
he
sit
and
puff
,
and
then
present
to
the


mistress
or
the
cook
the
raisined
german
loaf
his
boy
supply
he
.




Anna
have
never
be
a
customer
of
his
.
she
have
always
live
in
another


part
of
the
town
,
but
he
never
leave
she
out
in
these
bakery
progress


of
his
,
and
always
with
his
own
hand
he
give
she
her
festive
loaf
.




Anna
like
she
half
brother
well
enough
.
she
never
know
he
really


well
,
for
he
rarely
talk
at
all
and
least
of
all
to
woman
,
but


he
seem
to
she
,
honest
,
and
good
and
kind
,
and
he
never
try
to


interfere
in
Anna
's
way
.
and
then
Anna
like
the
loaf
of
raisine


bread
,
for
in
the
summer
she
and
the
second
girl
could
live
on
they
,


and
not
be
buy
bread
with
the
household
money
all
the
time
.




but
thing
be
not
so
simple
with
our
Anna
,
with
the
other
member
of


her
half
brother
's
house
.




her
half
brother
's
family
be
make
up
of
himself
,
his
wife
,
and
their


two
daughter
.




Anna
never
like
her
brother
's
wife
.




the
young
of
the
two
daughter
be
name
after
her
aunt
Anna
.




Anna
never
like
she
half
brother
's
wife
.
this
woman
have
be
very


good
to
Anna
,
never
interfere
in
her
way
,
always
glad
to
see
she


and
to
make
her
visit
pleasant
,
but
she
have
not
find
favour
in
our


good
Anna
's
sight
.




Anna
have
too
,
no
real
affection
for
her
niece
.
she
never
scold


they
or
try
to
guide
they
for
their
good
.
Anna
never
criticise
or


interfere
in
the
running
of
she
half
brother
's
house
.




Mrs.
Federner
be
a
good
looking
,
prosperous
woman
,
a
little
harsh
and


cold
within
her
soul
perhaps
,
but
try
always
to
be
pleasant
,
good


and
kind
.
her
daughter
be
well
train
,
quiet
,
obedient
,
well


dress
girl
,
and
yet
our
good
Anna
love
they
not
,
nor
their
mother
,


nor
any
of
their
way
.




it
be
in
this
house
that
Anna
have
first
meet
her
friend
,
the
widow
,


Mrs.
Lehntman
.




the
Federners
have
never
seem
to
feel
it
wrong
in
Anna
,
her
devotion


to
this
friend
and
her
care
of
she
and
of
her
child
.
Mrs.
Lehntman


and
Anna
and
her
feeling
be
all
somehow
too
big
for
their
attack
.


but
Mrs.
Federner
have
the
mind
and
tongue
that
blacken
thing
.
not


really
to
blacken
black
,
of
course
,
but
just
to
roughen
and
to
rub
on


a
little
smut
.
she
could
somehow
make
even
the
face
of
the
Almighty


seem
pimply
and
a
little
coarse
,
and
so
she
always
do
this
with
she


friend
,
though
not
with
the
intent
to
interfere
.




this
be
really
true
with
Mrs.
Lehntman
that
Mrs.
Federner
do
not


mean
to
interfere
,
but
Anna
's
friendship
with
the
Drehtens
be
a
very


different
matter
.




why
should
Mrs.
Drehten
,
that
poor
common
work
wife
of
a
man
who


work
for
other
in
a
brewery
and
who
always
drink
too
much
,
and
be


not
like
a
thrifty
,
decent
german
man
,
why
should
that
Mrs.
Drehten


and
her
ugly
,
awkward
daughter
be
get
present
from
her
husband
's


sister
all
the
time
,
and
her
husband
always
so
good
to
Anna
,
and
one


of
the
girl
have
her
name
too
,
and
those
drehten
all
stranger
to


she
and
never
go
to
come
to
any
good
?
it
be
not
right
for
Anna
to


do
so
.




Mrs.
Federner
know
well
than
to
say
such
thing
straight
out
to
she


husband
's
fiery
,
stubborn
sister
,
but
she
lose
no
chance
to
let
Anna


feel
and
see
what
they
all
think
.




it
be
easy
to
blacken
all
the
Drehtens
,
their
poverty
,
the
husband
's


drink
,
the
four
big
son
carry
on
and
always
lazy
,
the
awkward
,


ugly
daughter
dress
up
with
Anna
's
help
and
try
to
look
so


fine
,
and
the
poor
,
weak
,
hard
-
work
sickly
mother
,
so
easy
to


degrade
with
large
dosing
of
contemptuous
pity
.




Anna
could
not
do
much
with
these
attack
for
Mrs.
Federner
always


end
with
,
"
and
you
so
good
to
they
Anna
all
the
time
.
I
do
n't
see


how
they
could
get
along
at
all
if
you
do
n't
help
they
all
the
time
,


but
you
be
so
good
Anna
,
and
get
such
a
feel
heart
,
just
like
your


brother
,
that
you
give
anything
away
you
get
to
anybody
that
will
ask


you
for
it
,
and
that
be
shameless
enough
to
take
it
when
they
ai
n't
no


relative
of
yours
.
Poor
Mrs.
Drehten
,
she
be
a
good
woman
.
poor
thing


it
must
be
awful
hard
for
she
to
have
to
take
thing
from
stranger


all
the
time
,
and
her
husband
spend
it
on
drink
.
I
be
say
to


Mrs.
Lehntman
,
Anna
,
only
yesterday
,
how
I
never
be
so
sorry
for
any


one
as
Mrs.
Drehten
,
and
how
good
it
be
for
you
to
help
they
all
the


time
.
"




all
this
mean
a
gold
watch
and
chain
to
her
god
daughter
for
she


birthday
,
the
next
month
,
and
a
new
silk
umbrella
for
the
elder


sister
.
Poor
Anna
,
and
she
do
not
love
they
very
much
,
these


relative
of
hers
,
and
they
be
the
only
kin
she
have
.




Mrs.
Lehntman
never
join
in
,
in
these
attack
.
Mrs.
Lehntman
be


diffuse
and
careless
in
her
way
,
but
she
never
work
such
thing
for


her
own
end
,
and
she
be
too
sure
of
Anna
to
be
jealous
of
her
other


friend
.




all
this
time
Anna
be
lead
her
happy
life
with
Dr.
Shonjen
.


she
have
every
day
her
busy
time
.
she
cook
and
save
and
sew
and


scrub
and
scold
.
and
every
night
she
have
her
happy
time
,
in


see
her
doctor
like
the
fine
thing
she
buy
so
cheap
and
cook


so
good
for
he
to
eat
.
and
then
he
would
listen
and
laugh
so
loud
,
as


she
tell
he
story
of
what
have
happen
on
that
day
.




the
doctor
,
too
,
like
it
well
all
the
time
and
several
time
in


these
five
year
he
have
of
his
own
motion
raise
her
wage
.




Anna
be
content
with
what
she
have
and
grateful
for
all
her
doctor
do


for
she
.




so
Anna
's
serving
and
her
give
life
go
on
,
each
with
its
varied


pleasure
and
its
pain
.




the
adopting
of
the
little
boy
do
not
put
an
end
to
Anna
's
friendship


for
the
widow
Mrs.
Lehntman
.
neither
the
good
Anna
nor
the
careless


Mrs.
Lehntman
would
give
each
other
up
except
for
the
grave


cause
.




Mrs.
Lehntman
be
the
only
romance
Anna
ever
know
.
a
certain
magnetic


brilliancy
in
person
and
in
manner
make
Mrs.
Lehntman
a
woman
other


woman
love
.
then
,
too
,
she
be
generous
and
good
and
honest
,
though


she
be
so
careless
always
in
her
way
.
and
then
she
trust
Anna
and


like
she
well
than
any
of
her
other
friend
,
and
Anna
always
feel


this
very
much
.




no
,
Anna
could
not
give
up
Mrs.
Lehntman
,
and
soon
she
be
busy
than


before
make
Julia
do
thing
right
for
little
Johnny
.




and
now
new
scheme
be
work
strong
in
Mrs.
Lehntman
's
head
,
and


Anna
must
listen
to
her
plan
and
help
she
make
they
work
.




Mrs.
Lehntman
always
love
well
in
her
work
to
deliver
young
girl
who


be
in
trouble
.
she
would
keep
these
in
her
house
until
they
could
go


to
their
home
or
to
their
work
,
and
slowly
pay
she
back
the
money
for


their
care
.




Anna
have
always
help
her
friend
to
do
this
thing
,
for
like
all
the


good
woman
of
the
decent
poor
,
she
feel
it
hard
that
girl
should


not
be
help
,
not
girl
that
be
really
bad
of
course
,
these
she


condemn
and
hate
in
her
heart
and
with
her
tongue
,
but
honest
,


decent
,
good
,
hard
work
,
foolish
girl
who
be
in
trouble
.




for
such
as
these
Anna
always
like
to
give
her
money
and
she


strength
.




now
Mrs.
Lehntman
think
that
it
would
pay
to
take
a
big
house
for


herself
to
take
in
girl
and
to
do
everything
in
a
big
way
.




Anna
do
not
like
this
plan
.




Anna
be
never
dare
in
her
way
.
save
and
you
will
have
the
money


you
have
save
,
be
all
that
she
could
know
.




not
that
the
good
Anna
have
it
so
.




she
save
and
save
and
always
save
,
and
then
here
and
there
,
to
this


friend
and
to
that
,
to
one
in
her
trouble
and
to
the
other
in
her
joy
,


in
sickness
,
death
,
and
wedding
,
or
to
make
young
people
happy
,
it


always
go
,
the
hard
earn
money
she
have
save
.




Anna
could
not
clearly
see
how
Mrs.
Lehntman
could
make
a
big
house


pay
.
in
the
small
house
where
she
have
these
girl
,
it
do
not
pay
,
and


in
a
big
house
there
be
so
much
more
that
she
would
spend
.




such
thing
be
hard
for
the
good
Anna
to
very
clearly
see
.
one
day

.




"
I
know
,
Anna
,
but
it
be
such
a
good
house
,
just
right
you
know
and


someone
else
be
there
to
see
,
and
you
know
you
say
it
suit
very


well
,
and
if
I
do
n't
take
it
the
other
say
they
would
,
and
I
want


to
ask
you
only
there
be
n't
time
,
and
really
Anna
,
I
do
n't
need
much


help
,
it
will
go
so
well
I
know
.
I
just
need
a
little
to
begin
and


to
fix
up
with
and
that
be
all
Anna
that
I
need
,
and
I
know
it
will
go


awful
well
.
you
wait
Anna
and
you
'll
see
,
and
I
let
you
fix
it
up
just


like
you
want
,
and
you
will
make
it
look
so
nice
,
you
get
such
sense


in
all
these
thing
.
it
will
be
a
good
place
.
you
see
Anna
if
I
ai
n't


right
in
what
I
say
.
"




of
course
Anna
give
the
money
for
this
thing
though
she
could
not


believe
that
it
be
good
.
no
,
it
be
very
bad
.
Mrs.
Lehntman
could


never
make
it
pay
and
it
would
cost
so
much
to
keep
.
but
what
could


our
poor
Anna
do
?
remember
Mrs.
Lehntman
be
the
only
romance
Anna


ever
know
.




Anna
's
strength
in
her
control
of
what
be
do
in
Mrs.
Lehntman
's


house
,
be
not
now
what
it
have
be
before
that
Lily
's
little
Johnny


come
.
that
thing
have
be
for
Anna
a
defeat
.
there
have
be
no


fight
to
a
finish
but
Mrs.
Lehntman
have
very
surely
win
.




Mrs.
Lehntman
need
Anna
just
as
much
as
Anna
need
Mrs.
Lehntman
,


but
Mrs.
Lehntman
be
more
ready
to
risk
Anna
's
loss
,
and
so
the
good


Anna
grow
always
weak
in
her
power
to
control
.




in
friendship
,
power
always
have
its
downward
curve
.
one
's
strength
to


manage
rise
always
high
until
there
come
a
time
one
do
not
win
,


and
though
one
may
not
really
lose
,
still
from
the
time
that
victory


be
not
sure
,
one
's
power
slowly
cease
to
be
strong
.
it
be
only
in
a


close
tie
such
as
marriage
,
that
influence
can
mount
and
grow
always


strong
with
the
year
and
never
meet
with
a
decline
.
it
can
only


happen
so
when
there
be
no
way
to
escape
.




friendship
go
by
favour
.
there
be
always
danger
of
a
break
or
of
a


strong
power
come
in
between
.
influence
can
only
be
a
steady
march


when
one
can
surely
never
break
away
.




Anna
want
Mrs.
Lehntman
very
much
and
Mrs.
Lehntman
need
Anna
,
but


there
be
always
other
way
to
do
and
if
Anna
have
once
give
up
she


might
do
so
again
,
so
why
should
Mrs.
Lehntman
have
real
fear
?




no
,
while
the
good
Anna
do
not
come
to
open
fight
she
have
be


strong
.
now
Mrs.
Lehntman
could
always
hold
out
long
.
she
know


too
,
that
Anna
have
a
feel
heart
.
Anna
could
never
stop
do
all


she
could
for
any
one
that
really
need
help
.
Poor
Anna
have
no
power


to
say
no
.




and
then
,
too
,
Mrs.
Lehntman
be
the
only
romance
Anna
ever
know
.


romance
be
the
ideal
in
one
's
life
and
it
be
very
lonely
live
with


it
lose
.




so
the
good
Anna
give
all
her
saving
for
this
place
,
although
she


know
that
this
be
not
the
right
way
for
her
friend
to
do
.




for
some
time
now
they
be
all
very
busy
fix
up
the
house
.
it


swallow
all
Anna
's
saving
fix
up
this
house
,
for
when
Anna
once


begin
to
make
it
nice
,
she
could
not
leave
it
be
until
it
be
as
good


as
for
the
purpose
it
should
be
.




somehow
it
be
Anna
now
that
really
take
the
interest
in
the
house
.


Mrs.
Lehntman
,
now
the
thing
be
do
seem
very
lifeless
,
without


interest
in
the
house
,
uneasy
in
her
mind
and
restless
in
her
way
,


and
more
diffuse
even
than
before
in
her
attention
.
she
be
good
and


kind
to
all
the
people
in
her
house
,
and
let
they
do
whatever
they


think
good
.




Anna
do
not
fail
to
see
that
Mrs.
Lehntman
have
something
on
her
mind


that
be
all
new
.
what
be
it
that
disturb
Mrs.
Lehntman
so
?
she


keep
on
say
it
be
all
in
Anna
's
head
.
she
have
no
trouble
now
at


all
.
everybody
be
so
good
and
it
be
all
so
nice
in
the
new
house
.


but
surely
there
be
something
here
that
be
all
wrong
.




Anna
hear
a
good
deal
of
all
this
from
her
half
brother
's
wife
,
the


hard
speak
Mrs.
Federner
.




through
the
fog
of
dust
and
work
and
furnish
in
the
new
house
,
and


through
the
disturbed
mind
of
Mrs.
Lehntman
,
and
with
the
dark
hint


of
Mrs.
Federner
,
there
loom
up
to
Anna
's
sight
a
man
,
a
new
doctor


that
Mrs.
Lehntman
know
.




Anna
have
never
meet
the
man
but
she
hear
of
he
very
often
now
.
not


from
her
friend
,
the
widow
Mrs.
Lehntman
.
Anna
know
that
Mrs.
Lehntman


make
of
he
a
mystery
that
Anna
have
not
the
strength
just
then
to


vigorously
break
down
.




Mrs.
Federner
give
always
dark
suggestion
and
unpleasant
hint
.
even


good
Mrs.
Drehten
talk
of
it
.




Mrs.
Lehntman
never
speak
of
the
new
doctor
more
than
she
could
help
.


this
be
most
mysterious
and
unpleasant
and
very
hard
for
our
good


anna
to
endure
.




Anna
's
trouble
come
all
of
they
at
once
.




here
in
Mrs.
Lehntman
's
house
loom
up
dismal
and
forbid
,
a


mysterious
,
perhaps
an
evil
man
.
in
Dr.
Shonjen
's
house
be
begin


sign
of
interest
in
the
doctor
in
a
woman
.




this
,
too
,
Mrs.
Federner
often
tell
to
the
poor
Anna
.
the
doctor


surely
would
be
marry
soon
,
he
like
so
much
now
to
go
to
Mr.


Weingartner

house
where
there

a
daughter
who

room
in
her
half
brother
's
house
be
Anna
's


torture
chamber
.
and
bad
of
all
there
be
so
much
reason
for
she


half
sister
's
word
.
the
Doctor
certainly
do
look
like
marriage
and


Mrs.
Lehntman
act
very
queer
.




Poor
Anna
.
Dark

these
day
and
much
she
have
to
suffer
.




the

to
a
head
the
first
.
it
be
true

and

she
of
course
to


stay
.
Anna
be
so
sad
with
all
these
trouble
.
she
know
here
in
the


doctor
's
house
it
would
be
bad
when
he
be
marry
,
but
she
have
not


the
strength
now
to
be
firm
and
go
away
.
she
say
at
last
that
she


would
try
and
stay
.




doctor
got
marry
now
very
soon
.
Anna
make
the
house
all
beautiful


and
clean
and
she
really
hope
that
she
might
stay
.
but
this
be
not


for
long
.




Mrs.
Shonjen
be
a
proud
,
unpleasant
woman
.
she
want
constant


service
and
attention
and
never
even
a
thank
you
to
a
servant
.
soon


all
doctor
's
old
people
go
away
.
Anna
go
to
Doctor
and
explain
.


she
tell
he
what
all
the
servant
think
of
his
new
wife
.
Anna
bade


he
a
sad
farewell
and
go
away
.




Anna
be
now
most
uncertain
what
to
do
.
she
could
go
to
Curden
to
she


Miss
Mary
Wadsmith
who
always
write
how
much
she
need
Anna
,
but
Anna


still
dread
Miss
Jane
's
interfere
way
.
then
too
,
she
could
not


yet
go
away
from
Bridgepoint
and
from
Mrs.
Lehntman
,
unpleasant
as
it


always
be
now
over
there
.




through
one
of
Doctor
's
friend
Anna
hear
of
Miss
Mathilda
.
Anna
be


very
doubtful
about
work
for
a
Miss
Mathilda
.
she
do
not
think
it


would
be
good
work
for
a
woman
anymore
.
she
have
find
it
very
good


with
Miss
Mary
but
she
do
not
think
that
many
woman
would
be
so
.




Most
woman
be
interfere
in
their
way
.




Anna
hear
that
Miss
Mathilda
be
a
great
big
woman
,
not
so
big


perhaps
as
her
Miss
Mary
,
still
she
be
big
,
and
the
good
Anna
like


they
well
so
.
she
do
not
like
they
thin
and
small
and
active
and


always
look
in
and
always
prying
.




Anna
could
not
make
up
her
mind
what
be
the
good
thing
now
for
she


to
do
.
she
could
sew
and
this
way
make
a
living
,
but
she
do
not
like


such
business
very
well
.




Mrs.
Lehntman
urge
the
place
with
Miss
Mathilda
.
she
be
sure
Anna


would
find
it
well
so
.
the
good
Anna
do
not

Mrs.

and
so
dark

have
tree
all
round
about
,
and
that
Anna
find
herself
go
in


and
come
out
just
as
the
woman
that
day
say
that
she
would
do
,
have


it
not
all
be
just
as
the
medium
say
,
the
good
Anna
would
never


have
take
the
place
with
Miss
Mathilda
.




Anna
do
not
see
Miss
Mathilda
and
she
do
not
like
the
friend
who


act
in
her
place
.




this
friend
be
a
dark
,
sweet
,
gentle
little
mother
woman
,
very
easy


to
be
pleased
in
her
own
work
and
very
good
to
servant
,
but
she
feel


that
act
for
her
young
friend
,
the
careless
Miss
Mathilda
,
she
must


be
very
careful
to
examine
well
and
see
that
all
be
right
and
that


Anna
would
surely
do
the
good
she
know
.
she
ask
Anna
all
about
she


way
and
her
intention
and
how
much
she
would
spend
,
and
how
often


she
go
out
and
whether
she
could
wash
and
cook
and
sew
.




the
good
Anna
set
her
tooth
fast
to
endure
and
would
hardly
answer


anything
at
all
.
Mrs.
Lehntman
make
it
all
go
fairly
well
.




the
good
Anna
be
all
work
up
with
her
resentment
,
and
Miss


Mathilda
's
friend
do
not
think
that
she
would
do
.




however
,
Miss
Mathilda
be
willing
to
begin
and
as
for
Anna
,
she
know


that
the
medium
say
it
must
be
so
.
Mrs.
Lehntman
,
too
,
be
sure
,
and


say
she
know
that
this
be
the
good
thing
for
Anna
now
to
do
.
so
Anna


send
word
at
last
to
Miss
Mathilda
,
that
if
she
want
she
,
she
would


try
if
it
would
do
.




so
Anna
begin
a
new
life
take
care
of
Miss
Mathilda
.




Anna
fix
up
the
little
red
brick
house
where
Miss
Mathilda
be
go


to
live
and
make
it
very
pleasant
,
clean
and
nice
.
she
bring
over


her
dog
,
Baby
,
and
her
parrot
.
she
hire
Lizzie
for
a
second
girl
to


be
with
she
and
soon
they
be
all
content
.
all
except
the
parrot
,
for


Miss
Mathilda
do
not
like
its
scream
.
Baby
be
all
right
but
not
the


parrot
.
but
then
Anna
never
really
love
the
parrot
,
and
so
she
give


it
to
the
Drehten
girl
to
keep
.




before
Anna
could
really
rest
content
with
Miss
Mathilda
,
she
have
to


tell
her
good
german
priest
what
it
be
that
she
have
do
,
and
how


very
bad
it
be
that
she
have
be
and
how
she
would
never
do
so
again
.




Anna
really
do
believe
with
all
her
might
.
it
be
her
fortune
never


to
live
with
people
who
have
any
faith
,
but
then
that
never
worry


Anna
.
she
pray
for
they
always
as
she
should
,
and
she
be
very
sure


that
they
be
good
.
the
doctor
love
to
tease
she
with
his
doubt
and


Miss
Mathilda
like
to
do
so
too
,
but
with
the
tolerant
spirit
of
she


church
,
Anna
never
think
that
such
thing
be
bad
for
they
to
do
.




Anna
find
it
hard
to
always
know
just
why
it
be
that
thing
go


wrong
.
sometimes
her
glass
break
and
then
she
know
that
she
have
not


do
her
duty
by
the
church
,
just
in
the
way
that
she
should
do
.




sometimes
she
be
so
hard
at
work
that
she
would
not
go
to
mass
.


something
always
happen
then
.
Anna
's
temper
grow
irritable
and
she


way
uncertain
and
distraught
.
everybody
suffer
and
then
her
glass


break
.
that
be
always
very
bad
because
they
cost
so
much
to
fix
.


still
in
a
way
it
always
end
Anna
's
trouble
,
because
she
know
then


that
all
this
be
because
she
have
be
bad
.
as
long
as
she
could
scold


it
might
be
just
the
bad
way
of
all
the
thoughtless
careless
world
,


but
when
her
glass
break
that
make
it
clear
.
that
mean
that
it
be


she
herself
who
have
be
bad
.




no
,
it
be
no
use
for
Anna
not
to
do
the
way
she
should
,
for
thing


always
then
go
wrong
and
finally
cost
money
to
make
whole
,
and
this


be
the
hard
thing
for
the
good
Anna
to
endure
.




Anna
almost
always
do
her
duty
.
she
make
confession
and
her
mission


whenever
it
be
right
.
of
course
she
do
not
tell
the
father
when


she
deceive
people
for
their
good
,
or
when
she
want
they
to
give


something
for
a
little
less
.




when
Anna
tell
such
history
to
her
doctor
and
later
to
her
cherish


Miss
Mathilda
,
her
eye
be
always
full
of
humor
and
enjoyment
as
she


explain
that
she
have
say
it
so
,
and
now
she
would
not
have
to
tell


the
father
for
she
have
not
really
make
a
sin
.




but
go
to
a
fortune
teller
Anna
know
be
really
bad
.
that
have
to
be


tell
to
the
father
just
as
it
be
and
penance
have
then
to
be
do
.




Anna
do
this
and
now
her
new
life
be
well
begun
,
make
Miss


Mathilda
and
the
rest
do
just
the
way
they
should
.




yes
,
take
care
of
Miss
Mathilda
be
the
happy
day
of
all
the


good
Anna
's
strong
hard
work
life
.




with
Miss
Mathilda
Anna
do
it
all
.
the
clothe
,
the
house
,
the

,


what
she
should
wear
and
when
and
what
be
always
good
for
she
to
do
.


there
be
nothing
Miss
Mathilda
would
not
let
Anna
manage
,
and
only
be


too
glad
if
she
would
do
.




Anna
scold
and
cook
and
sew
and
save
so
well
,
that
Miss


Mathilda
have
so
much
to
spend
,
that
it
keep
Anna
still
busy
scold


all
the
time
about
the
thing

,
that
make
so
much
work
for


Anna
and
the
other
girl
to
do
.
but
for
all
the
scolding
,
Anna
be


proud
almost
to
burst
of
her

and
her
great
possession

day
of
all
her
life
with
Anna
,
even


though
with
her
friend
there

great
sorrow
.
but
these
sorrow

,
as

Miss
Mathilda
be
not

romance
in
the
good

too
certainly
an
evil
as
well
as


a
mysterious
man
,
and
he
have
power
over
the
widow
and
midwife
,
Mrs.


lehntman
.




Anna
never
see
Mrs.
Lehntman
at
all
now
any
more
.




Mrs.
Lehntman
have
borrow
some
more
money
and
have
give
Anna
a
note


then
for
it
all
,
and
after
that
Anna
never
see
she
any
more
.
Anna
now


stop
altogether
go
to
the
Lehntmans
'
.
Julia
,
the
tall
,
gawky
,


good
,
blonde
,
stupid
daughter
,
come
often
to
see
Anna
,
but
she
could


tell
little
of
her
mother
.




it
certainly
do
look
very
much
as
if
Mrs.
Lehntman
have
now
go


altogether
bad
.
this
be
a
great
grief
to
the
good
Anna
,
but
not
so


great
a
grief
as
it
would
have
be
had
not
Miss
Mathilda
mean
so


much
to
she
now
.




Mrs.
Lehntman
go
from
bad
to
bad
.
the
doctor
,
the
mysterious
and


evil
man
,
get
into
trouble
do
thing
that
be
not
right
to
do
.




Mrs.
Lehntman
be
mix
up
in
this
affair
.




it
be
just
as
bad
as
it
could
be
,
but
they
manage
,
both
the
doctor


and
Mrs.
Lehntman
,
finally
to
come
out
safe
.




everybody
be
so
sorry
about
Mrs.
Lehntman
.
she
have
be
really
a
good


woman
before
she
meet
this
doctor
,
and
even
now
she
certainly
have
not


be
really
bad
.




for
several
year
now
Anna
never
even
see
her
friend
.




but
Anna
always
find
new
people
to
befriend
,
people
who
,
in
the


kindly
fashion
of
the
poor
,
use
up
her
saving
and
then
give
promise


in
place
of
payment
.
Anna
never
really
think
that
these
people


would
be
good
,
but
when
they
do
not
do
the
way
they
should
,
and
when


they
do
not
pay
she
back
the
money
she
have
loan
,
and
never
seem


the
well
for
her
care
,
then
Anna
would
grow
bitter
with
the
world
.




no
,
none
of
they
have
any
sense
of
what
be
the
right
way
for
they
to


do
.
so
Anna
would
repeat
in
her
despair
.




the
poor
be
generous
with
their
thing
.
they
give
always
what
they


have
,
but
with
they
to
give
or
to
receive
bring
with
it
no
feeling


that
they
owe
the
giver
for
the
gift
.




even
a
thrifty
german
Anna
be
ready
to
give
all
that
she
have
save
,


and
so
not
be
sure
that
she
would
have
enough
to
take
care
of
herself


if
she
fall
sick
,
or
for
old
age
,
when
she
could
not
work
.
save
and


you
will
have
the
money
you
have
save
be
true
only
for
the
day
of


save
,
even
for
a
thrifty
german
Anna
.
there
be
no
certain
way
to


have
it
for
old
age
,
for
the
taking
care
of
what
be
save
can
never
be


rely
on
,
for
it
must
always
be
in
stranger
'
hand
in
a
bank
or
in


investment
by
a
friend
.




and
so
when
any
day
one
might
need
life
and
help
from
other
of
the


work
poor
,
there
be
no
way
a
woman
who
have
a
little
save
could


say
they
no
.




so
the
good
Anna
give
she
all
to
friend
and
stranger
,
to
child
,


dog
and
cat
,
to
anything
that
ask
or
seem
to
need
her
care
.




it
be
in
this
way
that
Anna
come
to
help
the
barber
and
his
wife
who


live
around
the
corner
,
and
who
somehow
could
never
make
end
meet
.


they
work
hard
,
be
thrifty
,
have
no
vice
,
but
the
barber
be
one


of
they
who
never
can
make
money
.
whoever
owe
he
money
do
not
pay
.


whenever
he
have
a
chance
at
a
good
job
he
fall
sick
and
could
not


take
it
.
it
be
never
his
own
fault
that
he
have
trouble
,
but
he
never


seem
to
make
thing
come
out
right
.




his
wife
be
a
blonde
,
thin
,
pale
,
german
little
woman
,
who
bear
she


child
very
hard
,
and
work
too
soon
,
and
then
till
she
be
sick
.


she
too
,
always
have
thing
that
go
wrong
.




they
both
need
constant
help
and
patience
,
and
the
good
Anna
give


both
to
they
all
the
time
.




another
woman
who
need
help
from
the
good
Anna
,
be
one
who
be
in

from
be
good
to

.




this

this
man

much
bad
he
could
not
do
his
work
,
but
he
be
not


so
sick
that
he
could
stay
in
a
hospital
.
so
this
woman
have
he
live


there
with
she
.
he
be
not
a
nice
man
,
nor
be
he
thankful
for

the


woman

.
he
be
cross
to

and
the

,
no

even
for
the

,
and
for
a
man
who
be
not
even
grateful
for

.
this
slowly
come


about
.




Mrs.

have
now
leave
the
evil
and
mysterious
man
who
have
be


the
cause
of
all

.
she
have
give
up
,
too
,
the
new
big


house
that
she
have
take
.
since
her
trouble
her
practice
have
be


very
quiet
.
still
she
manage
to
do
fairly
well
.
she
begin
to
talk
of


pay
the
good
Anna
.
this
,
however
,
have
not
get
very
far
.




Anna
see
Mrs.
Lehntman
a
good
deal
now
.
Mrs.
Lehntman
's
crisp
,
black
,


curly
hair
have
get
streak
with
gray
.
her
dark
,
full
,
good
look


face
have
lose
its
firm
outline
,
go
flabby
and
a
little
worn
.
she
have


grown
stouter
and
her
clothe
do
not
look
very
nice
.
she
be
as
bland


as
ever
in
her
way
,
and
as
diffuse
as
always
in
her
attention
,
but


through
it
all
there
be
uneasiness
and
fear
and
uncertainty
lest
some


danger
might
be
near
.




she
never
say
a
word
of
her
past
life
to
the
good
Anna
,
but
it
be


very
plain
to
see
that
her
experience
have
not
leave
she
easy
,
nor
yet


altogether
free
.




it
have
be
hard
for
this
good
woman
,
for
Mrs.

be
really
a


good
woman
,
it
have
be
a
very
hard
thing
for
this
german
woman
to
do


what
everybody
know
and
think
be
wrong
.
Mrs.
Lehntman
be
strong


and
she
have
courage
,
but
it
have
be
very
hard
to
bear
.
even
the


good
Anna
do
not
speak
to
she
with
freedom
.
there
always
remain
a


mystery
and
a
depression
in
Mrs.
Lehntman
's
affair
.

down
in
the


city
.
he
be
a
decent
,
dull
young
fellow
,
who

not
make
much
money


and
could
never
save
it
for

,
and
she


be
stubborn

of
course
,

"
the

no


sense
for

and
put
money
by
so
they
will
have
something
to


use
when
they
need
it
.
there
be
Julia
and
her
Charley
.
I
go
in
there


the
other
day
,
Miss
Mathilda
,
and
they
have
a
new
table
with
a
marble


top
and
on
it
they
have
a
grand
new
plush
album
.
'
where

'
I

would
be
soon
.
now
I
ask
you

Miss


Mathilda

when
they
ai

business

.
Julia


she
do
n't
do
no
work
,
she
just
sit
around
and
think
how
she
can


spend
the
money
,
and
Charley
he
never
put
one
cent
by
.
I
never
see


anything
like
the
people
nowadays
Miss
Mathilda
,
they
do
n't
seem
to


have
any
sense

.
Julia
and
Charley
when


they
have
any
child
they
wo
n't
have
nothing
to
bring
they
up
with


right

they
wo
n't
have
any
child
.
I
tell
she
she


ought
to
be
ashamed

I
do
n't

no
sense
at
all
of
what
be
the
right


way
for
they
to
do
,
and
perhaps
its
well
if
they
do
n't
have
any


child
,
and
then
Miss
Mathilda

a
happy
time
.
no
,

"




the
good
Anna
could
not
understand
the
careless
and
bad
way
of
all


the
world
and
always
she
grow
bitter
with
it
all
.
no
,
not
one
of
they


have
any
sense
of
what
be
the
right
way
for
they
to
do
.




Anna
's
past

now
draw
to
an
end
.

be
the
first
gift
from
her
friend


the
widow

in
the
old
day
when
Anna
have
be
with
Miss


Mary
Wadsmith
,
and
when
these
two
woman
have
first
come
together
.




through
all
the
year
of
change
,
Baby
have
stay
with
the
good
Anna
,


grow
old
and
fat
and
blind
and
lazy
.
Baby
have
be
active
and
a


ratter
when
she
be
young
,
but
that
be
so
long
ago
it
be
forget
,


and
for
many
year
now
Baby
have
want
only
her
warm
basket
and
she


dinner
.




Anna
in
her
active
life
find
need
of
other
,
of
Peter
and
the
funny


little
rag
,
but
always
Baby
be
the
eld
and
hold
she
with
the
tie


of
old
affection
.
Anna
be
harsh
when
the
young
one
try
to
keep


poor
Baby
out
and
use
her
basket
.
Baby
have
be
blind
now
for
some


year
as
dog
get
,
when
they
be
no
long
active
.
she
get
weak
and


fat
and
breathless
and
she
could
not
even
stand
long
any
more
.
Anna


have
always
to
see
that
she
get
her
dinner
and
that
the
young
active


one
do
not
deprive
she
.




Baby
do
not
die
with
a
real
sickness
.
she
just
get
old
and
more


blind
and
coughed
and
then
more
quiet
,
and
then
slowly
one
bright


summer
's
day
she
die
.




there
be
nothing
more
dreary
than
old
age
in
animal
.
somehow
it
be


all
wrong
that
they
should
have
grey
hair
and
withered
skin
,
and
blind


old
eye
,
and
decay
and
useless
tooth
.
an
old
man
or
an
old
woman


almost
always
have
some
tie
that
seem
to
bind
they
to
the
young
,


realer
life
.
they
have
child
or
the
remembrance
of
old
duty
,
but


a
dog
that
be
old
and
so
cut
off
from
all
its
world
of
struggle
,
be


like
a
dreary
,
deathless
Struldbrug
,
the
dreary
dragger
on
of
death


through
life
.




and
so
one
day
old
Baby
die
.
it
be
dreary
,
more
than
sad
,
for
the


good
Anna
.
she
do
not
want
the
poor
old
beast
to
linger
with
its


weary
age
,
and
blind
old
eye
and
dismal
shake
cough
,
but
this
death


leave
Anna
very
empty
.
she
have
the
foolish
young
man
Peter
,
and
the


jolly
little
Rags
for
comfort
,
but
Baby
have
be
the
only
one
that


could
remember
.




the
good
Anna
want
a
real
graveyard
for
her
Baby
,
but
this
could
not


be
in
a
christian
country
,
and
so
Anna
all
alone
take
her
old
friend


do
up
in
decent
wrapping
and
put
she
into
the
ground
in
some
quiet


place
that
Anna
know
of
.




the
good
Anna
do
not
weep
for
poor
old
Baby
.
nay
,
she
have
not
time


even
to
feel
lonely
,
for
with
the
good
Anna
it
be
sorrow
upon
sorrow
.


she
be
now
no
long
to
keep
house
for
Miss
Mathilda
.




when
Anna
have
first
come
to
Miss
Mathilda
she
have
know
that
it
might


only
be
for
a
few
year
,
for
Miss
Mathilda
be
give
to
much
wandering


and
often
change
her
home
,
and
find
new
place
where
she
go
to


live
.
the
good
Anna
do
not
then
think
much
about
this
,
for
when
she


first
go
to
Miss
Mathilda
she
have
not
think
that
she
would
like


it
and
so
she
have
not
worry
about
stay
.
then
in
those
happy
year


that
they
have
be
together
,
Anna
have
make
herself
forget
it
.
this


last
year
when
she
know
that
it
be
come
she
have
try
hard
to
think


it
would
not
happen
.




"
we
wo
n't
talk
about
it
now
Miss
Mathilda
,
perhaps
we
all
be
dead
by


then
,
"
she
would
say
when
Miss
Mathilda
try
to
talk
it
over
.
or
,
"
if


we
live
till
then
Miss
Mathilda
,
perhaps
you
will
be
stay
on
right


here
.
"




no
,
the
good
Anna
could
not
talk
as
if
this
thing
be
real
,
it
be


too
weary
to
be
once
more
left
with
stranger
.




both
the
good
Anna
and
her
cherish
Miss
Mathilda
try
hard
to
think


that
this
would
not
really
happen
.
Anna
make
mission
and
all
kind
of


thing
to
keep
she
Miss
Mathilda
and
Miss
Mathilda
think
out
all
the


way
to
see
if
the
good
Anna
could
not
go
with
she
,
but
neither
the


mission
nor
the
plan
have
much
success
.
Miss
Mathilda
would
go
,
and


she
be
go
far
away
to
a
new
country
where
Anna
could
not
live
,
for


she
would
be
too
lonesome
.




there
be
nothing
that
these
two
could
do
but
part
.
perhaps
we
all
be


dead
by
then
,
the
good
Anna
would
repeat
,
but
even
that
do
not
really


happen
.
if
we
all
live
till
then
Miss
Mathilda
,
come
out
truer
.
they


all
do
live
till
then
,
all
except
poor
old
blind
Baby
,
and
they


simply
have
to
part
.




Poor
Anna
and
poor
Miss
Mathilda
.
they
could
not
look
at
each
other


that
last
day
.
Anna
could
not
keep
herself
busy
work
.
she
just
go


in
and
out
and
sometimes
scold
.




Anna
could
not
make
up
her
mind
what
she
should
do
now
for
her
future
.


she
say
that
she
would
for
a
while
keep
this
little
red
brick
house


that
they
have
live
in
.
perhaps
she
might
just
take
in
a
few
boarder
.


she
do
not
know
,
she
would
write
about
it
later
and
tell
it
all
to


Miss
Mathilda
.




the
dreary
day
drag
out
and
then
all
be
ready
and
Miss
Mathilda


leave
to
take
her
train
.
Anna
stand
strained
and
pale
and
dry
eyed


on
the
white
stone
step
of
the
little
red
brick
house
that
they
have


live
in
.
the
last
thing
Miss
Mathilda
hear
be
the
good
Anna
bidding


foolish
Peter
say
good
bye
and
be
sure
to
remember
Miss
Mathilda
.








Part
III




the
death
of
the
good
ANNA






every
one
who
have
know
of
Miss
Mathilda
want
the
good
Anna
now
to


take
a
place
with
they
,
for
they
all
know
how
well
Anna
could
take


care
of
people
and
all
their
clothe
and
good
.
Anna
too
could
always


go
to
Curden
to
Miss
Mary
Wadsmith
,
but
none
of
all
these
way
seem


very
good
to
Anna
.




it
be
not
now
any
long
that
she
want
to
stay
near
Mrs.
Lehntman
.


there
be
no
one
now
that
make
anything
important
,
but
Anna
be


certain
that
she
do
not
want
to
take
a
place
where
she
would
be


under
some
new
people
.
no
one
could
ever
be
for
Anna
as
have
be
she


cherish
Miss
Mathilda
.
no
one
could
ever
again
so
freely
let
she
do


it
all
.
it
would
be
well
Anna
think
in
her
strong
strained
weary


body
,
it
would
be
well
just
to
keep
on
there
in
the
little
red


brick
house
that
be
all
furnish
,
and
make
a
living
taking
in
some


boarder
.
Miss
Mathilda
have
let
she
have
the
thing
,
so
it
would
not


cost
any
money
to
begin
.
she
could
perhaps
manage
to
live
on
so
.
she


could
do
all
the
work
and
do
everything
as
she
think
well
,
and
she


be
too
weary
with
the
change
to
do
more
than
she
just
have
to
,
to


keep
live
.
so
she
stay
on
in
the
house
where
they
have
live
,
and


she
find
some
man
,
she
would
not
take
in
woman
,
who
take
her
room


and
who
be
her
boarder
.




thing
soon
with
Anna
begin
to
be
less
dreary
.
she
be
very
popular


with
her
few
boarder
.
they
love
her
scolding
and
the
good
thing


she
make
for
they
to
eat
.
they
make
good
joke
and
laugh
loud
and


always
do
whatever
Anna
want
,
and
soon
the
good
Anna
get
so
that


she
like
it
very
well
.
not
that
she
do
not
always
long
for
Miss


Mathilda
.
she
hope
and
wait
and
be
very
certain
that
sometime
,


in
one
year
or
in
another
Miss
Mathilda
would
come
back
,
and
then
of


course
would
want
she
,
and
then
she
could
take
all
good
care
of
she


again
.




Anna
keep
all
Miss
Mathilda
's
thing
in
the
good
order
.
the
boarder


be
well
scold
if
they
ever
make
a
scratch
on
Miss
Mathilda
's


table
.




some
of
the
boarder
be
hearty
good
south
german
fellow
and
Anna


always
make
they
go
to
mass
.
one
boarder
be
a
lusty
german
student


who
be
study
in
Bridgepoint
to
be
a
doctor
.
he
be
Anna
's
special


favourite
and
she
scold
he
as
she
use
to
her
old
doctor
so
that
he


always
would
be
good
.
then
,
too
,
this
cheery
fellow
always
sing
when


he
be
wash
,
and
that
be
what
Miss
Mathilda
always
use
to
do
.


Anna
's
heart
grow
warm
again
with
this
young
fellow
who
seem
to


bring
back
to
she
everything
she
need
.




and
so
Anna
's
life
in
these
day
be
not
all
unhappy
.
she
work
and


scold
,
she
have
her
stray
dog
and
cat
and
people
,
who
all
ask
and


seem
to
need
her
care
,
and
she
have
hearty
german
fellow
who
love


her
scolding
and
eat
so
much
of
the
good
thing
that
she
know
so
well


the
way
to
make
.




no
,
the
good
Anna
's
life
in
these
day
be
not
all
unhappy
.
she
do


not
see
her
old
friend
much
,
she
be
too
busy
,
but
once
in
a
great


while
she
take
a
Sunday
afternoon
and
go
to
see
good
Mrs.
Drehten
.




the
only
trouble
be
that
Anna
hardly
make
a
living
.
she
charge
so


little
for
her
board
and
give
her
people
such
good
thing
to
eat
,
that


she
could
only
just
make
both
end
meet
.
the
good
german
priest
to


whom
she
always
tell
her
trouble
try
to
make
she
have
the
boarder


pay
a
little
high
,
and
Miss
Mathilda
always
in
her
letter
urge
she


to
this
thing
,
but
the
good
Anna
somehow
could
not
do
it
.
her
boarder


be
nice
man
but
she
know
they
do
not
have
much
money
,
and
then
she


could
not
raise
on
those
who
have
be
with
she
and
she
could
not
ask


the
new
one
to
pay
high
,
when
those
who
be
already
there
be


pay
just
what
they
have
pay
before
.
so
Anna
let
it
go
just
as
she


have
begin
it
.
she
work
and
work
all
day
and
think
all
night
how


she
could
save
,
and
with
all
the
work
she
just
manage
to
keep
live
.


she
could
not
make
enough
to
lay
any
money
by
.




Anna
get
so
little
money
that
she
have
all
the
work
to
do
herself
.
she


could
not
pay
even
the
little
Sally
enough
to
keep
she
with
she
.




not
have
little
Sally
nor
have
any
one
else
work
with
she
,
make


it
very
hard
for
Anna
ever
to
go
out
,
for
she
never
think
that


it
be
right
to
leave
a
house
all
empty
.
once
in
a
great
while
of
a


Sunday
,
Sally
who
be
now
work
in
a
factory
would
come
and
stay


in
the
house
for
the
good
Anna
,
who
would
then
go
out
and
spend
the


afternoon
with
Mrs.
Drehten
.




no
,
Anna
do
not
see
her
old
friend
much
any
more
.
she
go
sometimes


to
see
she
half
brother
and
his
wife
and
her
niece
,
and
they
always


come
to
she
on
her
birthday
to
give
present
,
and
her
half
brother


never
leave
she
out
of
his
festive
raisined
bread
give
progress
.


but
these
relative
of
hers
have
never
mean
very
much
to
the
good


Anna
.
Anna
always
do
her
duty
by
they
all
,
and
she
like
she
half


brother
very
well
and
the
loaf
of
raisine
bread
that
he
supply


she
be
most
welcome
now
,
and
Anna
always
give
she
god
daughter
and


her
sister
handsome
present
,
but
no
one
in
this
family
have
ever
make


a
way
inside
to
Anna
's
feeling
.




Mrs.
Lehntman
she
see
very
rarely
.
it
be
hard
to
build
up
new
on


an
old
friendship
when
in
that
friendship
there
have
be
bitter


disillusion
.
they
do
their
good
,
both
these
woman
to
be
friend
,
but


they
be
never
able
to
again
touch
one
another
nearly
.
there
be
too


many
thing
between
they
that
they
could
not
speak
of
,
thing
that


have
never
be
explain
nor
yet
forgive
.
the
good
Anna
still
do
she


good
for
foolish
Julia
and
still
every
now
and
then
see
Mrs.
Lehntman
,


but
this
family
have
now
lose
all
its
real
hold
on
Anna
.




Mrs.
Drehten
be
now
the
good
friend
that
Anna
know
.
here
there
be


never
any
more
than
the
mingling
of
their
sorrow
.
they
talk
over


all
the
time
the
good
way
for
Mrs.
Drehten
now
to
do
;
poor
Mrs.


drehten
who
with
her
chief
trouble
,
her
bad
husband
,
have
really
now
no


way
that
she
could
do
.
she
just
have
to
work
and
to
be
patient
and
to


love
her
child
and
be
very
quiet
.
she
always
have
a
soothe
mother


influence
on
the
good
Anna
who
with
her
irritable
,
strained
,
wear
-
out


body
would
come
and
sit
by
Mrs.
Drehten
and
talk
all
her
trouble


over
.




of
all
the
friend
that
the
good
Anna
have
have
in
these
twenty
year


in
Bridgepoint
,
the
good
father
and
patient
Mrs.
Drehten
be
the


only
one
that
be
now
near
to
Anna
and
with
whom
she
could
talk
she


trouble
over
.




Anna
work
,
and
think
,
and
save
,
and
scold
,
and
take
care
of
all


the
boarder
,
and
of
Peter
and
of
Rags
,
and
all
the
other
.
there
be


never
any
end
to
Anna
's
effort
and
she
grow
always
more
tired
,
more


pale
yellow
,
and
in
her
face
more
thin
and
worn
and
worried
.
sometimes


she
go
far
in
not
be
well
,
and
then
she
go
to
see
Dr.


Herman
who
have
operate
on
good
Mrs.
Drehten
.




the
thing
that
Anna
really
need
be
to
rest
sometimes
and
eat
more


so
that
she
could
get
strong
,
but
these
be
the
last
thing
that


Anna
could
bring
herself
to
do
.
Anna
could
never
take
a
rest
.
she
must


work
hard
through
the
summer
as
well
as
through
the
winter
,
else
she


could
never
make
both
end
meet
.
the
doctor
give
her
medicine
to
make


her
strong
but
these
do
not
seem
to
do
much
good
.




Anna
grow
always
more
tired
,
her
headache
come
oftener
and
hard
,


and
she
be
now
almost
always
feel
very
sick
.
she
could
not
sleep


much
in
the
night
.
the
dog
with
their
noise
disturb
she
and


everything
in
her
body
seem
to
pain
she
.




the
doctor
and
the
good
father
try
often
to
make
she
give
herself


more
care
.
Mrs.
Drehten
tell
she
that
she
surely
would
not
get
well


unless
for
a
little
while
she
would
stop
work
.
Anna
would
then


promise
to
take
care
,
to
rest
in
bed
a
little
long
and
to
eat
more


so
that
she
would
get
strong
,
but
really
how
could
Anna
eat
when
she


always
do
the
cooking
and
be
so
tired
of
it
all
,
before
it
be
half


ready
for
the
table
?




Anna
's
only
friendship
now
be
with
good
Mrs.
Drehten
who
be
too


gentle
and
too
patient
to
make
a
stubborn
faithful
german
Anna
ever
do


the
way
she
should
,
in
the
thing
that
be
for
her
own
good
.




Anna
grow
bad
all
through
this
second
winter
.
when
the
summer
come


the
doctor
say
that
she
simply
could
not
live
on
so
.
he
say
she
must


go
to
his
hospital
and
there
he
would
operate
upon
she
.
she
would
then


be
well
and
strong
and
able
to
work
hard
all
next
winter
.




Anna
for
some
time
would
not

.
she
could
not

this
so
,
for


she
have
her
house

and
she

last
a

a

she
know
have
kill

she
be
so
blue

,
she


think
this
be
the
good

just
because
you
be
blue

never

Rose

one
night
,
at

with
all
their

these

have
no


child
of

grow
old

it
happen
that
these
people
go
away
to
some
other

Rose
stay
behind

Bridgepoint
.
her
white

leave
a
little
money
to

,
and
then
Rose
go
back
to


her
house
again
with
Sam
.




Melanctha
Herbert
have
not
make
her
life
all
simple
like
Rose
Johnson
.


Melanctha
have
not
find
it
easy
with
herself
to
make
she
want
and


what
she
have
,
agree
.




Melanctha
Herbert
be
always
lose
what
she
have
in
want
all
the


thing
she

hard
and
much
too
often
.
she
be


always
full
with
mystery
and
subtle
movement
and
denial
and
vague


distrust
and
complicated
disillusion
.
then
Melanctha
would
be
sudden


and
impulsive
and
unbounded
in
some
faith
,
and
then
she
would
suffer


and
be
strong
in
her
repression
.




Melanctha
Herbert
be
always
seek
rest
and
quiet
,
and
always
she


could
only
find
new
way
to
be
in
trouble
.




Melanctha
wonder
often
how
it
be
she
do
not
kill
herself
when
she


be
so
blue
.
often
she
think
this
would
be
really
the
good
way
for


she
to
do
.




Melanctha
Herbert
have
be
raise
to
be
religious
,
by
her

.
this

'
Mis

Melanctha
be
pale
yellow
and
mysterious
and
a
little
pleasant

the
real
power
in
Melanctha
's
nature

she

very
well
the
power
in

feeling
be
really
close
to

John
be
a
very
decent
colored
coachman

about

.
perhaps
the
good
John
have
be
drink
a
good
deal
of


liquor
,
perhaps
there
be
a
gleam
of
something
soft
than
the
feeling


of
a
friendly
elder
in

half
to
himself
,
half
to


the
father
,
of
the
virtue
and
the
sweetness
of
Melanctha
.

but
he

when

Herbert

and
then

be
put
to
bed
to
sleep
off
his
drink
and


fight
.

"




Melanctha
Herbert
have
always
be
old
in
all
her
way
and
she
know


very
early
how
to
use
her
power
as
a
woman
,
and
yet
Melanctha
with
all


her
inborn
intense
wisdom
be
really
very
ignorant
of
evil
.
Melanctha


have
not
yet
come
to
understand
what
they
mean
,
the
thing
she
so


often
hear
around
she
,
and
which
be
just
begin
to
stir
strongly


in
she
.




now
when
her
father
begin
fiercely
to
assail
she
,
she
do
not
really


know
what
it
be
that
he
be
so
furious
to
force
from
she
.
in
every


way
that
he
could
think
of
in
his
anger
,
he
try
to
make
she
say


a
thing
she
do
not
really
know
.
she
hold
out
and
never
answer


anything
he
ask
she
,
for
Melanctha
have
a
breakneck
courage
and
she


just
then
badly
hate
her
black
father
.




when
the
excitement
be
all
over
,
Melanctha
begin
to
know
her
power
,


the
power
she
have
so
often
feel
stir
within
she
and
which
she
now


know
she
could
use
to
make
she
strong
.




James
Herbert
do
not
win
this
fight
with
his
daughter
.
after
awhile


he
forget
it
as
he
soon
forget
John
and
the
cut
of
his
sharp
razor
.


Melanctha
almost
forget
to
hate
her
father
,
in
her
strong
interest
in


the
power
she
now
know
she
have
within
she
.




Melanctha
do
not
care
much
now
,
any
long
,
to
see
John
or
his
wife


or
even
the
fine
horse
.
this
life
be
too
quiet
and
accustomed
and
no


long
stir
she
to
any
interest
or
excitement
.




Melanctha
now
really
be
begin
as
a
woman
.
she
be
ready
,
and
she


begin
to
search
in
the
street
and
in
dark
corner
to
discover
man
and


to
learn
their
nature
and
their
various
way
of
work
.




in
these
next
year
Melanctha
learn
many
way
that
lead
to
wisdom
.


she
learn
the
way
,
and
dimly
in
the
distance
she
see
wisdom
.
these


year
of
learning
lead
very
straight
to
trouble
for
Melanctha
,
though


in
these
year
Melanctha
never
do
or
mean
anything
that
be
really


wrong
.




girl
who
be
bring
up
with
care
and
watching
can
always
find


moment
to
escape
into
the
world
,
where
they
may
learn
the
way
that


lead
to
wisdom
.
for
a
girl
raise
like
Melanctha
Herbert
,
such
escape


be
always
very
simple
.
often
she
be
alone
,
sometimes
she
be
with
a


fellow
seeker
,
and
she
stray
and
stand
,
sometimes
by
railroad
yard
,


sometimes
on
the
dock
or
around
new
building
where
many
man
be


work
.
then
when
the
darkness
cover
everything
all
over
,
she
would


begin
to
learn
to
know
this
man
or
that
.
she
would
advance
,
they
would


respond
,
and
then
she
would
withdraw
a
little
,
dimly
,
and
always
she


do
not
know
what
it
be
that
really
hold
she
.
sometimes
she
would


almost
go
over
,
and
then
the
strength
in
she
of
not
really
know
,


would
stop
the
average
man
in
his
endeavor
.
it
be
a
strange


experience
of
ignorance
and
power
and
desire
.
Melanctha
do
not
know


what
it
be
that
she
so
badly
want
.
she
be
afraid
,
and
yet
she
do


not
understand
that
here
she
really
be
a
coward
.




boy
have
never
mean
much
to
Melanctha
.
they
have
always
be
too


young
to
content
she
.
Melanctha
have
a
strong
respect
for
any
kind
of


successful
power
.
it
be
this
that
always
keep
Melanctha
nearer
,
in


her
feeling
toward
her
virile
and
unendurable
black
father
,
than
she


ever
be
in
her
feeling
for
her
pale
yellow
,
sweet
-
appear
mother
.


the
thing
she
have
in
she
of
her
mother
,
never
make
she
feel
respect
.




in
these
young
day
,
it
be
only
man
that
for
Melanctha
hold
anything


there
be
of
knowledge
and
power
.
it
be
not
from
man
however
that


Melanctha
learn
to
really
understand
this
power
.




from
the
time
that
Melanctha
be
twelve
until
she
be
sixteen
she


wander
,
always
seek
but
never
more
than
very
dimly
see
wisdom
.


all
this
time
Melanctha
go
on
with
her
school
learning
;
she
go
to


school
rather
long
than
do
most
of
the
colored
child
.




Melanctha
's
wandering
after
wisdom
she
always
have
to
do
in
secret
and


by
snatch
,
for
her
mother
be
then
still
live
and
'
Mis
'
Herbert


always
do
some
watching
,
and
Melanctha
with
all
her
hard
courage


dread
that
there
should
be
much
tell
to
her
father
,
who
come
now


quite
often
to
where
Melanctha
live
with
her
mother
.




in
these
day
Melanctha
talk
and
stand
and
walk
with
many
kind
of


man
,
but
she
do
not
learn
to
know
any
of
they
very
deeply
.
they
all


suppose
she
to
have
world
knowledge
and
experience
.
they
,
believe


that
she
know
all
,
tell
she
nothing
,
and
think
that
she
be


decide
with
they
,
ask
for
nothing
,
and
so
though
Melanctha


wander
widely
,
she
be
really
very
safe
with
all
the
wandering
.




it
be
a
very
wonderful
experience
this
safety
of
Melanctha
in
these


day
of
her
attempt
learning
.
Melanctha
herself
do
not
feel
the


wonder
,
she
only
know
that
for
she
it
all
have
no
real
value
.




Melanctha
all
her
life
be
very
keen
in
her
sense
for
real
experience
.


she
know
she
be
not
get
what
she
so
badly
want
,
but
with
all


her
break
neck
courage
Melanctha
here
be
a
coward
,
and
so
she
could


not
learn
to
really
understand
.




Melanctha
like
to
wander
,
and
to
stand
by
the
railroad
yard
,
and


watch
the
man
and
the
engine
and
the
switch
and
everything
that
be


busy
there
,
work
.
railroad
yard
be
a
ceaseless
fascination
.
they


satisfy
every
kind
of
nature
.
for
the
lazy
man
whose
blood
flow
very


slowly
,
it
be
a
steady
soothe
world
of
motion
which
supply
he


with
the
sense
of
a
strong
move
power
.
he
need
not
work
and
yet
he


have
it
very
deeply
;
he
have
it
even
well
than
the
man
who
work
in


it
or
own
it
.
then
for
nature
that
like
to
feel
emotion
without
the


trouble
of
have
any
suffering
,
it
be
very
nice
to
get
the
swell


in
the
throat
,
and
the
fullness
,
and
the
heart
beat
,
and
all
the


flutter
of
excitement
that
come
as
one
watch
the
people
come
and


go
,
and
hear
the
engine
pound
and
give
a
long
draw
whistle
.
for
a


child
watch
through
a
hole
in
the
fence
above
the
yard
,
it
be
a


wonder
world
of
mystery
and
movement
.
the
child
love
all
the
noise
,


and
then
it
love
the
silence
of
the
wind
that
come
before
the
full


rush
of
the
pound
train
,
that
burst
out
from
the
tunnel
where
it


lose
itself
and
all
its
noise
in
darkness
,
and
the
child
love
all
the


smoke
,
that
sometimes
come
in
ring
,
and
always
puff
with
fire
and


blue
color
.




for
Melanctha
the
yard
be
full
of
the
excitement
of
many
man
,
and


perhaps
a
free
and
whirl
future
.




Melanctha
come
here
very
often
and
watch
the
man
and
all
the
thing


that
be
so
busy
work
.
the
man
always
have
time
for
,
"
Hullo
sis
,


do
you
want
to
sit
on
my
engine
,
"
and
,
"
Hullo
,
that
be
a
pretty
lookin
'


yaller
girl
,
do
you
want
to
come
and
see
he
cookin
.
"




all
the
colored
porter
like
Melanctha
.
they
often
tell
she
exciting


thing
that
have
happen
;
how
in
the
west
they
go
through
big


tunnel
where
there
be
no
air
to
breathe
,
and
then
out
and
wind


around
edge
of
great
canyon
on
thin
high
spindle
trestle
,
and


sometimes
car
,
and
sometimes
whole
train
fall
from
the
narrow


bridge
,
and
always
up
from
the
dark
place
death
and
all
kind
of


queer
devil
look
up
and
laugh
in
their
face
.
and
then
they
would


tell
how
sometimes
when
the
train
went
pound
down
steep
slippery


mountain
,
great
rock
would
racket
and
roll
down
around
they
,
and


sometimes
would
smash
in
the
car
and
kill
man
;
and
as
the
porter
tell


these
story
their
round
,
black
,
shine
face
would
grow
solemn
,


and
their
color
would
go
grey
beneath
the
greasy
black
,
and
their
eye


would
roll
white
in
the
fear
and
wonder
of
the
thing
they
could
scare


themselves
by
tell
.




there
be
one
,
big
,
serious
,
melancholy
,
light
brown
porter
who
often


tell
Melanctha
story
,
for
he
like
the
way
she
have
of
listen
with


intelligence
and
sympathetic
feeling
,
when
he
tell
how
the
white
man


in
the
far
South
try
to
kill
he
because
he
make
one
of
they
who
be


drunk
and
call
he
a
damned
nigger
,
and
who
refuse
to
pay
money
for


his
chair
to
a
nigger
,
get
off
the
train
between
station
.
and
then


this
porter
have
to
give
up
go
to
that
part
of
the
southern
country
,


for
all
the
white
man
swear
that
if
he
ever
come
there
again
they


would
surely
kill
he
.




Melanctha
like
this
serious
,
melancholy
light
brown
negro
very


well
,
and
all
her
life
Melanctha
want
and
respected
gentleness


and
goodness
,
and
this
man
always
give
her
good
advice
and
serious


kindness
,
and
Melanctha
feel
such
thing
very
deeply
,
but
she
could


never
let
they
help
she
or
affect
she
to
change
the
way
that
always


make
she
keep
herself
in
trouble
.




Melanctha
spend
many
of
the
last
hour
of
the
daylight
with
the


porter
and
with
other
man
who
work
hard
,
but
when
darkness
come
it


be
always
different
.
then
Melanctha
would
find
herself
with
the
,


for
she
,
gentlemanly
class
.
a
clerk
,
or
a
young
express
agent
would


begin
to
know
she
,
and
they
would
stand
,
or
perhaps
,
walk
a
little


while
together
.




Melanctha
always
make
herself
escape
but
often
it
be
with
an
effort
.


she
do
not
know
what
it
be
that
she
so
badly
want
,
but
with
all


her
courage
Melanctha
here
be
a
coward
,
and
so
she
could
not
learn
to


understand
.




Melanctha
and
some
man
would
stand
in
the
evening
and
would
talk


together
.
sometimes
Melanctha
would
be
with
another
girl
and
then
it


be
much
easy
to
stay
or
to
escape
,
for
then
they
could
make
way
for


themselves
together
,
and
by
throw
word
and
laughter
to
each
other
,


could
keep
a
man
from
get
too
strong
in
his
attention
.




but
when
Melanctha
be
alone
,
and
she
be
so
,
very
often
,
she
would


sometimes
come
very
near
to
make
a
long
step
on
the
road
that
lead


to
wisdom
.
some
man
would
learn
a
good
deal
about
she
in
the
talk
,


never
altogether
truly
,
for
Melanctha
all
her
life
do
not
know
how
to


tell
a
story
wholly
.
she
always
,
and
yet
not
with
intention
,
manage


to
leave
out
big
piece
which
make
a
story
very
different
,
for
when
it


come
to
what
have
happen
and
what
she
have
say
and
what
it
be
that


she
have
really
do
,
Melanctha
never
could
remember
right
.
the
man


would
sometimes
come
a
little
nearer
,
would
detain
she
,
would
hold


her
arm
or
make
his
joke
a
little
clear
,
and
then
Melanctha
would


always
make
herself
escape
.
the
man
think
that
she
really
have
world


wisdom
would
not
make
his
meaning
clear
,
and
believe
that
she
be


decide
with
he
he
never
go
so
fast
that
he
could
stop
she
when
at


last
she
make
herself
escape
.




and
so
Melanctha
wander
on
the
edge
of
wisdom
.
"
say
,
Sis
,
why
do
n't


you
when
you
come
here
stay
a
little
long
?
"
they
would
all
ask


she
,
and
they
would
hold
she
for
an
answer
,
and
she
would
laugh
,


and
sometimes
she
do
stay
long
,
but
always
just
in
time
she
make


herself
escape
.




Melanctha
Herbert
want
very
much
to
know
and
yet
she
fear
the


knowledge
.
as
she
grow
old
she
often
stay
a
good
deal
long
,


and
sometimes
it
be
almost
a
balanced
struggle
,
but
she
always
make


herself
escape
.




next
to
the
railroad
yard
it
be
the
shipping
dock
that
Melanctha


love
well
when
she
wander
.
often
she
be
alone
,
sometimes
she
be


with
some
well
kind
of
black
girl
,
and
she
would
stand
a
long
time


and
watch
the
man
work
at
unloading
,
and
see
the
steamer
do
their


coal
,
and
she
would
listen
with
full
feeling
to
the
yowling
of
the


free
swinge
negro
,
as
they
run
,
with
their
powerful
loose
joint


body
and
their
childish
savage
yelling
,
push
,
carry
,
pull


great
load
from
the
ship
to
the
warehouse
.




the
man
would
call
out
,
"
say
,
Sis
,
look
out
or
we
'll
come
and
catch


yer
,
"
or
"
hi
,
there
,
you
yaller
girl
,
come
here
and
we
'll
take
you


sailin
'
.
"
and
then
,
too
,
Melanctha
would
learn
to
know
some
of
the


serious
foreign
sailor
who
tell
she
all
sort
of
wonder
,
and
a
cook


would
sometimes
take
she
and
her
friend
over
a
ship
and
show
where
he


make
his
mess
and
where
the
man
sleep
,
and
where
the
shop
be
,
and


how
everything
be
make
by
themselves
,
right
there
,
on
ship
board
.




Melanctha
love
to
see
these
dark
and
smelly
place
.
she
always
love


to
watch
and
talk
and
listen
with
man
who
work
hard
.
but
it
be


never
from
these
rougher
people
that
Melanctha
try
to
learn
the
way


that
lead
to
wisdom
.
in
the
daylight
she
always
like
to
talk
with


rough
man
and
to
listen
to
their
life
and
about
their
work
and
their


various
way
of
do
,
but
when
the
darkness
cover
everything
all


over
,
Melanctha
would
meet
,
and
stand
,
and
talk
with
a
clerk
or
a


young
shipping
agent
who
have
see
she
watching
,
and
so
it
be
that
she


would
try
to
learn
to
understand
.




and
then
Melanctha
be
fond
of
watch
man
work
on
new
building
.
she


love
to
see
they
hoist
,
dig
,
sawing
and
stone
cutting
.
here
,


too
,
in
the
daylight
,
she
always
learn
to
know
the
common
workman
.


"
heh
,
Sis
,
look
out
or
that
rock
will
fall
on
you
and
smash
you
all


up
into
little
piece
.
do
you
think
you
would
make
a
nice
jelly
?
"
and


then
they
would
all
laugh
and
feel
that
their
joke
be
very
funny
.


and
"
say
,
you
pretty
yaller
girl
,
would
it
scare
you
bad
to
stand
up


here
on
top
where
I
be
?
see
if
you
've
get
grit
and
come
up
here
where


I
can
hold
you
.
all
you
got
to
do
be
to
sit
still
on
that
there
rock


that
they
be
just

,
and
then
when
you

here
I
'll
hold
you


tight
,
do
n't
you
be
scared
Sis
.
"




sometimes
Melanctha
would
do
some
of
these
thing
that
have
much


danger
,
and
always
with
such
man
,
she
show
her
power
and
her
break


neck
courage
.
once
she
slip
and
fall
from
a
high
place
.
a
workman


catch
she
and
so
she
be
not
kill
,
but
her
left
arm
be
badly


broken
.




all
the
man
crowd
around
she
.
they
admire
her
boldness
in
do
and


in
bear
pain
when
her
arm
be
break
.
they
all
go
along
with


she
with
great
respect
to
the
doctor
,
and
then
they
take
she
home
in


triumph
and
all
of
they
be
brag
about
she
not
squeal
.




James
Herbert
be
home
where
his
wife
live
,
that
day
.
he
be
furious


when
he
see
the
workman
and
Melanctha
.
he
drive
the
man
away
with


curse
so
that
they
be
all
very
nearly
fight
,
and
he
would
not


let
a
doctor
come
in
to
attend
Melanctha
.
"
why
do
n't
you
see
to
that


girl
well
,
you
,
you
be
her
mother
.
"




James
Herbert
do
not
fight
thing
out
now
any
more
with
his
daughter
.


he
fear
her

,
and
her
school
learning
,
and
the
way
she
have


of
say
thing
that
be
very
nasty
to
a
brutal
black
man
who


know
nothing
.
and
Melanctha
just
then
hate
he
very
badly
in
she


suffering
.




and
so
this

the
way

,
that


certain
way
that
be

daylight
,
the
rougher

she
would
talk
and


walk
and
laugh
and

often
.
it
be
still

and
dimly
she
begin
to
see
what

that
she
should
understand
.




it
be
not

and
then
Melanctha
be
young
,
and


she
have
sweetness
,
and
a
way
of
listen
with
intelligence
and


sympathetic
interest
,
to
the
story
that
Jane
Harden
often
tell
out


of
her
experience
.




Jane
grow
always
fonder
of
Melanctha
.
soon
they
begin
to
wander
,


more
to
be
together
than
to
see
man
and
learn
their
various
way
of


work
.
then
they
begin
not
to
wander
,
and
Melanctha
would
spend
long


hour
with
Jane
in
her
room
,
sit
at
her
foot
and
listen
to
she


story
,
and
feel
her
strength
and
the
power
of
her
affection
,
and


slowly
she
begin
to
see
clear
before
her
one
certain
way
that
would
be


sure
to
lead
to
wisdom
.




before
the
end
come
,
the
end
of
the
two
year
in
which
Melanctha
spend


all
her
time
when
she
be
not
at
school
or
in
her
home
,
with
Jane


Harden
,
before
these
two
year
be
finish
,
Melanctha
have
come
to


see
very
clear
,
and
she
have
come
to
be
very
certain
,
what
it
be
that


give
the
world
its
wisdom
.




Jane
Harden
always
have
a
little
money
and
she
have
a
room
in
the
low


part
of
the
town
.
Jane
have
once
teach
in
a
colored
school
.
she


have
have
to
leave
that
too
on
account
of
her
bad
conduct
.
it
be
she


drink
that
always
make
all
the
trouble
for
she
,
for
that
can
never


be
really
cover
over
.




Jane
's
drinking
be
always
grow
bad
upon
she
.
Melanctha
have
try


to
do
the
drinking
but
it
have
no
real
attraction
for
she
.




in
the
first
year
,
between
Jane
Harden
and
Melanctha
Herbert
,
Jane
have


be
much
the
strong
.
Jane
love
Melanctha
and
she
find
she
always


intelligent
and
brave
and
sweet
and
docile
,
and
Jane
mean
to
,
and


before
the
year
be
over
she
have
teach
Melanctha
what
it
be
that


give
many
people
in
the
world
their
wisdom
.




Jane
have
many
way
in
which
to
do
this
teaching
.
she
tell
Melanctha


many
thing
.
she
love
Melanctha
hard
and
make
Melanctha
feel
it


very
deeply
.
she
would
be
with
other
people
and
with
man
and
with


Melanctha
,
and
she
would
make
Melanctha
understand
what
everybody


want
,
and
what
one
do
with
power
when
one
have
it
.




Melanctha
sit
at
Jane
's
foot
for
many
hour
in
these
day
and
feel


Jane
's
wisdom
.
she
learn
to
love
Jane
and
to
have
this
feeling
very


deeply
.
she
learn
a
little
in
these
day
to
know
joy
,
and
she
be


teach
too
how
very
keenly
she
could
suffer
.
it
be
very
different


this
suffering
from
that
Melanctha
sometimes
have
from
her
mother
and


from
her
very
unendurable
black
father
.
then
she
be
fight
and


she
could
be
strong
and
valiant
in
her
suffering
,
but
here
with
Jane


Harden
she
be
long
and
she
bend
and
plead
with
her
suffering
.




it
be
a
very
tumultuous
,
very
mingle
year
,
this
time
for
Melanctha
,


but
she
certainly
do
begin
to
really
understand
.




in
every
way
she
get
it
from
Jane
Harden
.
there
be
nothing
good
or


bad
in
do
,
feeling
,
think
or
in
talk
,
that
Jane
spare
she
.


sometimes
the
lesson
come
almost
too
strong
for
Melanctha
,
but


somehow
she
always
manage
to
endure
it
and
so
slowly
,
but
always
with


increase
strength
and
feeling
,
Melanctha
begin
to
really
understand
.




then
slowly
,
between
they
,
it
begin
to
be
all
different
.
slowly
now


between
they
,
it
be
Melanctha
Herbert
,
who
be
strong
.
slowly
now


they
begin
to
drift
apart
from
one
another
.




Melanctha
Herbert
never
really
lose
her
sense
that
it
be
Jane
Harden


who
have
teach
she
,
but
Jane
do
many
thing
that
Melanctha
now
no


long
need
.
and
then
,
too
,
Melanctha
never
could
remember
right


when
it
come
to
what
she
have
do
and
what
have
happen
.
Melanctha
now


sometimes
quarrel
with
Jane
,
and
they
no
long
go
about
together
,


and
sometimes
Melanctha
really
forget
how
much
she
owe
to
Jane


Harden
's
teaching
.




Melanctha
begin
now
to
feel
that
she
have
always
have
world
wisdom
.
she


really
know
of
course
,
that
it
be
Jane
who
have
teach
she
,
but
all


that
begin
to
be
cover
over
by
the
trouble
between
they
,
that
be


now
always
get
strong
.




Jane
Harden
be
a
roughen
woman
.
once
she
have
be
very
strong
,
but


now
she
be
weaken
in
all
her
kind
of
strength
by
her
drinking
.


Melanctha
have
try
the
drinking
but
it
have
have
no
real
attraction
for


she
.




Jane
's
strong
and
roughen
nature
and
her
drinking
make
it
always


hard
for
she
to
forgive
Melanctha
,
that
now
Melanctha
do
not
really


need
she
any
long
.
now
it
be
Melanctha
who
be
strong
and
it
be


Jane
who
be
dependent
on
she
.




Melanctha
be
now
come
to
be
about
eighteen
year
old
.
she
be
a


graceful
,
pale
yellow
,
good
looking
,
intelligent
,
attractive
negress
,


a
little
mysterious
sometimes
in
her
way
,
and
always
good
and


pleasant
,
and
always
ready
to
do
thing
for
people
.




Melanctha
from
now
on
see
very
little
of
Jane
Harden
.
Jane
do
not


like
that
very
well
and
sometimes
she
abuse
Melanctha
,
but
she


drink
soon
cover
everything
all
over
.




it
be
not
in
Melanctha
's
nature
to
really
lose
her
sense
for
Jane


harden
.
Melanctha
all
her
life
be
ready
to
help
Jane
out
in
any
of


her
trouble
,
and
later
,
when
Jane
really
go
to
piece
,
Melanctha


always
do
all
that
she
could
to
help
she
.




but
Melanctha
Herbert
be
ready
now
herself
to
do
teaching
.
Melanctha


could
do
anything
now
that
she
want
.
Melanctha
know
now
what


everybody
want
.




Melanctha
have
learn
how
she
might
stay
a
little
long
;
she
have


learn
that
she
must
decide
when
she
want
really
to
stay
long
,


and
she
have
learn
how
when
she
want
to
,
she
could
escape
.




and
so
Melanctha
begin
once
more
to
wander
.
it
be
all
now
for
she


very

of
the

for
she
,
very


well
class
.
it
be
now
something
realler
that
Melanctha
want
,


something
that
would
move
she
very
deeply
,
something
that
would
fill


she
fully
with
the
wisdom
that
be
plant
now
within
she
,
and
that


she
want
badly
,
should
really
wholly
fill
she
.




Melanctha
these
day
wander
very
widely
.
she
be
always
alone
now


when
she
wander
.
Melanctha
do
not
need
help
now
to
know
,
or
to
stay


long
,
or
when
she
want

to
escape
.




Melanctha

with


a
young

.
he

he

,
but
it
be
not

that


concern
Melanctha
.
she
find
he

,
and
all
her

in


Melanctha
.
he
hold

some


old
paper
in
the
house
,
perhaps
Dr.
Campbell
could
find
something
in


they
that
would
help
pass
the
time
for
a
while
for
he
.
all
right
,


Dr.
Campbell
say
,
that
would
be
well
than
just
sit
there


with
nothing
.
Dr.
Campbell
begin
to
read
through
the
old
paper
that


Melanctha
give
he
.
when
anything
amuse
he
in
they
,
he
read
it
out


to
Melanctha
.
Melanctha
be
now
pretty
silent
,
with
he
.
Dr.
Campbell


begin
to
feel
a
little
,
about
how
she
respond
to
he
.
Dr.
Campbell


begin
to
see
a
little
that
perhaps
Melanctha
have
a
good
mind
.
Dr.


Campbell
be
not
sure
yet
that
she
have
a
good
mind
,
but
he
begin
to


think
a
little
that
perhaps
she
might
have
one
.




Jefferson
Campbell
always
like
to
talk
to
everybody
about
the
thing


he
work
at
and
about
his
thinking
about
what
he
could
do
for
the


colored
people
.
Melanctha
Herbert
never
think
about
these
thing
the


way
that
he
do
.
Melanctha
have
never
say
much
to
Dr.
Campbell
about


what
she
think
about
they
.
Melanctha
do
not
feel
the
same
as
he
do


about
be
good
and
regular
in
life
,
and
not
have
excitement


all
the
time
,
which
be
the
way
that
Jefferson
Campbell
want
that


everybody
should
be
,
so
that
everybody
would
be
wise
and
yet
be
happy
.


Melanctha
always
have
strong
the
sense
for
real
experience
.
Melanctha


Herbert
do
not
think
much
of
this
way
of
come
to
real
wisdom
.




Dr.
Campbell
soon
get
through
with
his
reading
,
in
the
old
newspaper
,


and
then
somehow
he
begin
to
talk
along
about
the
thing
he
be


always
think
.
Dr.
Campbell
say
he
want
to
work
so
that
he
could


understand
what
troubled
people
,
and
not
to
just
have
excitement
,
and


he
believe
you
ought
to
love
your
father
and
your
mother
and
to
be


regular
in
all
your
life
,
and
not
to
be
always
want
new
thing
and


excitement
,
and
to
always
know
where
you
be
,
and
what
you
want
,


and
to
always
tell
everything
just
as
you
mean
it
.
that
be
the
only


kind
of
life
he
know
or
believe
in
,
Jeff
Campbell
repeat
.
"
no
I


ai
n't
get
any
use
for
all
the
time
be
in
excitement
and
want
to


have
all
kind
of
experience
all
the
time
.
I
get
plenty
of
experience


just
live
regular
and
quiet
and
with
my
family
,
and
do
my
work
,


and
take
care
of
people
,
and
try
to
understand
it
.
I
do
n't


believe
much
in
this
run
around
business
and
I
do
n't
want
to
see


the
colored
people
do
it
.
I
be
a
colored
man
and
I
ai
n't
sorry
,
and
I


want
to
see
the
colored
people
like
what
be
good
and
what
I
want


they
to
have
,
and
that
be
to
live
regular
and
work
hard
and
understand


thing
,
and
that
be
enough
to
keep
any
decent
man
excited
.
"
Jeff


Campbell
speak
now
with
some
anger
.
not

Melanctha

he
do
not
think


of
she
at
all

way
he
want
thing

she

she
be
sure
some
day


he
would
find
out
,
that
it
be
not
all
,
of
real

there
very
often
,


and
you

very
nicely
,

he
look
brightly
at

then
he
settle
himself
down
to
answer

"
yes

"
he

a
little

do

,
when
you
put
it
like
that
to
I
,
Miss


Melanctha

that
be
just
because
you
do
n't
understand
enough
about


what
I
mean
,
by

I
do
n't

there
ai
n't
many

I

I


do
n't
find
some
like
Jane
Harden
very
good
to
know
and
talk
to
,
but


it
be
the
strong
thing
I
like
in
Jane
Harden
,
not
all
her
excitement
.


I
do
n't
admire
the
bad
thing
she
do
,
Miss

Jane

be
a
strong
woman

I
always
respect
that
in

.
no
I
know


you
do
n't
believe
what
I
say
,
Miss

I
mean
it
,

it
be


all
just
because
you
do
n't
understand
it
when
I
say
it
.
and
as
for


religion
,
that
just
ai
n't
my
way
of
be
good
,
Miss
Melanctha
,
but


it
be
a
good
way
for
many
people
to
be
good
and
regular
in
their
way


of
living
,
and
if
they
believe
it
,
it
help
they
to
be
good
,
and
if


they
be
honest
in
it
,
I
like
to
see
they
have
it
.
no
,
what
I
do
n't


like
,
Miss
Melanctha
,
be
this
what
I
see
so
much
with
the
colored


people
,
their
always
want
new
thing
just
to
get
excited
.
"




Jefferson
Campbell
here
stop
himself
in
this
talking
.
Melanctha


Herbert
do
not
make
any
answer
.
they
both
sit
there
very
quiet
.




Jeff
Campbell
then
begin
again
on
the
old
paper
.
he
sit
there
on
the


step
just
above
where
Melanctha
be
sit
,
and
he
go
on
with
his


reading
,
and
his
head
go
move
up
and
down
,
and
sometimes
he
be


reading
,
and
sometimes
he
be
think
about
all
the
thing
he
want


to
be
do
,
and
then
he
would
rub
the
back
of
his
dark
hand
over


his
mouth
,
and
in
between
he
would
be
frown
with
his
thinking
,
and


sometimes
he
would
be
rub
his
head
hard
to
help
his
thinking
.
and


Melanctha
just
sit
still
and
watch
the
lamp
burning
,
and
sometimes


she
turn
it
down
a
little
,
when
the
wind
catch
it
and
it
would


begin
to
get
to
smoking
.




and
so
Jeff
Campbell
and
Melanctha
Herbert
sit
there
on
the
step
,


very
quiet
,
a
long
time
,
and
they
do
n't
seem
to
think
much
,
that
they


be
together
.
they
sit
there
so
,
for
about
an
hour
,
and
then
it
come


to
Jefferson
very
slowly
and
as
a
strong
feeling
that
he
be
sit


there
on
the
step
,
alone
,
with
Melanctha
.
he
do
not
know
if


Melanctha
Herbert
be
feel
very
much
about
their
be
there
alone


together
.
Jefferson
begin
to
wonder
about
it
a
little
.
slowly
he
feel


that
surely
they
must
both
have
this
feeling
.
it
be
so
important
that


he
know
that
she
must
have
it
.
they
both
sit
there
,
very
quiet
,
a
long


time
.




at
last
Jefferson
begin
to
talk
about
how
the
lamp
be
smell
.


Jefferson
begin
to
explain
what
it
be
that
make
a
lamp
get
to


smell
.
Melanctha
let
he
talk
.
she
do
not
answer
,
and
then
he


stop
in
his
talking
.
soon
Melanctha
begin
to
sit
up
straighter
and


then
she
start
in
to
question
.




"
about
what
you
be
just
say
Dr.
Campbell
about
live
regular
and


all
that
,
I
certainly
do
n't
understand
what
you
mean
by
what
you
be


just
say
.
you
ai
n't
a
bit
like
good
people
Dr.
Campbell
,
like


the
good
people
you
be
always
say
be
just
like
you
.
I
know
good


people
Dr.
Campbell
,
and
you
ai
n't
a
bit
like
man
who
be
good
and


get
religion
.
you
be
just
as
free
and
easy
as
any
man
can
be
Dr.


Campbell
,
and
you
always
like
to
be
with
Jane
Harden
,
and
she
be
a


pretty
bad
one
and
you
do
n't
look
down
on
she
and
you
never
tell
she


she
be
a
bad
one
.
I
know
you
like
she
just
like
a
friend
Dr.
Campbell
,


and
so
I
certainly
do
n't
understand
just
what
it
be
you
mean
by
all


that
you
be
just
say
to
I
.
I
know
you
mean
honest
Dr.
Campbell
,


and
I
be
always
try
to
believe
you
,
but
I
ca
n't
say
as
I
see
just


what
you
mean
when
you
say
you
want
to
be
good
and
real
pious
,
because


I
be
very
certain
Dr.
Campbell
that
you
ai
n't
that
kind
of
a
man
at


all
,
and
you
ai
n't
never
ashamed
to
be
with
queer
folk
Dr.
Campbell
,


and
you
seem
to
be
think
what
you
be
do
be
just
like
what
you


be
always
say
,
and
Dr.
Campbell
,
I
certainly
do
n't
just
see
what


you
mean
by
what
you
say
.
"




Dr.
Campbell
almost
laugh
loud
enough
to
wake
'
Mis
'
Herbert
.
he
do


enjoy
the
way
Melanctha
say
these
thing
to
he
.
he
begin
to
feel


very
strongly
about
it
that
perhaps
Melanctha
really
have
a
good
mind
.

be
very
free
now
in
his
laughing
,

not
so
as
to
make
Melanctha


angry
.
he
be
very
friendly
with
she
in
his
laughing
,

then
he


make
his

get
serious

rub
his
head

"
I
know
Miss
Melanctha
"
he
begin
,
"
it
ai
n't
very
easy
for
you
to


understand
what
I
be
mean
by
what
I
be
just
say
to
you
,
and


perhaps
some
of
the
good
people
I
like
so
would
n't
think
very
much
,


any
more
than
you
do
,
Miss
Melanctha
,
about
the
way
I
have
to
be


good
.
but
that
be
no
matter
Miss
Melanctha
.
what
I
mean
Miss

thing
just
to
get
excited
.
you
see
Miss
Melanctha
I
mean
the


way
so
many
of
the
colored
people
do
it
.
instead
of
just
work
hard


and
care
about
their
working
and
live
regular
with
their
family


and
save
up
all
their
money
,
so
they
will
have
some
to
bring
up


their
child
well
,
instead
of
live
regular
and
do
like
that


and
get
all
their
new
way
from
just
decent
living
,
the
colored


people
just
keep
run
around
and
perhaps
drink
and
do


everything
bad
they
can
ever
think
of
,
and
not
just
because
they
like


all
those
bad
thing
that
they
be
always
do
,
but
only
just
because


they
want
to
get
excited

two
kind
of
way
of

one
kind
of


love
seem
to
I

be
like
one
have
a
good
quiet
feeling
in

when
one
do
his
work
,

be
always
live
good

be
regular

the
other
way
of

just
like
have
it

any


animal
that
be
low
in

very
good

I
do
n't

ever
that
it
be
not
all


right
when
anybody
like
it
,

that
be
all
the
kind
of
love
I
know


Miss

I
certainly
do
n't
care
very

explain
to
I
Dr.

what
I
been
think


about
you
this
long
time

wonder
how
you

so


live
,

know
everything

everybody

talk

be


never

about
anybody

certainly
not
be
really
very


understanding
.
it
certainly
be
all
Dr.

because
you
be
so


afraid
you
will
be
lose
be
good
so
easy

it

learn
a
whole

well
build

good

at
first
he


have
not

do
begin

he
have
not

he
have
not

she
would


ever
come

very
gentle

never

,
when
she
say


Melanctha
be
always
be
good
to
everybody
but
that
that
do
not


make
Melanctha
any
well
for
she
.
then
too
,
'
Mis
'
Herbert
never


like
Melanctha
any
well
,
even
on
the
last
day
of
her
living
,
and
so


Jefferson
really
never
think
much
of
Melanctha
's
always
be
good


to
her
mother
.




Jefferson
and
Melanctha
now
see
each
other
,
very
often
.
they
now


always
like
to
be
with
each
other
,
and
they
always
now
have
a
good


time
when
they
talk
to
one
another
.
they
,
mostly
in
their
talk
to


each
other
,
still
just
talk
about
outside
thing
and
what
they
be


think
.
except
just
in
little
moment
,
and
not
those
very
often
,


they
never
say
anything
about
their
feeling
.
sometimes
Melanctha


would
tease
Jefferson
a
little
just
to
show
she
have
not
forget
,
but


mostly
she
listen
to
his
talking
,
for
Jefferson
still
always
like


to
talk
along
about
the
thing
he
believe
in
.
Melanctha
be
like


Jefferson
Campbell
well
every
day
,
and
Jefferson
be
begin
to


know
that
Melanctha
certainly
have
a
good
mind
,
and
he
be
begin


to
feel
a
little
her
real
sweetness
.
not
in
she
be
good
to
'
Mis
'


Herbert
,
that
never
seem
to
Jefferson
to
mean
much
in
she
,
but
there


be
a
strong
kind
of
sweetness
in
Melanctha
's
nature
that
Jefferson


begin
now
to
feel
when
he
be
with
she
.




'
Mis
'
Herbert
be
now
always
get
sicker
.
one
night
again
Dr.


Campbell

very
certain
that
before
it
be
morning
she
would
surely


die
.
Dr.
Campbell
say
he
would
come
back
to

Melanctha
watch
she
,


and
to
do
anything
he
could
to

more
easy

evening
,

other
patient
,
and
then
he
make
'
Mis
'
Herbert
easy
,
and


then
he
come
and
sit
down
on
the
step
just
above
where
Melanctha

very
well


how
much
he
really
know
about
Melanctha

he
wonder
if
he


should
go
on
be
so
much
all
the
time
with
she
.
he
begin
to
think


about
what
he
should
do
now
with
she
.
Jefferson
Campbell
be
a
man
who


like
everybody
and
many
people
like
very
much
to
be
with
he
.


woman
like
he
,
he
be
so
strong
,
and
good
,
and
understanding
,
and


innocent
,
and
firm
,
and
gentle
.
sometimes
they
seem
to
want
very


much
he
should
be
with
they
.
when
they
get
so
,
they
always
have
make


Campbell
very
tired
.
sometimes
he
would
play
a
little
with
they
,


but
he
never
have
have
any
strong
feeling
for
they
.
now
with
Melanctha


Herbert
everything
seem
different
.
Jefferson
be
not
sure
that
he


know
here
just
what
he
want
.
he
be
not
sure
he
know
just
what


it
be
that
Melanctha
want
.
he
know
if
it
be
only
play
,
with


Melanctha
,
that
he
do
not
want
to
do
it
.
but
he
remember
always


how
she
have
tell
he
he
never
know
how
to
feel
thing
very
deeply
.


he
remember
how
she
tell
he
he
be
afraid
to
let
himself
ever
know


real
feeling
,
and
then
too
,
most
of
all
to
he
,
she
have
tell
he


he
be
not
very
understanding
.
that
always
trouble
Jefferson
very


keenly
,
he
want
very
badly
to
be
really
understand
.
if
Jefferson


only
know
well
just
what
Melanctha
mean
by
what
she
say
.
Jefferson


always
have
think
he
know
something
about
woman
.
now
he
find
that


really
he
know
nothing
.
he
do
not
know
the
least
bit
about
Melanctha
.


he
do
not
know
what
it
be
right
that
he
should
do
about
it
.
he


wonder
if
it
be
just
a
little
play
that
they
be
do
.
if
it
be


a
play
he
do
not
want
to
go
on
playing
,
but
if
it
be
really
that
he


be
not
very
understanding
,
and
that
with
Melanctha
Herbert
he
could


learn
to
really
understand
,
then
he
be
very
certain
he
do
not
want


to
be
a
coward
.
it
be
very
hard
for
he
to
know
what
he
want
.
he


think
and
think
,
and
always
he
do
not
seem
to
know
any
well


what
he
want
.
at
last
he
give
up
this
thinking
.
he
feel
sure
it
be


only
play
with
Melanctha
.
"
no
,
I
certainly
wo
n't
go
on
fool
with


she
any
more
this
way
,
"
he
say
at
last
out
loud
to
himself
,
when
he


be
through
with
this
thinking
.
"
I

will
stop

to

on

the
matter


with
people

take
out
his
book


from
his
pocket
,
and
draw
near
to
the
lamp
,
and
begin
with
some
hard


scientific
reading
.




Jefferson
sit
there
for
about
an
hour
reading
,

he
have
really


forget
all
about
his
trouble
with
Melanctha

Herbert
have
some
trouble
with
her
breathing
.
she
wake
up
and
be


gasp
.
Dr.
Campbell
go
to
she
and
give
she
something
that
would


help
she
.
Melanctha
come
out
from
the
other
room

do
thing
as

tell
she
.

together
make
'

more
comfortable

again
in

their
talking

Jeff
Campbell
begin
to

that
perhaps
it
be
all
different
.
perhaps


it
be
not
just
play
,
with
Melanctha
.

it
very
well


that
she
be
with

quiet
.

an
uncertain

he
never


know
how
much
he
really
know
about
Melanctha
.
he
see
she
now
for
long


time
and
very
often
.
he
be
begin
always
more
and
more
to
like


she
.

he
do
not
seem
to
himself
to
know
very
much
about

he


be
begin
to
feel
he
could
almost
trust
the
goodness
in
she
.
but


then
,
always
,
really
,
he
be
not
very
sure
about
she
.
Melanctha
always


have
way
that
make
he
feel
uncertain
with
she
,
and
yet
he
be
so


near
,
in
his
feeling
for
she
.
he
now
never
think
about
all
this
in


real
word
any
more
.

be
always
let
it
fight
itself
out
in

love
now
to
be
with
Melanctha
and
yet
he
always
hate
to


go
to
she
.
somehow
he
be
always
afraid
when
he
be
to
go
to
she
,


and
yet
he
have
make
himself
very
certain
that
here
he
would
not
be
a


coward

he
never
feel
any
of
this

afraid
,

then
they
always
be
very
true
,

near
to
one
another
.

always


when
he
be
go
to
she
,
Jeff
would
like
anything
that
could
happen


that
would
keep
he
a
little
long
from

his

no


one

Jeff

all
about

it
just
seem
as
if
it
be
well
understand
between


they
that
nobody
should
know
that

be
agree
between
they
,
that
they
should
be
alone
by


themselves
always

so
they
would
work
out
together
what
they
mean

what
they
be
always
say
to

often
speak

he
never


say
anything
about
whether
Melanctha
would
want

Jefferson
never
quite
understand
why
all
this
have
happen

Melanctha

"
I
certainly
do
n't
rightly
understand
Jeff
Campbell


why
you
ai
n't
all
these
day
be
near
I
,
but
I
certainly
do
suppose


it
be
just
another
one
of
the
queer
kind
of
way
you
have
to
be
good
,


and
repent
of
yourself
all
of
a
sudden
.
I
certainly
do
n't
say
to


you
Jeff
Campbell
I
admire
very
much
the
way
you
take
to
be
good
Jeff


Campbell
.
I
be
sorry
Dr.
Campbell
,
but
I
certainly
be
afraid
I


ca
n't
stand
it
no
more
from
you
the
way
you
have
be
just
act
.
I


certainly
ca
n't
stand
it
any
more
the
way
you
act
when
you
have
be


as
if
you
think
I
be
always
good
enough
for
anybody
to
have
with


they
,
and
then
you
act
as
if
I
be
a
bad
one
and
you
always
just


despise
I
.
I
certainly
be
afraid
Dr.
Campbell
I
ca
n't
stand
it
any


more
like
that
.
I
certainly
ca
n't
stand
it
any
more
the
way
you
be


always
change
.
I
certainly
be
afraid
Dr.
Campbell
you
ai
n't
man


enough
to
deserve
to
have
anybody
care
so
much
to
be
always
with
you
.


I
certainly
be
awful
afraid
Dr.
Campbell
I
do
n't
ever
any
more
want


to
really

Jeff
Campbell
sit
in
his
room
,
very
quiet
,
a
long
time
,
after
he
get


through
read
this
letter
.
he
sit
very
still
and
first
he
be
very


angry
.
as
if
he
,
too
,
do
not
know
very
badly
what
it
be
to
suffer


keenly
.
as
if
he
have
not
be
very
strong
to
stay
with
Melanctha
when


he
never
know
what
it
be
that
she
really
want
.
he
know
he
be
very


right
to
be
angry
,
he
know
he
really
have
not
be
a
coward
.
he
know


Melanctha
have
do
many
thing
it
be
very
hard
for
he
to
forgive


she
.
he
know
very
well
he
have
do
his
good
to
be
kind
,
and
to


trust
she
,
and
to
be
loyal
to
she
,
and
now;--and
then
Jeff
suddenly


remember
how
one
night
Melanctha
have
be
so
strong
to
suffer
,
and


he
feel
come
back
to
he
the
sweetness
in
she
,
and
then
Jeff
know
that


really
,
he
always
forgave
she
,
and
that
really
,
it
all
be
that
he
be


so
sorry
he
have
hurt
she
,
and
he
want
to
go
straight
away
and
be
a


comfort
to
she
.
Jeff
know
very
well
,
that
what
Jane
Harden
have
tell


he
about
Melanctha
and
her
bad
way
,
have
be
a
true
story
,
and
yet


he
want
very
badly
to
be
with
Melanctha
.
perhaps
she
could
teach


he
to
really
understand
it
well
.
perhaps
she
could
teach
he
how
it


could
be
all
true
,
and
yet
how
he
could
be
right
to
believe
in
she
and


to
trust
she
.




Jeff
sit
down
and
begin
his
answer
to
she
.

there
with
Melanctha
Herbert
.
she
be
always
so
sympathetic
to


he
for
the
way
she
listen
to
everything
he
find
and
tell
she
,
the


way

way

never

anything
different
from

certainly
a


busy
and
a
happy
day
,
this
their
first
long
day
of
really
wander
.




later
they
be
tired
,
and
Melanctha
sit
down
on
the
ground
,
and
Jeff


throw
himself
his
full
length
beside
she
.
Jeff
lie
there
,
very
quiet
,


and
then
he
press
her
hand
and
kiss
it
and
murmur
to
she
,
"
you


certainly
be
very
good
to
I
,
Melanctha
.
"
Melanctha
feel
it
very
deep


and
do
not
answer
.
Jeff
lie
there
a
long
time
,
look
up
above


he
.
he
be
count
all
the
little
leave
he
see
above
he
.
he
be


follow
all
the
little
cloud
with
his
eye
as
they
sail
past
he
.


he
watch
all
the
bird
that
fly
high
beyond
he
,
and
all
the
time


Jeff
know
he
must
tell
to
Melanctha
what
it
be
he
know
now
,
that


which
Jane
Harden
,
just
a
week
ago
,
have
tell
he
.
he
know
very
well


that
for
he
it
be
certain
that
he
have
to
say
it
.
it
be
hard
,
but


for
Jeff
Campbell
the
only
way
to
lose
it
be
to
say
it
,
the
only
way


to
know
Melanctha
really
,
be
to
tell
she
all
the
struggle
he
have


make
to
know
she
,
to
tell
she
so
she
could
help
he
to
understand
his


trouble
well
,
to
help
he
so
that
never
again
he
could
have
any
way


to
doubt
she
.




Jeff
lie
there
a
long
time
,
very
quiet
,
always
look
up
above
he
,


and
yet
feel
very
close
now
to
Melanctha
.
at
last
he
turn
a


little
toward
she
,
take
her
hand
close
in
his
to
make
he
feel
it


strong
,
and
then
very
slowly
,
for
the
word
come
very
hard
for
he
,


slowly
he
begin
his
talk
to
she
.




"
Melanctha
,
"
begin
Jeff
,
very
slowly
,
"
Melanctha
,
it
ai
n't
right
I


should
n't
tell
you
why
I
go
away
last
week
and
almost
never
get
the


chance
again
to
see
you
.
Jane
Harden
be
sick
,
and
I
go
in
to
take


care
of
she
.
she
begin
to
tell
everything
she
ever
know
about
you
.

do
n't
know
how
well
now
I
know
you
.
I
do
n't
tell
she
not
to
go


on
talk
.
I
listen
while
she
tell
I
everything
about
you
.
I


certainly
find
it
very
hard
with
what
she
tell
I
.
I
know
she
be


talk
truth
in
everything
she

about
you

have
be


free
in
your
way
,
Melanctha
,
I
know
you
like
to
get
excitement
the


way
I
always
hate
to
see
the
colored
people
take
it
.
I
do
n't


know
,
till
I
hear
Jane
Harden

it
,
you
have
do
thing
so
bad
,


Melanctha
.
when
Jane

I
get
very
sick
,
Melanctha
.
I


could
n't
bear
hardly
,
to

I
be
just
another
like
they


to
you
,
Melanctha
.
I
be
wrong
not
to
trust
you
perhaps
,

it
do
make
thing
very
ugly
to
I
.
I
try
to
be
honest
to
you
,


Melanctha
,
the
way
you
say
you
really
want
it
from
I

"




Melanctha
draw
her
hand
from
Jeff
Campbell
.
she
sit
there
,

there


be
deep
scorn
in
her
anger
.

you
be
n't
all

,

silent
a
little
,

he
wait
before
he
give
his
answer

not
the

you
see
,
Melanctha

really
,
it
be
just
like
this
way


always
with
I
.
you
see
,
Melanctha
,
its
like
this
way
now
all
the
time


with
I
.
you
remember
,
Melanctha
,
what
I
be
once
tell
to
you
,
when


I
do
n't
know
you
very
long
together
,
about
how
I
certainly
never
do


know
more
than
just
two
kind
of
way
of
living
,
one
way
the
way
it
be


good
to
be
in
family
and
the
other
kind
of
way
,
like
animal
be
all


the
time
just
with
each
other
,
and
how
I
do
n't
ever
like
that
last


kind
of
way
much
for
any
of
the
colored
people
.
you
see
Melanctha
,


it
be
like
this
way
with
I

I
get
a
new
feeling
now
,
you
been
teach


to
I
,
just
like
I
tell
you
once
,
just
like
a
new
religion
to
I
,


and
I
see
perhaps
what
really
love
be
like
,
like
really
have


everything
together
,
new
thing
,
little
piece
all
different
,
like


I
always
before
be
think
be
bad
to
be
have
,
all
go
together


like
,
to
make
one
good
big
feeling
.
you
see
,
Melanctha
,
it
be
certainly


like
that
you
make
I
be
see
,
like
I
never
know
before
any
way


there
be
of
all
kind
of
love
to
come
together
to
make
one
way


really
truly
lovely
.
I
see
that
now
,
sometimes
,
the
way
you
certainly


be
teach
I
,
Melanctha
,
really
,
and
then
I
love
you
those
time
,


Melanctha
,
like
a
real
religion
,
and
then
it
come
over
I
all
sudden
,


I
do
n't
know
anything
real
about
you
Melanctha
,
dear
one
,
and
then
it


come
over
I
sudden
,
perhaps
I
certainly
be
wrong
now
,
think
all


this
way
so
lovely
,
and
not
think
now
any
more
the
old
way
I
always


before
be
always
think
,
about
what
be
the
right
way
for
I
,
to


live
regular
and
all
the
colored
people
,
and
then
I
think
,
perhaps
,


Melanctha
you
be
really
just
a
bad
one
,
and
I
think
,
perhaps
I


certainly
be
do
it
so
because
I
just
be
too
anxious
to
be
just


have
all
the
time
excitement
,
like
I
do
n't
ever
like
really
to
be


do
when
I
know
it
,
and
then
I
always
get
so
bad
to
you
,
Melanctha
,


and
I
ca
n't
help
it
with
myself
then
,
never
,
for
I
want
to
be
always


right
really
in
the
way
,
I
have
to
do
they
.
I
certainly
do
very
badly


want
to
be
right
,
Melanctha
,
the
only
way
I
know
be
right
Melanctha


really
,
and

be
all
the

time
to
she
about
what
be


right
for
they
both
to

always

would
be
,
as
if
she
give
way


in
her
head
,

lose
herself
in
a
bad
feeling
.
sometimes
when
they


have
be
strong
in
their
loving
,
and
Jeff
would
have
rise
inside
he


some
strange
feeling
,

Melanctha
feel
it
in
he
as
it
would
soon
be


come
,
she
would
lose
herself
then
in
this

make
she


head
act
as
if
she
never
know
what
it
be
they
be
do
.
and
slowly


now
,
Jeff
soon
always
come
to
be
feel
that
his
Melanctha
would
be


hurt
very
much
in
her
head

the
way
he
never

to
think
of
,

she
would
ever
now
again
have
to
listen
to
his
trouble
,

he
be


tell
about

he
still
be
want

thing
for


himself

now
Jeff
begin
to
have
always
a
strong
feeling
that

no


long
stand
it
,
with
all
her
bad
suffering
,
to
let
he
fight
out
with


himself
what

he
feel
he
must
not
,


when
she
be
there
with
he
,
keep
on
,
with
this
kind
of
fight
that


be
always
go
on
inside

Jeff
Campbell
never

what
he


think
be
the
right
way
,
for
himself

for
all
the
colored
people


to
be
live

Jeff
be
come
always
each
time
close
to
be
really


understanding
,

now
Melanctha
be
so
bad
in
her
suffering
with
he
,


that
he
know
she
could
not
any
long
have
he
with
she

,
the


right
way
,
for
they
to
be
really

Jeff
see
now
he
have
to
go
so
fast
,
so
that
Melanctha
never
would
have


to
wait
any
to
get
from
he
always
all
that

any
more

very
much
it
be

what
it
be

be
really


happen

every
now

then
,
when
they
be


get
strong
to
get
excited
,
the
way
they
use
to
when
he
give
his


feel
out
so
that
he
could

she
just
look
at
he

look
as

her

then
Jeff
have
to
keep
himself
from
be


honest
,

he
have
to
go
so

night
to
he

be
it
true


that
he

the
one

make
all
this
trouble
for

what
to
feel
within
he
.
he
do
not


know
how
to
begin
think
out
this
trouble
that
must
always
now
be


bad
inside
he
.
he
just
feel
a
confused
struggle
and
resentment
always


in
he
,
a
knowing
,
no
,
Melanctha
be
not
right
in
what
she
have
say


that
night
to
he
,
and
then
a
feeling
,
perhaps
he
always
have
be


wrong
in
the
way
he
never
could
be
understand
.
and
then
would
come


strong
to
he
,
a
sense
of
the
deep
sweetness
in
Melanctha
's
loving
and


a
hate

right
way
to

out
what
be
inside
Melanctha
with
her
loving
,
he
could
not
use
any


way
now
to
reach
inside
she
to
find
if
she
be
true
in
her
loving
,
but


now
something
have
go
wrong
between

Melanctha
be
too
many
for
he
.
he
be
helpless
to
find
out
the
way


she
really
feel
now
for
he
.
often
Jeff
would

baffle
with

something
,
he

not
right
now
in
she
.
something
in
she
always
now
be
make


strong
the
torment
that
be
tear
every
minute
at
the
joy
he
once


always
have
have
with
she
.




always
now
Jeff
wonder
do
Melanctha
love
he
.
always
now
he
be


wonder
,
be
Melanctha
right
when
she
say
,
it
be
he
have
make
all


their
beginning
.
be
Melanctha
right
when
she
say
,
it
be
he
have
the


real
responsibility
for
all
the
trouble
they
have
and
still
be
have


now
between
they
.
if
she
be
right
,
what
a
brute
he
always
have
be
in


his
acting
.
if
she
be
right
,

be
to
endure
the


pain
he
have
make
so
bad
so
often
for
she
.

have
make


herself
to
bear
it
,
for
her
own
sake
,
not
for
his

not
so
twisted
in
all
his
long
thinking
.
surely
he


could
remember
right
what
it
be
had
happen
every
day
in
their
long

be
not
so
poor
a
coward
as
Melanctha
always
seem


to
be
think
.
surely
,
surely
,
and
then
the
torment
would
get
bad


every

it
bad


enough

want
to
stand
it

all
wrong

it
any

the

we
really
do
it

do
n't
know

her
loving

find
out

I
know

himself

right

I

her
trouble

everybody

Melanctha

Jeff

do
not

all
Jeff
know
,
be
that
now
he
could
not
be
so
often
with
she

Jeff
never
know
how
it
have
come

now
he
never

Melanctha
would

a
little
,

Tuesday
.
"
Jeff
Campbell
would
then
go
away
and
leave
she
,


and
he
would
be
hurt
and
very
angry
,
for
it
be
hard
for
a
man
with
a


great
pride
in
himself
,
like
Jeff
Campbell
,
to
feel
himself
no
well


than
a
beggar
.
and
yet
he
always
come
as
she
say
he
should
,
on
the


day
she
have
fix
for
he
,
and
always
Jeff
Campbell
be
not
sure


yet
that
he
really
understand
what
it
be
Melanctha
want
.
always


Melanctha
say
to
he
,
yes
she
love
he
,
sure
he
know
that
.
always


Melanctha
say
to
he
,
she
certainly
do
love
he
just
the
same
as


always
,
only
sure
he
know
now
she
certainly
do
seem
to
be
right
busy


with
all
she
certainly
now
have
to
be
do
.




Jeff
never
know
what
Melanctha
have
to
do
now
,
that
make
she
always


be
so
busy
,
but
Jeff
Campbell
never
care
to
ask
Melanctha
such
a


question
.
besides
Jeff
know
Melanctha
Herbert
would
never
,
in
such
a


matter
,
give
he
any
kind
of
a
real
answer
.
Jeff
do
not
know
whether


it
be
that
Melanctha
do
not
know
how
to
give
a
simple
answer
.
and


then
how
could
he
,
Jeff
,
know
what
be
important
to
she
.
Jeff
Campbell


always
feel
strongly
in
he
,
he
have
no
right
to
interfere
with


Melanctha
in
any
practical
kind
of
a
matter
.
there
they
have
always
,


never
ask
each
other
any
kind
of
question
.
there
they
have
feel


always
in
each
other
,
not
any
right
to
take
care
of
one
another
.
and


Jeff
Campbell
now
feel
less
than
he
have
ever
,
any
right
to
claim
to


know
what
Melanctha
think
it
right
that
she
should
do
in
any
of
she


way
of
living
.
all
Jeff
feel
a
right
in
himself
to
question
,
be
she


love
.




Jeff
learn
every
day
now
,
more
and
more
,
how
much
it
be
that
he


could
really
suffer
.
sometimes
it
hurt
so
in
he
,
when
he
be
alone
,


it
would
force
some
slow
tear
from
he
.
but
every
day
,
now
that
Jeff


Campbell
,
know
more
how
it
could
hurt
he
,
he
lose
his
feeling
of
deep


awe
that
he
once
always
have
have
for
Melanctha
's
feeling
.
suffering
be


not
so
much
after
all
,
think
Jeff
Campbell
,
if
even
he
could
feel
it


so
it
hurt
he
.
it
hurt
he
bad
,
just
the
way
he
know
he
once
have
hurt


Melanctha
,
and
yet
he
too
could
have
it
and
not
make
any
kind
of
a


loud
holler
with
it
.




in
tender
hearted
nature
,
those
that
mostly
never
feel
strong


passion
,
suffering
often
come
to
make
they
hard
.
when
these
do
not


know
in
themselves
what
it
be
to
suffer
,
suffering
be
then
very
awful


to
they
and
they
badly
want
to
help
everyone
who
ever
have
to
suffer
,


and
they
have
a
deep
reverence
for
anybody
who
know
really
how
to


always
surfer
.
but
when
it
come
to
they
to
really
suffer
,
they
soon


begin
to
lose
their
fear
and
tenderness
and
wonder
.
why
it
be
n't
so


very
much
to
suffer
,
when
even
I
can
bear
to
do
it
.
it
be
n't
very


pleasant
to
be
have
all
the
time
,
to
stand
it
,
but
they
be
not
so


much
wise
after
all
,
all
the
other
just
because
they
know
too
how
to


bear
it
.




passionate
nature
who
have
always
make
themselves
,
to
suffer
,
that
is


all
the
kind
of
people
who
have
emotion
that
come
to
they
as
sharp
as


a
sensation
,
they
always
get
more
tender
-
hearted
when
they
suffer
,
and


it
always
do
they
good
to
suffer
.
tender
-
hearted
,
unpassionate
,
and


comfortable
nature
always
get
much
hard
when
they
suffer
,
for


so
they
lose
the
fear
and
reverence
and
wonder
they
once
have
for


everybody
who
ever
have
to
suffer
,
for
now
they
know
themselves
what
it


be
to
suffer
and
it
be
not
so
awful
any
long
to
they
when
they
know


too
,
just
as
well
as
all
the
other
,
how
to
have
it
.




and
so
it
come
in
these
day
to
Jeff
Campbell
.
Jeff
know
now
always
,


way
inside
he
,
what
it
be
to
really
suffer
,
and
now
every
day
with


it
,
he
know
how
to
understand
Melanctha
well
.
Jeff
Campbell
still


love
Melanctha
Herbert
and
he
still
have
a
real
trust
in
she
and


he
still
have
a
little
hope
that
some
day
they
would
once
more
get


together
,
but
slowly
,
every
day
,
this
hope
in
he
would
keep
grow


always
weak
.
they
still
be
a
good
deal
of
time
together
,
but
now


they
never
any
more
be
really
trust
with
each
other
.
in
the
day


when
they
use
to
be
together
,
Jeff
have
feel
he
do
not
know
much
what

his
trust
in

well
,

a
deep
trust
in
she
.
now
Jeff
never
could
be
really
honest


with
she
.
he
never
doubt
yet
,
that
she
be
steady
only
to
he
,
but


somehow
he
could
not
believe
much
really
in
Melanctha
's
loving
.




Melanctha
Herbert
be
a

,


when
he
have
learn
to
really
love
Melanctha
,
she
do
not
need
any


more
to
have
he

Jeff
begin
to
know
this
very
well
inside
he

Jeff
Campbell
do
not
know
yet
that
Melanctha
have
begin
again
to


wander
.
Jeff
be
not
very
quick
to
suspect
Melanctha
.
all
Jeff
know


be
,
that
he
do
not
trust
she
to
be
now
really
love
to
he

Jeff
be
no
long
now
in
any
doubt
inside
he
.
he
know
very
well
now


he
really
love
Melanctha
.
he
know
now
very
well
she
be
not
any
more


a
real
religion
to
he
.
Jeff
Campbell
know
very
well
too
now
inside


he
,
he
do
not
really
want
Melanctha
,
now
if
he
could
no
long


trust
she
,
though
he
love
she
hard
and
really
know
now
what
it
be
to


suffer
.




every
day
Melanctha
Herbert
be
less
and
less
near
to
he
.
she
always


be
very
pleasant
in
her
talk
and
to
be
with
he
,
but
somehow
now
it


never
be
any
comfort
to
he
.




Melanctha
Herbert
now
always
have
a
lot
of
friend
around
she
.
Jeff


Campbell
never
want
to
be
with
they
.
now
Melanctha
begin
to
find


it
,
she
say
it
often
to
he
,
always
hard
to
arrange
to
be
alone
now


with
he
.
sometimes
she
would
be
late
for
he
.
then
Jeff
always
would


try
to
be
patient
in
his
waiting
,
for
Jeff
Campbell
know
very
well
how


to
remember
,
and
he
know
it
be
only
right
that
he
should
now
endure


this
from
she
.




then
Melanctha
begin
to
manage
often
not
to
see
he
,
and
once
she
go


away
when
she
have
promise
to
be
there
to
meet
he
.




then
Jeff
Campbell
be
really
fill
up
with
his
anger
.
now
he
know


he
could
never
really
want
she
.
now
he
know
he
never
any
more
could


really
trust
she
.




Jeff
Campbell
never
know
why
Melanctha
have
not
come
to
meet
he
.


Jeff
have
hear
a
little
talk
now
,
about
how
Melanctha
Herbert
have


commence
once
more
to
wander
.
Jeff
Campbell
still
sometimes
see
Jane


Harden
,
who
always
need
a
doctor
to
be
often
there
to
help
she
.
Jane


Harden
always
know
very
well
what
happen
to
Melanctha
.
Jeff
Campbell


never
would
talk
to
Jane
Harden
anything
about
Melanctha
.
Jeff
be


always
loyal
to
Melanctha
.
Jeff
never
let
Jane
Harden
say
much
to
he


about
Melanctha
,
though
he
never
let
she
know
that
now
he
love
she
.


but
somehow
Jeff
do
know
now
about
Melanctha
,
and
he
know
about
some


man
that
Melanctha
meet
with
Rose
Johnson
very
often
.




Jeff
Campbell
would
not
let
himself
really
doubt
Melanctha
,
but
Jeff


begin
to
know
now
very
well
,
he
do
not
want
she
.
Melanctha
Herbert


do
not
love
he
ever
,
Jeff
know
it
now
,
the
way
he
once
have
think


that
she
could
feel
it
.
once
she
have
be
great
for
he
than
he
have


think
he
could
ever
know
how
to
feel
it
.
now
Jeff
have
come
to
where


he
could
understand
Melanctha
Herbert
.
Jeff
be
not
bitter
to
she


because
she
could
not
really
love
he
,
he
be
bitter
only
that
he
have


let
himself
have
a
real
illusion
in
he
.
he
be
a
little
bitter
too
,


that
he
have
lose
now
,
what
he
have
always
feel
real
in
the
world
,
that


have
make
it
for
he
always
full
of
beauty
,
and
now
he
have
not
get
this


new
religion
really
,
and
he
have
lose
what
he
before
have
to
know
what


be
good
and
have
real
beauty
.




Jeff
Campbell
be
so
angry
now
in
he
,
because
he
have
beg
Melanctha


always
to
be
honest
to
he
.
Jeff
could
stand
it
in
she
not
to
love


he
,
he
could
not
stand
it
in
she
not
to
be
honest
to
he
.




Jeff
Campbell
go
home
from
where
Melanctha
have
not
meet
he
,
and
he


be
sore
and
full
of
anger
in
he
.




Jeff
Campbell
could
not
be
sure
what
to
do
,
to
make
it
right
inside


he
.
surely
he
must
be
strong
now
and
cast
this
love
from
he
,


and
yet
,
be
he
sure
he
now
have
real
wisdom
in
he
.
be
he
sure
that


Melanctha
Herbert
never
have
have
a
real
deep
loving
for
he
.
be
he


sure
Melanctha
Herbert
never
have
deserve
a
reverence
from
he
.
always


now
Jeff
have
this
torment
in
he
,
but
always
now
he
feel
more
that


Melanctha
never
have
real
greatness
for
he
.




Jeff
wait
to
see
if
Melanctha
would
send
any
word
to
he
.
Melanctha


Herbert
never
send
a
line
to
he
.




at
last
Jeff
write
his
letter
to
Melanctha
.
"
Dear
Melanctha
,
I


certainly
do
know
you
ai
n't
be
any
way
sick
this
last
week
when
you


never
meet
I
right
the
way
you
promise
,
and
never
send
I
any
word
to


say
why
you
act
a
way
you
certainly
never
could
think
be
the
right


way
you
should
do
it
to
I
.
Jane
Harden
say
she
see
you
that
day
and


you
go
out
walk
with
some
people
you
like
now
to
be
with
.
do
n't


be
misunderstand
I
now
any
more
Melanctha
.
I
love
you
now
because


that
be
my
slow
way
to
learn
what
you
been
teach
,
but
I
know
now


you
certainly
never
have
what
seem
to
I
real
kind
of
feeling
.
I
do
n't


love
you
Melanctha
any
more
now
like
a
real
religion
,
because
now
I


know
you
be
just
make
like
all
we
other
.
I
know
now
no
man
can


ever
really
hold
you
because
no
man
can
ever
be
real
to
trust
in
you
,


because
you
mean
right
Melanctha
,
but
you
never
can
remember
,
and


so
you
certainly
never
have
get
any
way
to
be
honest
.
so
please
you


understand
I
right
now
Melanctha
,
it
never
be
I
do
n't
know
how
to


love
you
.
I
do
know
now
how
to
love
you
,
Melanctha
,
really
.
you
sure


do
know
that
,
Melanctha
,
in
I
.
you
certainly
always
can
trust
I
.
and


so
now
Melanctha
,
I
can
say
to
you
certainly
real
honest
with
you
,
I


be
well
than
you
be
in
my
right
kind
of
feeling
.
and
so
Melanctha
,


I
do
n't
never
any
more
want
to
be
a
trouble
to
you
.
you
certainly
make


I
see
thing
Melanctha
,
I
never
any
other
way
could
be
know
.
you


be
very
good
and
patient
to
I
,
when
I
be
certainly
below
you
in
my


right
feeling
.
I
certainly
never
have
be
near
so
good
and
patient


to
you
every
any
way
Melanctha
,
I
certainly
know
that
Melanctha
.
but


Melanctha
,
with
I
,
it
certainly
be
,
always
to
be
good
together
,
two


people
certainly
must
be
think
each
one
as
good
as
the
other
,
to
be


really
love
right
Melanctha
.
and
it
certainly
must
never
be
any
kind


of
feeling
,
of
one
only
take
,
and
one
only
just
give
,
Melanctha
,


to
I
.
I
know
you
certainly
do
n't
really
ever
understand
I
now


Melanctha
,
but
that
be
no
matter
.
I
certainly
do
know
what
I
be
feel


now
with
you
real
Melanctha
.
and
so
good
-
bye
now
for
good
Melanctha
.
I


say
I
can
never
ever
really
trust
you
real
Melanctha
,
that
be
only
just


certainly
from
your
way
of
not
be
ever
equal
in
your
feeling
to


anybody
real
,
Melanctha
,
and
your
way
never
to
know
right
how
to


remember
.
many
way
I
really
trust
you
deep
Melanctha
,
and
I
certainly


do
feel
deep
all
the
good
sweetness
you
certainly
get
real
in
you


Melanctha
.
its
only
just
in
your
love
I
Melanctha
.
you
never
can
be


equal
to
I
and
that
way
I
certainly
never
can
bear
any
more
to
have


it
.
and
so
now
Melanctha
,
I
always
be
your
friend
,
if
you
need
I
,
and


now
we
never
see
each
other
any
more
to
talk
to
.
"




and
then
Jeff
Campbell
think
and
think
,
and
he
could
never
make


any
way
for
he
now
,
to
see
it
different
,
and
so
at
last
he
send
this


letter
to
Melanctha
.




and
now
surely
it
be
all
over
in
Jeff
Campbell
.
surely
now
he
never


any
more
could
know
Melanctha
.
and
yet
,
perhaps
Melanctha
really
love


he
.
and
then
she
would
know
how
much
it
hurt
he
never
any
more
,
any


way
,
to
see
she
,
and
perhaps
she
would
write
a
line
to
tell
he
.


but
that
be
a
foolish
way
for
Jeff
ever
to
be
think
.
of
course


Melanctha
never
would
write
a
word
to
he
.
it
be
all
over
now
for


always
,
everything
between
they
,
and
Jeff
feel
it
a
real
relief
to


he
.




for
many
day
now
Jeff
Campbell
only
feel
it
as
a
relief
in
he
.
Jeff


be
all
lock
up
and
quiet
now
inside
he
.
it
be
all
settle
down


heavy
in
he
,
and
these
day
when
it
be
sink
so
deep
in
he
,
it


be
only
the
rest
and
quiet
of
not
fight
that
he
could
really
feel


inside
he
.
Jeff
Campbell
could
not
think
now
,
or
feel
anything
else


in
he
.
he
have
no
beauty
nor
any
goodness
to
see
around
he
.
it
be
a


dull
,
pleasant
kind
of
quiet
he
now
have
inside
he
.
Jeff
almost
begin


to
love
this
dull
quiet
in
he
,
for
it
be
more
nearly
be
free
for


he
than
anything
he
have
know
in
he
since
Melanctha
Herbert
first


have
move
he
.
he
do
not
find
it
a
real
rest
yet
for
he
,
he
have


not
really
conquer
what
have
be
work
so
long
in
he
,
he
have
not


learn
to
see
beauty
and
real
goodness
yet
in
what
have
happen
to


he
,
but
it
be
rest
even
if
he
be
sodden
now
all
through
he
.
Jeff


Campbell
like
it
very
well
,
not
to
have
fight
always
go
on


inside
he
.




and
so
Jeff
go
on
every
day
,
and
he
be
quiet
,
and
he
begin
again
to


watch
himself
in
his
working
;
and
he
do
not
see
any
beauty
now
around


he
,
and
it
be
dull
and
heavy
always
now
inside
he
,
and
yet
he
be


content
to
have
go
so
far
in
keep
steady
to
what
he
know
be
the


right
way
for
he
to
come
back
to
,
to
be
regular
,
and
see
beauty
in


every
kind
of
quiet
way
of
living
,
the
way
he
have
always
want
it
for


himself
and
for
all
the
colored
people
.
he
know
he
have
lose
the
sense


he
once
have
of
joy
all
through
he
,
but
he
could
work
,
and
perhaps
he


would
bring
some
real
belief
back
into
he
about
the
beauty
that
he


could
not
now
any
more
see
around
he
.




and
so
Jeff
Campbell
go
on
with
his
working
,
and
he
staid
home
every


evening
,
and
he
begin
again
with
his
reading
,
and
he
do
not
do
much


talk
,
and
he
do
not
seem
to
himself
to
have
any
kind
of
feeling
.




and
one
day
Jeff
think
perhaps
he
really
be
forget
,
one
day
he


think
he
could
soon
come
back
and
be
happy
in
his
old
way
of
regular


and
quiet
living
.




Jeff
Campbell
have
never
talk
to
any
one
of
what
have
be
go
on


inside
he
.
Jeff
Campbell
like
to
talk
and
he
be
honest
,
but
it


never
come
out
from
he
,
anything
he
be
ever
really
feel
,
it


only
come
out
from
he
,
what
it
be
that
he
be
always
think
.
Jeff


Campbell
always
be
very
proud
to
hide
what
he
be
really
feel
.


always
he
blush
hot
to
think
thing
he
have
be
feel
.
only
to


Melanctha
Herbert
,
have
it
ever
come
to
he
,
to
tell
what
it
be
that


he
be
feel
.




and
so
Jeff
Campbell
go
on
with
this
dull
and
sodden
,
heavy
,
quiet


always
in
he
,
and
he
never
seem
to
be
able
to
have
any
feeling
.


only
sometimes
he
shiver
hot
with
shame
when
he
remember
some


thing
he
once
have
be
feel
.
and
then
one
day
it
all
wake
up
,
and


be
sharp
in
he
.




Dr.
Campbell
be
just
then
stay
long
time
with
a
sick
man
who


might
soon
be
die
.
one
day
the
sick
man
be
rest
.
Dr.
Campbell


go
to
the
window
to
look
out
a
little
,
while
he
be
wait
.
it


be
very
early
now
in
the
southern
springtime
.
the
tree
be
just


begin
to
get
the
little
zigzag
crinkle
in
they
,
which
the
young


bud
always
give
they
.
the
air
be
soft
and
moist
and
pleasant
to


they
.
the
earth

wet
and
rich
and
smell

.
the

make
sharp
fresh
noise
all
around
they
.
the
wind
be
very
gentle


and
yet
urgent
to
they
.
and
the
bud
and
the
long
earthworm
,
and
the


negro
,
and
all
the
kind
of
child
,
be
come
out
every
minute


far
into
the
new
spring
,
watery
,
southern
sunshine
.




Jeff
Campbell
too
begin
to
feel
a
little
his
old
joy
inside
he
.
the


sodden
quiet
begin
to
break
up
in
he
.
he
lean
far
out
of
the
window


to
mix
it
all
up
with
he
.
his
heart
go
sharp
and
then
it
almost


stop
inside
he
.

or
be
it

some
other

,
who
make
he


feel
so
bad
inside
he
?
well
,

.


Melanctha
Herbert
be
always
in
the
same
town
with
he
,
and
he
could


never
any
more
feel
she
near
he
.
what
a
fool
he
be
to

and
the
bitter
water
once


more
rise
up
in
he
.




all
that
long

his
nail

Melanctha
have
learn

Melanctha
do
not

Melanctha

Rose
be
a
good

look
,


well
kind
of
black
girl
,
and
have
be
bring
up
quite
like
their


own
child
by
white
folk
.
Rose
be
live
now
with
colored
people
.


Rose
be
stay
just
then
with
a
colored
woman
,
who
have
know
'
Mis
'


Herbert
and
her
black
husband
and
this
girl
Melanctha
.




Rose
soon
get
to
like
Melanctha
Herbert
and
Melanctha
now
always


want
to
be
with
Rose
,
whenever
she
could
do
it
.
Melanctha
Herbert


always
be
do
everything
for
Rose
that
she
could
think
of
that
Rose


ever
want
.
Rose
always
like
to
be
with
nice
people
who
would
do


thing
for
she
.
Rose
have
strong
common
sense
and
she
be
lazy
.
Rose


like
Melanctha
Herbert
,
she
have
such
kind
of
fine
way
in
she
.
then
,


too
,
Rose
have
it
in
she
to
be
sorry
for
the
subtle
,
sweet
-
natured
,


docile
,
intelligent
Melanctha
Herbert
who
always
be
so
blue


sometimes
,
and
always
have
have
so
much
trouble
.
then
,
too
,
Rose
could


scold
Melanctha
,
for
Melanctha
Herbert
never
could
know
how
to
keep


herself
from
trouble
,
and
Rose
be
always
strong
to
keep
straight
,


with
her
simple
selfish
wisdom
.




but
why
do
the
subtle
,
intelligent
,
attractive
,
half
white
girl


Melanctha
Herbert
,
with
her
sweetness
and
her
power
and
her
wisdom
,


demean
herself
to
do
for
and
to
flatter

to
be
scold
,
by
this


lazy
,
stupid
,
ordinary
,
selfish
black
girl
.
this
be
a
queer
thing
in


Melanctha
Herbert
.




and
so
now
in
these
new
spring
day
,
it
be
with
Rose
that
Melanctha


begin
again
to

very
well
in
herself
what
be


the
right
way
to
do
when
you
wander
.
Rose
know
very
well
,
she
be


not
just
any
common
kind
of
black
girl

for
she
have
be
raise

Rose
always
see

Rose


always

the
sense
for
proper
conduct
.
Rose
always
be

the
complex
and
less
sure
Melanctha
,
what
be
the
right
way


she
should
do
when
she
wander
.




Rose
never

much
about
Jeff

Rose


have
not

about
Melanctha
Herbert
when
she
have
be
almost
all
she


time

.




Jeff
Campbell
do
not
like
Rose
when
he
see
she
with

.
he


be
not
important
now
to
be
with

Rose
do
not
like
Melanctha
's
old
friend
Jane
Harden
when
she
see
she
.


Jane
despise
Rose
for
an
ordinary
,
stupid
,
sullen
black
girl
.
Jane


could
not
see
what
Melanctha
could
find
in
that
black
girl
,
to
endure


she
.
it
make
Jane
sick
to
see
she
.
but
then
Melanctha
have
a
good
mind
,


but
she
certainly
never
do
care
much
to
really
use
it
.
Jane
Harden


now
really
never
care
any
more
to
see
Melanctha
,
though
Melanctha


still
always
try
to
be
good
to
she
.
and
Rose
,
she
hate
that
stick


up
,
mean
speaking
,
nasty
,
drunk
thing
,
Jane
Harden
.
Rose
do
not
see


how
Melanctha
could
bear
to
ever
see
she
,
but
Melanctha
always
be
so


good
to
everybody
,
she
never
would
know
how
to
act
to
people
the
way


they
deserve
that
she
should
do
it
.




Rose
do
not
know
much
about
Melanctha
,
and
Jeff
Campbell
and
Jane


harden
.
all
Rose
know
about
Melanctha
be
her
old
life
with
her
mother


and
her
father
.
Rose
be
always
glad
to
be
good
to
poor
Melanctha
,
who


have
have
such
an
awful
time
with
her
mother
and
her
father
,
and
now
she


be
alone
and
have
nobody
who
could
help
she
.
"
he
be
a
awful
black
man


to
you
Melanctha
,
I
like
to
get
my
hand
on
he
so
he
certainly
could


feel
it
.
I
just
would
Melanctha
,
now
you
hear
I
.
"




perhaps
it
be
this
simple
faith
and
simple
anger
and
simple
moral
way


of
do
in
Rose
,
that
Melanctha
now
find
such
a
comfort
to
she
.
Rose


be
selfish
and
be
stupid
and
be
lazy
,
but
she
be
decent
and
know


always
what
be
the
right
way
she
should
do
,
and
what
she
want
,
and


she
certainly
do
admire
how
bright
be
her
friend
Melanctha
Herbert
,


and
she
certainly
do
feel
how
very
much
it
be
she
always
suffer


and
she
scold
she
to
keep
she
from
more
trouble
,

she
never
be


angry

she
find
some
of
the
different
way
Melanctha
Herbert


sometimes
have
to
do
it

so
always
Rose

Melanctha
be
more

more
together

Jeff


Campbell
could
now

ai
n't
never
the
way
I
feel
it
ever
real
,
right
for
a
decent


colored
girl
to
be
always
do
,
but
not
never
Melanctha
,
now
you

I
,
no
not
never
no
kind
of
white

now


Melanctha
when
I
see
you
.
you
just
hear
to
I
Melanctha
,
you
certainly


have
ought
to

I
Melanctha
,
I
say
it
just
like
I
know
it
awful


well
,
Melanctha
,
and
I
know
you
do
n't
know
no
well
,
Melanctha
,
how


to
act
so
,
the
way
I
see
it
with
they
kind
of
white
feller
,
they
as


never
can
know
what
to
do
right
by
a
decent
girl
they
have
ever
get
to


be

.
now
you
hear
to
I
Melanctha
,
what
I
tell
you
.
"




and
so
it
be
Melanctha
Herbert
find
new
way
to
be
in
trouble
.


but
it
be
not
very
bad
this
trouble
,
for
these
white
man
rise
never


want
she
should
be
with
,
never
mean
very
much
to
Melanctha
.
it
be


only
that
she
like
it
to
be
with
they
,
and
they
know
all
about
fine


horse
,
and
it
be
just
good
to
Melanctha
,
now
a
little
,
to
feel
real


reckless
with
they
.
but
mostly
it
be
Rose
and
other
well
kind
of


colored
girl
and
colored
man
with
whom
Melanctha
Herbert
now
always


wander
.




it
be
summer
now
and
the
colored
people
come
out
into
the
sunshine
,


full
blow
with
the
flower
.
and
they
shine
in
the
street
and
in
the


field
with
their
warm
joy
,
and
they
glisten
in
their
black
heat
,


and
they
fling
themselves
free
in
their
wide
abandonment
of
shout


laughter
.




it
be
very
pleasant
in
some
way
,
the
life
Melanctha
Herbert
now
lead


with
Rose
and
all
the
other
.
it
be
not
always
that
Rose
have
to
scold


she
.




there
be
not
anybody
of
all
these
colored
people
,
except
only


Rose
,
who
ever
mean
much
to
Melanctha
Herbert
.
but
they
all
like


Melanctha
,
and
the
man
all
like
to
see
she
do
thing
,
she
be
so
game


always
to
do
anything
anybody
ever
could
do
,
and
then
she
be
good
and


sweet
to
do
anything
anybody
ever
want
from
she
.




these
be
pleasant
day
then
,
in
the
hot
southern
negro
sunshine
,


with
many
simple
joke
and
always
wide
abandonment
of
laughter
.
"
just


look
at
that
Melanctha
there
a
running
.
do
n't
she
just
go
like
a
bird


when
she
be
fly
.
hey
Melanctha
there
,
I
come
and
catch
you
,
hey


Melanctha
,
I
put
salt
on
your
tail
to
catch
you
,
"
and
then
the
man


would
try
to
catch
she
,
and
he
would
fall
full
on
the
earth
and
roll


in
an
agony
of
wide
-
mouthed
shouting
laughter
.
and
this
be
the
kind


of
way
Rose
always
like
to
have
Melanctha
do
it
,
to
be
engage
to


he
,
and
to
have
a
good
warm
nigger
time
with
colored
man
,
not
to
go


about
with
that
kind
of
white
man
,
never
could
know
how
to
act
right
,


to
any
decent
kind
of
girl
they
could
ever
get
to
be
with
they
.




Rose
,
always
more
and
more
,
like
Melanctha
Herbert
well
.
Rose
often


have
to
scold
Melanctha
Herbert
,
but
that
only
make
she
like
Melanctha


well
.
and
then
Melanctha
always
listen
to
she
,
and
always
act


every
way
she
could
to
please
she
.
and
then
Rose
be
so
sorry
for


Melanctha
,
when
she
be
so
blue
sometimes
,
and
want
somebody
should


come
and
kill
she
.




and
Melanctha
Herbert
cling
to
Rose
in
the
hope
that
Rose
could


save
she
.
Melanctha
feel
the
power
of
Rose
's
selfish
,
decent
kind
of


nature
.
it
be
so
solid
,
simple
,
certain
to
she
.
Melanctha
clung
to


Rose
,
she
love
to
have
she
scold
she
,
she
always
want
to
be
with


she
.
she
always
feel
a
solid
safety
in
she
;
Rose
always
be
,
in
she


way
,
very
good
to
let
Melanctha
be
love
to
she
.
Melanctha
never
have


any
way
she
could
really
be
a
trouble
to
she
.
Melanctha
never
have
any


way
that
she
could
ever
get
real
power
,
to
come
close
inside
to
she
.


Melanctha
be
always
very
humble
to
she
.
Melanctha
be
always
ready
to


do
anything
Rose
want
from
she
.
Melanctha
need
badly
to
have


Rose
always
willing
to
let
Melanctha
cling
to
she
.
Rose
be
a
simple
,


sullen
,
selfish
,
black
girl
,
but
she
have
a
solid
power
in
she
.
Rose


have
strong
the
sense
of
decent
conduct
,
she
have
strong
the
sense
of


decent
comfort
.
Rose
always
know
very
well
what
it
be
she
want
,
and


she
know
very
well
what
be
the
right
way
to
do
to
get
everything
she


want
,
and
she
never
have
any
kind
of
trouble
to
perplex
she
.
and
so


the
subtle
intelligent
attractive
half
white
girl
Melanctha
Herbert


love
and
do
for
,
and
demean
herself
in
service
to
this
coarse
,


decent
,
sullen
,
ordinary
,
black
,
childish
Rose
and
now
this
unmoral


promiscuous
shiftless
Rose
be
to
be
married
to
a
good
man
of
the


negro
,
while
Melanctha
Herbert
with
her
white
blood
and
attraction


and
her
desire
for
a
right
position
be
perhaps
never
to
be
really


regularly
marry
.
sometimes
the
thought
of
how
all
her
world
be


make
fill
the
complex
,
desire
Melanctha
with
despair
.
she
wonder


often
how
she
could
go
on
live
when
she
be
so
blue
.
sometimes


Melanctha
think
she
would
just
kill
herself
,
for
sometimes
she


think
this
would
be
really
the
good
thing
for
she
to
do
.

in
her
position
to

Rose


be
lazy
,
but
not

,
and
Sam

careful
but
not
fussy
.
Sam
be


a
kindly
,
simple
,
earnest
,
steady

,
and
Rose
have
good


common
decent
sense
in
she
,
of
how
to
live
regular
,
and
not
to
have


excitement
,
and
to
be
save
so
you
could
be
always
sure
to
have


money
,
so
as
to
have
everything
you
want
.




it
be
not
very
long
that
Rose
know
Sam
Johnson
,
before
they
be


regularly
marry
.
sometimes
Sam
go
into
the
country
with
all
the


other
young
church
people
,
and
then
he
would
be
a
great
deal
with
Rose


and
with
her
Melanctha
Herbert
.
Sam

always
well
.
Melanctha
's


mystery

no
charm
for
Sam
ever
.
Sam

a
nice
little
house
to


come
to
when
he
be
tired
from
his

be
ready
to
marry
as

wedding
and
be

.
then
they

little
red
brick
house
and
then
Sam
go
back
to
his


work
as
deck
hand
on
a
coasting
steamer
.




Rose
have
often
talk
to
Sam
about
how
good
Melanctha

and
how
much

.
Sam
Johnson
never
really

Rose
do
the
talking
for


she
.

Rose
be
the
only
steady
thing

so
Melanctha
demean
herself
to
be
like

servant
,
to
wait
on

and
always

,
as
the
right
way
he
should


act
toward

it
could
never
come
to
Melanctha
to
ask
Rose
to

.
it
never


could
come
to
Melanctha
to
think
that
Rose
would
ask

.
it
would


never
ever
come
to
Melanctha
to
want
it
,
if
Rose
should
ask

Melanctha
Herbert
want
badly
to

safe
now
,
but
this


live
with
she
,
that
,
Rose
would
never
give
she
.
Rose
have
strong


the
sense
for
decent
comfort
,
Rose
have
strong
the
sense
for
proper


conduct

thing
she
need

and


always
Rose
get
what

want
.




and
so
Rose
have
Melanctha
Herbert
always
there
to
help
she
,
and
she


sit
and
be
lazy
and
she
brag
and
she
complain
a
little
and
she


tell
Melanctha
how
she
ought
to
do
,
to
get
good
what
she
want
like


she
Rose
always
do
it
,
and
always
Melanctha
be
do
everything
Rose


ever
need
.
"
do
n't
you
bother
so
,
do
that
Melanctha
,
I
do
it
or


Sam
when
he
come
home
to
help
I
.
sure
you
do
n't
mind
lift
it


Melanctha
?
you
be
very
good
Melanctha
to
do
it
,
and
when
you
go
out


Melanctha
,
you
stop
and
get
some
rice
to
bring
I
to
-
morrow
when
you


come
in
.
sure
you
wo
n't
forget
Melanctha
.
I
never
see
anybody
like


you
Melanctha
to
always
do
thing
so
nice
for
I
.
"
and
then
Melanctha


would
do
some
more
for
Rose
,
and
then
very
late
Melanctha
would
go


home
to
the
colored
woman
where
she
live
now
.




and
so
though
Melanctha
still
be
so
much
with
Rose
Johnson
,
she
have


time
when
she
could
not
stay
there
.
Melanctha
now
could
not
really


cle
there
.
Rose
have
Sam
,
and
Melanctha
more
and
more
lose
the
hold


she
have
have
there
.




Melanctha
Herbert
begin
to
feel
she
must
begin
again
to
look
and
see


if
she
could
find
what
it
be

have
always
want
.
now
Rose
Johnson


could
no
long

.




and
so
Melanctha
Herbert
begin
once
more

with
man

fight
to
win
out
,
well
.


Melanctha
really
have
already
lose
it
,
in
not
keep
quiet
and
wait


for
Jem
to
do
it
.




Jem
Richards
be
not
yet
have
well
luck
in
his
betting
.
he
never


before
have
have
such
a
long
time
without
some
good
come
to
he
in


his
betting
.
sometimes
Jem
talk
as
if
he
want
to
go
off
on
a
trip


somewhere
and
try
some
other
place
for
luck
with
his
betting
.
Jem


richard
never
talk
as
if
he
want
to
take
Melanctha
with
he
.




and
so
Melanctha
sometimes
be
really
trust
,
and
sometimes
she
be


all
sick
inside
she
with
she
doubt
.
what
be
it
Jem
really
want


to
do
with
she
?
he
do
not
have
any
other
woman
,
in
that
Melanctha


could
be
really
trust
,
and
when
she
say
no
to
he
,
no
she
never


would
come
near
he
,
now
he
do
not
want
to
have
she
,
then
Jem
would


change
and
swear
,
yes
sure
he
do
want
she
,
now
and
always
right
here


near
he
,
but
he
never
now
any
more
say
he
want
to
be
marry
soon


to
she
.
but
then
Jem
Richards
never
would
marry
a
girl
,
he
say
that


very
often
,
when
he
be
in
this
kind
of
trouble
,
and
now
he
do
not


see
any
way
he
could
get
out
of
his
trouble
.
but
Melanctha
ought
to


wear
his
ring
,
sure
she
know
he
never
have
love
any
kind
of
woman
like


he
love
she
.
Melanctha
would
wear
the
ring
a
little
while
,
and
then


they
would
have
some
more
trouble
,
and
then
she
would
say
to
he
,
no


she
certainly
never
would
any
more
wear
anything
he
give
she
,
and
then


she
would
wear
it
on
the
string
so
nobody
could
see
it
but
she
could


always
feel
it
on
she
.




Poor
Melanctha
,
surely
her
love
have
make
she
mad
and
foolish
.




and
now
Melanctha
need
always
more
and
more
to
be
with
Rose
Johnson
,


and
Rose
have
commence
again
to
advise
she
,
but
Rose
could
not
help


she
.
there
be
no
way
now
that
anybody
could
advise
she
.
the
time
when


Melanctha
could
have
change
it
with
Jem
Richards
be
now
all
past


for
she
.
Rose
know
it
,
and
Melanctha
too
,
she
know
it
,
and
it
almost


kill
she
to
let
herself
believe
it
.




the
only
comfort
Melanctha
ever
have
now
be
wait
on
Rose
till


she
be
so
tired
she
could
hardly
stand
it
.
always
Melanctha
do


everything
Rose
ever
want
.
Sam
Johnson
begin
now
to
be
very
gentle


and
a
little
tender
to
Melanctha
.
she
be
so
good
to
Rose
and
Sam
be


so
glad
to
have
she
there
to
help
Rose
and
to
do
thing
and
to
be
a


comfort
to
she
.




Rose
have
a
hard
time
to
bring
her
baby
to
its
birth
and
Melanctha
do


everything
that
any
woman
could
.




the
baby
though
it
be
healthy
after
it
be
bear
do
not
live
long
.


Rose
Johnson
be
careless
and
negligent
and
selfish
and
when
Melanctha


have
to
leave
for
a
few
day
the
baby
die
.
Rose
Johnson
have
like
she


baby
well
enough
and
perhaps
she
just
forget
it
for
a
while
,
anyway


the
child
be
dead
and
Rose
and
Sam
be
very
sorry
,
but
then
these


thing
come
so
often
in
the
negro
world
in
Bridgepoint
that
they


neither
of
they
think
about
it
very
long
.
when
Rose
have
become


strong
again
she
go
back
to
her
house
with
Sam
.
and
Sam
Johnson
be


always
now
very
gentle
and
kind
and
good
to
Melanctha
who
have
be
so


good
to
Rose
in
her
bad
trouble
.




Melanctha
Herbert
's
trouble
with
Jem
Richards
be
never
get
any


well
.
Jem
always
now
have
less
and
less
time
to
be
with
she
.
when


Jem
be
with
Melanctha
now
he
be
good
enough
to
she
.
Jem
Richards
be


worried
with
his
betting
.
never
since
Jem
have
first
begin
to
make
a


living
have
he
ever
have
so
much
trouble
for
such
a
long
time
together


with
his
betting
.
Jem
Richards
be
good
enough
now
to
Melanctha
but
he


have
not
much
strength
to
give
she
.
Melanctha
could
never
any
more
now


make
he
quarrel
with
she
.
Melanctha
never
now
could
complain
of
his


treatment
of
she
,
for
surely
,
he
say
it
always
by
his
action
to
she
,


surely
she
must
know
how
a
man
be
when
he
have
trouble
on
his
mind


with
try
to
make
thing
go
a
little
well
.




sometimes
Jem
and
Melanctha
have
long
talk
when
they
neither
of


they
like
very
well
what
the
other
one
be
say
,
but
mostly
now


Melanctha
could
not
make
Jem
Richards
quarrel
with
she
,
and
more
and


more
,
Melanctha
could
not
find
any
way
to
make
it
right
to
blame
he


for
the
trouble
she
now
always
have
inside
she
.
Jem
be
good
to
she
,


and
she
know
,
for
he
tell
she
,
that
he
have
trouble
all
the
time
now


with
his
betting
.
Melanctha
know
very
well
that
for
she
it
be
all


wrong
inside
Jem
Richards
,
but
Melanctha
have
now
no
way
that
she
could


really
reach
he
.




thing
between
Melanctha
and
Jem
Richards
be
now
never
get
any


well
.
Melanctha
now
more
and
more
need
to
be
with
Rose
Johnson
.


Rose
still
like
to
have
Melanctha
come
to
her
house
and
do
thing


for
she
,
and
Rose
like
to
grumble
to
she
and
to
scold
she
and
to
tell


Melanctha
what
be
the
way
Melanctha
always
should
be
do
so


she
could
make
thing
come
out
well
and
not
always
be
so
much
in


trouble
.
Sam
Johnson
in
these
day
be
always
very
good
and
gentle
to


Melanctha
.
Sam
be
now
begin
to
be
very
sorry
for
she
.




Jem
Richards
never
make
thing
any
well
for
Melanctha
.
often
Jem


would
talk
so
as
to
make
Melanctha
almost
certain
that
he
never
any


more
wanted
to
have
she
.
then
Melanctha
would
get
very
blue
,
and
she


would
say
to
Rose
,
sure
she
would
kill
herself
,
for
that
certainly
now


be
the
good
way
she
could
do
.




Rose
Johnson
never
see
it
the
least
bit
that
way
.
"
I
do
n't
see


Melanctha
why
you
should
talk
like
you
would
kill
yourself
just


because
you
be
blue
.
I
'd
never
kill
myself
Melanctha
cause
I
be
blue
.


I
'd
maybe
kill
somebody
else
but
I
'd
never
kill
myself
.
if
I
ever


kill
myself
,
Melanctha
it
'd
be
by
accident
and
if
I
ever
kill


myself
by
accident
,
Melanctha
,
I
'd
be
awful
sorry
.
and
that
certainly


be
the
way
you
should
feel
it
Melanctha
,
now
you
hear
I
,
not
just


talk
foolish
like
you
always
do
.
it
certainly
be
only
your
way
just


always
be
foolish
make
you
all
that
trouble
to
come
to
you
always


now
,
Melanctha
,
and
I

right
well

that
.
you
certainly


never

way
Melanctha
ever
with
all

to
you
,
ever
since
I
know
you
good

talk
,


the
way
I
certainly
always
have
see
you
do
so
Melanctha
always
.
I


certainly
be
right
Melanctha
about
they
way
you
have
to
do
it
,
and


I
know
it
;
but
you
certainly
never
can
noway
learn
to
act
right


Melanctha
,
I
certainly
do
know
that
,
I
certainly
do
my
good
Melanctha


to
help
you
with
it
only
you
certainly
never
do
act
right
Melanctha
,


not
to
nobody
ever
,
I
can
see
it
.
you
never
act
right
by
I
Melanctha


no
more
than
by
everybody
.
I
never
say
nothing
to
you
Melanctha
when


you
do
so
,
for
I
certainly
never
do
like
it
when
I
just
get
to
say
it


to
you
,
but
you
just
certainly
do
with
that
Jem
Richards
you
always


say
want
real
bad
to
be
married
to
you
,
just
like
I
always
say
to


Sam
you
certainly
be
go
to
do
it
.
and
I
certainly
be
real
kind
of


sorry
like
for
you
Melanctha
,
but
you
certainly
have
ought
to
have
come


to
see
I
to
talk
to
you
,
when
you
first
be
engage
to
he
so
I
could


show
you
,
and
now
you
get
all
this
trouble
come
to
you
Melanctha


like
I
certainly
know
you
always
catch
it
.
it
certainly
ai
n't
never


Melanctha
I
ai
n't
real
sorry
to
see
trouble
come
so
hard
to
you
,
but


I
certainly
can
see
Melanctha
it
all
be
always
just
the
way
you
always


be
have
it
in
you
not
never
to
do
right
.
and
now
you
always
talk


like
you
just
kill
yourself
because
you
be
so
blue
,
that
certainly


never
be
Melanctha
,
no
kind
of
a
way
for
any
decent
kind
of
a
girl
to


do
.
"




Rose
have
begin
to
be
strong
now
to
scold
Melanctha
and
she
be


impatient
very
often
with
she
,
but
Rose
could
now
never
any
more
be
a


help
to
she
.
Melanctha
Herbert
never
could
know
now
what
it
be
right


she
should
do
.
Melanctha
always
want
to
have
Jem
Richards
with
she


and
now
he
never
seem
to
want
she
,
and
what
could
Melanctha
do
.


surely
she
be
right
now
when
she
say
she
would
just
kill
herself
,


for
that
be
the
only
way
now

,
she
be
so
good
and
sweet
to
do
anything
anybody
ever


want
,
and
Melanctha
always
like
it
if
she
could
have
peace
and


quiet
,
and
always
she
could
only
find
new
way
to
be
in
trouble
.
Sam


often
say
this
now
to
Rose
about
Melanctha
.




"
I
certainly
do
n't
never
want
Sam
to
say
bad
thing
about
Melanctha
,


for
she
certainly
always
do
have
most
awful
kind
of
trouble
come
hard


to
she
,
but
I
never
can
say
I
like
it
real
right
Sam
the
way
Melanctha


always
have
to
do
it
.
its
now
just
the
same
with
she
like
it
be
always


she
have
get
to
do
it
,
now
the
way
she
be
with
that
Jem
Richards
.
he


certainly
now
do
n't
never
want
to
have
she

Melanctha
she
ai
n't
get


no

honest
,
the
way
she
always
should
do
it
.
she
certainly
just
do
n't
kind


of
never
Sam
tell
right
what
way
she
be
do
with
it
.
I
do
n't
never


like
to
say
nothing
Sam
no
more
to
she
about
the
way
she
always
have


to
be
act
.
she
always
say
,
yes
all
right
Rose
,
I
do
the
way
you
say


it
,
and
then
Sam
she
do
n't
never
noway
do
it
.
she
certainly
be
right


sweet
and
good
,
Sam
,
be
Melanctha
,
nobody
ever
can
hear
I
say
she


ai
n't
always
ready
to
do
thing
for
everybody
anyway
she
ever
can
see


to
do
it
,
only
Sam
some
way
she
never
do
act
real
right
ever
,
and


some
way
,
Sam
,
she
ai
n't
ever
real
honest
with
it
.
and
Sam
sometimes


I
hear
awful
kind
of
thing
she
been
do
,
some
girl
know
about
she


how
she
do
it
,
and
sometimes
they
tell
I
what
kind
of
way
she


have
to
do
it
,
and
Sam
it
certainly
do
seem
to
I
like
more
and
more
I


certainly
be
awful
afraid
Melanctha
never
will
come
to
any
good
.


and
then
Sam
,
sometimes
,
you
hear
it
,
she
always
talk
like
she
kill


herself
all
the
time
she
be
so
blue
,
and
Sam
that
certainly
never
be


no
kind
of
way
any
decent
girl
ever
have
ought
to
do
.
you
see
Sam
,
how


I
be
right
like
I
always
be
when
I
know
it
.
you
just
be
careful
,
Sam
,


now
you
hear
I
,
you
be
careful
Sam
sure
,
I
tell
you
,
Melanctha
more


and
more
I
see
she
I
certainly
do
feel
Melanctha
no
way
be
really


honest
.
you
be
careful
,
Sam
now
,
like
I
tell
you
,
for
I
know
it
,
now


you
hear
to
I
,
Sam
,
what
I
tell
you
,
for
I
certainly
always
be
right
,


Sam
,
when
I
know
it
.
"




at
first
Sam
try
a
little
to
defend
Melanctha
,
and
Sam
always
be


good
and
gentle
to
she
,
and
Sam
like
the
way
Melanctha
have
to
be


quiet
to
he
,
and
to
always
listen
as
if
she
be
learn
,
when
she


be
there
and
hear
he
talk
,
and
then
Sam
like
the
sweet
way
she


always
do
everything
so
nicely
for
he
;
but
Sam
never
like
to
fight


with
anybody
ever
,
and
surely
Rose
know
well
about
Melanctha
and


anyway
Sam
never
do
really
care
much
about
Melanctha
.
her
mystery


never
have
have
any
interest
for
he
.
Sam
like
it
that
she
be
sweet


to
he
and
that
she
always
do
everything
Rose
ever
want
that
she


should
be
do
.
but
Melanctha
never
would
be
important
to
he
.
all


Sam
ever
want
be
to
have
a
little
house
and
to
live
regular
and
to


work
hard
and
to
come
home
to
his
dinner
,
when
he
be
tired
with
his


work
and
by
and
by
he
want
to
have
some
child
all
his
own
to


be
good
to
,
and
so
Sam
be
real
sorry
for
Melanctha
,
she
be
so
good


and
so
sweet
always
to
they
,
and
Jem
Richards
be
a
bad
man
to
behave


so
to
she
,
but
that
be
always
the
way
a
girl
get
it
when
she
like


that
kind
of
fast
fellow
.
anyhow
Melanctha
be
Rose
's
friend
,
and
Sam


never
care
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
kind
of
trouble
always


come
to
woman
,
when
they
want
to
have
man
,
who
never
could
know
how


to
behave
good
and
steady
to
their
woman
.




and
so
Sam
never
say
much
to
Rose
about
Melanctha
.
Sam
be
always


very
gentle
to
she
,
but
now
he
begin
less
and
less
to
see
she
.
soon


Melanctha
never
come
any
more
to
the
house
to
see
Rose
and
Sam
never


ask
Rose
anything
about
she
.




Melanctha
Herbert
be
begin
now
to
come
less
and
less
to
the
house


to
be
with
Rose
Johnson
.
this
be
because
Rose
seem
always
less
and


less
now
to
want
she
,
and
Rose
would
not
let
Melanctha
now
do
thing


for
she
.
Melanctha
be
always
humble
to
she
and
Melanctha
always


want
in
every
way
she
could
to
do
thing
for
she
.
Rose
say
no
,


she
guess
she
do
that
herself
like
she
like
to
have
it
well
.


Melanctha
be
real
good
to
stay
so
long
to
help
she
,
but
Rose
guess


perhaps
Melanctha
well
go
home
now
,
Rose
do
n't
need
nobody
to
help


she
now
,
she
be
feel
real
strong
,
not
like
just
after
she
have
all


that
trouble
with
the
baby
,
and
then
Sam
,
when
he
come
home
for
his


dinner
he
like
it
when
Rose
be
all
alone
there
just
to
give
he
his


dinner
.
Sam
always
be
so
tired
now
,
like
he
always
be
in
the
summer
,


so
many
people
always
on
the
steamer
,
and
they
make
so
much
work
so


Sam
be
real
tired
now
,
and
he
like
just
to
eat
his
dinner
and
never


have
people
in
the
house
to
be
a
trouble
to
he
.




each
day
Rose
treat
Melanctha
more
and
more
as
if
she
never
want


Melanctha
any
more
to
come
there
to
the
house
to
see
she
.
Melanctha


dared
not
ask
Rose
why
she
act
in
this
way
to
she
.
Melanctha
badly


need
to
have
Rose
always
there
to
save
she
.
Melanctha
want
badly


to
cling
to
she
and
Rose
have
always
be
so
solid
for
she
.
Melanctha


do
not
dare
to
ask
Rose
if
she
now
no
long
want
she
to
come
and


see
she
.




Melanctha
now
never
any
more
have
Sam
to
be
gentle
to
she
.
Rose
always


send
Melanctha
away
from
she
before
it
be
time
for
Sam
to
come
home


to
she
.
one
day
Melanctha
have
stay
a
little
long
,
for
Rose


that
day
have
be
good
to
let
Melanctha
begin
to
do
thing
for
she
.


Melanctha
then
leave
she
and
Melanctha
meet
Sam
Johnson
who
stop
a


minute
to
speak
kindly
to
she
.




the
next
day
Rose
Johnson
would
not
let
Melanctha
come
in
to
she
.
Rose


stand
on
the
step
,

think
she
will
most
kill
herself
some
time

would

and


wonder
if
it
be
really

,
be
just
then
the
most
important


thing
that
Mrs.

to
do
.




Mrs.

this

most
successful
,
though

.
Mrs.
Haydon
's
people
be
of
the
middling
class
of
farmer
.
they


be
not
peasant
,
and
they
live
in
a
town
of
some
pretension
,
but


it
all
seem
very
poor
and
smelly
to
Mrs.
Haydon
's
american
bear


daughter
.




Mrs.
Haydon
like
it
all
.
it
be
familiar
,
and
then
here
she
be
so


wealthy
and
important
.
she
listen
and
decide
,
and
advise

have
be


wrong
in
all
their
method
.




Mrs.
Haydon
's
only
trouble
be
with
her
two
daughter
,
whom
she
could


not
make
behave
well

.
the
two
girl
be
very
nasty
to


all
their
numerous
relation
.
their
mother
could
hardly
make
they
kiss


their
grandparent
,
and
every
day
the
girl
would
get
a
scolding
.
but


then
Mrs.
Haydon
be
so
very
busy
that
she
do
not
have
time
to
really


manage
her
stubborn
daughter
.




these
hard
work
,
earth
-
rough
german
cousin
be
to
these
american


bear
child
,
ugly
and
dirty
,
and
as
far
below
they
as
be
italian


or
negro
workman
,
and
they
could
not
see
how
their
mother
could
ever


bear
to
touch
they
,
and
then
all
the
woman
dress
so
funny
,
and
be


work
all
rough
and
different
.




the
two
girl
stick
up
their
nose
at
they
all
,
and
always
talk
in


english
to
each
other
about
how
they
hate
all
these
people
and
how


they
wish
their
mother
would
not
do
so
.
the
girl
could
talk
some


german
,
but
they
never
choose
to
use
it
.




it
be
her
eld
brother
's
family
that
most
interested
Mrs.
Haydon
.


here
there

and
out
of
the
eight
,
five
of
they


be
girl
.




Mrs.
Haydon
think
it
would
be
a
fine
thing
to
take
one
of
these


girl
back
with
she
to
Bridgepoint
and
get
she
well
start
.
everybody


like
that
she
should
do
so
and
they
be
all
willing
that
it
should


be
Lena
.




Lena
be
the
second
girl
in
her
large
family
.
she
be
at
this
time


just
seventeen
year
old
.
Lena
be
not
an
important
daughter
in
the


family
.
she
be
always
sort
of
dreamy
and
not
there
.
she
work
hard


and
go
very
regularly
at
it
,
but
even
good
work
never
seem
to


bring
she
near
.




Lena
's
age
just
suit
Mrs.
Haydon
's
purpose
.
Lena
could
first
go


out
to
service
,
and
learn
how
to
do
thing
,
and
then
,
when
she
be
a


little
old
,
Mrs.
Haydon
could
get
she
a
good
husband
.
and
then
Lena


be
so
still
and
docile
,
she
would
never
want
to
do
thing
her
own


way
.
and
then
,
too
,
Mrs.
Haydon
,
with
all
her
hardness
have
wisdom
,
and


she
could
feel
the
rare
strain
there
be
in
Lena
.




Lena
be
willing
to
go
with
Mrs.
Haydon
.
Lena
do
not
like
her
german


life
very
well
.
it
be
not
the
hard
work
but
the
roughness
that


disturb
she
.
the
people
be
not
gentle
,
and
the
man
when
they
be


glad
be
very
boisterous
,
and
would
lay
hold
of
she
and
roughly
tease


she
.
they
be
good
people
enough
around
she
,
but
it
be
all
harsh
and


dreary
for
she
.




Lena
do
not
really
know
that
she
do
not
like
it
.
she
do
not
know


that
she
be
always
dreamy
and
not
there
.
she
do
not
think
whether
it


would
be
different
for
she
away
off
there
in

.
Mrs.

she
and
get

,
and
then
take

and
the

together
.
they
could
not

.




Lena

and
sure
that
she
be

Mathilda
and
Bertha

no
trouble
from
have

always
sit
with

the
park
,
and
who
laugh
at
she
and
always
tease


she
.




Mathilda
Haydon
,
the
simple
,
fat
,
blonde
,
old
daughter
feel
very


badly
that
she
have
to
say
that
this
be
her
cousin
Lena
,
this
Lena
who


be
little
well
for
she
than
a
nigger
.
Mathilda
be
an
overgrown
,


slow
,
flabby
,
blonde
,
stupid
,
fat
girl
,
just
begin
as
a
woman
;


thick
in
her
speech
and
dull
and
simple
in
her
mind
,
and
very
jealous


of
all
her
family
and
of
other
girl
,
and
proud
that
she
could
have


good
dress
and
new
hat
and
learn
music
,
and
hate
very
badly
to


have
a
cousin
who
be
a
common
servant
.
and
then
Mathilda
remember


very
strongly
that
dirty
nasty
place
that
Lena
come
from
and
that


Mathilda
have
so
turn
up
her
nose
at
,
and
where
she
have
be
make


so
angry
because
her
mother
scold
she
and
like
all
those
rough


cow
-
smelly
people
.




then
,
too
,
Mathilda
would
get
very
mad
when
her
mother
have
Lena
at


their
party
,
and
when
she
talk
about
how
good
Lena
be
,
to
certain


german
mother
in
whose
son
,
perhaps
,
Mrs.
Haydon
might
find
Lena
a


good
husband
.
all
this
would
make
the
dull
,
blonde
,
fat
Mathilda
very


angry
.
sometimes
she
would
get
so
angry
that
she
would
,
in
her
thick
,


slow
way
,
and
with
jealous
anger
blaze
in
her
light
blue
eye
,
tell


her
mother
that
she
do
not
see
how
she
could
like
that
nasty
Lena
;


and
then
her
mother
would
scold
Mathilda
,
and
tell
she
that
she
know


her
cousin
Lena
be
poor
and
Mathilda
must
be
good
to
poor
people
.




Mathilda
Haydon
do
not
like
relation
to
be
poor
.
she
tell
all
she


girl
friend
what
she
think
of
Lena
,
and
so
the
girl
would
never


talk
to
Lena
at
Mrs.
Haydon
's
party
.
but
Lena
in
her
unsuffering


and
unexpectant
patience
never
really
know
that
she
be
slight
.
when


Mathilda
be
with
her
girl
in
the
street
or
in
the
park
and
would
see


Lena
,
she
always
turn
up
her
nose
and
barely
nod
to
she
,
and
then


she
would
tell
her
friend
how
funny
her
mother
be
to
take
care
of


people
like
that
Lena
,
and
how
,
back
in
Germany
,
all
Lena
's
people


live
just
like
pig
.




the
young
daughter
,
the
dark
,
large
,
but
not
fat
,
Bertha
Haydon
,
who


be
very
quick
in
her
mind
,
and
in
her
way
,
and
who
be
the
favorite


with
her
father
,
do
not
like
Lena
,
either
.
she
do
not
like
she


because
for
her
Lena
be
a
fool
and
so
stupid
,
and
she
would
let
those


irish
and
italian
girl
laugh
at
she
and
tease
she
,
and
everybody


always
make
fun
of
Lena
,
and
Lena
never
get
mad
,
or
even
have
sense


enough
to
know
that
they
be
all
make
an
awful
fool
of
she
.




Bertha
Haydon
hate
people
to
be
fool
.
her
father
,
too
,
think
Lena


be
a
fool
,
and
so
neither
the
father
nor
the
daughter
ever
pay


any
attention
to
Lena
,
although
she
come
to
their
house
every
other


Sunday
.




Lena
do
not
know
how
all
the
Haydons
feel
.
she
come
to
her
aunt
's

.
in
the
same
way
Lena

save
all
of


her
wage
.
she
never
think
of
any
way
to
spend
it
.
the
german
cook
,


the
good
woman
who
always
scold
Lena
,
help
she
to
put
it
in
the


bank
each
month
,
as
soon
as
she
get
it
.
sometimes
before
it
get
into


the
bank
to
be
take
care
of
,
somebody
would
ask
Lena
for
it
.
the


little
Haydon
boy
sometimes
ask
and
would
get
it
,
and
sometimes
some


of
the
girl
,
the
one
Lena
always
sit
with
,
need
some
more
money
;


but
the
german
cook
,
who
always
scold
Lena
,
see
to
it
that
this
do


not
happen
very
often
.
when
it
do
happen
she
would
scold
Lena
very


sharply
,
and
for
the
next
few
month
she
would
not
let
Lena
touch
she


wage
,
but

the
bank
for
she
on
the
same
day
that
Lena
get


it

so
Lena
always
save
her
wage
,
for
she
never
think
to
spend
they
,


and
she
always
go
to
her
aunt

for
her
sunday
because
she


do
not
know
that
she
could
do
anything
different
.




Mrs.

and
then
to

would
go
to

very
likely
that

sister
.




Mrs.

child
.
their
child
always
be
so


thankless
,
and
never

always


do
thing
for
their
good
.
do
Lena
think
it
give

work
so
hard
to
make

good


husband
,
and
then
Lena
be
so
thankless
and
never
do
anything
that


anybody

.
it
be
a
lesson
to
poor
Mrs.
Haydon
not
to
do
thing


any
more
for
anybody
.
let
everybody

much
for


Lena
,
though
she
be
always
talk
so
grand
about
what
she
could


do
for
everybody
.
the
good
german

have
be
a
little


distrustful
of

People
who
always
think
they

never


do
really
do
thing
right
for
anybody

not
that
Mrs.

german
woman
,
and
she


do
really
mean
to
do
well
by
her
niece
Lena
.
the
cook
know
that


very
well
,
and
she
have
always
say
so
,
and
she
always
have
like
and


respect
Mrs.
Haydon

have


hard
work
when
she
try

marry
Lena
.
Mrs.
Haydon
be
a
good
woman
,


only
she
do
talk
sometimes
too
grand
.
perhaps
this
trouble
would


make
she
see
it
be
n't
always
so
easy
to
do
,
to
make
everybody
do


everything
just
like
she
want
.
the
cook
be
very
sorry
now
for
Mrs.

all
this
must
be
such
a

such
a
worry
to

Lena
have


well
go

put
on
her
other
clothe
and
stop
all
that
cry
.
that


would
n't
do
nothing
now
to
help
she
,
and
if
Lena
would
be
a
good
girl
,


and
just
be
real
patient
,
her
aunt
would
make
it
all
come
out
right


yet
for
she

Haydon
,


not

,
Lena
and
Herman
and


the
old
father
and
the
old
mother
,
in
the
house
where
Mr.
Kreder
have


work
so
many
year
as
a
tailor
,
with
his
son
Herman
always
there
to


help
he
.




Irish
Mary
have
often
say
to
Lena
she
never
do
see
how
Lena
could


ever
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
Herman
Kreder
and
his
dirty


stingy
parent
.
the
old
Kreders
be
to
an
irish
nature
,
a
stingy
,


dirty
couple
.
they
have
not
the
free
-
hearted
,
thoughtless
,
fighting
,


mud
bespatter
,
ragged
,
peat
-
smoke
cabin
dirt
that
irish
Mary
know


and
could
forgive
and
love
.
Theirs
be
the
german
dirt
of
saving
,
of


be
dowdy
and
loose
and
foul
in
your
clothe
so
as
to
save
they
and


yourself
in
washing
,
have
your
hair
greasy
to
save
it
in
the
soap


and
dry
,
have
your
clothe
dirty
,
not
in
freedom
,
but
because
so


it
be
cheap
,
keep
the
house
close
and
smelly
because
so
it
cost


less
to
get
it
heated
,
live
so
poorly
not
only
so
as
to
save
money


but
so
they
should
never
even
know
themselves
that
they
have
it
,


work
all
the
time
not
only
because
from
their
nature
they
just
have


to
and
because
it
make
they
money
but
also
that
they
never
could
be


put
in
any
way
to
make
they
spend
their
money
.




this
be
the
place
Lena
now
have
for
her
home
and
to
she
it
be
very


different
than
it
could
be
for
an
irish
Mary
.
she
too
be
german
and


be
thrifty
,
though
she
be
always
so
dreamy
and
not
there
.
Lena
be


always
careful
with
thing
and
she
always
save
her
money
,
for
that


be
the
only
way
she
know
how
to
do
it
.
she
never
have
take
care
of


her
own
money
and
she
never
have
think
how
to
use
it
.




Lena
Mainz
have
be
,
before
she
be
Mrs.
Herman
Kreder
,
always
clean


and
decent
in
her
clothe
and
in
her
person
,
but
it
be
not
because


she
ever
think
about
it
or
really
need
so
to
have
it
,
it
be
the


way
her
people
do
in
the
german
country
where
she
come
from
,
and
she


Aunt
Mathilda
and
the
good
german
cook
who
always
scold
,
have
keep


she
on
and
make
she
,
with
their
scolding
,
always
more
careful
to
keep


clean
and
to
wash
real
often
.
but
there
be
no
deep
need
in
all
this


for
Lena
and
so
,
though
Lena
do
not
like
the
old
Kreders
,
though
she


really
do
not
know
that
,
she
do
not
think
about
their
be
stingy


dirty
people
.




Herman
Kreder
be
clean
than
the
old
people
,
just
because
it
be
his


nature
to
keep
clean
,
but
he
be
use
to
his
mother
and
his
father
,


and
he
never
think
that
they
should
keep
thing
clean
.
and
Herman


too
always
save
all
his
money
,
except
for
that
little
beer
he
drink


when
he
go
out
with
other
man
of
an
evening
the
way
he
always
like


to
do
it
,
and
he
never
think
of
any
other
way
to
spend
it
.
his


father
have
always
keep
all
the
money
for
they
and
he
always
be
do


business
with
it
.
and
then
too
Herman
really
have
no
money
,
for
he


always
have
work
for
his
father
,
and
his
father
have
never
think
to


pay
he
.




and
so
they
begin
all
four
to
live
in
the
Kreder
house
together
,
and


Lena
begin
soon
with
it
to
look
careless
and
a
little
dirty
,
and
to
be


more
lifeless
with
it
,
and
nobody
ever
notice
much
what
Lena
want
,


and
she
never
really
know
herself
what
she
need
.




the
only
real
trouble
that
come
to
Lena
with
their
live
all
four


there
together
,
be
the
way
old
Mrs.
Kreder
scold
.
Lena
have
always


be
use
to
be
scold
,
but
this
scolding
of
old
Mrs.
Kreder
be


very
different
from
the
way
she
ever
before
have
have
to
endure
it
.




Herman
,
now
he
be
married
to
she
,
really
like
Lena
very
well
.
he
do


not
care
very
much
about
she
but
she
never
be
a
bother
to
he
be


there
around
he
,
only
when
his
mother
worry
and
be
nasty
to
they


because
Lena
be
so
careless
,
and
do
not
know
how
to
save
thing


right
for
they
with
their
eating
,
and
all
the
other
way
with
money
,


that
the
old
woman
have
to
save
it
.




Herman
Kreder
have
always
do
everything
his
mother
and
his
father


want
but
he
do
not
really
love
his
parent
very
deeply
.
with
Herman


it
be
always
only
that
he
hate
to
have
any
struggle
.
it
be
all


always
all
right
with
he
when
he
could
just
go
along
and
do
the
same


thing
over
every
day
with
his
working
,
and
not
to
hear
thing
,
and
not


to
have
people
make
he
listen
to
their
anger
.
and
now
his
marriage
,


and
he
just
know
it
would
,
be
make
trouble
for
he
.
it
make
he


hear
more
what
his
mother
be
always
say
,
with
her
scolding
.
he
have


to
really
hear
it
now
because
Lena
be
there
,
and
she
be
so
scared


and
dull
always
when
she
hear
it
.
Herman
know
very
well
with
his


mother
,
it
be
all
right
if
one
eat
very
little
and
work
hard
all


day
and
do
not
hear
she
when
she
scold
,
the
way
Herman
always
have


do
before
they
be
so
foolish
about
his
getting
marry
and
have


a
girl
there
to
be
all
the
time
around
he
,
and
now
he
have
to
help
she


so
the
girl
could
learn
too
,
not
to
hear
it
when
his
mother
scold
,


and
not
to
look
so
scared
,
and
not
to
eat
much
,
and
always
to
be
sure


to
save
it
.




Herman
really
do
not
know
very
well
what
he
could
do
to
help
Lena


to
understand
it
.
he
could
never
answer
his
mother
back
to
help
Lena
,


that
never
would
make
thing
any
well
for
she
,
and
he
never
could


feel
in
himself
any
way
to
comfort
Lena
,
to
make
she
strong
not
to


hear
his
mother
,
in
all
the
awful
way
she
always
scold
.
it
just


worry
Herman
to
have
it
like
that
all
the
time
around
he
.
Herman


do
not
know
much
about
how
a
man
could
make
a
struggle
with
a
mother
,


to
do
much
to
keep
she
quiet
,
and
indeed
Herman
never
know
much
how
to


make
a
struggle
against
anyone
who
really
want
to
have
anything
very


badly
.
Herman
all
his
life
never
want
anything
so
badly
,
that
he


would
really
make
a
struggle
against
any
one
to
get
it
.
Herman
all
his


life
only
want
to
live
regular
and
quiet
,
and
not
talk
much
and
to


do
the
same
way
every
day
like
every
other
with
his
working
.
and
now


his
mother
have
make
he
get
married
to
this
Lena
and
now
with
his


mother

all
that
scolding
,
he
have
all
this
trouble
and
this


worry
always
on
he
.




Mrs.
Haydon
do
not
see
Lena
now
very
often
.
she
have
not
lose
she


interest
in
her
niece
Lena
,
but
Lena
could
not
come
much
to
her
house


to
see
she
,
it
would
not
be
right
,
now
Lena
be
a
married
woman
.


and
then
too
Mrs.
Haydon
have
her
hand
full
just
then
with
her
two


daughter
,
for
she
be

to
find
they
good

husband
now
worry
she
very
often
about
she


always
spoil
that
boy
of
hers
,
so
he
would
be
sure
to
turn
out
no


good
and
be
a
disgrace
to
a
german
family
,
and
all
because
his
mother


always
spoil
he
.
all
these
thing
be
very
worrying
now
to
Mrs.


Haydon
,
but
still
she
want
to
be
good
to
Lena
,
though
she
could
not


see
she
very
often
.
she
only
see
she
when
Mrs.
Haydon

on
Mrs.
Kreder
or
when
Mrs.

come
to
see
Mrs.
Haydon
,
and
that


never
could
be
very
often
.
then
too
these
day
Mrs.
Haydon
could
not


scold
Lena
,
Mrs.
Kreder
be
always
there
with
she
,
and
it
would

right
to
scold
Lena
,
when
Mrs.
Kreder
be
there
,
who
have
now
the
real


right

do
it
.
and
so
her
aunt

say
nice
thing
now
to
Lena
,


and
though
Mrs.
Haydon
sometimes

a
little
worried
when
she
see


Lena
look
sad
and
not
careful
,
she
do
not
have
time
just
then
to


really
worry
much
about
it
.




Lena
now
never
any
more
see
the
girl
she
always
use
to
sit
with
.
she


have
no
way
now
to
see
they
and
it
be
not
in
Lena
's
nature
to
search


out
way
to
see
they
,
nor
do
she
now
ever
think
much
of
the
day
when


she
have
be
use
to
see

really
could
not

any
long
with

the
awful
way

a
new
feeling

have
inside
he
that
make
he
feel
he


be
strong
to
make
a
struggle

be
new
for
Herman
Kreder
really
to


be
want
something
,
but
Herman
want
strongly
now
to
be
a
father
,


and
he
want
badly
that

always
,
all
his
life
,
he
have
do
everything
just
as
they


want
,
and

much
about
his

very
good
to
she

always
try
to


keep
his
mother
off
she
,
with
the
awful
way

really
a
father
of
a
little
baby
,
that
feeling
take
hold
of
Herman


very
deeply
.
he
be
almost
ready
,
so
as
to
save
his
baby
from
all


trouble
,
to
really
make
a
strong
struggle
with
his
mother
and
with
his


father
,
too
,
if
he
would
not
help
he
to
control
his
mother
.




sometimes
Herman
even
go
to
Mrs.
Haydon
to
talk
all
this
trouble


over
.
they
decide
then
together
,
it
be
well
to
wait
there
all
four


together
for
the
baby
,
and
Herman
could
make
Mrs.
Kreder
stop
a
little


with
her
scolding
,
and
then
when
Lena
be
a
little
strong
,
Herman


should
have
his
own
house
for
she
,
next
door
to
his
father
,
so
he


could
always
be
there
to
help
he
in
his
working
,
but
so
they
could


eat
and
sleep
in
a
house
where
the
old
woman
could
not
control
they


and
they
could
not
hear
her
awful
scolding
.




and
so
thing
go
on
,
the
same
way
,
a
little
long
.
Poor
Lena
be


not
feel
any
joy
to
have
a
baby
.
she
be
scared
the
way
she
have


be
when
she
be
so
sick
on
the
water
.
she
be
scared
now
every
time


when
anything
would
hurt
she
.
she
be
scared
and
still
and
lifeless
,


and
sure
that
every
minute
she
would
die
.
Lena
have
no
power
to
be


strong
in
this
kind
of
trouble
,
she
could
only
sit
still
and
be


scared
,
and
dull
,
and
lifeless
,
and
sure
that
every
minute
she
would


die
.




before
very
long
,
Lena
have
her
baby
.
he
be
a
good
,
healthy
little


boy
,
the
baby
.
Herman
care
very
much
to
have
the
baby
.
when
Lena
be


a
little
strong
he
take
a
house
next
door
to
the
old
couple
,
so
he


and
his
own
family
could
eat
and
sleep
and
do
the
way
they
want
.


this
do
not
seem
to
make
much
change
now
for

.
she
always

everything
regular
with
the
work
,
the
way
she
always
have
have
to
do
it
,


but
she
never
get
back
any
spirit
in
she
.
Herman
be
always
good
and


kind
,
and
always
help
she
with
she
working
.
he

he
always

all
the
active
new
thing
in
the
house


and
for
the

little
daze
