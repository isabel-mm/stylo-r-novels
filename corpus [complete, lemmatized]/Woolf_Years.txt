then
,
by
a
natural


transition

they
turn
to
the
present
.
it
be
a
question

Colonel

shut


his
mouth
on
the
thing
he
might
have
say

and
turn
back
again
to


the
window
overlook
Piccadilly
.
everybody

crowded


street

some
end
in

in
their
victoria


and
brougham
be
trot
down
Piccadilly
on
some
errand
or


other
.
People
be
come
back
to
London
;
they
be
settle
in


for
the
season
.
but
for
he
there
would
be
no
season
;
for
he


there
be
nothing
to
do
.
his
wife
be
die
;
but
she
do
not
die
.


she
be
well
today
;
would
be
bad
tomorrow
;
a
new
nurse
be


come
;
and
so
it
go
on
.
he
pick
up
a
paper
and
turn
over


the
page
.
he
look
at
a
picture
of
the
west
front
of
Cologne


Cathedral
.
he
toss
the
paper
back
into
its
place
among
the
other


paper
.
one
of
these
day
-
that
be
his
euphemism
for
the
time


when
his
wife
be
dead
-
he
would
give
up
London
,
he
think
,
and


live
in
the
country
.
but
then
there
be
the
house
;
then
there
be


the
child
;
and
there
be
also
.
.
.
his
face
change
;
it
become


less
discontent
;
but
also
a
little
furtive
and
uneasy
.




he
have
somewhere
to
go
,
after
all
.
while
they
be
gossip
he


have
keep
that
thought
at
the
back
of
his
mind
.
when
he
turn


round
and
find
they
go
,
that
be
the
balm
he
clap
on
his


wound
.
he
would
go
and
see
Mira
;
Mira
at
least
would
be
glad
to


see
he
.
thus
when
he
leave
the
club
he
turn
not
East
,
where
the


busy
man
be
go
;
nor
West
where
his
own
house
in
Abercorn


terrace
be
;
but
take
his
way
along
the
hard
path
through
the


Green
Park
towards
Westminster
.
the
grass
be
very
green
;
the


leave
be
begin
to
shoot
;
little
green
claw
,
like
bird
'


claw
,
be
push
out
from
the
branch
;
there
be
a
sparkle
,
an


animation
everywhere
;
the
air
smell
clean
and
brisk
.
but
Colonel


Pargiter
see
neither
the
grass
nor
the
tree
.
he
march
through


the
Park
,
in
his
closely
button
coat
,
look
straight
ahead
of


he
.
but
when
he
come
to
Westminster
he
stop
.
he
do
not
like


this
part
of
the
business
at
all
.
every
time
he
approach
the


little
street
that
lie
under
the
huge
bulk
of
the
Abbey
,
the
street


of
dingy
little
house
,
with
yellow
curtain
and
card
in
the


window
,
the
street
where
the
muffin
man
seem
always
to
be
ring


his
bell
,
where
child
scream
and
hop
in
and
out
of
white


chalk
-
mark
on
the
pavement
,
he
pause
,
look
to
the
right
,
look


to
the
left
;
and
then
walk
very
sharply
to
Number
Thirty
and
ring


the
bell
.
he
gaze
straight
at
the
door
as
he
wait
with
his
head


rather
sink
.
he
do
not
wish
to
be
see
stand
on
that
door-


step
.
he
do
not
like
wait
to
be
let
in
.
he
do
not
like
it


when
Mrs
Sims
let
he
in
.
there
be
always
a
smell
in
the
house
;


there
be
always
dirty
clothe
hang
on
a
line
in
the
back


garden
.
he
go
up
the
stair
,
sulkily
and
heavily
,
and
enter


the
sitting
-
room
.




nobody
be
there
;
he
be
too
early
.
he
look
round
the
room
with


distaste
.
there
be
too
many
little
object
about
.
he
feel
out


of
place
,
and
altogether
too
large
as
he
stand
upright
before
the


drape
fireplace
in
front
of
a
screen
upon
which
be

the
act
of

about
hither
and
thither
on
the

he
ask
himself
listen
.
child
scream


in
the
street
outside
.
it
be
sordid
;
it
be
mean
;
it
be
furtive
.


one
of
these
day
,
he
say
to
himself
.
.
.
but

;
then
there
be
the
clever
little
Jew
-
boy


from
Birmingham
-
but
it
be
time
to
begin
.
one
after
another
the


bell
of
Oxford
begin
push
their
slow
chime
through
the
air
.


they
toll
ponderously
,
unequally
,
as
if
they
have
to
roll
the
air


out
of
their
way
and
the
air
be
heavy
.
he
love
the
sound
of
the


bell
.
he
listen
till
the
last
stroke
have
strike
;
then
pull


his
chair
to
the
table
;
time
be
up
;
he
must
work
now
.




a
little
dint
sharpen
between
his
brow
.
he
frown
as
he
read
.


he
read
;
and
make
a
note
;
then
he
read
again
.
all
sound
be


blot
out
.
he
see
nothing
but
the
Greek
in
front
of
he
.
but
as


he
read
,
his
brain
gradually
warm
;
he
be
conscious
of
something


quicken
and
tighten
in
his
forehead
.
he
catch
phrase
after


phrase
exactly
,
firmly
,
more
exactly
,
he
note
,
make
a
brief
note


in
the
margin
,
than
the
night
before
.
little
negligible
word
now


reveal
shade
of
meaning
which
alter
the
meaning
.
he
make


another
note
;
that
be
the
meaning
.
his
own
dexterity
in
catch


the
phrase
plumb
in
the
middle
give
he
a
thrill
of
excitement
.


there
it
be
,
clean
and
entire
.
but
he
must
be
precise
;
exact
;


even
his
little
scribbled
note
must
be
clear
as
print
.
he
turn


to
this
book
;
then
that
book
.
then
he
lean
back
to
see
,
with
his


eye
shut
.
he
must
let
nothing
dwindle
off
into
vagueness
.
the


clock
begin
strike
.
he
listen
.
the
clock
go
on
strike
.


the
line
that
have
grave
themselves
on
his
face
slacken
;
he


leant
back
;
his
muscle
relax
;
he
look
up
from
his
book
into


the
dimness
.
he
feel
as
if
he
have
throw
himself
down
on
the
turf


after
run
a
race
.
but
for
a
moment
it
seem
to
he
that
he


be
still
run
;
his
mind
go
on
without
the
book
.
it
travel


by
itself
without
impediment
through
a
world
of
pure
meaning
;
but


gradually
it
lose
its
meaning
.
the
book
stand
out
on
the
wall
:

the
last
of
the
stroke
have
sound
.

give
a
sigh
and
rise
from


the
table
.

and
there
lie

bulk


against
the
sky
which
,
because
of
the
rain
,

then
a
nondescript
clatter
and
chatter

wonder
,


look
at

pretty

gay

dowdy

dumpy
beside
she

she

at

without
any
american
accent
.


yet
he

but
Mrs

do
not

.
Kitty
give
her
good
mark
for
that
.


she
compare
favourably
with
most
of
their
visitor
,
Kitty
think
.


she
have
never

the
Bodleian
quite
so
quick
as
she
have
do
it


that
morning
.
indeed
,
she
have
feel
rather
guilty
.
there
be
a


great
many
more
sight
to
be
see
,
have
they
wish
it
.
but
in
less


than
an
hour
of
it
Mrs
Fripp
have
turn
to
Kitty
and
have
say
in


her
fascinating
,
if
nasal
,
voice
:




"
well
,
my
dear
,
I
guess
you
be
a
bit
feed
-
up
with
sight
-
what
d'you


say
to
an
ice
in
that
dear
old
bun
-
shop
with
the
bow
window
?
"




and
they
have
eat
ice
when
they
ought
to
have
be
go
round


the
Bodleian
.




the
procession
have
now
reach
the
first
landing
,
and
Mrs
Malone


stop
at
the
door
of
the
famous
room
where
distinguished
guest


always
sleep
when
they
stay
at
the
Lodge
.
she
give
one
look


round
as
she
hold
the
door
open
.




"
the
bed
where
Queen
Elizabeth
do
not
sleep
,
"
she
say
,
make
the


usual
little
joke
as
they
look
at
the
great
four
-
poster
.
the


fire
be
burn
;
the
water
-
jug
be
swaddle
up
like
an
old
woman


with
the
toothache
;
and
the
candle
be
light
on
the
dressing
-
table
.


but
there
be
something
strange
about
the
room
tonight
,
Kitty


think
,
glance
over
her
mother
's
shoulder
;

gown


flash
green
and
silver
upon
the

.
and
on
the
dressing

table


there
be
a
number
of
little
pot
and
jar
and
a
large
powder
-
puff


stain
pink
.
could
it
be
,
be
it
possible
,
that
the
reason
why


Mrs
Fripp
look
so
very
bright
and
the
Oxford
lady
look
so


very
dingy
be
that
Mrs
Fripp
-
but
Mrs
Malone
be
say
,
"
you
have


everything
you
want

"
with
such
extreme
politeness
that
Kitty


guess
that
Mrs
Malone
too
have
see
the
dressing
-
table
.
Kitty


hold
out
her
hand
.
to
her
surprise
,
instead
of
take
it
,
Mrs


Fripp
pull
she
down
and
kiss
she
.




"

to
stay

we
in

she
add
.
for
she
have
like
the
big
shy
girl
who
have
so
obviously


preferred
eating
ice
to
show
she

Bodleian

and
she
have
feel

but


it
slip
off
as
it
sway
down
the
brilliant
sunlit
step
on
the


slant
shoulder
of
Whiteleys
'
man
.
the
family
follow
after
.








it
be
an
uncertain
day
,
with
pass
shadow
and
dart
ray
of


bright
sunshine
.
the
funeral
start
at
a
walk
pace
.
Delia
,


get
into
the
second
carriage
with
Milly
and
Edward
,
notice


that
the
house
opposite
have
their
blind
draw
in
sympathy
,
but
a


servant
peep
.
the
other
,
she
notice
,
do
not
seem
to
see
she
;


they
be
think
of
their
mother
.
when
they
get
into
the
main


road
the
pace
quicken
,
for
the
drive
to
the
cemetery
be
a
long


one
.
through
the
slit
of
the
blind
,
Delia
notice
dog
play
;
a


beggar
singing
;
man
raise
their
hat
as
the
hearse
pass
they
.


but
by
the
time
their
own
carriage
pass
,
the
hat
be
on
again
.


man
walk
briskly
and
unconcernedly
along
the
pavement
.
the
shop


be
already
gay
with
spring
clothing
;
woman
pause
and
look
in


at
the
window
.
but
they
would
have
to
wear
nothing
but
black
all


the
summer
,
Delia
think
,
look
at
Edward
's
coal
-
black
trouser
.




they
scarcely
speak
,
or
only
in
little
formal
sentence
,
as
if
they


be
already
take
part
in
the
ceremony
.
somehow
their
relation


have
change
.
they
be
more
considerate
,
and
a
little
important


too
,
as
if
their
mother
's
death
have
lay
new
responsibility
on


they
.
but
the
other
know
how
to
behave
;
it
be
only
she
who
have


to
make
an
effort
.
she
remain
outside
,
and
so
do
her
father
,


she
think
.
when
Martin
suddenly
burst
out
laugh
at
tea
,
and


then
stop
and
look
guilty
,
she
feel
-
that
be
what
Papa
would


do
,
that
be
what
I
should
do
if
we
be
honest
.




she
glance
out
of
the
window
again
.
another
man
raise
his
hat
-
a


tall
man
,
a
man
in
a
frock
-
coat
,
but
she
would
not
allow
herself
to


think
of
Mr
Parnell
until
the
funeral
be
over
.




at
last
they
reach
the
cemetery
.
as
she
take
her
place
in
the


little
group
behind
the
coffin
and
walk
up
the
church
,
she
be


relieve
to
find
that
she
be
overcome
by
some
generalise
and


solemn
emotion
.
People
stand
up
on
both
side
of
the
church
and


she
feel
their
eye
on
she
.
then
the
service
begin
.
a
clergyman
,


a
cousin
,
read
it
.
the
first
word
strike
out
with
a
rush
of


extraordinary
beauty
.
Delia
,
stand
behind
her
father
,
notice


how
he
brace
himself
and
square
his
shoulder
.




"
I
be
the
resurrection
and
the
life
.
"




pent
up
as
she
have
be
all
these
day
in
the
half
-
light
house
which


smell
of
flower
,
the
outspoken
word
fill
she
with
glory
.
this


she
could
feel
genuinely
;
this
be
something
that
she
say
herself
.


but
then
,
as
Cousin
James
go
on
reading
,
something
slip
.
the


sense
be
blur
.
she
could
not
follow
with
her
reason
.
then
in


the
midst
of
the
argument
come
another
burst
of
familiar
beauty
.


"
and
fade
away
suddenly
like
the
grass
,
in
the
morning
it
be
green
,


and
groweth
up
;
but
in
the
evening
it
be
cut
down
,
dry
up
,
and


wither
.
"
she
could
feel
the
beauty
of
that
.
again
it
be
like


music
;
but
then
Cousin
James
seem
to
hurry
,
as
if
he
do
not


altogether
believe
what
he
be
say
.
he
seem
to
pass
from
the


know
to
the
unknown
;
from
what
he
believe
to
what
he
do
not


believe
;
even
his
voice
alter
.
he
look
clean
,
he
look


starch
and
iron
like
his
robe
.
but
what
do
he
mean
by
what


he
be
say
?
she
give
it
up
.
either
one
understand
or
one
do


not
understand
,
she
think
.
her
mind
wander
.




but
I
will
not
think
of
he
,
she
think
,
see
a
tall
man
who


stand
beside
she
on
a
platform
and
raise
his
hat
,
until
it
be
over
.


she
fix
her
eye
upon
her
father
.
she
watch
he
dab
a
great


white
pocket
-
handkerchief
to
his
eye
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
;


then
he
pull
it
out
and
dab
his
eye
with
it
again
.
then
the


voice
stop
;
he
put
his
handkerchief
finally
in
his
pocket
;
and


again
they
all
form
up
,
the
little
group
of
the
family
,
behind


the
coffin
and
again
the
dark
people
on
either
side
rise
,
and


watch
they
and
let
they
go
first
and
follow
after
.




it
be
a
relief
to
feel
the
soft
damp
air
blow
its
leafy
smell


in
her
face
again
.
but
again
now
that
she
be
out
of
door
,
she


begin
to
notice
thing
.
she
notice
how
the
black
funeral
horse


be
paw
the
ground
;
they
be
scrape
little
pit
with
their


hoof
in
the
yellow
gravel
.
she
remember
hear
that
funeral


horse
come
from
Belgium
and
be
very
vicious
.
they
look


vicious
she
think
;
their
black
neck
be
fleck
with
foam
-
but


she
recall
herself
.
they
go
straggle
in
one
and
two
along


a
path
until
they
reach
a
fresh
mound
of
yellow
earth
heap


beside
a
pit
;
and
there
again
she
notice
how
the
grave
-
digger


stand
at
a
little
distance
,
rather
behind
,
with
their
spade
.




there
be
a
pause
;
people
keep
on
arrive
and
take
up
their


position
,
some
a
little
high
,
some
a
little
low
.
she
observe


a
poor
-
look
shabby
woman
prowl
on
the
outskirt
,
and
try
to


think
whether
she
be
some
old
servant
,
but
she
could
not
put
a


name
to
she
.
her
Uncle
Digby
,
her
father
's
brother
,
stand
directly


opposite
she
,
with
his
top
-
hat
hold
like
some
sacred
vessel
between


his
hand
,
the
image
of
grave
decorum
.
some
of
the
woman
be


cry
;
but
not

one
pose
;

another
,
she
observe
.
then
it
all
begin
again
.
the
splendid
gust


of
music
blow
through
they
-
"

a
little
close
to
the
graveside
and
look


fixedly
at
the
coffin
which
lie
with
its

hard


shiny
surface
;
and
as
they
drop
she
be

by
a
sense
of


something

-
"

rob
she
of
the
one
feeling
that

;
he
have

People

her
eye
on

.

be
crack
some
joke
with
the
sandy
man
next
to
he
.
those
be


his
crony
,
she
think
;
this
be
his
life
.
she
remember
his


passion
for
the
Bar
as
a
boy
.
it
be
she
who
have

Papa


round
;
one
morning
she
have
take
her
life
in
her
hand
and
go
to


his
study
.
.
.
but
now
,
to
her
excitement
,
Morris
himself
get
up
.




she
feel
her
sister
-
in
-
law
stiffen
with
nervousness
and
clasp
she


little
bag
tightly
.
Morris
look
very
tall
,
and
very
black
and


white
as
he
begin
.
one
hand
be
on
the
edge
of
his
gown
.
how
well


she
know
that
gesture
of
Morris
's
,
she
think
-
grasp
something
,


so
that
you
see
the
white
scar
where
he
have
cut
himself
bathe
.


but
she
do
not
recognise
the
other
gesture
-
the
way
he
fling
his


arm
out
.
that
belong
to
his
public
life
,
his
life
in
the
Courts
.


and
his
voice
be
unfamiliar
.
but
every
now
and
then
as
he
warm


to
his
speech
,
there
be
a
tone
in
his
voice
that
make
her
smile
;


it
be
his
private
voice
.
she
could
not
help
half
turn
to
she


sister
-
in
-
law
as
if
to
say
,
how

,


try
to
fix
her

upon
the
argument
.
he
speak
with


extraordinary
clearness
;
he
space
his
word
beautifully
.
suddenly


the
Judge
interrupt
:




"

in
urbane


yet
awful
tone
;
and
eleanor
be
thrill
to
see
how
instantly


Morris
stop
short
;
how
respectfully
he
bend
his
head
as
the


Judge
speak
.




but
will
he
know
the
answer
?
she
think
,
as
if
he
be
a
child
,


shift
in
her
seat
with
nervousness
lest

but
he

answer
at

.
without

or
flutter


he
open
a
book
;
find
his
place
;
read
out
a

relax
.
she

mixture
of
solemnity


and
licence

in
and
out
.
they
stand


lean
against

pale
top

to
drop
his

catch
she


round

sheer
gallantry
,
since
she
be
no
beauty
,

her
action
be
merely
a
parody
of
what
he
remember
in

town
of
Tuscany
.

a
cab
stop
in

absorb
almost
;
it


still
sweep
round
in
his

do
not
prevent

there

that
they
have
have
the

the
three

the
two
little

Eugénie
be
a
clever
woman
of


course
;

he
wish
she
would
get
a
parlourmaid
instead
of
these


italian

always
seem
to
be
swallow
macaroni
.
here

of
laughter
.




he
like
Eugénie

it
be


probably
one
of
the
thing
she
have
pick
up
there
:
the
sort
of


thing
that

,


turn
away
.

false

a
little
spark
from
what


someone

all
those
year
ago

here
it
come
 
the
china

listen

be
the
wind

the
wind
be
terrific
.

press
on
the
house

it
tight
,
then
let
it
fall
apart

Upstairs
a
door

;
a
window
must
be
open

the
bedroom


above
.
a
blind
be

.
it
be
difficult
to
fix
her
mind
on


Renan
.
she
like
it
,
though
.
french
she
could
read
easily
of


course
;

italian
;
and
a
little
german
.
but
what
vast
gap
there


be
,
what
blank
space
,
she
think
lean
back
in
her
chair
,
in


her
knowledge
!
how
little
she
know
about
anything

take
this
cup


for
instance

what

how
do
they
stick
together
?


the
smooth
hard
surface
of
the
china
with
its
red
flower
seem
to


she
for
a
second
a
marvellous
mystery
.
but
there
be
another
sound


in
the
hall
.
it
be
the
wind
,

it
be
also
a
voice
,
talk
.


it
must
be
Martin

who
could
he
be
talk
to

wonder
?


she
listen
,
but
she
could
not
hear
what
he
be
say
because
of


the
wind
.

why
,
she
ask
herself
,
do
he
say
we
ca
n't
 
tell
a


lie
to
save
our
soul
?
he
be
think
about
himself
;
one
always


know
when
people
be
think
about
themselves
by
their
tone
of


voice
.
perhaps
he
be
justify
himself
for
having
leave
the
Army
.


that
have
be
courageous
,
she
think
;
but
be
n't
 
it
odd
,
she
muse
,


listen
to
the
voice
,
that
he
should
be
such
a
dandy
too
?
he


be
wear
a
new
blue
suit
with
white
stripe
on
it
.
and
he
have


shave
off
his
moustache
.
he
ought
never
to
have
be
a
soldier
,


she
think
;
he
be
much
too
pugnacious
.
.
.
.
they
be
still


talk
.
she
could
not
hear
what
he
be
say
,
but
from
the
sound


of
his
voice
it
come
over
she
that
he
must
have
a
great
many
love


affair
.
yes
-
it
become
perfectly
obvious
to
she
,
listen
to
his


voice
through
the
door
,
that
he
have
a
great
many
love
affair
.

fall
,

happiness
,

queer
expression
,

frown
,
half
smile

form
on
her
face

she
throw

surprise
.


she
laugh
.
she
often
talk
aloud
.
why
not
?
that
too
be
one


of
the
consolation
,
like
her
coat
and
skirt
,
and
the
hat

stick


on
without
give
a
look

of
the
moment

a
shop

first
she
have
hear
a
voice
;
then
see
a
hand
.


and
it
be
odd
,
consider
how
little
she
know
they

they
have


live
abroad
-
how
strongly
,
sit
there
at
the
counter
before


Maggie
see
she
,
simply
from
the
sound
of
her
voice
,
she
have
feel
-


she
suppose
it
be
affection
?
-
some
feeling
breed
of
blood
in


common
.
she
have
get
up
and
say
may
I
come

on

little


crescent
of

house
with
the
name
carve
in
the
middle
which
she


use
to
pass
so
often
when
she

down
here
.
she
use
to
ask


herself
in
those
far
-
off
day
who
be
Hyam
?
but
she
have
never


solve
the
question
to
her
satisfaction
.
she
walk
on
,
across
the


river
.








the
shabby
street
on
the
south
side
of
the
river
be
very
noisy
.


now
and
again

voice
detach
itself
from
the
general
clamour
.
a


woman
shout
to
her
neighbour
;

bedstead
,
grate
,
poker

whether

hear
the

rustle
in
the

.
it
be
so
hot


still
that
she
lie
in

to
do


either
.
she
want
to
lie
still

a
relief
to
lie
in
the


semi
-
darkness
after
the
talk
,
after
the
card
.
she
could
still

polished


wardrobe
and
a
china
box
by
her
bedside
.
she
lift
the
lid
.
yes
;


four
biscuit
and
a
pale
piece
of
chocolate
-
in
case

should
be


hungry
in
the

.
Celia
have
provide
book
too
,
the
Diary
of
a


nobody
,
Ruff
's
Tour
in
Northumberland
and
an
odd
volume
of
Dante
,


in
case
she
should
wish
to
read
in
the
night
.
she
take
one
of
the


book
and
lay
it
on
the
counterpane
beside
she
.
perhaps
because


she
have
be
travel
,
it
seem
as
if
the
ship
be
still


pad
softly
through
the
sea
;
as
if
the
train
be
still
swinge


from
side
to
side
as
it
rattle
across
France
.
she
feel
as
if


thing
be
move
past
she
as
she
lie
stretch
on
the
bed
under


the
single
sheet
.
but
it
be
not
the
landscape
any
long
,
she


think
;
it
be
people
's
life
,
their
change
life
.




the
door
of
the
pink
bedroom
shut
.
William
Whatney
cough
next


door
.
she
hear
he
cross
the
room
.
now
he
be
stand
by
the


window
,
smoke
a
last
cigar
.
what
be
he
think
,
she
wonder
-


about
India
?
-
how
he
stand
under
a
peacock
umbrella
?
then
he
begin


move
about
the
room
,
undressing
.
she
could
hear
he
take
up
a


brush
and
put
it
down
again
on
his
dressing
-
table
.
and
it
be
to


he
,
she
think
,
remember
the
wide
sweep
of
his
chin
and
the


float
stain
of
pink
and
yellow
that
lie
underneath
it
,
that
I


owe
that
moment
,
which
have
be
more
than
pleasure
,
when
she
hide


her
face
behind
the
newspaper
in
the
corner
of
the
third
-
class


railway
carriage
.




now
there
be
three
moth
dash
round
the
ceiling
.
they
make
a


little
tap
noise
as
they
dash
round
and
round
from
corner
to


corner
.
if
she
leave
the
window
open
much
long
the
room
would
be


full
of
moth
.
a
board
creak
in
the
passage
outside
.
she


listen
.
Peggy
,
be
it
,
escape
,
to
join
her
brother
?
she
feel


sure
there
be
some
scheme
on
foot
.
but
she
could
only
hear
the


heavy
-
laden
branch
move
up
and
down
in
the
garden
;
a
cow


lowing
;
a
bird
chirping
,
and
then
,
to
her
delight
,
the
liquid
call


of
an
owl
go
from
tree
to
tree
loop
they
with
silver
.




she
lie
look
at
the
ceiling
.
a
faint
water
mark
appear
there
.


it
be
like
a
hill
.
it
remind
she
of
one
of
the
great
desolate


mountain
in
Greece
or
in
Spain
,
which
look
as
if
nobody
have
ever


set
foot
there
since
the
beginning
of
time
.




she
open
the
book
that
lie
on
the
counterpane

she
hope
it
be


Ruff
's
Tour
,
or
the
Diary
of
a
nobody
;
but
it
be
Dante
,
and
she


be
too
lazy
to
change
it
.
she
read
a
few
line
,
here
and
there
.


but
her
Italian
be
rusty
;
the
meaning
escape
she
.
there
be
a


mean
however
;
a
hook
seem
to
scratch
the
surface
of
her
mind
.






 
chč
per
quanti
si
dice

what

she
read
the
english
translation
.






 
for
by
so
many
more
there
be
who
say
'
ours
'


 
so
much
the
more
of
good
doth
each
possess
.






brush
lightly
by
her
mind
that
be
watch
the
moth
on
the


ceiling
,
and
listen
to
the
call
of
the
owl
as
it
loop
from


tree
to
tree
with
its
liquid
cry
,
the
word
do
not
give
out
their


full
meaning
,
but
seem
to
hold
something
furl
up
in
the
hard


shell
of
the
archaic
Italian
.
I
'll
read
it
one
of
these
day
,


she

,
shut
the

when

.
.
should
she

travel
?


should
she
go
to
India

into
one
fiery
circle
.
the

with
a
roar
through
a


tunnel
.
it
seem
to

an
act

out
on

rather
hard
shelf
with
her
back

wall
,
so
that
she

she
turn


and
pull
the
blue
shade
over
the
lamp
.
the
sound
of
the
train


become
louder
in
the
darkness
;
its
roar
,
its
vibration
,
seem
to


fall
into
a
regular
rhythm
of
sound
,
rake
through
her
mind
,


roll
out
her
thought
.




ah

on
her
ledge
.
all

the
same
.
and
which
be
right

she
think
,
turn


restlessly
on
her
shelf
.
which
be
wrong
?
she
turn
again
.




the
train
rush
she
on
.
the
sound
have
deepen
;
it
have
become
a


continuous
roar
.
how
could
she
sleep
?
how
could
she
prevent


herself
from
think
?
she
turn
away
from
the
light
.
now
where


be
we

she
say
to
herself
.
where
be
the
train
at
this
moment
?


now
,
she
murmur
,
shut
her
eye
,

.
.
.
a
blank
intervene
;
she


thought
became
space
;
they
became
muddle
.
past
and
present


became
jumble
together
.
she
see
Margaret
Marrable
pinch
the


dress
in
her
finger
,
but
she
be
lead

a
ring


through
its
nose

,
she
say
to
herself
,
shut


they
again
,
this
be
sleep
.
and
she
resign
herself
to
the
charge


of
the
train
,
whose
roar
now
become
dull
and
distant
.








there
be
a
tap
at
her
door
.
she
lie
for
a
moment
,
wonder
why


the
room
shake
so
;
then
the
scene
settle
itself
;

early
.


she

tree
in
its
white
cloud
.
when

she
think
how
fine

and
sharp
,
white
and
grey
.

of


the
softness
,
none
of
the
greenness
of
the
land
in

south
.

here

.
very
slowly
,
for
the
engine

.


the
whole
day
be
hers
.
it
be
fine
too
.
the
sunlight
suddenly


quicken
in
the

,
and
lay
a
broad
bar
of
light
across
the


floor
.
the
sun
be
on
the

down
in


a
bright
patch
of
sunlight
.




Heartless
brute
!
she
think
,
but
his
indifference
please
she
.
he


ask
nothing
of
she
either
.
she
stretch
her
hand
for
a


cigarette
.
and
what
would
Martin
say
,
she
wonder
,
as
she
take


the
enamel
box
that
turn
from
green
to
blue
,
as

hideous
?
Vulgar
?
possibly
-

what
do

matter
what
people


say
?
criticism
seem
light
as

what
do
it


matter
what
he

say
,
what
anybody
say
,
since
she


have
a
whole
day
to
herself
?
-
since
she
be
alone
?
and
there
they


be
,
still
asleep
,
in
their
house
,
she
think
,
stand
at
the


window
,
look
at
the
green
-
grey
grass
,
after
their
dance
,
after


their
party
.
.
.
the
thought

she
throw
away
she


cigarette
and
go
upstairs
to
change
her
clothe
.




the
sun
be
much
strong
when
she
come
down
again
.
the
garden
have


already
lose
its
look
of
purity
;
the
mist
be
off
the
wood
.
she


could
hear
the
squeak
of
the
lawn
mower
as
she
step
out
of
the


window
.
the
rubber
-
shoe
pony
be
pace
up
and
down
the
lawn


leave
a
pale
wake
in
the
grass
behind
he
.
the
bird
be


singe
in
their
scatter
way
.
the
starling
in
their
bright
mail


be
feed
on
the
grass
.
Dew
shine
,
red
,
violet
,
gold
on
the


tremble
tip
of
the
grass
blade
.
it
be
a
perfect
May
morning
.




she
saunter
slowly
along
the
terrace
.
as
she
pass
she
glance


in
at
the
long
window
of
the
library
.
everything
be
shroud
and


shut
up
.
but
the
long
room
look
more
than
usually
stately
,
its


proportion
seemly
;
and
the
brown
book
in
their
long
row
seem


to
exist
silently
,
with
dignity
,
by
themselves
,
for
themselves
.


she
leave
the
terrace
and
stroll
down
the
long
grass
path
.
the


garden
be
still
empty
;
only
a
man
in
his
shirt
sleeve
be
do


something
to
a
tree
;
but
she
need
speak
to
nobody
.
the
chow


stalk
after
she
;
he
too
be
silent
.
she
walk
on
past
the


flower
-
bed
to
the
river
.
there
she
always
stop
,
on
the
bridge
,


with
the
cannon
-
ball
at
interval
.
the
water
always
fascinate


she
.
the
quick
northern
river
come
down
from
the
moor
;
it
be


never
smooth
and
green
,
never
deep
and
placid
like
southern
river
.


it
race
;
it
hurry
.
it
splay
itself
,
red
,
yellow
and
clear


brown
,
over
the
pebble
on
the
bed
.
rest
her
elbow
on
the


balustrade
,
she
watch
it
eddy
round
the
arch
;
she
watch
it


make
diamond
and
sharp
arrow
streak
over
the
stone
.
she


listen
.
she
know
the
different
sound
it
make
in
summer
and


winter
;
now
it
hurry
,
it
race
.




but
the
chow
be
bored
;
he
march
on
.
she
follow
he
.
she
go


up
the
green
ride
towards
the
snuffer
-
shape
monument
on
the
crest


of
the
hill
.
every
path
through
the
wood
have
its
name
.
there
be


keeper
'
Path
,
Lovers
'
walk
,
lady
'
Mile
,
and
here
be
the
Earl
's


ride
.
but
before
she
go
into
the
wood
,
she
stop
and
look


back
at
the
house
.
time
out
of
number
she
have
stop
here
;
the


Castle
look
grey
and
stately
;
asleep
this
morning
,
with
the


blind
draw
,
and
no
flag
on
the
flagstaff
.
very
noble
it
look
,


and
ancient
,
and
enduring
.
then
she
go
on
into
the
wood
.




the
wind
seem
to
rise
as
she
walk
under
the
tree
.
it
sing
in


their
top
,
but
it
be
silent
beneath
.
the
dead
leave
crackle


under
foot
;
among
they
spring
up
the
pale
spring
flower
,
the


lovely
of
the
year
-
blue
flower
and
white
flower
,
tremble
on


cushion
of
green
moss
.
spring
be
sad
always
,
she
think
;
it


bring
back
memory
.
all
pass
,
all
change
,
she
think
,
as


she
climb
up
the
little
path
between
the
tree
.
nothing
of
this


belong
to
she
;
her
son
would
inherit

be
a
centre
of
a
little
group
.
they
sweep
their
eye
over


the
grow
-
up
people
for
a
moment
,
then
,
each
give
the
other
a


little
nudge
,
they
burst
into
song
:






 
Etho

donk
to

that
be
what
it
sound
like
.
not
a
word
be
recognisable
.
the


distorted
sound
rise
and
sink
as
if
they
follow
a
tune
.
they


stop
.




they
stand
with
their
hand
behind
their
back
.
then
with
one


impulse
they
attack
the
next
verse
:






 
fanno
to
par
,
etto
to
mar
,

Eido

teido
,
meido
-






they
sing
the
second
verse
more
fiercely
than
the
first
.
the


rhythm
seem
to
rock
and
the
unintelligible
word
run
themselves


together
almost
into
a
shriek
.
the
grow
-
up
people
do
not
know


whether
to
laugh
or
to
cry
.
their
voice
be
so
harsh
;
the
accent


be
so
hideous
.




they
burst
out
again
:






 
Chree
to
gay
ei
,


 
Geeray

.
.
.






then
they
stop
.
it
seem
to
be
in
the
middle
of
a
verse
.
they


stand
there
grin
,
silent
,
look
at
the
floor
.
nobody
know


what
to
say
.
there
be
something
horrible
in
the
noise
they
make
.


it
be
so
shrill
,
so
discordant
,
and
so
meaningless
.
then
old


Patrick
amble
up
.




"
ah

nice

nice

he


say
in
his
genial
way
,
fiddle
with
his
toothpick
.
the
child


grin
at
he
.
then
they
begin
to
make
off
.
as
they
sidle
past


Martin
,
he
slip
coin
into
their
hand
.
then
they
make
a
dash


for
the
door
.




"
but
what
the
devil
be
they
