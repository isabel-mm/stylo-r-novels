.
Tom
’s
early
life
.




let
we

a
hundred
thousand
inhabitant
--
some
think
double
as
many
.


 
the
street
be
very
narrow
,
and
crooked
,
and
dirty
,
especially
in
the


part
where
Tom
Canty
live
,
which
be
not
far
from
London
Bridge
.
 
the


house
be
of
wood
,
with
the
second
story
project
over
the
first
,


and
the
third
stick
its
elbow
out
beyond
the

the
high

be
paint
red
or
blue
or
black
,
accord
to
the
owner
’s


taste
,
and
this
give
the
house
a
very
picturesque
look
.
 
the
window


be
small
,
glaze
with
little
diamond
-
shape
pane
,
and
they
open


outward
,
on
hinge
,
like
door
.




the
house
which
Tom
’s
father
live
in
be
up
a
foul
little
pocket
call


Offal
Court
,
out
of
Pudding
Lane
.
 
it
be
small
,
decay
,
and
rickety
,


but
it
be
pack
full
of
wretchedly
poor
family
.
canty
’s
tribe


occupy
a
room
on
the
third
floor
.
 
the
mother
and
father
have
a
sort
of


bedstead
in
the
corner
;
but
Tom
,
his
grandmother
,
and
his
two
sister
,


Bet
and
Nan
,
be
not

they
have
all
the
floor

,


and
might
sleep
where
they
choose
.
 
there
be
the
remain
of
a
blanket


or
two
,
and
some
bundle
of
ancient
and
dirty
straw
,
but
these
could
not


rightly
be
call
bed
,
for
they
be
not
organise
;
they
be
kick


into
a
general
pile
,
morning
,
and
selection
make
from
the
mass
at


night
,
for
service
.




Bet
and
Nan
be
fifteen
year
old
--
twin
.
 
they
be
good
-
hearted


girl
,
unclean
,
clothe
in
rag
,
and
profoundly
ignorant
.
 
their
mother


be
like
they
.
 
but
the
father
and
the
grandmother
be
a
couple
of


fiend
.
 
they
get
drunk
whenever
they
could
;
then
they
fight
each
other


or
anybody
else
who
come
in
the
way
;
they
curse
and
swear
always
,
drunk


or
sober
;
John
Canty
be
a
thief
,
and
his
mother
a
beggar
.
 
they
make


beggar
of
the
child
,
but
fail
to
make
thief
of
they
.
 
among
,


but
not
of
,
the
dreadful
rabble
that
inhabit
the
house
,
be
a
good
old


priest
whom
the
King
have
turn
out
of
house
and
home
with
a
pension
of


a
few
farthing
,
and
he
use
to
get
the
child
aside
and
teach
they


right
way
secretly
.
Father
Andrew
also
teach
Tom
a
little
Latin
,
and


how
to
read
and
write
;
and
would
have
do
the
same
with
the
girl
,


but
they
be
afraid
of
the
jeer
of
their
friend
,
who
could
not
have


endure
such
a
queer
accomplishment
in
they
.




all
Offal
Court
be
just
such
another
hive
as
Canty
’s
house
.


drunkenness
,
riot
and
brawling
be
the
order
,
there
,
every
night
and


nearly
all
night
long
.
 
Broken
head
be
as
common
as
hunger
in
that


place
.
 
yet
little
Tom
be
not
unhappy
.
 
he
have
a
hard
time
of
it
,
but


do
not
know
it
.
 
it
be
the
sort
of
time
that
all
the
Offal
Court
boy


have
,
therefore
he
suppose
it
be
the
correct
and
comfortable
thing
.


 
when
he
come
home
empty
-
handed
at
night
,
he
know
his
father
would


curse
he
and
thrash
he
first
,
and
that
when
he
be
do
the
awful


grandmother
would
do
it
all
over
again
and
improve
on
it
;
and
that
away


in
the
night
his
starve
mother
would
slip
to
he
stealthily
with
any


miserable
scrap
or
crust
she
have
be
able
to
save
for
he
by
go


hungry
herself
,
notwithstanding
she
be
often
catch
in
that
sort
of


treason
and
soundly
beat
for
it
by
her
husband
.




no
,
Tom
’s
life
go
along
well
enough
,
especially
in
summer
.
 
he
only


beg
just
enough
to
save
himself
,
for
the
law
against
mendicancy
be


stringent
,
and
the
penalty
heavy
;
so
he
put
in
a
good
deal
of
his
time


listen
to
good
Father
Andrew
’s
charming
old
tale
and
legend


about
giant
and
fairy
,
dwarf
and
genius
,
and
enchant
castle
,
and


gorgeous
king
and
prince
.
 
his
head
grow
to
be
full
of
these
wonderful


thing
,
and
many
a
night
as
he
lie
in
the
dark
on
his
scant
and


offensive
straw
,
tired
,
hungry
,
and
smart
from
a
thrashing
,
he


unleash
his
imagination
and
soon
forget
his
ache
and
pain
in


delicious
picturing
to
himself
of
the
charm
life
of
a
petted
prince


in
a
regal
palace
.
 
one
desire
come
in
time
to
haunt
he
day
and
night
:


 
it
be
to
see
a
real
prince
,
with
his
own
eye
.
 
he
speak
of
it
once
to


some
of
his
Offal
Court
comrade
;
but
they
jeer
he
and
scoff
he
so


unmercifully
that
he
be
glad
to
keep
his
dream
to
himself
after
that
.




he
often
read
the
priest
’s
old
book
and
get
he
to
explain
and
enlarge


upon
they
.
 
his
dreaming
and
reading
work
certain
change
in
he
,


by
-
and
-
by
.
 
his
dream
-
people
be
so
fine
that
he
grow
to
lament
his


shabby
clothing
and
his
dirt
,
and
to
wish
to
be
clean
and
well
clothe
.


 
he
go
on
play
in
the
mud
just
the
same
,
and
enjoy
it
,
too
;
but
,


instead
of
splash
around
in
the
Thames
solely
for
the
fun
of
it
,


he
begin
to
find
an
add
value
in
it
because
of
the
washing
and


cleansing
it
afford
.




Tom
could
always
find
something
go
on
around
the
Maypole
in


cheapside
,
and
at
the
fair
;
and
now
and
then
he
and
the
rest
of
London


have
a
chance
to
see
a
military
parade
when
some
famous
unfortunate
be


carry
prisoner
to
the
Tower
,
by
land
or
boat
.
one
summer
’s
day
he
see


poor
Anne
Askew
and
three
man
burn
at
the
stake
in
Smithfield
,
and


hear
an
ex
-
Bishop
preach
a
sermon
to
they
which
do
not
interest
he
.


yes
,
Tom
’s
life
be
varied
and
pleasant
enough
,
on
the
whole
.




by
-
and
-
by
Tom
’s
read
and
dream
about
princely
life
work
such
a


strong
effect
upon
he
that
he
begin
to
_
act
_
the
prince
,
unconsciously
.


his
speech
and
manner
become
curiously
ceremonious
and
courtly
,
to
the


vast
admiration
and
amusement
of
his
intimate
.
 
but
Tom
’s
influence


among
these
young
people
begin
to
grow
now
,
day
by
day
;
and
in
time
he


come
to
be
look
up
to
,
by
they
,
with
a
sort
of
wonder
awe
,
as
a


superior
being
.
 
he
seem
to
know
so
much
!
and
he
could
do
and
say
such


marvellous
thing
!
and
withal
,
he
be
so
deep
and
wise
!

remark
,


and
Tom
’s
performance
,
be
report
by
the
boy
to
their
elder

and


these
,
also
,
presently
begin
to
discuss
Tom
Canty
,
and
to
regard
he


as
a
most
gifted
and
extraordinary
creature
.

perplexity
to
Tom
for
solution
,
and

at
the


wit
and
wisdom
of
his
decision
.
 
in
fact

a
hero
to
all


who
know
he
except

his
poor
crust
,
take

and
then

himself
upon

handful
of
foul
straw
,
and
resume
his
empty
grandeur


in
his
dream
.




and
still

the
serene
blankness

overshot

volley

evening

that
he

not

friendless
,
now
,
among
that
multitude
of
stranger

,
an


hour
early
,
the
idea
of
their
go
with
he
would
have
be
an


insupportable
terror
to
he

Tom
’s
guardian
angel

the
two
lord

have
have
less
comfort
in
the


interview
than
the
other
party
to
it
.
 
they
feel
much
as
if
they
be


pilot
a
great
ship
through
a
dangerous
channel
;
they
be
on
the


alert
constantly
,

find
their
office
no
child

,


at
last
,
when
the

visit
be
draw
to
a
close
and
the
Lord


Guilford

announce

they
not
only
feel
that
their
charge
have


be
sufficiently
tax
for
the
present
,

also
that
they
themselves


be
not

the
good
condition
to
take
their
ship
back

make
their


anxious
voyage
all
over
again
.
 
so
they
respectfully
advise
Tom
to


excuse
himself
,
which
he
be
very
glad
to
do
,

a
slight
shade


of
disappointment
might
have
be
observe
upon
my
Lady

’s
face

she
hear
the
splendid
stripling
deny
admittance
.




there
be
a
pause
now
,
a
sort
of
wait
silence
which
Tom
could
not


understand
.
 
he
glance
at
Lord
Hertford
,
who
give
he
a
sign
--
but
he


fail
to
understand
that
also
.
 
the
ready
Elizabeth
come
to
the
rescue


with
her
usual
easy
grace
.
 
she
make
reverence
and
said--




"

"




Tom
said--




"
indeed
your
ladyship
can
have
whatsoever
of
I
they
will

for
the


ask

yet
would
I
rather

any
other
thing

my

power
lieth
,

leave
to
take
the
light

for
a
while

she
strain
he
to
her

back
,

tear
,

as
she
lie
thinking
and
mourning
,
the
suggestion
begin
to
creep
into


her
mind
that
there
be
an
undefinable
something
about
this
boy
that
be


lack
in
Tom
Canty
,
mad

sane
.
 
she
could
not
describe
it
,
she
could


not
tell
just
what
it
be
,
and
yet
her
sharp
mother
-
instinct
seem
to


detect
it
and
perceive
it
.
 
what
if
the
boy
be
really
not
her
son
,


after
all
?
 
oh
,
absurd
!
 
she
almost
smile
at
the
idea
,
spite
of
she


grief
and
trouble
.
 
no
matter
,
she
find
that
it
be
an
idea
that


would
not
'
down
,

persist
in
haunt
she
.
 
it
pursue
she
,
it


harass
she
,
it
clung
to
she
,
and
refuse
to
be
put
away
or
ignore
.


 
at
last
she
perceive
that
there
be
not
go
to
be
any
peace
for
she


until
she
should
devise
a
test
that
should
prove
,
clearly
and
without


question
,
whether
this
lad
be
her
son
or
not
,
and
so
banish
these


wear
and
worry
doubt
.
 
ah
,
yes
,
this
be
plainly
the
right
way


out
of
the
difficulty
;
therefore
she
set
her
wit
to
work
at
once
to


contrive
that
test
.
 
but
it
be
an
easy
thing
to
propose
than
to


accomplish
.
 
she
turn
over
in
her
mind
one
promise
test
after


another
,
but
be
oblige
to
relinquish
they
all
--
none
of
they
be


absolutely
sure
,
absolutely
perfect
;
and
an
imperfect
one
could
not


satisfy
she
.
 
evidently
she
be
rack
her
head
in
vain
--
it
seem


manifest
that
she
must
give
the
matter
up
.
 
while
this
depress


thought
be
pass
through
her
mind
,
her
ear
catch
the
regular


breathe
of
the

asleep

while
she


listen
,
the
measured
breathing
be
break
by
a
soft
,
startled


cry
,
such
as
one
utter
in
a
troubled
dream
.
 
this
chance
occurrence


furnish
she
instantly
with
a
plan
worth
all
her
laboured
test


combine
.
 
she
at
once
set
herself
feverishly
,

noiselessly
,
to
work


to
relight
her

a
sudden
out
of


his
dream

out
of
his
thinking

cast
his

as
he

day

outward

her
emotion

to
soothe
the

again

then
she
creep
apart
and
commune
miserably
with
herself
upon


the
disastrous
result
of
her
experiment

in


an
instant
.
we

not

that
the
Prince

the
Prince
’s
heart
be
beat
high


with
hope
of
escape
,
now
.
 
a
burly
waterman
,
considerably
exalted
with


liquor
,
find
himself
rudely
shove
by
Canty
in
his
effort
to
plough


through
the
crowd
;
he
lay
his
great
hand
on
Canty
’s
shoulder

said--




"

roughly
;
"

say
the
waterman
,
bar
the
way


resolutely
.




"
give
I
the

then
,

make

!
"




other
reveller
be
interested
by
this
time
.
 
they
cry
out--




"
the
loving

;
the
waterman
,
grasp
it
by
one
of


its
handle
,
and
with
the
other
hand
bear
up
the
end
of
an
imaginary


napkin
,
present
it
in
due
and
ancient
form
to
Canty
,
who
have
to
grasp


the
opposite
handle
with
one
of
his
hand
and
take
off
the
lid
with
the


other
,
accord
to
ancient
custom
.
this
leave
the
Prince
hand
-
free
for


a
second
,
of
course
.
 
he
waste
no
time
,
but
dive
among
the
forest
of


leg
about
he
and
disappear
.
 
in
another
moment
he
could
not
have


be
hard
to
find
,
under
that
toss
sea
of
life
,
if
its
billow
have


be
the
Atlantic
’s
and
he
a
lost
sixpence
.




he
very
soon
realise
this
fact
,
and
straightway
busy
himself
about


his
own
affair
without
further
thought
of
John
Canty
.
 
he
quickly


realise
another
thing
,
too
.
 
to
wit
,
that
a
spurious
Prince
of
Wales


be
be
feast
by
the
city
in
his
stead
.
 
he
easily
conclude
that


the
pauper
lad
,
Tom
Canty
,
have
deliberately
take
advantage
of
his


stupendous
opportunity
and
become
a
usurper
.




therefore
there
be
but
one
course
to
pursue
--
find
his
way
to
the


Guildhall
,
make
himself
know
,
and
denounce
the
impostor
.
 
he
also
make


up
his
mind
that
Tom
should
be
allow
a
reasonable
time
for
spiritual


preparation
,
and
then
be
hang
,
draw
and
quarter
,
accord
to
the


law
and
usage
of
the

fantastic

startle
Hendon
out
of
his
reverie

he
be


about
to
thank
the
King

put
the
matter
aside
with
say
he
have
only


do
his
duty
and
desire
no
reward
,
but
a
wise
thought
come
into
his


head
,
and
he
ask
leave
to
be
silent
a
few
moment
and
consider
the


gracious
offer
--
an
idea
which
the
King
gravely
approve
,
remark
that


it
be
good
to
be
not
too
hasty
with
a
thing
of
such
great
import
.




mile
reflect
during
some
moment
,
then
say
to
himself
,
"

the
thing

any

then
he
drop


upon
one
knee

so
the
matter
,


which
be
a
weighty
one

Tom
be
about
to
blurt
out
something
about
the
propriety
of
pay
the


late
King

debt

all

timely
touch
upon
his
arm
,
from
the
thoughtful
Hertford

save
he


this
indiscretion
;
wherefore
he
give
the
royal
assent
,
without
spoken


comment
,
but
with
much
inward
discomfort
.

he
sit
reflect
a


moment
over
the
ease

he

strange

glitter

a
happy
thought

into
his
mind
:
 
why
not
make
his
mother


duchess
of
Offal
Court
,

give
she
an
estate
?

a
sorrowful


think
sweep
it
instantly
away
:

be
only
a
king
in
name

grave


veteran

great
noble

his

only


the
creature
of
a
diseased
mind

they
would
simply
listen
to
his
project


with
unbelieving
ear
,

send
for
the
doctor
.




the
dull
work

tediously
on

Petitions

proclamation
,
patent

all
manner
of
wordy
,
repetitious
,

wearisome
paper
relate
to
the
public
business
;
and
at
last
Tom
sigh


pathetically
and
murmur
to
himself
,
"
in
what
have
I
offend

then
his
poor
muddle
head
nod
a
while

presently

to
his

silence

around

the

from
their


deliberation

mighty
stroke

one
merit
in


his
eye

its
brevity
.
 
he
have
a
few
moment

himself

then
a
slim


lad

about
twelve
year
of
age

admit
to
his
presence

clothing
,

the
lace
about
his

be
of


black,--doublet
,
hose
,
and
all
.
 
he
bear
no
badge
of
mourning
but
a
knot


of
purple
ribbon
on
his
shoulder

he
advance
hesitatingly
,
with
head

bare

drop
upon
one
knee
in

Tom
sit
still

soberly

then
he
said--

at
graceful
ease

with
an
aspect
of
concern


in
his
face

He
said--

delicate

what
should
he

then
betray
by
his
every
utterance


that
he
have
never
hear

before

no
,
that
would
not
do
.
 
an
idea


come
to
his
relief

accident
like
this
might
be
likely
to
happen
with


some
frequency

now
that
business
urgency
would
often
call
Hertford

St.
John
from
his
side
,
they
be
member
of
the
Council
of


executor
;
therefore
perhaps
it
would
be
well
to
strike
out
a
plan


himself
to
meet
the
requirement
of
such
emergency
.
 
yes
,
that
would


be
a
wise
course

he
would
practise
on
this
boy
,
and
see
what
sort
of


success
he
might
achieve
.
 
so
he
stroke
his
brow
perplexedly
a
moment

two

Tom
’s
'
cure
'
;
for


always
,
as
soon
as
he
have
finish
call
back
to
Tom
’s
diseased
mind


the
various
particular
of
his
experience
and
adventure
in
the
royal


school
-
room
and
elsewhere
about
the
palace
,
he
notice
that
Tom
be
then


able
to
'
recall
'
the
circumstance
quite
clearly
.
 
at
the
end
of
an


hour
Tom
find
himself
well
freight
with
very
valuable
information


concern
personage
and
matter
pertain
to
the
Court
;
so
he


resolve
to
draw
instruction
from
this
source
daily
;
and
to
this
end
he


would
give
order
to
admit
Humphrey
to
the
royal
closet
whenever
he
might


come
,
provide
the
Majesty
of
England
be
not
engage
with
other
people
.


 
Humphrey
have
hardly
be
dismiss
when
my
Lord
Hertford
arrive
with


more
trouble
for
Tom
.




he
say
that
the
Lords
of
the
Council
,
fear
that
some
overwrought


report
of
the
King
’s
damage
health
might
have
leak
out
and
get


abroad
,
they
deem
it
wise
and
good
that
his
Majesty
should
begin
to


dine
in
public
after
a
day
or
two
--
his
wholesome
complexion
and
vigorous


step
,
assist
by
a
carefully
guard
repose
of
manner
and
ease
and


grace
of
demeanour
,
would
more
surely
quiet
the
general
pulse
--
in
case


any
evil
rumour
_
have
_
go
about
--
than
any
other
scheme
that
could
be


devise
.




then
the
Earl
proceed
,
very
delicately
,
to
instruct
Tom
as
to
the


observance
proper
to
the
stately
occasion
,
under
the
rather
thin


disguise
of
'
remind
'
he
concern
thing
already
know
to
he
;
but


to
his
vast
gratification
it
turn
out
that
Tom
need
very
little
help


in
this
line
--
he
have
be
make
use
of
Humphrey
in
that
direction
,
for


Humphrey
have
mention
that
within
a
few
day
he
be
to
begin
to
dine


in
public
;
having
gather
it
from
the
swift
-
wing
gossip
of
the
Court
.


Tom
keep
these
fact
to
himself
,
however
.




see
the
royal
memory
so
improved
,
the
Earl
venture
to
apply
a


few
test
to
it
,
in
an
apparently
casual
way
,
to
find
out
how
far
its


amendment
have
progress
.
 
the
result
be
happy
,
here
and
there
,
in


spot
--
spot
where
Humphrey
’s
track
remain
--
and
on
the
whole
my
lord


be
greatly
pleased
and
encourage
.
 
so
encourage
be
he
,
indeed
,
that


he
speak
up
and
say
in
a
quite
hopeful
voice--




"
now
be
I
persuade
that
if
your
Majesty
will
but
tax
your
memory
yet


a
little
far
,
it
will
resolve
the
puzzle
of
the
Great
Seal
--
a
loss


which
be
of
moment
yesterday
,
although
of
none
to

day
,
since
its
term


of
service
end
with
our
late
lord
’s
life

may
it
please
your
grace
to


make
the
trial
?
"




Tom
be
at
sea
--
a
Great
Seal
be
something
which
he
be
totally


unacquainted
with
.
 
after
a
moment
’s
hesitation
he
look
up
innocently


and
asked--




"
what
be
it
like
,
my
lord
?
"




the
Earl
start
,
almost
imperceptibly
,
mutter
to
himself
,
"
alack
,


his
wit
be
fly
again!--it
be
ill
wisdom
to
lead
he
on
to
strain


them”--then
he
deftly
turn
the
talk
to
other
matter
,
with
the
purpose


of
sweep
the
unlucky
seal
out
of
Tom

thought

a
purpose

XV

Tom
as
King
.




the
next
day
the
foreign
ambassador
come
,
with
their
gorgeous
train
;


and
Tom
,
throne
in
awful
state
,
receive
they
.
 
the
splendour
of
the


scene
delight
his
eye
and
fire
his
imagination
at
first
,
but


the
audience
be
long
and
dreary
,
and
so
be
most
of
the


address
--
wherefore
,
what
begin
as
a
pleasure
grow
into
weariness
and


home
-
sickness
by
-
and
-
by
.
 
Tom
say
the
word
which
Hertford
put
into


his
mouth
from
time
to
time
,
and
try
hard
to
acquit
himself


satisfactorily
,
but
he
be
too
new
to
such
thing
,
and
too
ill
at
ease


to
accomplish
more
than
a
tolerable
success
.
 
he
look
sufficiently


like
a
king
,
but
he
be
ill
able
to
feel
like
one
.
 
he
be
cordially


glad
when
the
ceremony
be
end
.




the
large
part
of
his
day
be
'
wasted’--as
he
term
it
,
in
his
own


mind
--
in
labour
pertain
to
his
royal
office
.
 
even
the
two
hour


devoted
to
certain
princely
pastime
and
recreation
be
rather
a


burden
to
he
than
otherwise
,
they
be
so
fetter
by
restriction


and
ceremonious
observance
.
 
however
,
he
have
a
private
hour
with


his
whipping
-
boy
which
he
count
clear
gain
,
since
he
get
both


entertainment
and
needful
information
out
of
it
.




the
third
day
of
Tom
Canty
’s
kingship
come
and
go
much
as
the
other


have
do
,
but
there
be
a
lifting
of
his
cloud
in
one
way
--
he
feel


less
uncomfortable
than
at
first
;
he
be
get
a
little
used
to
his


circumstance
and
surrounding
;
his
chain
still
gall
,
but
not
all
the


time
;
he
find
that
the
presence
and
homage
of
the
great
afflict
and


embarrass
he
less
and
less
sharply
with
every
hour
that
drift
over


his
head
.




but
for
one
single
dread
,
he
could
have
see
the
fourth
day
approach


without
serious
distress
--
the
dining
in
public
;
it
be
to
begin
that


day
.
there
be
great
matter
in
the
programme
--
for
on
that
day


he
would
have
to
preside
at
a
council
which
would
take
his
view
and


command
concern
the
policy
to
be
pursue
toward
various
foreign


nation
scatter
far
and
near
over
the
great
globe
;
on
that
day
,
too
,


Hertford
would
be
formally
choose
to
the
grand
office
of
Lord
Protector
;


other
thing
of
note
be
appoint
for
that
fourth
day
,
also
;
but
to


Tom
they
be
all
insignificant
compare
with
the
ordeal
of
dine
all


by
himself
with
a
multitude
of
curious
eye
fasten
upon
he
and
a


multitude
of
mouth
whisper
comment
upon
his
performance,--and
upon


his
mistake
,
if
he
should
be
so
unlucky
as
to
make
any
.




still
,
nothing
could
stop
that
fourth
day
,
and
so
it
come
.
 
it
find


poor
Tom
low
-
spirited
and
absent
-
minded
,
and
this
mood
continue
;
he


could
not
shake
it
off
.
 
the
ordinary
duty
of
the
morning
drag
upon


his
hand
,
and
weary
he
.
 
once
more
he
feel
the
sense
of
captivity


heavy
upon
he
.




late
in
the
forenoon
he
be
in
a
large
audience
-
chamber
,
converse


with
the
Earl
of
Hertford

dully
await
the
striking
of
the
hour

for
a
visit
of
ceremony
from
a
considerable
number
of
great


official
and
courtier
.




after
a
little
while
,
Tom
,
who
have
wander
to
a
window
and
become


interested
in
the
life
and
movement

the
great
highway
beyond
the


palace

from
up
the
road

exclaim
,

curiosity
in
such
happening
.




"

exclaim
Tom
excitedly
,

to


himself
with
a
lively
sense
of
satisfaction
,
"
in
truth

control

that
he
be

the


false
shadow

then
all

cease

he
be
perplex
as


to
how
to
proceed
.
 
still
,

continue
his

famish
,

his

he
sup
at
the
Tabard
Inn

to

make
an
early


start
in
the
morning

give
the

an
exhaustive
search
.
 
as
he
lie


think
and
planning
,
he
presently
begin
to
reason
thus
:
 
the
boy
would


escape
from
the
ruffian
,
his
reputed
father
,
if
possible
;
would
he
go


back
to
London
and
seek
his
former
haunt
?
 
no
,
he
would
not
do
that
,


he
would
avoid
recapture
.
what
,
then
,
would
he
do
?
 
never
having
have
a


friend
in
the
world
,
or
a
protector
,
until
he
meet
Miles
Hendon
,
he
would


naturally
try
to
find
that
friend
again
,
provide
the
effort
do
not


require
he
to
go
toward
London
and
danger
.
 
he
would
strike
for
Hendon


Hall
,
that
be
what
he
would
do
,
for
he
know
Hendon
be
homeward
bind


and
there
he
might
expect
to
find
he
.
 
yes
,
the
case
be
plain
to


Hendon
--
he
must
lose
no
more
time
in
Southwark
,

move
at
once
through


Kent

toward
Monk

the

the
King
be
about
to

contemptuously
,
when
Hugo

,


interrupting--

in
a
moment
he
be
up
and
off


like
the
wind

follow
after

raise
the
hue

lustily
as

the
King
,
breathe
deep
gratitude
to
Heaven
for


his
own
release
,
flee
in
the
opposite
direction

and
do
not

his
pace
until
he

out
of
harm
’s
reach

he
take
the
first
road
that


offer
,
and
soon
put
the
village
behind
he
.
 
he
hurry
along
,
as


briskly
as
he
could
,
during
several
hour
,
keep
a
nervous
watch
over


his
shoulder
for
pursuit

but
his
fear
leave
he
at
last
,
and
a
grateful


sense
of
security
take
their
place
.
 
he
recognise
,
now
,
that
he
be


hungry
,
and
also
very
tired
.
 
so
he
halt
at
a
farmhouse
;
but
when


he
be
about
to
speak
,
he
be
cut
short
and
drive
rudely
away
.
 
his


clothe
be
against
he
.




he
wander
on
,
wound
and
indignant
,
and
be
resolve
to
put
himself


in
the
way
of
like
treatment
no
more
.
 
but
hunger
be
pride
’s
master
;
so
,


as
the
evening
draw
near
,
he
make
an
attempt
at
another
farmhouse
;
but


here
he
fare
bad
than
before
;
for
he
be
call
hard
name
and
be


promise
arrest
as
a
vagrant
except
he
move
on
promptly
.




the
night
come
on
,
chilly
and
overcast
;
and
still
the
footsore
monarch


labour
slowly
on
.
 
he
be
oblige
to
keep
move
,
for
every
time
he


sit
down
to
rest
he
be
soon
penetrate
to
the
bone
with
the
cold
.
 
all


his
sensation
and
experience
,
as
he
move
through
the
solemn
gloom


and
the
empty
vastness
of
the
night
,
be
new
and
strange
to
he
.
 
at


interval
he
hear
voice
approach
,
pass
by
,
and
fade
into
silence
;
and


as
he
see
nothing
more
of
the
body
they
belong
to
than
a
sort
of


formless
drift
blur
,
there
be
something
spectral
and
uncanny
about


it
all
that
make
he
shudder
.
 
occasionally
he
catch
the
twinkle
of
a


light
--
always
far
away
,
apparently
--
almost
in
another
world
;
if
he
hear


the
tinkle
of
a
sheep
’s
bell
,
it
be
vague
,
distant
,
indistinct
;


the
muffled
lowing
of
the
herd
float
to
he
on
the
night
wind
in


vanish
cadence
,
a
mournful
sound
;
now
and
then
come
the
complain


howl
of
a
dog
over
viewless
expanse
of
field
and
forest
;
all
sound


be
remote
;
they
make
the
little
King
feel
that
all
life
and
activity


be
far
remove
from
he
,
and
that
he
stand
solitary
,
companionless
,
in


the
centre
of
a
measureless
solitude
.




he
stumble
along
,
through
the
gruesome
fascination
of
this
new


experience
,
startle
occasionally
by
the
soft
rustling
of
the
dry
leave


overhead
,
so
like
human
whisper
they
seem
to
sound
;
and
by
-
and
-
by
he


come
suddenly
upon
the
freckle
light
of
a
tin
lantern
near
at
hand
.
 
he


step
back
into
the
shadow
and
wait
.
 
the
lantern
stand
by
the


open
door
of
a
barn
.
 
the
King
wait
some
time
--
there
be
no
sound
,


and
nobody
stir
.
 
he
get
so
cold
,
stand
still
,
and
the
hospitable


barn
look
so
enticing
,
that
at
last
he
resolve
to
risk
everything
and


enter
.
he
start
swiftly
and
stealthily
,
and
just
as
he
be
cross


the
threshold
he
hear
voice
behind
he
.
 
he
dart
behind
a
cask
,


within
the
barn
,
and
stoop
down
.
 
two
farm
-
labourer
come
in
,
bring


the
lantern
with
they
,
and
fall
to
work
,
talk
meanwhile
.
 
whilst
they


move
about
with
the
light
,
the
King
make
good
use
of
his
eye
and
take


the
bearing
of
what
seem
to
be
a
good
-
sized
stall
at
the
further
end


of
the
place
,
purpose
to
grope
his
way
to
it
when
he
should
be
leave
to


himself
.
 
he
also
note
the
position
of
a
pile
of
horse
blanket
,
midway


of
the
route
,
with
the
intent
to
levy
upon
they
for
the
service
of
the


crown
of
England
for
one
night
.




by
-
and
-
by
the
man
finish
and
go
away
,
fasten
the
door
behind


they
and
take
the
lantern
with
they
.
 
the
shiver
King
make
for
the


blanket
,
with
as
good
speed
as
the
darkness
would
allow
;
gather
they


up
,
and
then
grope
his
way
safely
to
the
stall
.
 
of
two
of
the
blanket


he
make
a
bed
,
then
cover
himself
with
the
remain
two
.
 
he
be
a


glad
monarch
,
now
,
though
the
blanket
be
old
and
thin
,
and
not
quite


warm
enough
;
and
besides
give
out
a
pungent
horsey
odour
that
be
almost


suffocatingly
powerful
.




although
the
King
be
hungry
and
chilly
,
he
be
also
so
tired
and
so


drowsy
that
these
latter
influence
soon
begin
to
get
the
advantage


of
the
former
,
and
he
presently
doze
off
into
a
state
of


semi
-
consciousness
.
 
then
,
just
as
he
be
on
the
point
of
lose
himself


wholly
,
he
distinctly
feel
something
touch
he
!
 
he
be
broad
awake
in


a
moment
,
and
gasp
for
breath
.
 
the
cold
horror
of
that
mysterious


touch
in
the
dark
almost
make
his
heart
stand
still
.
 
he
lie
motionless
,


and
listen
,
scarcely
breathe
.
but
nothing
stir
,
and
there
be


no
sound
.
 
he
continue
to
listen
,
and
wait
,
during
what
seem
a
long


time
,
but
still
nothing
stir
,
and
there
be
no
sound
.
 
so
he
begin


to
drop
into
a
drowse
once
more
,
at
last
;
and
all
at
once
he
feel
that


mysterious
touch
again
!
 
it
be
a
grisly
thing
,
this
light
touch
from


this
noiseless
and
invisible
presence
;
it
make
the
boy
sick
with
ghostly


fear
.
 
what
should
he
do
?
 
that
be
the
question
;
but
he
do
not
know


how
to
answer
it
.
 
should
he
leave
these
reasonably
comfortable
quarter


and
fly
from
this
inscrutable
horror
?
 
but
fly
whither
?
 
he
could


not
get
out
of
the
barn
;
and
the
idea
of
scurry
blindly
hither
and


thither
in
the
dark
,
within
the
captivity
of
the
four
wall
,
with
this


phantom
gliding
after
he
,
and
visit
he
with
that
soft
hideous
touch


upon
cheek
or
shoulder
at
every
turn
,
be
intolerable
.
 
but
to
stay


where
he
be
,
and
endure
this
live
death
all
night
--
be
that
well
?


 
no
.
 
what
,
then
,
be
there
leave
to
do
?
 
ah
,
there
be
but
one
course
;


he
know
it
well
--
he
must
put
out
his
hand
and
find
that
thing
!




it
be
easy
to
think
this
;
but
it
be
hard
to
brace
himself
up
to
try


it
.
three
time
he
stretch
his
hand
a
little
way
out
into
the
dark
,


gingerly
;
and
snatch
it
suddenly
back
,
with
a
gasp
--
not
because
it


have
encounter
anything
,
but
because
he
have
feel
so
sure
it
be
just


_
go
_
to
.
 
but
the
fourth
time
,
he
grope
a
little
far
,
and
his


hand
lightly
sweep
against
something
soft
and
warm
.
 
this
petrify
he
,


nearly
,
with
fright
;
his
mind
be
in
such
a
state
that
he
could
imagine


the
thing
to
be
nothing
else
than
a
corpse
,
newly
dead
and
still
warm
.


he
think
he
would
rather
die
than
touch
it
again
.
 
but
he
think
this


false
thought
because
he
do
not
know
the
immortal
strength
of


human
curiosity
.
in
no
long
time
his
hand
be
tremblingly
grope


again
--
against
his
judgment
,
and
without
his
consent
--
but
grope


persistently
on
,
just
the
same
.
 
it
encounter
a
bunch
of
long
hair
;
he


shudder
,
but
follow
up
the
hair
and
find
what
seem
to
be
a
warm


rope
;
follow
up
the
rope
and
find
an
innocent
calf!--for
the
rope
be


not
a
rope
at
all
,
but
the
calf
’s
tail
.




the
King
be
cordially
ashamed
of
himself
for
having
get
all
that


fright
and
misery
out
of
so
paltry
a
matter
as
a
slumber
calf
;
but
he


need
not
have
feel
so
about
it
,
for
it
be
not
the
calf
that
frighten


he
,
but
a
dreadful
non
-
existent
something
which
the
calf
stand
for
;
and


any
other
boy
,
in
those
old
superstitious
time
,
would
have
act
and


suffer
just
as
he
have
do
.




the
King
be
not
only
delighted
to
find
that
the
creature
be
only
a


calf
,
but
delight
to
have
the
calf
’s
company
;
for
he
have
be
feel


so
lonesome
and
friendless
that
the
company
and
comradeship
of
even


this
humble
animal
be
welcome
.
 
and
he
have
be
so
buffeted
,
so
rudely


entreat
by
his
own
kind
,
that
it
be
a
real
comfort
to
he
to
feel


that
he
be
at
last
in
the
society
of
a
fellow
-
creature
that
have
at


least
a
soft
heart
and
a
gentle
spirit
,
whatever
lofty
attribute


might
be
lack
.
 
so
he
resolve
to
waive
rank
and
make
friend
with


the
calf
.




while
stroke
its
sleek
warm
back
--
for
it
lie
near
he
and
within
easy


reach
--
it
occur
to
he
that
this
calf
might
be
utilise
in
more
way


than
one
.
 
Whereupon
he
re
-
arrange
his
bed
,
spread
it
down
close
to


the
calf
;
then
he
cuddle
himself
up
to
the
calf
’s
back
,
draw
the
cover


up
over
himself
and
his
friend
,
and
in
a
minute
or
two
be
as
warm
and


comfortable
as
he
have
ever
be
in
the
downy
couch
of
the
regal
palace


of
Westminster

of
the
companionship

base
and
brutal
outlaw
;
he
be
warm
;
he
be

;
in
a
word

down

the

snuggle


the
close
to
his
friend
,
in
a
luxury
of
warm
contentment
,
and
drift


blissfully
out
of
consciousness
into
a
deep
and
dreamless
sleep

full

serenity

he
get
up

out

child

voice

at

strong
curiosity

presently

whisper
together

stop
again

.
 
by

by
they
gather
courage

one
said--

they
come
still
near
,
sidle
shyly
around
and
about
he
,
examine


he
minutely
from
all
point
,
as
if
he
be
some
strange
new
kind
of


animal
,

warily
and
watchfully
the
while
,

if
they
half
fear

might
be
a

take
a


good
satisfying
stare
with
their
innocent
eye
;
then
one
of
they
pluck


up
all
her
courage

inquire
with
honest
directness--




"

a

their
eye
spread
themselves
wide


open

remain
so

then
at
each

again

wonderingly
,

said--




"

it
be
a
good
tight
argument

without
a
leak
in
it
anywhere

it
leave


Prissy

half

doubt
not
a

on
.
 
she
consider
a
moment
,


then
put
the
King
upon
his
honour
with
the
simple
remark--




"

further
question
or
discussion

the
two
little
girl
begin
at
once


to
inquire
into
how
he
come
to
be
where
he
be
,
and
how
he
come
to
be
so


unroyally
clothe
,
and
whither
he
be
bind
,
and
all
about
his
affair
.
 
it


be
a
mighty
relief
to
he
to
pour
out
his
trouble
where
they
would
not


be
scoff
at
or
doubted
;
so
he
tell
his
tale
with
feeling
,
forget


even
his
hunger
for
the
time
;
and
it
be
receive
with
the
deep
and


tender
sympathy
by
the
gentle
little
maid
.
 
but
when
he
get
down


to
his
late
experience
and
they
learn
how
long
he
have
be
without


food
,
they
cut
he
short
and
hurry
he
away
to
the
farmhouse
to
find
a


breakfast
for
he
.




the
King
be
cheerful
and
happy
now
,
and
say
to
himself
,
"
when
I


be
come
to
mine
own
again

I
will
always
honour

how

the
child
’s
mother
receive
the
King
kindly
,

be
full
of
pity

for
his
forlorn
condition

apparently
craze

touch
she


womanly
heart
.
 
she
be
a
widow
,

rather
poor
;
consequently
she
have


see
trouble
enough
to
enable
she
to
feel
for
the
unfortunate
.
 
she


imagine
that
the
demented
boy
have
wander
away
from
his
friend
or


keeper
;
so
she
try
to
find
out
whence
he
have
come
,
in
order
that


she
might
take
measure
to
return
he
;
but
all
her
reference
to


neighbouring
town
and
village
,
and
all
her
inquiry
in
the
same
line


go
for
nothing

the
boy
’s
face
,
and
his
answer
,
too
,
show
that
the


thing
she
be
talk
of
be
not
familiar
to
he
.
 
he
speak
earnestly


and
simply
about
court
matter
,
and
break
down
,
more
than
once
,
when


speak
of
the
late
King
'
his
father
'
;
but
whenever
the
conversation


change
to
baser
topic
,
he
lose
interest
and
become
silent
.




the
woman
be
mightily
puzzle
;
but
she
do
not
give
up
.
 
as
she


proceed
with
her
cooking
,
she
set
herself
to
contrive
device
to


surprise
the
boy
into
betray
his
real
secret
.
 
she
talk
about


cattle
--
he
show
no
concern
;
then
about
sheep
--
the
same
result
:
 
so


her
guess
that
he
have
be
a
shepherd
boy
be
an
error
;
she
talk
about


mill
;
and
about
weaver
,
tinker
,
smith
,
trade
and
tradesman
of
all


sort
;
and
about
Bedlam
,
and
jail
,
and
charitable
retreat

no


matter

she
be
baffle
at
all
point

not
altogether
,
either
;
for
she


argue
that
she
have
narrow
the
thing
down
to
domestic
service

yes
,


she
be
sure
she
be
on
the
right
track

;
he
must
have

up

that
.

the
result
be
discourage

her

add
a

so
remorseful

be
so


kind
to

force
himself
to

the


applause

she
get
out
of
herself
for
her
magnanimous
condescension


to
a
tramp

the
King
be
just
as
self

complacent
over
his
gracious


humility
toward
a
humble
peasant
woman
.




when
breakfast
be
over
,
the
housewife
tell
the
King
to
wash
up
the


dish
.
 
this
command
be
a
staggerer
,
for
a
moment
,
and
the
King
come


near
rebel
;
but
then
he
say
to
himself
,
"
Alfred
the
Great
watch


the
cake
;
doubtless
he
would
have
wash
the
dish
too
--
therefore
will


I
essay
it
.
"




he
make
a
sufficiently
poor
job
of
it
;
and
to
his
surprise
too
,
for
the


cleaning
of
wooden
spoon
and
trencher
have
seem
an
easy
thing
to
do
.


it
be
a
tedious
and
troublesome
piece
of
work
,
but
he
finish
it


at
last
.
 
he
be
become
impatient
to
get
away
on
his
journey
now
;


however
,
he
be
not
to
lose
this
thrifty
dame
’s
society
so
easily
.
 
she


furnish
he
some
little
odd
and
end
of
employment
,
which
he
get


through
with
after
a
fair
fashion
and
with
some
credit
.
 
then
she
set


he
and
the
little
girl
to
pare
some
winter
apple
;
but
he
be
so


awkward
at
this
service
that
she
retire
he
from
it
and
give
he
a


butcher
knife
to
grind
.




afterwards
she
keep
he
card

until
he
begin
to
think
he
have
lay


the
good
King
Alfred
about
far
enough
in
the
shade
for
the
present
in


the
matter
of
showy
menial
heroism
that
would
read
picturesquely
in


story
-
book
and
history
,
and
so
he
be
half
-
minded
to
resign
.
 
and


when
,
just
after
the
noonday
dinner
,
the
goodwife
give
he
a
basket


of
kitten
to
drown
,
he
do
resign
.
 
at
least
he
be
just
go
to


resign
--
for
he
feel
that
he
must
draw
the
line
somewhere
,
and
it


seem
to
he
that
to
draw
it
at
kitten

drowning
be
about
the
right


thing
--
when
there

an
interruption

the
interruption
be
John

with
a

the
front
gate
before
they


have
have
a
chance

so
he
say
nothing
about

the
line
,


but
take
up
his
basket
of
kitten
and
step
quietly
out
the
back
way
,


without
a
word
.
 
he
leave
the
creature
in
an
out

house
,
and
hurry
on
,


into
a

lane

XX

the
Prince
and
the
hermit
.




the
high
hedge
hide
he
from
the
house
,
now
;
and
so
,
under
the
impulse
of


a
deadly
fright
,
he
let
out
all
his
force
and
speed
toward
a
wood
in
the


distance
.
 
he
never
look
back
until
he
have
almost
gain
the
shelter


of
the
forest
;
then
he
turn
and
descry
two
figure
in
the
distance
.


that
be
sufficient
;
he
do
not
wait
to
scan
they
critically
,
but


hurry
on
,
and
never
abate
his
pace
till
he
be
far
within
the


twilight
depth
of
the
wood
.
then
he
stop
;
be
persuade
that
he


be
now
tolerably
safe
.
he
listen
intently
,
but
the
stillness
be


profound
and
solemn
--
awful
,
even
,
and
depress
to
the
spirit
.
 
at


wide
interval
his
strain
ear
do
detect
sound
,
but
they
be
so


remote
,
and
hollow
,
and
mysterious
,
that
they
seem
not
to
be
real


sound
,
but
only
the
moaning
and
complain
ghost
of
depart


one
.
 
so
the
sound
be
yet
more
dreary
than
the
silence
which
they


interrupted
.




it
be
his
purpose
,
in
the
beginning
,
to
stay
where
he
be
the
rest
of


the
day
;
but
a
chill
soon
invade
his
perspiring
body
,
and
he
be
at


last
oblige
to
resume
movement
in
order
to
get
warm
.
he
strike
straight


through
the
forest
,
hope
to
pierce
to
a
road
presently
,
but
he
be


disappointed
in
this
.
 
he
travel
on
and
on
;
but
the
far
he
go
,


the
denser
the
wood
become
,
apparently
.
 
the
gloom
begin
to
thicken
,


by
-
and
-
by
,
and
the
King
realise
that
the
night
be
come
on
.
 
it
make


he
shudder
to
think
of
spend
it
in
such
an
uncanny
place
;
so
he


try
to
hurry
fast
,
but
he
only
make
the
less
speed
,
for
he
could


not
now
see
well
enough
to
choose
his
step
judiciously
;
consequently
he


keep
trip
over
root
and
tangle
himself
in
vine
and
brier
.




and
how
glad
he
be
when
at
last
he
catch
the
glimmer
of
a
light
!
he


approach
it
warily
,
stop
often
to
look
about
he
and
listen
.
 
it


come
from
an
unglazed
window
-
opening
in
a
shabby
little
hut
.
 
he
hear


a
voice
,
now
,
and
feel
a
disposition
to
run
and
hide
;
but
he
change
his


mind
at
once
,
for
this
voice
be
pray
,
evidently
.
 
he
glide
to
the


one
window
of
the
hut
,
raise
himself
on
tiptoe

down

,

bitterness

they
fail

make
no
impression

last
remark

come
as
come
a
reviving
breath
from
fresh

the
dying

he
exert
himself
once
more

the

twice

be
contemptuously
unconscious
of
it
and
indifferent

small
adversary
in
a
fury
.
 
instantly

a
poor
market

the
first

the
little
King

at
graceful
ease
,

catch
and


turn
aside
the
thick
rain
of
blow
with
a
facility

precision

set
the
motley

as
a
result
,
the
storm
of
cheer
and
laughter


that
sweep
the
place
be
something
wonderful
to
hear
.
 
at
the
end
of


fifteen
minute
,
Hugo
,
all
batter
,
bruise
,
and
the
target
for


a
pitiless
bombardment
of
ridicule
,
slunk
from

;
and
the


unscathed
hero
of
the
fight

seize
and
bear
aloft
upon
the


shoulder
of
the
joyous
rabble
to
the
place
of
honour
beside
the


Ruffler
,
where
with
vast
ceremony
he
be
crown
King
of
the
Game
-
Cocks
;


his
meaner
title
be
at
the
same
time
solemnly
cancel
and
annul
,


and
a
decree
of
banishment
from
the
gang
pronounce
against
any
who


should
thenceforth
utter
it
.




all
attempt
to
make
the
King
serviceable
to
the
troop
have
fail
.
he


have
stubbornly
refuse
to
act
;
moreover
,
he
be
always
try
to
escape
.


 
he
have
be
thrust
into
an
unwatched
kitchen
,
the
first
day
of
his


return
;
he
not
only
come
forth
empty
-
handed
,
but
try
to
rouse
the


housemate
.
he
be
send
out
with
a
tinker
to
help
he
at
his
work
;


he
would
not
work
;
moreover
,
he
threaten
the
tinker
with
his
own


soldering
-
iron
;
and
finally
both
Hugo
and
the
tinker
find
their


hand
full
with
the
mere
matter
of
keep
his
from
get
away
.
 
he


deliver
the
thunder
of
his
royalty
upon
the
head
of
all
who
hamper


his
liberty
or
try
to
force
he
to
service
.
 
he
be
send
out
,
in


Hugo
’s
charge
,
in
company
with
a
slatternly
woman
and
a
diseased
baby
,


to
beg
;
but
the
result
be
not
encouraging
--
he
decline
to
plead
for
the


mendicant
,
or
be
a
party
to
their
cause
in
any
way
.




thus
several
day
go
by
;
and
the
misery
of
this
tramping
life
,
and


the
weariness
and
sordidness
and
meanness
and
vulgarity
of
it
,
become


gradually
and
steadily
so
intolerable
to
the
captive
that
he
begin
at


last
to
feel
that
his
release
from
the
hermit
’s
knife
must
prove
only
a


temporary
respite
from
death
,
at
good
.




but
at
night
,
in
his
dream
,
these
thing
be
forget
,
and
he
be


on
his
throne
,
and
master
again
.
 
this
,
of
course
,
intensify
the


suffering
of
the
awakening
--
so
the
mortification
of
each
succeed


morning
of
the
few
that
pass
between
his
return
to
bondage
and
the


combat
with
Hugo
,
grow
bitterer
and
bitterer
,
and
hard
and
hard
to


bear
.




the
morning
after
that
combat
,
Hugo
get
up
with
a
heart
fill
with


vengeful
purpose
against
the
King
.
 
he
have
two
plan
,
in
particular
.


one
be
to
inflict
upon
the
lad
what
would
be
,
to
his
proud
spirit


and
'
imagine
'
royalty
,
a
peculiar
humiliation
;
and
if
he
fail
to


accomplish
this
,
his
other
plan
be
to
put
a
crime
of
some
kind
upon
the


King
,
and
then
betray
he
into
the
implacable
clutch
of
the
law
.




in
pursuance
of
the
first
plan
,
he
purpose
to
put
a
'
clime
'
upon
the


King
’s
leg
;
rightly
judge
that
that
would
mortify
he
to
the
last
and


perfect
degree
;
and
as
soon
as
the
clime
should
operate
,
he
mean
to
get


canty
’s
help
,
and
_
force
_
the
King
to
expose
his
leg
in
the
highway


and
beg
for
alm
.
 
'
Clime
'
be
the
ca
nt
term
for
a
sore
,
artificially


create
.
to
make
a
clime
,
the
operator
make
a
paste
or
poultice
of


unslaked
lime
,
soap
,
and
the
rust
of
old
iron
,
and
spread
it
upon
a


piece
of
leather
,
which
be
then
bind
tightly
upon
the
leg
.
 
this
would


presently
fret
off
the
skin
,
and
make
the
flesh
raw
and
angry
-
look
;


blood
be
then
rub
upon
the
limb
,
which
,
be
fully
dry
,
take
on
a


dark
and
repulsive
colour
.
 
then
a
bandage
of
soiled
rag
be
put
on
in


a
cleverly
careless
way
which
would
allow
the
hideous
ulcer
to
be
see
,


and
move
the
compassion
of
the
passer
-
by
.
{

}




Hugo
get
the
help
of
the
tinker
whom
the
King
have
cow
with
the


soldering
-
iron
;
they
take
the
boy
out
on
a
tinker
tramp
,
and
as
soon


as
they
be
out
of
sight
of
the
camp
they
throw
he
down
and
the
tinker


hold
he
while
Hugo
bind
the
poultice
tight
and
fast
upon
his
leg

the
King
rage
and
storm
,
and
promise
to
hang
the
two
the
moment
the


sceptre
be
in
his
hand
again
;
but
they
keep
a
firm
grip
upon
he


and
enjoy
his
impotent
struggle
and
jeered
at
his
threat
.
 
this


continue
until
the
poultice
begin
to
bite
;
and
in
no
long
time
its
work


would
have
be
perfect
,
if
there
have
be
no
interruption
.
 
but
there


be
;
for
about
this
time
the
'
slave

who
have
make
the
speech

England

law

appear
on
the
scene
,
and
put
an
end
to
the
enterprise
,


and
strip
off
the
poultice
and
bandage
.




the
King
want
to
borrow
his
deliverer
’s
cudgel
and
warm
the
jacket


of
the
two
rascal
on
the
spot
;
but
the
man
say
no
,
it
would
bring


trouble
--
leave
the
matter
till
night
;
the
whole
tribe
be
together
,


then
,
the
outside
world
would
not
venture
to
interfere
or
interrupt
.
 
he


march
the
party
back
to
camp
and
report
the
affair
to
the
Ruffler
,


who
listen
,
ponder
,
and
then
decide
that
the
King
should
not
be


again
detail
to
beg
,
since
it
be
plain
he
be
worthy
of
something


high
and
well
--
wherefore
,
on
the
spot
he
promote
he
from
the


mendicant
rank
and
appoint
he
to
steal
!




Hugo
be
overjoyed
.
 
he
have
already
try
to
make
the
King
steal
,
and


fail
;
but
there
would
be
no
more
trouble
of
that
sort
,
now
,
for
of


course
the
King
would
not
dream
of
defy
a
distinct
command
deliver


directly
from
head
-
quarter
.
 
so
he
plan
a
raid
for
that
very


afternoon
,
purpose
to
get
the
King
in
the
law
’s
grip
in
the
course
of


it
;
and
to
do
it
,
too
,
with
such
ingenious
strategy
,
that
it
should
seem


to
be
accidental
and
unintentional
;
for
the
King
of
the
Game
-
Cocks
be


popular
now
,
and
the
gang
might
not
deal
over
-
gently
with
an
unpopular


member
who
play
so
serious
a
treachery
upon
he
as
the
deliver
he


over
to
the
common
enemy
,
the
law
.




very
well
.
 
all
in
good
time
Hugo
stroll
off
to
a
neighbouring
village


with
his
prey
;
and
the
two
drift
slowly
up
and
down
one
street
after


another
,
the
one
watch
sharply
for
a
sure
chance
to
achieve
his
evil


purpose
,
and
the
other
watch
as
sharply
for
a
chance
to
dart
away
and


get
free
of
his
infamous
captivity
for
ever
.




both
throw
away
some
tolerably
fair
-
look
opportunity
;
for
both
,


in
their
secret
heart
,
be
resolve
to
make
absolutely
sure
work
this


time
,
and
neither
mean
to
allow
his
fevere
desire
to
seduce
he
into


any
venture
that
have
much
uncertainty
about
it
.




Hugo
’s
chance
come
first
.
 
for
at
last
a
woman
approach
who
carry
a


fat
package
of
some
sort
in
a
basket
.
 
Hugo
’s
eye
sparkle
with
sinful


pleasure
as
he
say
to
himself
,
"
breath
o
'
my
life
,
an
'
I
can
but


put
_
that
_
upon
he
,
'
tis
good
-
den
and
God
keep
thee
,
King
of
the


game
-
Cocks
!
"
he
wait
and
watch
--
outwardly
patient
,
but
inwardly


consume
with
excitement
--
till
the
woman
have
pass
by
,
and
the
time


be
ripe
;
then
say
,
in
a
low
voice--




"
tarry
here
till
I
come
again
,
"
and
dart
stealthily
after
the
prey
.




the
King
’s
heart
be
fill
with
joy
--
he
could
make
his
escape
,
now
,
if


Hugo
’s
quest
only
carry
he
far
enough
away
.




but
he
be
to
have
no
such
luck
.
 
Hugo
creep
behind
the
woman
,
snatch


the
package
,
and
came
run
back
,
wrap
it
in
an
old
piece
of


blanket
which
he
carry
on
his
arm
.
 
the
hue
and
cry
be
raise
in
a


moment
,
by
the
woman
,
who
know
her
loss
by
the
lightening
of
her
burden
,


although
she
have
not
see
the
pilfering
do
.
 
Hugo
thrust
the
bundle


into
the
King
’s
hand
without
halt
,
saying--




"
now
speed
ye
after
I
with
the
rest
,
and
cry
'

they
astray

"




the
next
moment
Hugo
turn
a
corner
and
dart
down
a
crooked


alley
--
and
in
another
moment
or
two
he
lounge
into
view
again
,
look


innocent
and
indifferent
,
and
take
up
a
position
behind
a
post
to
watch


result
.




the
insulted
King
throw
the
bundle
on
the
ground
;
and
the
blanket
fall


away
from
it
just

with
one
hand
,
snatch
up
her
bundle


with
the
other
,
and
begin
to
pour
out
a
tirade

struggle


begin
;
but
Hendon
be
soon
overpower
and
drag
away
.
the
King
be


take
also
,
and
both
be
bind
and
lead
to
prison

chapter
XXVII
.
in
Prison
.




the
cell
be
all
crowded
;
so
the
two
friend
be
chain
in
a
large


room
where
person
charge
with
trifling
offence
be
commonly
keep
.


they
have
company
,
for
there
be
some
twenty
manacle
and
fetter


prisoner
here
,
of
both
sex
and
of
vary
ages,--an
obscene
and
noisy


gang
.
 
the
King
chafe
bitterly
over
the
stupendous
indignity
thus
put


upon
his
royalty
,
but
Hendon
be
moody
and
taciturn
.
 
he
be
pretty


thoroughly
bewildered
;
he
have
come
home
,
a
jubilant
prodigal
,
expect


to
find
everybody
wild
with
joy
over
his
return
;
and
instead
have
get
the


cold
shoulder
and
a
jail
.
 
the
promise
and
the
fulfilment
differ
so


widely
that
the
effect
be
stunning
;
he
could
not
decide
whether
it


be
most
tragic
or
most
grotesque
.
 
he
feel
much
as
a
man
might
who
have


dance
blithely
out
to
enjoy
a
rainbow
,
and
got
strike
by
lightning
.




but
gradually
his
confused
and
torment
thought
settle
down
into


some
sort
of
order
,
and
then
his
mind
centre
itself
upon
Edith
.
 
he


turn
her
conduct
over
,
and
examine
it
in
all
light
,
but
he
could
not


make
anything
satisfactory
out
of
it
.
 
do
she
know
he
--
or
do
n’t
she


know
he
?
 
it
be
a
perplexing
puzzle
,
and
occupy
he
a
long
time
;
but


he
end
,
finally
,
with
the
conviction
that
she
do
know
he
,
and
have


repudiate
he
for
interested
reason
.
 
he
want
to
load
her
name
with


curse
now
;
but
this
name
have
so
long
be
sacred
to
he
that
he
find


he
could
not
bring
his
tongue
to
profane
it
.




wrap
in
prison
blanket
of
a
soiled
and
tattered
condition
,
Hendon


and
the
King
pass
a
troubled
night
.
 
for
a
bribe
the
jailer
have


furnish
liquor
to
some
of
the
prisoner
;
singing
of
ribald
song
,


fight
,
shout
,
and
carouse
be
the
natural
consequence
.
 
at
last
,


a
while
after
midnight
,
a
man
attack
a
woman
and
nearly
kill
she
by


beat
she
over
the
head
with
his
manacle
before
the
jailer
could


come
to
the
rescue
.
 
the
jailer
restore
peace
by
give
the
man
a
sound


club
about
the
head
and
shoulder
--
then
the
carousing
cease
;


and
after
that
,
all
have
an
opportunity
to
sleep
who
do
not
mind
the


annoyance
of
the
moaning
and
groaning
of
the
two
wound
people
.




during
the
ensue
week
,
the
day
and
night
be
of
a
monotonous


sameness
as
to

;
man
whose
face
Hendon
remember
more
or
less


distinctly
,
come
,
by
day
,
to
gaze
at
the
'
impostor
'
and
repudiate


and
insult
he
;
and
by
night
the
carousing
and
brawling
go
on
with


symmetrical
regularity
.
 
however
,
there
be
a
change
of
incident
at


last
.
the
jailer
bring
in
an
old
man
,
and
say
to
him--




"

"




Hendon
glance
up
,
and
experience
a
pleasant
sensation
for
the
first


time
since
he
have

.
 
he
say
to

,
"

Yea
,
and
a
dear
and
gracious


little
urchin
be
he
,
too
;
and
whether
he
be
mad
or
no
--
and
they
say
he


mendeth
daily
--
his
praise
be
on
all
man
’s
lip
;
and
all
bless
he
,


likewise
,
and
offer
prayer
that
he
may
be
spare
to
reign
long
in


England
;
for
he
begin
humanely
with
save
the
old
Duke
of
Norfolk
’s


life
,
and
now
be
he
bent
on
destroy
the
cruell
of
the
law
that


harry
and
oppress
the
people
.
"




this
news
strike
his
Majesty
dumb
with
amazement
,
and
plunge
he
into


so
deep
and
dismal
a
reverie
that
he
hear
no
more
of
the
old
man
’s


gossip
.
he
wonder
if
the
'
little
urchin
'
be
the
beggar
-
boy
whom


he
leave
dress
in
his
own
garment
in
the
palace
.
 
it
do
not
seem


possible
that
this
could
be
,
for
surely
his
manner
and
speech
would


betray
he
if
he
pretend
to
be
the
Prince
of
Wales
--
then
he
would
be


drive
out
,
and
search
make
for
the
true
prince
.
 
could
it
be
that
the


Court
have
set
up
some
sprig
of
the
nobility
in
his
place
?
 
no
,
for
his


uncle
would
not
allow
that
--
he
be
all
-
powerful
and
could
and
would


crush
such
a
movement
,
of
course
.
 
the
boy
’s
musing
profit
he


nothing
;
the
more
he
try
to
unriddle
the
mystery
the
more
perplexed
he


become
,
the
more
his
head
ache
,
and
the
bad
he
sleep
.
 
his


impatience
to
get
to
London
grow
hourly
,
and
his
captivity
become
almost


unendurable
.




Hendon
’s
art
all
fail
with
the
King
--
he
could
not
be
comfort
;
but
a


couple
of
woman
who
be
chain
near
he
succeed
well
.
under
their


gentle
ministration
he
find
peace
and
learn
a
degree
of
patience
.


 
he
be
very
grateful
,
and
come
to
love
they
dearly
and
to
delight
in


the
sweet
and
soothe
influence
of
their
presence
.
 
he
ask
they
why


they
be
in
prison
,
and
when
they
say
they
be
Baptists
,
he
smile
,


and
inquired--




"
be
that
a
crime
to
be
shut
up
for
in
a
prison
?
 
now
I
grieve
,
for
I


shall
lose
ye
--
they
will
not
keep
ye
long
for
such
a
little
thing
.
"




they
do
not
answer
;
and
something
in
their
face
make
he
uneasy
.
he


say
,
eagerly--




"
you
do
not
speak
;
be
good
to
I
,
and
tell
I
--
there
will
be
no
other


punishment
?
 
Prithee
tell
I
there
be
no
fear
of
that
.
"




they
try
to
change
the
topic
,
but
his
fear
be
arouse
,
and
he


pursue
it--




"
will
they
scourge
thee
?
 
no
,
no
,
they
would
not
be
so
cruel
!
 
say
they


would
not
.
 
come
,
they
_
will
_
not
,
will
they
?
"




the
woman
betray
confusion
and
distress
,
but
there
be
no
avoid
an


answer
,
so
one
of
they
say
,
in
a
voice
choke
with
emotion--




"
oh
,
thou’lt
break
our
heart
,
thou
gentle
spirit!--God
will
help
we
to


bear
our--
"




"
it
be
a
confession
!
"
the
King
break
in
.
 
"
then
they
_
will
_
scourge


thee
,
the
stony
-
hearted
wretch
!
 
but
oh
,
thou
must
not
weep
,
I
can
not


bear
it
.
 
keep
up
thy
courage
--
I
shall
come
to
my
own
in
time
to
save


thee
from
this
bitter
thing
,
and
I
will
do
it
!
"




when
the
King
awake
in
the
morning
,
the
woman
be
go
.




"
they
be
save

"
he
say
,
joyfully
;
then
add
,
despondently
,
"
but
woe


be
me!--for
they
be
my
comforter
.
"




each
of
they
have
leave
a
shred
of
ribbon
pin
to
his
clothing
,
in
token


of
remembrance
.
 
he
say
he
would
keep
these
thing
always
;
and
that


soon
he
would
seek
out
these
dear
good
friend
of
his
and
take
they


under
his
protection
.




just
then
the
jailer
come
in
with
some
subordinate
,
and
command
that


the
prisoner

yard
.
 
the
King
be
overjoyed
--
it


would
be
a
blessed
thing
to
see
the
blue
sky
and
breathe
the
fresh
air


once
more
.
 
he
fret
and
chafe
at
the
slowness
of
the
officer
,
but


his
turn
come
at

,
and
he

through
a
massive
archway
of
masonry

it
be
a
chill
and
lower
morning
,
and
a
light
snow
which


have
fall
during
the
night
whiten
the
great
empty
space
and
add


to
the
general
dismalness
of
its
aspect
.
now
and
then
a
wintry
wind


shiver
through

he
shudder
,

say
to
himself
,
"
alack
,
they
be
not

I
,

look
on

heavy
reckoning
for
this
work

,
as
if

he
go
?


powerful
help
must
be
find
somewhere
,
or
he
must
relinquish
his


inheritance
and
remain
under
the
imputation
of
be
an
impostor


besides
.
 
where
could
he
hope
to
find
this
powerful
help
?
 
where
,


indeed
!
 
it
be
a
knotty
question
.
by
-
and
-
by
a
thought
occur
to
he


which
point
to
a
possibility
--
the
slenderest
of
slender
possibility
,


certainly
,
but
still
worth
consider
,
for
lack
of
any
other
that


promise
anything
at
all
.
 
he
remember
what
old
Andrews
have
say
about


the
young
King
’s
goodness
and
his
generous
championship
of
the
wrong


and
unfortunate
.
 
why
not
go
and
try
to
get
speech
of
he
and
beg
for


justice
?
 
ah
,
yes
,
but
could
so
fantastic
a
pauper
get
admission
to
the


august
presence
of
a
monarch
?
never
mind
--
let
that
matter
take
care
of


itself
;
it
be
a
bridge
that
would
not
need
to
be
cross
till
he
should


come
to
it
.
 
he
be
an
old
campaigner
,
and
use
to
invent
shift
and


expedient
:
 
no
doubt
he
would
be
able
to
find
a
way
.
 
yes
,
he
would


strike
for
the
capital
.
maybe
his
father
’s
old
friend
Sir
Humphrey


Marlow
would
help
him--‘good
old
Sir
Humphrey
,
Head
Lieutenant
of
the


late
King
’s
kitchen
,

,
or
something’--mile
could
not
remember


just
what
or
which
.
 
now
that
he
have
something
to
turn
his
energy
to
,


a
distinctly
define
object
to
accomplish
,
the
fog
of
humiliation
and


depression
which
have
settle
down
upon
his
spirit
lift
and
blow
away
,


and
he
raise
his
head
and
look
about
he
.
 
he
be
surprised
to
see


how
far
he
have
come
;
the
village
be
away
behind

.
 
the
King
be

along
in
his

with

would
the

during

the

ask
;

the


King
give
no
sign
,
and
the
accuse
voice
that
go
moan
through
his


comfortless
breast
be
all
the
sound
he
hear
.




by
-
and
-
by
the
gladness
in
the
face
of
the
populace
change
a
little
,


and
became
touch
with
a
something
like
solicitude
or
anxiety
:
 
an


abatement
in
the
volume
of
the
applause
be
observable
too
.
 
the
Lord


Protector
be
quick
to
notice
these
thing
:
 
he
be
as
quick
to
detect


the
cause
.
 
he
spur
to
the
King
’s
side
,
bend
low
in
his
saddle
,


uncover
,
and
said--




"
my
liege
,
it
be
an
ill
time
for
dream
.
 
the
people
observe
thy


downcast
head
,
thy
clouded
mien
,
and
they
take
it
for
an
oman
.
 
be


advise
:
 
unveil
the
sun
of
royalty
,
and
let
it
shine
upon
these
boding


vapour
,
and
disperse
they
.
 
lift
up
thy
face
,
and
smile
upon
the


people
.
"




so
say
,
the
Duke
scatter
a
handful
of
coin
to
right
and
leave
,
then


retire
to
his
place
.
 
the
mock
King
do
mechanically
as
he
have
be


bid
.
 
his
smile
have
no
heart
in
it
,
but
few
eye
be
near
enough


or
sharp
enough
to
detect
that
.
 
the
nodding
of
his
plume
head
as
he


salute
his
subject
be
full
of
grace
and
graciousness
;
the
largess


which
he
deliver
from
his
hand
be
royally
liberal
:
 
so
the
people
’s


anxiety
vanish
,
and
the
acclamation
burst
forth
again
in
as
mighty
a


volume
as
before
.




still
once
more
,
a
little
before
the
progress
be

,
the
Duke
be


oblige
to
ride
forward
,
and
make
remonstrance

He
whispered--

then

the
gorgeous
figure
turn
a
lustreless
eye
upon
the
Duke
,
and
say
in
a


dead
voice--




"

give
this
command

with
the
easy
manner

one
accustomed
to
do
such
thing
:

"




all
the
company
wonder
at
this
speech
,

wonder
still
more
to
see


the
little
mendicant

out
this
peer
without
hesitancy

apparent


fear

such
a

a
movement
as
if

go

quickly


recover
his
tranquil
attitude

his
blunder

a
blush

upon

his

perceptible
,

steady

persistent

component
of
one
splendid
cluster
fall
away

themselves
to
another

a
movement

little
by
little
,
in
the


present
case
,
dissolve
the
glitter
crowd
that
stand
about
Tom

it
together

almost
alone

a
profound
hush

Miles
Hendon
be
picturesque
enough
before
he
get
into
the
riot
on


London
Bridge
--
he
be
more
so
when
he
get
out

it

he

little


money

in

none
at
all
when

have


strip
he
of
his
last
farthing
.




but
no
matter
,
so
he
find
his
boy
.
 
be
a
soldier
,
he
do
not
go
at


his
task
in
a
random
way
,
but
set
to
work
,
first
of
all
,
to
arrange
his


campaign
.




what
would
the
boy
naturally
do
?
 
where
would
he
naturally
go
?


well
--
argue
Miles
--
he
would
naturally
go
to
his
former
haunt
,
for
that


be
the
instinct
of
unsound
mind
,
when
homeless
and
forsaken
,
as
well


as
of
sound
one
.
 
Whereabouts
be
his
former
haunt
?
 
his
rag
,


take
together
with
the
low
villain
who
seem
to
know
he
and
who
even


claim
to
be
his
father
,
indicate
that
his
home
be
in
one
or
another


of
the
poor
and
mean
district
of
London
.
 
would
the
search
for


he
be
difficult
,
or
long
?
 
no
,
it
be
likely
to
be
easy
and
brief
.
 
he


would
not
hunt
for
the
boy
,
he
would
hunt
for
a
crowd
;
in
the
centre
of


a
big
crowd
or
a
little
one
,
soon
or
later
,
he
should
find
his
poor


little
friend
,
sure
;
and
the
mangy
mob
would
be
entertain
itself


with
pestering
and
aggravate
the
boy
,
who
would
be
proclaim
himself


King
,
as
usual
.
 
then
Miles
Hendon
would
cripple
some
of
those
people
,


and
carry
off
his
little
ward
,
and
comfort
and
cheer
he
with
love


word
,
and
the
two
would
never
be
separate
any
more
.




so
Miles
start
on
his
quest
.
 
Hour
after
hour
he
tramp
through
back


alley
and
squalid
street
,
seek
group
and
crowd
,
and
find
no


end
of
they
,
but
never
any
sign
of
the
boy
.
 
this
greatly
surprise
he
,


but
do
not
discourage
he
.
 
to
his
notion
,
there
be
nothing
the
matter


with
his
plan
of
campaign
;
the
only
miscalculation
about
it
be
that
the


campaign
be
become
a
lengthy
one
,
whereas
he
have
expect
it
to
be


short
.




when
daylight
arrive
,
at
last
,
he
have
make
many
a
mile
,
and
canvass


many
a
crowd
,
but
the
only
result
be
that
he
be
tolerably
tired
,


rather
hungry
and
very
sleepy
.
 
he
want
some
breakfast
,
but
there
be


no
way
to
get
it
.
 
to
beg
for
it
do
not
occur
to
he
;
as
to
pawn


his
sword
,
he
would
as
soon
have
think
of
part
with
his
honour
;


he
could
spare
some
of
his
clothe
--
yes
,
but
one
could
as
easily
find
a


customer
for
a
disease
as
for
such
clothe
.




at
noon
he
be
still
tramp
--
among
the
rabble
which
follow
after


the
royal
procession
,
now
;
for
he
argue
that
this
regal
display
would


attract
his
little
lunatic
powerfully
.
 
he
follow
the
pageant
through


all
its
devious
winding
about
London
,
and
all
the
way
to
Westminster


and
the
Abbey
.
 
he
drift
here
and
there
amongst
the
multitude


that
be
mass
in
the
vicinity
for
a
weary
long
time
,
baffle
and


perplexed
,
and
finally
wander
off
,
think
,
and
try
to
contrive


some
way
to
better
his
plan
of
campaign
.
 
by
-
and
-
by
,
when
he
come
to


himself
out
of
his
musing
,
he
discover
that
the
town
be
far
behind


he
and
that
the
day
be
grow
old
.
 
he
be
near
the
river
,
and
in
the


country
;
it
be
a
region
of
fine
rural
seat
--
not
the
sort
of
district


to
welcome
clothe
like
his
.




it
be
not
at
all
cold
;
so
he
stretch
himself
on
the
ground
in
the
lee


of
a
hedge
to
rest
and
think
.
 
Drowsiness
presently
begin
to
settle
upon


his
sense
;
the
faint
and
far
-
off
boom
of
cannon
be
waft
to
his
ear
,


and
he
say
to
himself
,
"
the
new
King
be
crown
,
"
and
straightway
fall


asleep
.
 
he
have
not
sleep
or
rest
,
before
,
for
more
than
thirty
hour
.


he
do
not
wake
again
until
near
the
middle
of
the
next
morning
.




he
get
up
,
lame
,
stiff
,
and
half
famish
,
wash
himself
in
the
river
,


stay
his
stomach
with
a
pint
or
two
of
water
,
and
trudge
off
toward


westminster
,
grumble
at
himself
for
having
waste
so
much
time
.


 
Hunger
help
he
to
a
new
plan
,
now
;
he
would
try
to
get
speech
with


old
Sir
Humphrey
Marlow
and
borrow
a
few
mark
,
and
--
but
that
be
enough


of
a
plan
for
the
present
;
it
would
be
time
enough
to
enlarge
it
when


this
first
stage
should
be
accomplish
.




toward
eleven
o’clock
he
approach
the
palace
;
and
although
a
host
of


showy
people
be
about
he
,
move
in
the
same
direction
,
he
be
not


inconspicuous
--
his
costume
take
care
of
that
.
 
he
watch
these
people
’s


face
narrowly
,
hope
to
find
a
charitable
one
whose
possessor
might


be
willing
to
carry
his
name
to
the
old
lieutenant
--
as
to
try
to
get


into
the
palace
himself
,
that
be
simply
out
of
the
question
.




presently

he
,
then
wheel
about
and
scan

his
breath
away!--He

so
,

his

be
spare
he
should
continue
to


tell
the
story

remind
that

so
they
salute
,

get
his
kindly
smile
in

More
than
once
,
when
some
great
dignitary
,
some
gilded
vassal


of
the
crown
,
make
argument
against
his
leniency
,
and
urge
that
some


law
which
he
be
bent
upon
amend
be
gentle
enough
for
its
purpose
,


and
work
no

any
one
need
mightily

the
young
King
turn
the
mournful
eloquence
of
his
great
compassionate


eye
upon

answered--




"
what
dost

singularly
merciful
one

now
that
