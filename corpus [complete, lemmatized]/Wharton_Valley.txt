1.1
.




it
be
very
still
in
the
small
neglect
chapel
.
the
noise
of
the
farm


come
faintly
through
closed
door
--
voice
shout
at
the
oxen
in
the


low
field
,
the
querulous
bark
of
the
old
house
-
dog
,
and
Filomena
's


angry
call
to
the
little
white
-
faced
foundling
in
the
kitchen
.




the
February
day
be
close
,
and
a
ray
of
sunshine
,
slant
through
a


slit
in
the
chapel
wall
,
bring
out
the
vision
of
a
pale
haloed
head


float
against
the
dusky
background
of
the
chancel
like
a
water
-
lily


on
its
leaf
.
the
face
be
that
of
the
saint
of
Assisi
--
a
sink
ravage


countenance
,
light
with
an
ecstasy
of
suffering
that
seem
not
so
much
to


reflect
the
anguish
of
the
Christ
at
whose
foot
the
saint
kneel
,
as
the


mute
pain
of
all
poor
down
-
trodden
folk
on
earth
.




when
the
small
Odo
Valsecca
--
the
only
frequenter
of
the
chapel
--
have
be


taunt
by
the
farmer
's
wife
for
be
a
beggar
's
brat
,
or
when
his
ear


be
tingle
from
the
heavy
hand
of
the
farmer
's
son
,
he
find
a


melancholy
kinship
in
that
suffering
face
;
but
since
he
have
fight


blood
in
he
too
,
come
on
the
mother
's
side
of
the
rude
piedmontese


stock
of
the
Marquesses
di
Donnaz
,
there
be
other
mood
when
he
turn


instead
to
the
stout
Saint
George
in
gold
armour
,
just
discernible


through
the
grime
and
dust
of
the
opposite
wall
.




the
chapel
of
Pontesordo
be
indeed
as
wonderful
a
storybook
as
fate


ever
unrolled
before
the
eye
of
a
neglect
and
solitary
child
.
for
a


hundred
year
or
more
Pontesordo
,
a
fortified
manor
of
the
duke
of


Pianura
,
have
be
use
as
a
farmhouse
;
and
the
chapel
be
never
open


save
when
,
on
Easter
Sunday
,
a
priest
come
from
the
town
to
say
mass
.
at


other
time
it
stood
abandon
,
cobwebs
curtain
the
narrow
window
,


farm
tool
lean
against
the
wall
,
and
the
dust
deep
on
the
sea
-
god


and
acanthus
volute
of
the
altar
.
the
manor
of
Pontesordo
be
very
old
.


the
country
people
say
that
the
great
warlock
Virgil
,
whose


dwell
-
place
be
at
Mantua
,
have
once
shut
himself
up
for
a
year
in
the


topmost
chamber
of
the
keep
,
engage
in
unholy
research
;
and
another


legend
relate
that
Alda
,
wife
of
an
early
lord
of
Pianura
,
have
throw


herself
from
its
battlement
to
escape
the
pursuit
of
the
terrible


Ezzelino
.
the
chapel
adjoin
this
keep
,
and
Filomena
,
the
farmer
's


wife
,
tell
Odo
that
it
be
even
old
than
the
tower
and
that
the
wall


have
be
paint
by
early
martyr
who
have
conceal
themselves
there


from
the
persecution
of
the
pagan
emperor
.




on
such
question
a
child
of
Odo
's
age
could
obviously
have
no


pronounce
opinion
,
the
less
so
as
Filomena
's
fact
varied
accord
to


the
season
or
her
mood
,
so
that
on
a
day
of
east
wind
or
when
the
worm


be
not
hatch
well
,
she
have
be
know
to
affirm
that
the
pagan
have


paint
the
chapel
under
Virgil
's
instruction
,
to
commemorate
the


christian
they
have
torture
.
in
spite
of
the
distance
to
which
these


conflicting
statement
seem
to
relegate
they
,
Odo
somehow
feel
as


though
these
pale
strange
people
--
youth
with
ardent
face
under
their


small
round
cap
,
damsel
with
wheat
-
colour
hair
and
boy
no
big


than
himself
,
hold
spot
dog
in
leash
--
be
young
and
near
to


he
than
the
dweller
on
the
farm
:
jacopone
the
farmer
,
the
shrill


Filomena
,
who
be
Odo
's
foster
-
mother
,
the
hulk
bully
their
son
and


the
abate
who
once
a
week
come
out
from
Pianura
to
give
Odo
religious


instruction
and
who
dismiss
his
question
with
the
invariable


exhortation
not
to
pry
into
matter
that
be
beyond
his
year
.
Odo
have


love
the
picture
in
the
chapel
all
the
well
since
the
abate
,
with
a


shrug
,
have
tell
he
they
be
nothing
but
old
rubbish
,
the
work
of
the


barbarian
.




life
at
Pontesordo
be
in
truth
not
very
pleasant
for
an
ardent
and


sensitive
little
boy
of
nine
,
whose
remote
connection
with
the
reigning


line
of
Pianura
do
not
preserve
he
from
wear
torn
clothe
and


eat
black
bread
and
bean
out
of
an
earthen
bowl
on
the
kitchen


doorstep
.




"
go
ask
your
mother
for
new
clothe

"
Filomena
would
snap
at
he
,
when


his
toe
come
through
his
shoe
and
the
rent
in
his
jacket

spread

and

would


add
with
a
coarse
laugh
:

that

discalce

"




it
be
after
such
a
scene
that
the
beggar
-
noble
,
as
they
call
he
at


Pontesordo
,
would
steal
away
to
the
chapel
and
,
seat
himself
on
an


upturned
basket
or
a
heap
of
pumpkin
,
gaze
long
into
the
face
of
the


mournful
saint
.




there
be
nothing
unusual
in
Odo
's
lot
.
it
be
that
of
many
child
in


the
eighteenth
century
,
especially
those
whose
parent
be
cadet
of


noble
house
,
with
an
appanage
barely
sufficient
to
keep
their
wife
and


themselves
in
court
finery
,
much
less
to
pay
their
debt
and
clothe
and


educate
their
child
.
all
over
Italy
at
that
moment
,
have
Odo
Valsecca


but
know
it
,
be
lad
whose
ancestor
,
like
his
own
,
have
be
duke


and
crusader
,
but
who
,
none
the
less
,
be
fare
,
as
he
fare
,
on


black
bread
and
hard
blow
,
and
the
half
-
comprehend
taunt
of
unpaid


foster
-
parent
.
many
,
doubtless
,
there
be
who
care
little
enough
,
as


long
as
they
might
play
morro
with
the
farmer
's
lad
and
ride
the
colt


bare
-
back
through
the
pasture
and
go
bird
-
net
and
frog
-
hunting
with


the
village
child
;
but
some
perhaps
,
like
Odo
,
suffer
in
a
dumb


animal
way
,
without
understand
why
life
be
so
hard
on
little
boy
.




Odo
,
for
his
part
,
have
small
taste
for
the
sport
in
which
Gianozzo
and


the
village
lad
take
pleasure
.
he
shrink
from
any
amusement
associate


with
the
frightening
or
hurting
of
animal
,
and
his
bosom
swell
with


the
fine
gentleman
's
scorn
of
the
clown
who
get
their
fun
in
so
coarse


a
way
.
now
and
then
he
find
a
moment
's
glee
in
a
sharp
tussle
with
one


of
the
young
child
who
have
be
torment
a
frog
or
a
beetle
;
but


he
be
still
too
young
for
real
fighting
,
and
could
only
hang
on
the


outskirt
when
the
big
boy
close
,
and
think
how
some
day
he
would


be
at
they
and
break
their
lubberly
head
.
there
be
thus
many
hour


when
he
turn
to
the
silent
consolation
of
the
chapel
.
so
familiar
have


he
grow
with
the
image
on
its
wall
that
he
have
a
name
for
every
one
:


the
King
,
the
Knight
,
the
Lady
,
the
child
with
guinea
-
pig
,
basilisk


and
leopard
,
and
lastly
the
Friend
,
as
he
call
Saint
Francis
.
an


almond
-
face
lady
on
a
white
palfrey
with
gold
trapping
represent
his


mother
,
whom
he
have
see
too
seldom
for
any
distinct
image
to
interfere


with
the
illusion
;
a
knight
in
damascened
armour
and
scarlet
cloak
be


the
valiant
captain
,
his
father
,
who
hold
a
commission
in
the
ducal


army
;
and
a
proud
young
man
in
diadem
and
ermine
,
attend
by
a
retinue


of
page
,
stand
for
his
cousin
,
the
reign
Duke
of
Pianura
.




a
mist
,
as
usual
at
that
hour
,
be
rise
from
the
marsh
between


Pontesordo
and
Pianura
,
and
the
light
soon
ebb
from
the
saint
's
face
,


leave
the
chapel
in
obscurity
.
Odo
have
creep
there
that
afternoon
with


a
keener
sense
than
usual
of
the
fact
that
life
be
hard
on
little
boy
;


and
though
he
be
cold
and
hungry
and
half
afraid
,
the
solitude
in
which


he
cower
seem
more
endurable
than
the
noisy
kitchen
where
,
at
that


hour
,
the
farm
hand
be
gather
for
their
polenta
,
and
Filomena
be


scream
at
the
frightened
orphan
who
carry
the
dish
to
the
table
.


he
know
,
of
course
,
that
life
at
Pontesordo
would
not
last
for


ever
--
that
in
time
he
would
grow
up
and
be
mysteriously
transform
into


a
young
gentleman
with
a
sword
and
laced
coat
,
who
would
go
to
court
and


perhaps
be
an
officer
in
the
Duke
's
army
or
in
that
of
some
neighbouring


prince
;
but
,
view
from
the
lowliness
of
his
nine
year
,
that
dazzle


prospect
be
too
remote
to
yield
much
solace
for
the
cuff
and
sneer
,


the
ragged
shoe
and
sour
bread
of
the
present
.
the
fog
outside
have


thicken
,
and
the
face
of
Odo
's

eye


of

little
boy

unexpectedly

from

solitude

know
that

Duke

vaguely
imagine
that
his


father

death
must
have
plunge
its
huge
precinct
into
silence

beautiful

he
sometimes
do
at
the
music
of
the
Easter


mass
,

at

scent
of
the
orange

blossom
and
the
bright
colour


of
the
flower

the
Duchess
's
apartment
,
where
the
court
play


lansquenet
after
dinner
;
the
door
of
her
Highness
's
closet
be
throw


open
,
and
Odo
,
now
glad
enough
to
cling
to
his
mother
's
hand
,
find


himself
in
a
tall
room
,
with
god
and
goddess
in
the
cloud
overhead


and
personage
as
supra
-
terrestrial
seat
in
gilt
armchair
about
a


smoke
brazi
.
before
one
of
these
,
to
whom
Donna
Laura
sweep


successive
curtsy
in
advance
,
the
frightened
cavaliere
find
himself


drag
with
his
sword
between
his
leg
.
he
duck
his
head
like
the
old


drake
diving
for
worm
in
the
puddle
at
the
farm
,
and
when
at
last
he


dare
look
up
,
it
be
to
see
an
odd
sallow
face
,
half
-
smother
in
an


immense
wig
,
bow
back
at
he
with
infinite
ceremony
--
and
Odo
's
heart


sink
to
think
that
this
be
his
sovereign
.




the
Duke
be
in
fact
a
sickly
narrow
-
face
young
man
with
thick


obstinate
lip
and
a
slight
lameness
that
make
his
walk
ungainly
;
but


though
no
way
resemble
the
ermine
-
cloak
king
of
the
chapel
at


Pontesordo
,
he
yet
know
how
to
put
on
a
certain
majesty
with
his
state


wig
and
his
order
.
as
for
the
newly
married
Duchess
,
who
sit
at
the


other
end
of
the
cabinet
caress
a
toy
spaniel
,
she
be
scant
fourteen


and
look
a
mere
child
in
her
great
hoop
and
jewel
stomacher
.
she


wonderful
fair
hair
,
draw
over
a
cushion
and
lightly
powdered
,
be


twist
with
pearl
and
rose
,
and
her
cheek
excessively
rouge
,
in
the


french
fashion
;
so
that
as
she
arise
on
the
approach
of
the
visitor
she


look
to
Odo
for
all
the
world
like
the
wooden
Virgin
hang
with
votive


offering
in
the
parish
church
at
Pontesordo
.
though
they
be
but
three


month
marry
the
Duke
,
it
be
rumour
,
be
never
with
she
,
prefer


the
company
of
the
young
Marquess
of
Cerveno
,
his
cousin
and


heir
-
presumptive
,
a
pale
boy
scent
with
musk
and
paint
like
a


comedian
,
whom
his
Highness
would
never
suffer
away
from
he
and
who
now


lean
with
an
impertinent
air
against
the
back
of
the
ducal
armchair
.




on
the
other
side
of
the
brazi
sit
the
dowager
Duchess
,
the
Duke
's


grandmother
,
an
old
lady
so
high
and
forbid
of
aspect
that
Odo
cast


but
one
look
at
her
face
,
which
be
yellow
and
wrinkle
as
a
medlar
,
and


surmount
,
in
the
spanish
style
,
with
black
veil
and
a
high
coif
.
what


these
alarming
personage
say
and
do
,
the
child
could
never
recall
;


nor
be
his
own
action
clear
to
he
,
except
for
a
furtive
caress
that


he
remember
give
the
spaniel
as
he
kiss
the
Duchess
's
hand
;


whereupon
her
Highness
snatch
up
the
pampered
animal
and
walk
away


with
a
pout
of
anger
.
Odo
notice
that
her
angry
look
follow
he
as
he


and
Donna
Laura
withdraw
;
but
the
next
moment
he
hear
the
Duke
's
voice


and
see
his
Highness
limp
after
they
.




"
you
must
have
a
fur
cloak
for
your
journey
,
cousin
,
"
say
he


awkwardly
,
press
something
in
the
hand
of
Odo
's
mother
,
who
break


into
fresh
compliment
and
curtsy
,
while
the
Duke
,
with
a
finger
on


his
thick
lip
,
withdraw
hastily
into
the
closet
.




the
next
morning
early
they
set
out
on
their
journey
.
there
have
be


frost
in
the
night
and
a
cold
sun
sparkle
on
the
palace
window
and
on


the
marble
church
-
front
as
their
carriage
lumber
through
the
street
,


now
full
of
noise
and
animation
.
it
be
Odo
's
first
glimpse
of
the
town


by
daylight
,
and
he
clap
his
hand
with
delight
at
sight
of
the


people
pick
their
way
across
the
reek
gutter
,
the
ass
laden


with
milk
and
vegetable
,
the
servant
-
girl
bargaining
at
the


provision
-
stall
,
the
shop
-
keeper
'
wife
go
to
mass
in
patten
and


hood
,
with
scaldini
in
their
muff
,
the
dark
recess
opening
in
the


palace
basement
,
where
fruit
seller
,
wine
-
merchant
and
coppersmith


display
their
ware
,
the
pedlar
hawk
book
and
toy
,
and
here
and


there
a
gentleman
in
a
sedan
chair
return
flush
and
disorder
from


a
night
at
bassett
or
faro
.
the
travel
-
carriage
be
escort
by


half
-
a
-
dozen
of
the
Duke
's
trooper
and
Don
Lelio
ride
at
the
door


follow
by
two
groom
.
he
wear
a
furred
coat
and
boot
,
and
never
,
to


Odo
,
have
he
appear
more
proud
and
splendid
;
but
Donna
Laura
have
hardly


a
word
for
he
,
and
he
ride
with
the
set
air
of
a
man
who
acquit


himself
of
a
troublesome
duty
.




outside
the
gate
the
spectacle
seem
tame
in
comparison
;
for
the
road


bent
toward
Pontesordo
,
and
Odo
be
familiar
enough
with
the
look
of
the


bare
field
,
set
here
and
there
with
oak
-
copse
to
which
the
leave


still
clung
.
as
the
carriage
skirt
the
marsh
his
mother
raise
the


window
,
exclaim
that
they
must
not
expose
themselves
to
the


pestilent
air
;
and
though
Odo
be
not
yet
addict
to
general


reflection
,
he
could
not
but
wonder
that
she
should
display
such
dread


of
an
atmosphere
she
have
let
he
breathe
since
his
birth
.
he
know
of


course
that
the
sunset
vapour
on
the
marsh
be
unhealthy
:
everybody
on


the
farm
have
a
touch
of
the
ague
,
and
it
be
a
saying
in
the
village


that
no
one
live
at
Pontesordo
who
could
buy
an
ass
to
carry
he
away
;


but
that
Donna
Laura
,
in
skirt
the
place
on
a
clear
morning
of
frost
,


should
show
such
fear
of
infection
,
give
a
sinister
emphasis
to
the


ill
-
repute
of
the
region
.




the
thought
,
he
know
not
why
,
turn
his
mind
to
Momola
,
who
often
on


damp
evening
sit
shake
and
burn
in
the
kitchen
corner
.
he


reflect
with
a
pang
that
he
might
never
see
she
again
,
and
lean


forward
he
strain
his
eye
for
a
glimpse
of
Pontesordo
.
they
be


pass
through
a
patch
of
oak
;
but
where
these
end
the
country


open
,
and
beyond
a
belt
of
osier
and
the
mottled
fade
stretch
of


the
marsh
the
keep
stand
up
like
a
beckon
finger
.
Odo
cry
out
as


though
in
answer
to
its
call
;
but
that
moment
the
road
turn
a
knoll


and
bend
across
rise
ground
toward
an
unfamiliar
region
.




"
thank
God
!
"
cry
his
mother
,
lower
the
window
,
"
we
be
rid
of
that


poison
and
can
breath
the
air
.
"




as
the
keep
vanish
Odo
reproached
himself
for
not
having
beg
a
pair


of
shoe
for
Momola
.
he
have
feel
very
sorry
for
she
since
the
hunchback


have
speak
so
strangely
of
life
at
the
foundling
hospital
;
and
he
have
a


sudden
vision
of
her
bare
foot
,
pinch
with
cold
and
cut
with
the


pebble
of
the
yard
,
perpetually
run
across
the
damp
stone
floor
,


with
Filomena
cry
after
she
:
"
Hasten
then
,
child
of
iniquity
!
you


be
slow
than
a
day
without
bread
!
"
he
have
almost
resolve
to
speak
of


the
foundling
to
his
mother
,
who
still
seem
in
a
condescend
humour
;


but
his
attention
be
unexpectedly
distract
by
a
troop
of
Egyptians
,


who
come
along
the
road
lead
a
dancing
bear
;
and
hardly
have
these


pass
when
the
chariot
of
an
itinerant
dentist
engage
he
.
the
whole


way
,
indeed
,
be
alive
with
such
surprise
;
and
at
Valsecca
,
where
they


dine
,
they
find
the
yard
of
the
inn
crowd
with
the
sumpt
-
mule
and


servant
of
a
cardinal
travel
to
Rome
,
who
be
to
lie
there
that


night
and
whose
bedstead
and
saucepan
have
precede
he
.




here
,
after
dinner
,
Don
Lelio
take
leave
of
Odo
's
mother
,
with
small


show
of
regret
on
either
side
;
the
lady
high
and
sarcastic
,
the


gentleman
sullen
and
polite
;
and
both
,
as
it
seem
,
easy
when
the


business
be
despatch
and
the
Count
's
foot
in
the
stirrup
.
he
have
so


far
take
little
notice
of
Odo
,
but
he
now
bend
from
the
saddle
and


tap
the
boy
's
cheek
,
say
in
his
cold
way
:
"
in
a
few
year
I
shall


see
you
at
court
;
"
and
with
that
ride
away
toward
Pianura
.






1.4
.




lie
that
night
at
Pavia
,
the
traveller
set
forward
next
morning
for


the
city
of
Vercelli
.
the
road
,
though
it
run
for
the
most
part
through


flat
mulberry
orchard
and
rice
-
field
reflect
the
pale
blue
sky
in


their
sodden
channel
,
would
yet
have
appear
divert
enough
to
Odo
,


have
his
mother
be
in
the
mood
to
reply
to
his
question
;
for
whether


their
carriage
overtake
a
party
of
stroll
juggler
,
travel
in
a


roof
-
in
waggon
,
with
the
young
child
of
the
company
run


alongside
in
threadbare
tight
and
trunkhose
deck
with
tinsel
;
or


whether
they
drive
through
a
village
market
-
place
,
where
yellow
earthen


crock
and
gaudy
indian
cotton
,
brass
pail
and
brazier
and
platter


of
bluish
pewter
,
fill
the
stall
with
a
medley
of
colour
--
at
every


turn
be
something
that
excite
the
boy
's
wonder
;
but
Donna
Laura
,
who


have
fall
into
a
depression
of
spirit
,
lament
the
cold
,
she


misfortune
and
the
discomfort
of
the
journey
,
be
at
no
more
pain
than


the
abate
to
satisfy
the
prompting
of
his
curiosity
.




Odo
have
indeed
meet
but
one
person
who
care
to
listen
to
he
,
and
that


be
the
strange
hunchback
who
have
call
himself
Brutus
.
remember
how


entertainingly
this
odd
guide
have
explain
all
the
wonder
of
the
ducal


ground
,
Odo
begin
to
regret
that
he
have
not
ask
his
mother
to
let
he


have
Brutus
for
a
body
-
servant
.
meanwhile
no
one
attend
to
his


question
and
the
hour
be
begin
to
seem
long
when
,
on
the
third


day
,
they
set
out
from
Vercelli
toward
the
hill
.
the
cold
increase
as


they
rise
;
and
Odo
,
though
he
have
often
wish
to
see
the
mountain
,
be


yet
dismay
at
the
gloomy
and
menacing
aspect
of
the
region
on
which


they
be
enter
.
leafless
wood
,
prodigious
boulder
and
white


torrent
foam
and
roaring
seem
a
poor
exchange
for
the


pleasantly
-
order
garden
of
Pianura
.
here
be
no
violet
and
cowslip


in
bloom
;
hardly
a
green
blade
pierce
the
sodden
roadside
,
and


snowdrift
linger
in
the
shade
hollow
.




Donna
Laura
's
loudly
express
fear
of
robber
seem
to
increase
the


loneliness
of
the
way

down

down

from
this
point
of
observation
the

odo
of
the
narrow
elongate
saint
squeeze
into
the
niche
of
a


church

the
old
Marchioness

the
high
coif

of
the


previous
century

the

,

Odo
afterwards

,

canonesse
of

conventual
dress

none

when
the


Marquess
address
they
.




their
timidity
appear
to
infect
Odo
's
mother
,
who
,
from
her
habitual


volubility
of
temper
,
sink
to
a
mood
of
like
submissiveness
.
a
supper
of


venison
and
goat
's
cheese

not
design
to
restore
her
spirit
,

when
at
length
she
and
Odo
have
withdraw
to
their
cavernous
bedchamber
,


she
fling
herself
weep
on
the
bed
and
declare
she
must
die
if
she


remain
long
in
this
prison
.




fall
asleep
under
such
influence
,
it
be
the
more
wonderful
to
Odo


to
wake
with
the
sun
on
his
counterpane
,
a
sweet
noise
of
stream


through
the
casement
and
the
joyous
barking
of
hound
in
the
castle


court
.
from
the
window
-
seat
he
look
out
on

extraordinarily


novel

eye

its

pasture
slope


pleasantly
under
walnut
tree
,
with
here
and
there
a
clearing
plough


for
the
spring
crop

a
snowpeak
;
and
,
as
if
to


lend
a
human
interest
to
the
scene
,
the
old
Marquess
,
his
flintlock
on


his
shoulder
,
his
dog
and
beater
at
his
heel
,
now
ride
across
the


valley
.




wonder
succeed
to
wonder
that
first
morning
;
for
there
be
the
castle


to
be
see
,
with
the
kennel
and
stable
roughly
keep
,

full
of
dog


and
horse
;
and
Odo
,
in
the
Marquess
's
absence
,
be
leave
free
to
visit


every
nook
of
his
new
home
.
Pontesordo
,
though
perhaps
as
ancient
as


Donnaz
,
be
but
a
fortified
manor
in
the
plain
;
but
here
be
the


turrete
border
castle
,
bristle
at
the
head
of
the
gorge
like
the


fang
in
a
boar
's
throat
:
its
wall
overhang
by
machicolation
,
its


portculli
still
drop
at
nightfall
,
and
the
loud
stream
form
a


natural
moat
at
its
base
.
through
the
desert
space
of
this
great


structure
Odo
wander
at
will
,
lose
himself
in
its
network
of
bare


chamber
,
some
now
put
to
domestic
use
,
with
smoke
meat
hang
from


the
rafter
,
cheese

implement
stack


on
the
floor
;
other
abandon
to
bat
and
spider
,
with
slit
-
like


opening
choke
by
a
growth
of
wild
cherry
,
and
little
animal


scurry
into
their
hole
as
Odo
open
the
unused
door
.
at
the
next


turn
he
mount
by
a
wind
stair
to
the
platform
behind
the


battlement
,
whence
he
could
look
down
on
the
inner
court
,
where
horse


be
be
groom
,
dog
feed
,
harness
mend
,
and
platter
of
smoking


food
carry
from
the
kitchen
to
the
pantry
;
or
,
lean
another
way
,


discover
,
between
the
cliff
and
the
rampart
a
tiny
walled
garden
with


fruit
-
tree
and
a
sundial
.




the
lady
keep
to
themselves
in
a
corner
of
the
castle
,
where
the
room


be
hang
with
tapestry
and
a
few
straight
-
back
chair
stand
about
the


hearth
;
but
even
here
no
fire
be
suffer
till
nightfall
,
nor
be


there
so
much
as
a
carpet
in
the
castle
.
Odo
's
grandmother
,
the
old


Marchioness
,
a
heavy
woman
who
would
doubtless
have
enjoy
her
ease
in


a
cushioned
seat
,
be
afoot
all
day
attend
to
her
household
;
for


besides
the

be
the
great
spinning

the
woman

the
linen

coarse
stuff

inmate

the
cobbler
and
tailor
who
clothe
and
shod
the
Marquess
and
his


household
.
all
these
the
Marchioness
must
visit
,
and
attend
to
she


devotion
between
;
the
lady
be
govern
by
a
dark
-
face
priest
,


their
chaplain
and
director
,
who
keep
they
perpetually
run
along
the


cold
stone
corridor
to
the
chapel
in
a
distant
wing
,
where
they
knelt


without
so
much
as
a
brazier
to
warm
they
or
a
cushion
to
their
knee
.


as
to
the
chapel
,
though
large
and
lofty
than
that
of
Pontesordo
,


with
a
fine
carve
and
paint
tabernacle
and
many
silver
candlestick
,


it
seem
to
Odo
,
by
reason
of
its
bare
wall
,
much
less
beautiful
than


that
desert
oratory
;
nor
do
he
,
amid
all
the
novelty
of
his


surrounding
,
cease
to
regret
the
companionship
of
his
familiar
image
.




his
delight
be
the
great
,
therefore
,
when
,
explore
a
part
of
the


castle
now
quite
abandon
,
he
come
one
day
on
a
vaulted
chamber
use
as


a
kind
of
granary
,
where
,
under
layer
of
dirt
and
cobwebs
,
lovely


countenance
flower
from
the
wall
.
the
scene
depict
differ


indeed
from
those
of
Pontesordo
,
be
less
animated
and
homely
and
more


difficult
for
a
child
to
interpret
;
for
here
be
naked
laurel
-
crown


knight
on
prance
horse
,
nimble
goat
-
face
creature
group
in


adoration
round
a
smoking
altar
and
youth
pipe
to
saffron
-
haired


damsel
on
grass
-
bank
set
with
poplar
.
the
very
strangeness
of
the


fable
set
forth
perhaps
engage
the
child
's
fancy
;
or
the
benignant


mildness
of
the
countenance
,
so
unlike
the
eager
individual
face
of


the
early
artist
;
for
he
return
again
and
again
to
gaze
unweariedly


on
the
inhabitant
of
that
tranquil
grassy
world
,
study
every
inch
of


the
wall
and
with
much
awe
and
fruitless
speculation
decipher
on
the


hem
of
a
float
drapery
the
inscription
:
Bernardinus
Lovinus
pinxit
.




his
impatience
to
know
more
of
the
history
of
these
painting
lead
he
to


question
an
old
man
,
half
house
-
servant
,
half
huntsman
,
now
too
infirm


for
service
and
often
to
be
find
sun
himself
in
the
court
with
an


old
hound
's
chin
on
his
knee
.
the
old
man
,
whose
name
be
Bruno
,
tell


he
the
room
in
question
have
be
paint
for
the
Marquess
Gualberto
di


Donnaz
,
who
have
fight
under
the
Duke
of
Milan
hundred
of
year
before
:


a
splendid
and
hospitable
noble
,
patron
of
learning
and
the
art
,
who


have
bring
the
great
milanese
painter
to
Donnaz
and
keep
he
there
a


whole
summer
adorn
the
banqueting
-
room
.
"
but
I
advise
you
,
little


master
,
"
Bruno
add
,
"
not
to
talk
too
loudly
of
your
discovery
;
for
we


live
in
change
day
,
do
you
see
,
and
it
seem
those
be
pagan
sorcerer


and
witch
paint
on
the
wall
,
and
because
of
that
,
and
their


nakedness
,
the
chaplain
have
forbid
all
the
young
boy
and
wench


about
the
place
to
set
foot
there
;
and
the
Marchioness
herself
,
I
be


tell
,
do
n't
enter
without
leave
.
"




this
be
the
more
puzzling
to
Odo
that
he
have
see
so
many
naked
pagan
,


in
colour
and
marble
,
at
his
cousin
's
palace
of
Pianura
,
where
they


be
praise
as
the
chief
ornament
of
that
sumptuous
fabric
;
but
he
keep


Bruno
's
warning
in
mind
and
so
time
his
visit
that
they
escape
the


chaplain
's
observation
.
whether
this
touch
of
mystery
add
charm
to
the


painting
;
or
whether
there
be
already
form
in
he
what
afterward


become
an
instinctive
resistance
to
many
of
the
dictate
of
his
age
;


certain
it
be
that
,
even
after
he
have
be
privileged
to
admire
the


stupendous
work
of
the
Caracci
at
Parma
and
of
the
immortal
Giulio


Romano
at
Mantua
,
Odo
's
fancy
always
turn
with
peculiar
fondness
to


the
clear
-
limbe
youth
move
in
that
world
of
untroubled
beauty
.




Odo
,
the
day
after
his
arrival
at
Donnaz
,
learn
that
the
chaplain
be


to
be
his
governor
;
and
he
be
not
long
in
discover
that
the
system


of
that
ecclesiastic
bore
no
resemblance
to
the
desultory
method
of
his


former
pedagogue
.
it
be
not
that
Don
Gervaso
be
a
man
of
superior


acquirement
:
in
writing
,
cipher
and
the
rudiment
of
Latin
he
seem


little
likely
to
carry
Odo
far
than
the
other
;
but
in

his
piety
be
of
a


stamp
so
different
from
the
abate
's
that
it
vivify
the
theological


abstraction
over
which
Odo
have
formerly
languish
,
infuse
a


passionate
meaning
into
the
formula
of
the
textbook
.
his
discourse

the
same
spirit
,
and

his
religion
be
warm
by


imagination
or

charity
the
child

a
ductile


substance

Council
of

over
the
Church
in
Savoy

make
its
approach
almost
as
sombre
and


forbid
as
that
of
the
Calvinist
heresy
.
as
it
be
,
the
fascination


that
draw
Odo
to
the
divine
teaching
be
counteract
by
a
depress


awe
:
he
tremble
in
God
's
presence
almost
as
much
as
in
his


grandfather
's
,
and
with
the
same
despair
of
discover
what
course
of


action
be
most
likely
to
call
down
the
impending
wrath
.
the
beauty
of


the
Church
's
office
,
now
for
the
first
time
reveal
to
he
in
the


well
-
order
service
of
the
chapel
,
be
doubly
move
in
contrast
with


the
rude
life
at
Donnaz
;
but
his
confession
torture
he
and
the


penance
which
the
chaplain
inflict
abase
without
reform
his


spirit
.




next
to
the
mass
,
the
book
Don
Gervaso
lend
he
be
his
chief


pleasure
:
the
life
of
the
Saints
,
Cardinal
Bellarmine
's
Fables
and
the


mirror
of
true
penitence
.
the
life
of
the
Saints
feed
at
once
his


imagination
and
his
heart
,
and
over
the
story
of
Saint
Francis
,
now


first
make
known
to
he
,
he
tremble
with
delicious
sympathy
.
the


longing
to
find
a
hermitage
like
the
Portiuncula
among
the
savage
rock


of
Donnaz
,
and
live
there
in
gentle
communion
with
plant
and
animal
,


alternate
in
he
with
the
martial
ambition
to
ride
forth
against
the


Church
's
enemy
,
as
his
ancestor
have
ride
against
the
bloody
and


pestilent
waldense
;
but
whether
his
piety
take
the
passive
or
the


aggressive
form
,
it
always
shrink
from
the
subtlety
of
doctrine
.
to


live
like
the
saint
,
rather
than
to
reason
like
the
father
,
be
his


ideal
of
christian
conduct
;
if
indeed
a
vague
pity
for
suffer


creature
and
animal
be
not
the
source
of
his
monastic
yearning
,
and


a
desire
to
see
strange
country
the
secret
of
his
zeal
against
the


infidel
.




the
chaplain
,
though
reprove
his
lukewarmness
in
matter
of
dogma
,


could
not
but
commend
his
devotion
to
the
saint
;
and
one
day
his


grandmother
,
to
reward
he
for
some
act
of
piety
,
inform
he
with


tear
of
joy
that
he
be
destine
for
holy
order
,
and
that
she
have
good


hope
of
live
to
see
he
a
bishop

this
news
have
hardly
the
intend


effect

for
Odo
's
dream
be
of
the
saint
's
halo
rather
than
the
bishop
's


mitre
;
and
throw
himself
on
his
knee
before
the
old
Marquess
,
who


be
present
,
he
beseech
that
he
might
be
allow
to
join
the
franciscan


order
.
the
Marquess
at
this
fly
into
so
furious
a
rage
,
curse
the


meddlesomeness
of
woman

the
chaplain

bigotry
,
that
the
lady


burst
into
tear
and
Odo
's
swell
zeal

small
.
there
be
indeed

one
person
in
the
castle

seem
not
to

its
master

violence

Odo

with

so
that
,
in
his
dealing
with
his
people

he
resemble
one
of


those
torrent
which
now
devastate

now
enrich
their

the


Marquess

he

obstinately
to
his
fishing
right

his

sickness

nourish

govern
they
with
a
paternal
tyranny
doubtless
less


insufferable
than
the
negligence
of
the
great
land

owner
who
live
at


court
.




to
Odo
,
however
,
these
ride
among
the
tenantry
be
less
agreeable
than


the
hunting

expedition
which
carry
they
up
the
mountain
in
the


solitude
of
morning

here
the
wild
freshness
of
the
scene

the


exhilaration
of
pursuit
rouse
the
fighting
strain
in
the
boy
's
blood
,


and
so
stir
his
memory
with
tale

sometimes
,

they


climb
the
stony

shadow

forth

exterminate
the
Waldenses

,
accord
to
the


chaplain

still
lurk
like
basilisk
and
dragon
in
the
recess
of
the


mountain

certain
it
be
that
his
ride
with
the
old
Marquess
,
if
they


inflame
his
zeal
against
heresy

cool
the
ardour
of
his
monastic


vocation
;
and
if
he
ponder
on
his
future
,
it
be
to
reflect
that


doubtless
he
would
some
day
be
a
bishop
,
and
that
bishop
be


territorial

down


from

two

it

a
service
exact
by


King
Charles
Emanuel

view
with
a
jealous
eye
those
of
his
noble


inclined
to
absent
themselves
from
court
and
reward
their
presence


with
privilege
and
preferment
.
at
the
same
time
the
two
canonesse


descend
to
their
abbey
in
the
plain
,
and
thus
with
the
closing
in
of


winter
the
old
Marchioness
,
Odo

his
mother
be
leave
alone
in
the


castle
.




to
the
Marchioness
this
be
an
agreeable
period
of
spiritual
compunction


and
bodily
repose
;
but
to
Donna
Laura
a
season
of
despair
.
the
poor


lady
,
who
have
be
early
remove
from
the
rough
life
at

the
fulness
of
youth

strain
her
eye
over
an
embroidery
in
which
the

repeat
itself

Odo
be
grandfather


be
fond
of
declare
that
a
nobleman
need
not

a
scholar

for
here

in
this
region
Odo
spend
many
blissful
hour
.
his
fancy
range
in
the


wake
of
hero
and
adventurer
who
,
for
all
he
know
,
might
still
be


feast
and
fight
north
of
the
Alps
,
or
might
any
day
with
a
blast


of
their
magic
horn
summon
the
porter
to

"
the

"
there
be
one
tale
of

that
the
boy
never

:


how
the
King
,
in
his
youth
,
have
always
about
he
a
company
of
twelve


lad
of
his

age
;
how
when
Conrad

wrong
,
his
governor
,
instead


of

he
,
beat
his

how
,
on
the
young


King

what
the
lad
be

for

pedagogue


reply
:




"
for
your
Majesty
's
offence

"




"
and
why
do
you
punish
my
companion

"




"
because
you
be
our
lord
and
master
,
"
he
be
tell
.




at
this
the
King
fall
to
thinking
,
and
thereafter
,
it
be
say
,
in
pity


for
those
who
must
suffer
in
his
stead
he
set
close
watch
on
himself
,


lest
his
sinning
should
work
harm
to
other
.
this
be
the
story
of
King


conrad
;
and
much
as
Odo
love
the
clash
of
arm
and
joyous
feat
of


paladin
rescue
fair
maid
in
battle
,
yet
Conrad
's
seem
to
he
,
even


then
,
a
braver
deed
than
these
.




in
March
of
the
second
year
the
old
Marquess
,
return
from
Turin
,
be


accompany
,
to
the
surprise
of
all
,
by
the
fantastical
figure
of
an


elderly
gentleman
in
the
rich
travel
dress
,
with
one
of
the
new


french
toupet
,
a
thin
wrinkle
paint
face
,
and
emit
with
every


movement
a
prodigious
odour
of
millefleur
.
this
visitor
,
who
be


attend
by
his
french
barber
and
two
or
three
liveried
servant
,
the


Marquess
introduce
as
the
lord
of
Valdu
,
a
neighbouring
seigneurie
of


no
great
account
.
though
his
land
march
with
the
Marquess
's
,
it
be


year
since
the
Count
have
visit
Donnaz
,
be
one
of
the
King
's


chamberlain
and
always
in
attendance
on
his
Majesty
;
and
it
be
amazing


to
see
with
what
smirk
and
grimace
,
and
ejaculation
in
piedmontese


french
,
he
compliment
the
Marchioness
on
her
appearance
,
and
exclaim


at
the
magnificence
of
the
castle
,
which
must
doubtless
have
appear
to


he
little
well
than
a
cattle
-
grange
.
his
talk
be
unintelligible
to


odo
,
but
there
be
no
mistaking
the
nature
of
the
glance
he
fix
on


Donna
Laura
,
who
,
having
flee
to
her
room
on
his
approach
,
presently


descend
in
a
ravish
new
sacque
,
with
an
air
of
extreme
surprise
,


and
her
hair
curl
(
as
Odo
afterward
learn
)
by
the
Count
's
own


barber
.




Odo
have
never
see
his
mother
look
handsomer
.
she
sparkle
at
the


Count
's
compliment
,
embrace
her
father
,
playfully
readjust
she


mother
's
coif
,
and
in
the
pretty
way
make
their
excuse
to
the
Count


for
the
cold
draught
and
bare
floor
of
the
castle
.
"
for
having
live


at
court
myself
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
know
to
what
your
excellency
be


accustomed
,
and
can
the
well
value
your
condescension
in
expose


yourself
,
at
this
rigorous
season
,
to
the
hardship
of
our


mountain
-
top
.
"




the
Marquess
at
this
begin
to
look
black
,
but
see
the
Count
's


pleasure
in
the
compliment
,
content
himself
with
call
out
for


dinner
,
which
,
say
he
,
with
all
respect
to
their
visitor
,
would
stay


his
stomach
well
than
the
french
kick
-
shaw
at
his
Majesty
's
table
.


whether
the
Count
be
of
the
same
mind
,
it
be
impossible
to
say
,
though


Odo
could
not
help
observe
that
the
stew
venison
and
spiced
boar
's


flesh
seem
to
present
certain
obstacle
either
to
his
jaw
or
his


palate
,
and
that
his
appetite
linger
on
the
fry
chicken
-
liver
and


tunny
-
fish
in
oil
;
but
he
cast
such
look
at
Donna
Laura
as
seem
to


declare
that
for
her
sake
he
would
willingly
have
risk
his
tooth
on


the
very
cobblestone
of
the
court
.
know
how
she
pine
for
company
,


Odo
be
not
surprised
at
his
mother
's
complaisance
;
yet
wonder
to
see


the
smile
with
which
she
presently
receive
the
Count
's
half
-
banter


disparagement
of
Pianura
.
for
the
duchy
,
by
his
showing
,
be
a
place
of


small
consequence
,
an
asylum
of
superannuated
fashion
;
whereas
no


frenchman
of
quality
ever
visit
Turin
without
exclaim
on
its


resemblance
to
Paris
,
and
vow
that
none
who
have
the
entree
of


stupinigi
need
cross
the
Alps
to
see
Versailles
.
as
to
the
Marquess
's


deprive
the
court
of
Donna
Laura
's
presence
,
their
guest
protest


against
it
as
an
act
of
overt
disloyalty
to
the
sovereign
;
and
what
most


surprise
Odo
,
who
have
often
hear
his
grandfather
declaim
against
the


count
as
a
cheap
jackanape
that
hang
about
the
court
for
what
he
could


make
at
play
,
be
the
indulgence
with
which
the
Marquess
receive
his


visitor
's
sally
.
Father
and

down
by
her
mistress
to
prepare
his
morning
chocolate
.




next
day
it
be
agree
the
gentleman
should
ride
to
Valdu
;
but
its
lord


be
as
stiff
-
jointed
as
a
marionette
,
Donna
Laura
,
with
charming
tact
,


beg
to
be
of
the
party
,
and
thus
enable
he
to
attend
she
in
she


litter
.
the
Marquess
thereupon
call
on
Odo
to
ride
with
he
;
and


set
forth
across
the
mountain
they
descend
by
a
long
defile
to
the


half
-
ruin
village
of
Valdu
.
here
,
for
the
first
time
,
Odo
see
the


spectacle
of
a
neglect
estate
,
its
last
penny
wring
from
it
for
the


absent
master

pleasure

a
bailiff

be
expect
to
extract
his


pay
from
the
sale
of
clandestine
concession
to
the
tenant
.
ride


beside
the
Marquess
,
who
swear
under
his
breath
at
the
ravage
of
the


undyked
stream
and
the
sight
of
good
arable
land
run
wild
and
choke


with
underbrush
,
the
little
boy
obtain
a
precocious
insight
into
the


evil
of
a
system
which
have
long
outlive
its
purpose
,
and
the
idea
of


feudalism
be
ever
afterward
embody
for
he
in
his
glimpse
of
the


peasant
of
Valdu
look
up
sullenly
from
their
work
as
their
suzerain


and
protector
thrust
an
unfamiliar
paint
smile
between
the
curtain
of


his
litter
.




what
his
grandfather
thought
of
Valdu
(
to
which
the
Count
on
the
way


home
refer
with
smirk
apology
as
the
mountain
-
lair
of
his


barbarous
ancestor
)
be
patent
enough
even
to
Odo
's
undeveloped


perception
;
but
it
would
have
require
a
more
experienced
understanding


to
detect
the
motive
that
lead
the
Marquess
,
scarce
two
day
after
their


visit
,
to
accord
his
daughter
's
hand
to
the
Count
.
Odo
feel
a
shock
of


dismay
on
learn
that
his
beautiful
mother
be
to
become
the
property


of
an
old
gentleman
whom
he
guess
to
be
of
his
grandfather
's
age
,
and


whose
enamoured
grimace
recall
the
antic
of
her
favourite
monkey
,


and
the
boy
's
face
reflect
the
blush
of
embarrassment
with
which
Donna


Laura
impart
the
news
;
but
the
child
of
that
day
be
train
to
a


passive
acquiescence
,
and
have
she
inform
he
that
she
be
to
be


chain
in
the
keep
on
bread
and
water
,
Odo
would
have
accept
the
fact


with
equal
philosophy
.
three
week
afterward
his
mother
and
the
old


Count
be
marry
in
the
chapel
of
Donnaz
,
and
Donna
Laura
,
with
many


tear
and
embrace
,
set
out
for
Turin
,
take
her
monkey
but
leave
she


son
behind
.
it
be
not
till
later
that
Odo
learn
of
the
social
usage


which
compel
young
widow
to
choose
between
remarriage
and
the


cloister
;
and
his
subsequent
view
be
unconsciously
tinge
by
the


remembrance
of
his
mother
's
melancholy
bridal
.




her
departure
leave
no
trace
but
be
speedily
repair
by
the
coming
of


spring
.
the
sun
grow
warm
,
and
the
close
season
put
an
end
to


the
Marquess
's
hunting
,
it
be
now
Odo
's
chief
pleasure
to
carry
his


book
to
the
walled
garden
between
the
castle
and
the
southern
face
of


the
cliff
.
this
small
enclosure
,
probably
a
survival
of
medieval


horticulture
,
have
along
the
upper
ledge
of
its
wall
a
grass
walk


command
the
flow
of
the
stream
,
and
an
angle
turret
that
turn
one


slit
to
the
valley
,
the
other
to
the
garden
lie
below
like
a
tranquil


well
of
scent
and
brightness
:
its
box
tree
clip
to
the
shape
of


peacock
and
lion
,
its
clove
pink
and
simple
set
in
a
border
of


thrift
,
and
a
pear
tree
bask
on
its
sunny
wall
.
these
pleasant


space
,
which
Odo
have
to
himself
save
when
the
canonesse
walk
there


to
recite
their
rosary
,
he
people
with
the
knight
and
lady
of
the


novelle
,
and
the
fantastic
being
of
Pulci
's
epic
:
there
walk
the
Fay


Morgana
,
Regulus
the
loyal
knight
,
the
giant
Morgante
,
Trajan
the
just


emperor
and
the
proud
figure
of
King
Conrad
;
so
that
,
escape
thither


from
the
after
-
dinner
dullness
of
the
tapestry
parlour
,
the
boy
seem


to
pass
from
the
most
oppressive
solitude
to
a
world
of
warmth
and


fellowship
.

.




Odo
,
who
,
like
all
neglect
child
,
be
quick
to
note
in
the


demeanour
of
his
elder
any
hint
of
a
change
in
his
own
condition
,
have


be
keenly
conscious
of
the
effect
produce
at
Donnaz
by
the
news
of


the
Duchess
of
Pianura
's
deliverance
.
guide
perhaps
by
his
mother
's


exclamation
,
he
notice
an
add
zeal
in
Don
Gervaso
's
teaching
and
an


unction
in
the
manner
of
his
aunt
and
grandmother
,
who
embrace
he
as


though
they
be
handle
a
relic
;
while
the
old
Marquess
,
though
he


take
his
grandson
seldomer
on
his
ride
,
would
sit
stare
at
he
with
a


frown
tenderness
that
once
find
vent
in
the
growl--"Morbleu
,
but


he
be
too
good
for
the
tonsure
!
"
all
this
make
it
clear
to
Odo
that
he


be
indeed
mean
for
the
Church
,
and
he
learn
without
surprise
that


the
following
spring
he
be
to
be
send
to
the
seminary
at
Asti

thought
that
his
life
be
to
be
pass

mystic


beauty

a
moment
above
the
grassy


common

present
a
scene

curious
contrast
to

it
be
strange
to
pass
from
this
scene
to
the
solitude
of
the
grove

,
in

twilight

with

some
scene


of

Passion

a
tigerish
Judas
and
a
Saint


John

his
yellow
curl
on
his
Master
's
bosom

there
an
Entombment

a

stricken
Maries
.
these
figure
,
though
rudely
model
and


daub
with
bright
colour
,
yet
,
by
a
vivacity
of
attitude
and
gesture


which
the
mystery
of
their
setting
enhance
,
convey
a
thrilling


impression
of
the
sacred
scene
set
forth
;
and
Odo
be
yet
at
an
age


when
the
distinction
between
flesh
-
and
-
blood
and
its
plastic


counterfeit
be
not
clearly
define
,
or
when
at
least
the
sculpture


image
be
still
a
mysterious
half
-
sentient
thing
,
denizen
of
some
strange


borderland
between
art
and
life
.
it
seem
to
he
,
as
he
gaze
through


the
chapel
grating
,
that
those
long
-
distant
episode
of
the
divine


tragedy
have
be
here
preserve
in
some
miraculous
state
of
suspend


animation
,
and
as
he
climb
from
one
shrine
to
another
he
have
the
sense


of
tread
the
actual
stone
of
Gethsemane
and
Calvary
.




as
be
usual
with
he
,
the
impression
of
the
moment
have
efface
those


precede
it
,
and
it
be
almost
with
surprise
that
,
at
the
rector
's


door
,
he
behold
the
primo
soprano
of
Pianura
totter
forth
to
the
litter


and
offer
his
knee
as
a
step
for
the
canonesse
.
the
charitable
lady


cry
out
on
he
for
this
imprudence
,
and
his
pallor
still
give


evidence
of
distress
,

be
bid
to
wait
on
they
after
supper
with


his
story
.
he
present
himself
promptly
in
the
parlour
,
and
be


question
as
to
his
condition
at
once
rashly
proclaim
his
former


connection
with
the
ducal
theatre
of
Pianura
.
no
avowal
could
have
be


more
disastrous
to
his
cause
.
the
canonesse
cross
themselves
with


horror
,
and
the
abate
,
see
his
mistake
,
hasten
to
repair
it
by


exclaiming--"What
,

involuntary
error

the
effect

this
appeal

tinsel

health

an
heir

the
most
sanguine
imagination
could
hardly


view
Odo
as

bring
much
near
the
succession

the
change
in

fancy

to
be
exchange

seminary
for
the
academy

even
the
old
chief
of

betray
in


his
grumbling
counsel
to
the
boy
a
sense
of
the
exalted
future
in
which


they
might
some
day
serve
he
.




the
preparation
of
departure

the
wonder
of
his
new
state
leave
Odo


little
space
wherein
to
store
his
thought
with
impression
of
what
he


be
leave
;
and
it
be
only
in
after
year
,
when
the
accretion
of


superficial
incident
have
drop
from
his
past
,
that
those
last
day
at


Donnaz
gain
their
full
distinctness
.
he
see
they
then
,
heavy
with
the


warmth
of
the
long
summer
,
from
the
topmost
pine
-
belt
to
the
bronze


vineyard
turn
their
metallic
cluster
to
the
sun
;
and
in
the
midst


his
small
bewildered
figure
,
net
in
a
web
of
association
,
and


seem
,
as
he
break
away
,
to
leave
a
shred
of
himself
in
every
corner


of
the
castle
.




sharp
of
all
,
there
remain
with
he
the
vision
of
his
last
hour


with
Don
Gervaso
.
the
news
of
Odo
's
change
condition
have
be
receive


in
silence
by
the
chaplain
.
he
be
not
the
man
to
waste
word
and
he


know
the
futility
of
assert
the
Church
's
claim
to
the


heir
-
presumptive
of
a
reign
house
.
therefore
if
he
show
no


enthusiasm
he
betray
no
resentment
;
but
,
the
evening
before
the
boy
's


departure
,
lead
he
,
still
in
silence
,
to
the
chapel
.
here
the
priest


kneel
with
Odo
;
then
,
raise
he
,
sit
on
one
of
the
bench
face
the


high
altar
,
and
speak
a
few
grave
word
.




"
you
be
set
out
,
"
say
he
,
"
on
a
way
far
different
from
that
in


which
it
have
be
my
care
to
guide
you
;
yet
the
high
road
and
the


mountain
path
may
,
by
diverse
winding
,
lead
to
the
same
point
;
and


whatever
walk
a
man
choose
,
it
will
surely
carry
he
to
the
end
that


God
have
appoint
.
if
you
be
call
to
serve
he
in
the
world
,
the


journey
on
which
you
be
now
start
may
lead
you
to
the
throne
of


Pianura
;
but
even
so
,
"
he
go
on
,
"
there
be
this
I
would
have
you


remember
:
that
should
this
dignity
come
to
you
it
may
come
as
a
calamity


rather
than
a
joy
;
for
when
God
confer
earthly
honour
on
a
child
of


his
predilection
,
he
sometimes
deign
to
render
they
as
innocuous
as


misfortune
;
and
my
chief
prayer
for
you
be
that
you
should
be
raise
to


this
eminence
,
it
may
be
at
a
moment
when
such
advancement
seem
to


thrust
you
in
the
dust
.
"




the
word
burn
themselves
into
Odo
's
heart
like
some
mystic
writing
on


the
wall
of
memory
,
long
afterward
to
start
into
fiery
meaning
.
at
the


time
he
feel
only
that
the
priest
speak
with
a
power
and
dignity
no


human
authority
could
give
;
and
for
a
moment
all
the
store
influence


of
his
faith
reach
out
to
he
from
the
dimly
-
gleam
altar
.




the
next
sun
rise
on
a
new
world
.
he
be
to
set
out
at
daylight
,
and


dawn
find
he
at
the
casement
,
foot
it
in
thought
down
the
road
as


yet
undistinguishable
in
a
die
glimmer
of
star
.
Bruno
be
to
attend


he
to
Turin
;
but
one
of
the
woman
presently
bring
word
that
the
old


huntsman

rheumatism
have
catch
he
in
the
knee

that
the
Marquess

his
grandson

departure

have
choose
Cantapresto

companion

the
courtyard

when
Odo

fairly


bubble
with

voluble
joy

fat
soprano

undying
devotion

the
comment

cool
eye
on
the
soprano

protestation

only
,
as
Cantapresto
sweep
the
company
into


the
circle
of
an
obsequious
farewell:--"remember

abate
's
answer
be
a
rush
of


purple
to
the
forehead
;
but
Don
Gervaso
imperturbably
add
,
"

you


lie
but
one
night

road

meanwhile

old
Marquess
,
visibly
move
,
be

Odo
to
respect


his
elder
and
superior
,
while
in
the
same
breath
warn
he
not
to


take
up
with
the
frenchify
notion
of
the
court
,
but
to
remember
that


for
a
lad
of
his
condition
the
chief
virtue
be
a
tight
seat
in
the


saddle
,
a
quick
hand
on
the
sword

a
slow
tongue

"




the
Marchioness
thereupon
,
with
many
tear
,
hang
a
scapular
about
Odo
's


neck
,
bid
he
shun
the
theatre
and
be
regular
at
confession
;
one
of


the
canonesse
remind
he
not
to
omit
a
visit
to
the
chapel
of
the


Holy
Winding

sheet

the
other
beg
he
to
burn
a
candle
for

at
the
Consolata

forward

little
master

down
the
valley

shadow

numb

presently
his
sense
wake
to
the
call

the
brightening


landscape

the
scene
be
such

:
wild


block
of
stone
heap
under
walnut

shade

here
the
white
plunge
of


water
down
a
wall
of
granite
,

there
,
in
bluer
depth
,
a
charcoal


burner

hut

up
its
spiral
of
smoke
to
the
dark
raftering
of


branch

it
be
but
a
few
hour
since

travel
from

at

the
roadside

into
detail
like
the
foreground
of
some
minute
dutch
painter
;


every
pendent
mass
of
fern
,
dark
dripping
rock
,
late
tuft
of
harebell

out
to

well

this

your
last

"
his


first
sight
too
,
it
seem
:
since
he
have
live
through
twelve
italian


summer
without
sense
of
the
sun
-
steep
quality
of
atmosphere
that
,


even
in
shade
,
give
each
object
a
golden
salience
.
he
be
conscious
of


it
now
only
as
it
suggest
finger
a
missal
stiff
with
gold
-
leaf
and


edge
with
a
swarm
diversity
of
bud
and
insect
.
the
carriage
move


so
slowly
that
he
be
in
no
haste
to
turn
the
page
;
and
each
spike
of


yellow
foxglove
,
each
clouding
of
butterfly
about
a
patch
of


speedwell
,
each
quiver
of
grass
over
a
hidden
thread
of
moisture
,
become


a
marvel
to
be
thumb
and
treasure
.




from
this
mood
he
be
detach
by
the
next
bend
of
the
road
.
the
way
,


hitherto
wind
through
narrow
glen
,
now
swing
to
a
ledge
overhanging


the
last
escarpment
of
the
mountain

Cantapresto
turn
a
snore
countenance
.
the
lively
air
of


the
hill
,
the
good
fare
of
Donnaz
,
and
the
satisfaction
,
above
all
,
of


roll
on
cushion
over
a
road

think
to
trudge

here


Cantapresto
prove
to
his
charge
that
,
as
he
phrase
it
,
his
belly
have


as
short
a
memory
for
food
as

for
injury
.
a
flask

Asti


put
he
in
the
talk
mood
,
and
as
they
drive
on
he
regale
Odo
with
a


lively
picture
of
the
life
on
which
he
be
about
to
enter
.




"
you
be
go
,

say
he
,
"
to
one
of
the
first
city
of
Europe
;
one


that
have
all
the
beauty
and
elegance
of
the
french
capital
without
its


folly
and
excess
.
Turin
be
bless
with
a
court
where
good
manner


and
a
fine
tone
be
more
highly
prize
than
the
extravagance
of
genius
;


and
I
have
hear
it
say
of
his
Majesty
that
he
be
delighted
to
see
his


courtier
wear
the
french
fashion
outside
their
head
,
provide
they


do
n't
carry
the
french
idea
within
.
you
be
too
young
,
doubtless
,


cavaliere
,
to
have
hear
of
the
philosopher
who
be
raise
such
a


pother
north
of
the
Alps
:
a
set
of
madman
that
,
because
their
birth


do
n't
give
they
the
entree
of
Versailles
,
be
preach
that
man


should
return
to
a
state
of
nature
,
great
lady
suckle
their
young
like


animal
,
and
the
peasantry
own
their
land
like
noble
.
luckily
you
'll


hear
little
of
this
infectious
talk
in
Turin
:
the
King
stamp
out
the


philosopher
like
vermin
or
pack
they
off
to
splutter
their
heresy
in


Milan
or
Venice
.
but
to
a
nobleman
mindful
of
the
privilege
of
his


condition
there
be
no
more
agreeable
sojourn
in
Europe
.
the
wine
be


delicious
,
the
woman
--
er
--
accomplished
--
and
though
the
sbirri
may
hug


one
a
trifle
close
now
and
then
,
why
,
with
money
and
discretion
,
a


friend
or
two
in
the
right
quarter
,
and
the
wit
to
stand
well
with
the


Church
,
there
be
no
city
in
Europe
where
a
man
may
have
pleasanter
sin


to
confess
.
"




the
carriage
,
by
this
,
be
descend
the
last
curve
above
the
valley
,


and
before
they
,
in
a
hollow
of
the
hill
,
blink
the
warm
shimmer
of


maize
and
vine
,
like
some
bright
vintage
brim

cup

"

"
what
Nature
have

for

happy
region

spread
the
table
so
bountifully
,
should
her
child
hang


back
from

feast
?
I
vow
,
cavaliere
,
if
the
mountain
be
build
for


hermit
and
ascetic
,
then
the
plain
be
make
level
for
dancing
,


banqueting
and
the
pleasure
of
the
villeggiatura
.
if
God
have
mean
we


to
break
our
tooth
on
nut
and
root
,
why
do
he
hang
the
vine
with


fruit
and
draw
three
crop
of
wheat
from
this
indulgent
soil
?
I
protest


when
I
look
on
such
a
scene
as
this
,
it
be
sufficient
incentive
to


lowliness
to
remember
that
the
meek
shall
inherit
the
earth
!
"




this
mood

Cantapresto

his
after

dinner

overtake
he
;

when
he
wake
again

chariot

Chivasso

the
Po

sunset
crimson
between
flat
that
seem


dull
and
featureless
after
the
broken
scenery
of
the

beyond


the

the
tower

of
the
town
,
with
its


cathedral

the

in
the

presently


there

a
shout
of

its

in
the


only
two
subject
safely
discuss
in
Turin
at
that
day
--
the
doing
of


the
aristocracy

of
the
clergy
.
the
fashion
of
the
Queen
's
headdress


at
the
last
circle
,
the
marked
manner
in
which
his
Majesty

lately


distinguish
the
brilliant
young
cavalry
officer
,
Count
Roberto
di


tournanche
,
the
third
marriage
of
the
Countess
Alfieri

court
lady

have


take
to
white
muslin
and

hat

the
probable
significance
of
the


vicar

general

visit
to
Rome
,
the
subject
of
the
next
sacred


representation
to

give
by
the
nun
of
Santa
Croce
--
such
be
the


question
that
engage
the
noble
frequenter
of
Casa
Valdu
.




this
be
the
only
society
that
Donna
Laura
see
;
for
she
be
too
poor
to


dress
to
her
taste
and
too
proud
to
show
herself
in
public
without
the


appointment
become
her
station
.
her
sole
distraction
consist
in


visit
to
the
various
shrine
--
the
Sudario
,
the
Consolata
,
the
Corpus


Domini
--
at
which
the
feminine
aristocracy
offer
up
its
devotion
and


implore
absolution
for
sin
it
have
often
no
opportunity
to
commit
:
for


though
fashion
accord
cicisbeo
to
the
fine
lady
of
Turin
,
the
Church


usually
restrict
their
intercourse
to
the
exchange
of
the
most


harmless
amenity
.




meanwhile
the
antechamber
be
as
full
of
dun
as
the
approach
to
Donna


Laura
's
apartment
at
Pianura
;
and
Odo
guess
that
the
warmth
of
the


maternal
welcome
spring
less
from
natural
affection
than
from
the
hope


of
use
his
expectation
as
a
sop
to
her
creditor
.
the
pittance
which


the
ducal
treasury
allow
for
his
education
be
scarce
large
enough
to


be
worth
divert
to
other
end
;
but
a
potential
prince
be
a
shield
to


the
most
vulnerable
fortune
.
in
this
character
Odo
for
the
first
time


find
himself
flatter
,
indulge
,
and
make
the
centre
of
the
company
.


the
contrast
to
his
life
of
subjection
at
Donnaz
;
the
precocious


initiation
into
motive
that
taint
the
very
fount
of
filial
piety
;
the


taste
of
this
mingle
draught
of
adulation
and
disillusionment
,
might


have
pervert
a
nature
more
self
-
centre
than
his
.
from
this


perversion
,
and
from
many
subsequent
peril
he
be
save
by
a
kind
of


imaginative

the
obscenity

the
different
point

which
at
that

a
period

praise
to
the
sky

load


with
wealth

up

the
impression

talk

of
the


provincial
stage

here
be
a
spectacle

lofty

a
touch
of
shyness
:

the
age
of
sixteen
,

desultory
year
of
academic
schooling

be
probably
the
most


extraordinary
youth
in
Charles
Emmanuel
's
dominion
.
of
the
future


student
,
of
the
tragic
poet
who
be
to
prepare
the
liberation
of
Italy


by
raise
the
political
ideal
of
his
generation
,
this
moody
boy
with


his
craze
for
dress
and
horse
,
his
pride
of
birth
and
contempt
for
his


own
class
,
his
liberal
theory
and
insolently
aristocratic
practice
,


must
have
give
small
promise
to
the
most
discerning
observer
.
it
seem


indeed
probable
that
none
think
he
worth
observe
and
that
he
pass


among
his
townsman
merely
as
one
of
the
most
idle
and
extravagant
young


nobleman
in
a
society
where
idleness
and
extravagance
be
hold
to
be


the
natural
attribute
of
the
great
.
but
in
the
growth
of
character
the


light
on
the
road
to
Damascus
be
apt
to
be
precede
by
faint
premonitory


gleam
;
and
even
in
his
frivolous
day
at
the
Academy
Alfieri
carry
a


virgil
in
his
pocket
and
weep
and
tremble
over
Ariosto
's
verse
.




it
be
the
instant
response
of
Odo
's
imagination
that
draw
the
two


together
.
odo
,
as
one
of
the
foreign
pupil
,
be
quarter
in
the
same


wing
of
the
Academy
with
the
student
of
Alfieri
's
class
,
and
enjoy
an


almost
equal
freedom
.
thus
,
despite
the
difference
of
age
,
the
lad


find
themselves
ally
by
taste
and
circumstance
.
among
the
youth
of


their
class
they
be
perhaps
the
only
two
who
already
feel
,
however


obscurely
,
the
stirring
of
unborn
ideal
,
the
pressure
of
that
tide
of


renovation
that
be
to
sweep
they
,
on
widely
-
sunder
current
,
to
the


same
uncharted
deep
.
Alfieri
,
at
any
rate
,
represent
to
the
young


lad
the
seer
who
hold
in
his
hand
the
key
of
knowledge
and
beauty
.
odo


could
never
forget
the
youth
who
first
leant
he
Annibale
Caro
's
Aeneid


and
Metastasio
's
opera
libretti
,
Voltaire
's
Zaire
and
the
comedy
of


Goldoni
;
while
Alfieri
perhaps
find
in
his
companion
's
sympathy
with


his
own
half
-
dormant
taste
the
first
incentive
to
a
nobler
activity
.


certain
it
be
that
,
in
the
interchange
of
their
daily
comradeship
,
the


elder
give
his
friend
much
that
he
be
himself
unconscious
of


possess
,
and
perhaps
first
see
reflect
in
Odo
's
more
vivid


sensibility
an
outline
of
the
formless
ideal
coil
in
the
depth
of


his
own
sluggish
nature
.




the
difference
in
age
,
and
the
possession
of
an
independent
fortune
,


which
the
law
of
Savoy
have
leave
Alfieri
free
to
enjoy
since
his


fifteenth
year
,
give
he
an
obvious
superiority
over
Odo
;
but
if


Alfieri
's
amusement
separate
he
from
his
young
friend
,
his
taste


be
always
draw
they
together
;
and
Odo
be
happily
of
those
who
be


more
engaged
in
profiting
by
what
come
their
way
than
in
pine
for


what
escape
they
.
much
as
he
admire
Alfieri
,
it
be
somehow
impossible


for
the
latter
to
condescend
to
he
;
and
the
equality
of
intercourse


between
the
two
be
perhaps
its
chief
attraction
to
a
youth
surfeit


with
adulation
.




of
the
opportunity
his
new
friendship
bring
he
,
none
become
in


after
year

pleasanter

hold
its
own
through
all
later
variation

parallel
with
the
barocchismo
of

seventeenth
century
and
the


effeminate
caprice
of
the
rococo
period

much
in
Rome
,
in


the
company
of

society

revival

research
be
be
forward
by
the
liberality


of
Princes

by
the
indefatigable
zeal
of
the
scholar


in
their
pay
.
from
this
centre
of
aesthetic
reaction
Alfieri
have


return
to
the
Gallicized
Turin
,
with
its
preference
for
the
graceful

than
for

large
,
the
noble

but
perhaps
narrow
by
close
study
of
the
past
:
the
view
of
a


generation
of
architect
in
whom
archeological
curiosity
have
stifle
the


artistic
instinct
,
and
who
,
instead
of
assimilate
the
spirit
of
the


past
like
their
great
predecessor
,
be
engross
in
a
sterile


restoration
of
the
letter
.
it
may
be
say
of
this
school
of
architect


that
they
be
of
more
service
to
posterity
than
to
their


contemporary
;
for
while
they
open
the
way
to
modern
antiquarian


research
,
their
pedantry
check
the
natural
development
of
a
style


which
,
if
leave
to
itself
,
might
in
time
have
find
new
and
more
vigorous


form
of

to
Odo

,
Count
Benedetto

speak
more
forcibly
than


his
theory
.
every
object
in
the
calm
severe
room
appeal
to
the
boy


with
the
pure
eloquence
of
form

cast

,
rouse
Odo
's
curiosity
as


if
they
have
be
the
scatter
letter
of
a
new
alphabet
;
and
he
see


with
astonishment
his
friend
Vittorio
's
indifference
to
these
wonder
.


Count
Benedetto
,
it
be
clear
,
be
resign
to
his
nephew
's
lack
of


interest
.
the
old
man
doubtless
know
that
he
represent
to
the
youth


only
the
rich
uncle
whose
crotchet
must
be
humour
for
the
sake
of


what
his
pocket
may
procure
;
and
such
kindly
tolerance
make
Odo
regret


that
Vittorio
should
not
at
least
affect
an
interest
in
his
uncle
's


pursuit
.




Odo
's
eagerness
to
see
and
learn
fill
Count
Benedetto
with
a
simple


joy
.
he
bring
forth
all
his
treasure
for
the
boy
's
instruction
and


the
two
spend
many
an
afternoon
pore
over
Piranesi
's
roman
etching
,

of
classical
remain
.
like
all
student
of
his
day
he


have
also
his
cabinet
of
antique
gem
and
coin
,
from
which
Odo
obtain


more
intimate
glimpse
of
that
bury
life
so
marvellously
exhume


before
he
:
hint
of

place

familiar


gesture
of
hand
on
which
those
very
jewel
might
have
sparkle
.
nor


do
the
Count
restrict
the
boy
's
enquiry
to
that
distant
past
;
and
for


the
first
time
Odo
hear
of
the
master
who
have
maintain
the
great


classical
tradition
on
latin
soil
:
Sanmichele
,
Vignola
,
Sansovino
,
and


the
divine
Michael
Angelo
,
whom
the
old
architect
never
name
without


bare
his
head
.
from
the
work
of
these
architect
Odo
form
his
first


conception
of
the
early
,
more
virile
manner
which
the
first
contact


with
Graeco
-
roman
antiquity
have
produce
.
the
Count
tell
he
,
too
,
of


the
great
painter
whose
popularity
have
be
lessen
,
if
their
fame
have


not
be
dim
,
by
the
more
recent
achievement
of
Correggio
,
Guido
,


Guercino
,
and
the
bolognese
school
.
the
splendour
of
the
stanze
of
the


Vatican
,
the
dreadful
majesty
of
the
Sistine
ceiling
,
reveal
to
Odo


the
beauty
of
that
unmatched
moment
before
grandeur
break
into
bombast
.


his
early
association
with
the
expressive
homely
art
of
the
chapel
at


Pontesordo
and
with
the
half
-
pagan
beauty
of
Luini
's
composition
have


form
his
taste
on
soberer
line
than
the
fashion
of
the
day
affect
;


and
his
imagination
breathe
freely
on
the
height
of
the
Latin


Parnassus
.
thus
,
while
his
friend
Vittorio
storm
up
and
down
the
quiet


room
,
chatter
about
his
horse
,
boasting
of
his
escapade
,
or


rant
against
the
tyranny
of
the
sardinian
government
,
Odo
,
at
the
old


Count
's
side
,
be
enter
on
the
great
inheritance
of
the
past
.




such
an
initiation
be
the
more
precious
to
he
from
the
indifference
of


those
about
he
to
all
form
of
liberal
culture
.
among
the
great


italian
city

Turin

at
that
period

least
open
to
new


influence
,
the
most
rigidly
bind
up
in
the
formula
of
the
past
.

Milan

the
austrian
rule
,

such
at
any

the


opinion

have
sink
into
a
state

that

himself

Lettere
Virgiliane
have
so
conclusively
show
Dante
to
be
a
writer
of


barbarous
doggerel
;

among
the
dilettanti
of

one
hear
less


of
Raphael
than
of
Carlo
Maratta
,
less
of
Ariosto

of


the
Jesuit

author
of

sublime
"
heroico
-
comic
"
poem


on
the
infancy
of
Jesus

it
be
in
fact
mainly
to
the
Jesuits
that
Italy
,
in
the
early
part
of


the
eighteenth
century
,
owe
her
literature
and
her
art
,
as
well
as
the


direction
of
her
religious
life

popularity

their


hold
on
the
aristocracy
,

pretention
they
flatter
,
whose
taste


they
affect

to
whom
they

the
spirit

political
conservatism

which
invisible
force

already

move
.
for
the
use
of
their
noble
supporter
,
the
Jesuits
have


devise
a
religion
as
elaborate
and
ceremonious
as
the
social
usage
of


the
aristocracy
:
a
religion
which
deck
its
chapel
in
imitation
of


great
lady
'
boudoir

prescribe
observance
in
keep
with
the


vapid
and
gossip
existence
of
their
inmate
.




to
Odo
,
fresh
from
the
pure
air
of
Donnaz
,
where
the
faith
of
his


kinsfolk
express
itself
in
charity
,
self
-
denial
and
a
noble
decency
of


life
,
there
be
something
stifle
in
the
atmosphere
of
languish


pietism
in
which
his
mother
's
friend
veil
the
emptiness
of
their


day
.
under
the
instruction
of
the
Countess
's
director
the
boy
's


conscience
be
enervate
by
the
casuistry
of
Liguorianism
and
his


devotion
dull
by
the
imposition
of
interminable
"
pious
practice
.
"
it


be
in
his
nature
to
grudge
no
sacrifice
to
his
ideal
,
and
he
might


have
accomplish
without
question
the
monotonous
observance
his


confessor
exact
,
but
for
the
change
aspect
of
the
deity
in
whose

they
be
impose
.




as
with
most
thoughtful
nature
,
Odo
's
first
disillusionment
be
to
come


from
discover
not
what
his
God
condemn
,
but
what
he
condone
.


between
Cantapresto
's
coarse
philosophy
of
pleasure
and
the
refined


complaisance
of
his
new
confessor
he
feel
the
distinction
to
be
one


rather
of
taste
than
of
principle
;
and
it
seem
to
he
that
the


religion
of
the
aristocracy
might
not
unfairly
be
sum
up
in
the


ex
-
soprano
's
cynical
aphorism
:
"
as
respectful
child
of
our
Heavenly


Father
it
behove
we
not
to
speak
till
we
be
speak
to
.
"




even
the
religious
ceremony
he
witness
do
not
console
he
for
that


chill
hour
of
dawn
,
when
,
in
the
chapel
at
Donnaz
,
he
have
serve
the


mass
for
Don
Gervaso
,
with
a
heart
tremble
at
its
own
unworthiness

Odo
pray


in

for
a
reawakening
of
the
old
emotion
.
the
sense
of
sonship

himself
an
alien

temple
of
this
affable
divinity

no

the
cry

once
lift

on


wing
of
praise

one
afternoon
of
April
in
the
year
1774
,
Odo
Valsecca
,
ride
down
the


hillside
below
the
church
of
the
Superga
,
have
rein
in
his
horse
at
a


point
where
a
group
of
spanish
chestnut
overhang
the
way
.
the
air
be


light
and
pure
,
the
shady
turf
invite
he
,
and
dismount
he
bid
his


servant
lead
the
horse
to
the
wayside
inn
half
way
down
the
slope
.




the
spot
he
have
choose
,
though
seclude
as
some
nook
above
the
gorge
of


Donnaz
,
command
a
view
of
the
Po
rolling
at
his
foot
like
a
flood
of


yellowish
metal
,
and
beyond
,
outspread
in
clear
spring
sunshine
,
the


great
city
in
the
bosom
of
the
plain
.
the
spectacle
be
fair
enough
to


touch
any
fancy
:
brown
dome
and
facade
set
in
new
-
leave
garden
and


surround
by
vineyard
extend
to
the
near
acclivity
;


country
-
house
glance
through
the
fresh
green
of
plane
and
willow
;


monastery
-
wall
crest
the
high
ridge
;
and
westward
the
Po
winding


in
sunlit
curve
toward
the
Alps
.




Odo
have
lose
none
of
his
sensitiveness
to
such
impression
;
but
the
sway


of
another
mood
turn
his
eye
from
the
outstretched
beauty
of
the
city


to
the
vernal
solitude
about
he
.
it
be
the
season
when
old
memory
of


Donnaz
work
in
his
blood
;
when
the
bank
and
hedge
of
the
fresh


hill
-
country
about
Turin
cheat
he
with
a
breath
of
bud


beech
-
grove
and
the
fragrance
of
crush
fern
in
the
glen
of
the
high


pennine
valley
.
it
be
a
mere
waft
,
perhaps
,
from
some
clod
of
loosen


earth
,
or
the
touch
of
cool
elastic
moss
as
he
fling
himself
face


downward
under
the
tree
;
but
the
savour
,
the
contact
fill
his


nostril
with
mountain
air
and
his
eye
with
dim
-
branched
distance
.
at


Donnaz
the
slow
motion
of
the
northern
spring
have
endear
to
he
all


those
sweet
incipiency
precede
the
full
choral
burst
of
leaf
and


flower
:
the
mauve
mist
over
bare
woodland
,
the
wet
black
gleam
in


frost
-
bind
hollow
,
the
thrust
of
frond
through
withered
bracken
,
the


primrose
-
patch
spread
like
pale
sunshine
along
wintry
lane
.
he
have


always
feel
a
sympathy
for
these
delicate
unnoted
change
;
but
the


feeling
which
have
formerly
be
like
the
blind
stir
of
sap
in
a
plant


be
now
a
conscious
sensation
that
grope
for
speech
and
understanding
.




he
have
grow
up
among
people
to
whom
such
emotion
be
unknown
.
the
old


Marquess
's
passion
for
his
field
and
wood
be
the
love
of
the


agriculturist
and
the
hunter
,
not
that
of
the
naturalist
or
the
poet
;


and
the
aristocracy
of
the
city
regard
the
country
merely
as
so
much


soil
from
which
to
draw
their
maintenance
.
the
gentlefolk
never
absent


themselves
from
town
but
for
a
few
week
of
autumn
,
when
they
go
to


their
villa
for
the
vintage
,
transport
thither
all
the
diversion
of


city
life
and
venture
no
far
afield
than
the
pleasure
-
ground
that


be
but
so
many
open
-
air
card
-
room
,
concert
-
hall
and
theatre
.
Odo
's


tenderness
for
every
sylvan
function
of
renewal
and
decay
,
every


shift
of
light
and
colour
on
the
fly
surface
of
the
year
,
would


have
be
meet
with
the
same
stare
with
which
a
certain
enchanting


Countess
have
receive
the
handful
of
wind
-
flower
that
,
fresh
from
a


sunrise
on
the
hill
,
he
have
lay
one
morning
among
her
toilet
-
box
.


the
Countess
Clarice
have
stare
and
laugh
,
and
every
one
of
his


acquaintance
,
Alfieri
even
,
would
have
echo
her
laugh
;
but
one
man
at


least
have
feel
the
divine
commotion
of
nature
's
touch
,
have
feel
and


interpret
it
,
in
word
as
fresh
as
spring
verdure
,
in
the
page
of
a


volume
that
Odo
now
draw
from
his
pocket
.




"
I
long
to
dream
,
but
some
unexpected
spectacle
continually
distract


I
from
my
musing
.
here
immense
rock
hang
their
ruinous
masse
above


my
head
;
there
the
thick
mist
of
roar
waterfall
envelop
I
;
or


some
unceasing
torrent
tear
open
at
my
very
foot
an
abyss
into
which
the


gaze
fear
to
plunge
.
sometimes
I
be
lose
in
the
twilight
of
a
thick


wood
;
sometimes
,
on
emerge
from
a
dark
ravine
,
my
eye
be
charm
by


the
sight
of
an
open
meadow
...
nature
seem
to
revel
in
unwonted


contrast
;
such
variety
of
aspect
have
she
unite
in
one
spot
.
here
be


an
eastern
prospect
bright
with
spring
flower
,
while
autumn
fruit


ripen
to
the
south
and
the
northern
face
of
the
scene
be
still
lock


in
wintry
frost
...
add
to
this
the
different
angle
at
which
the
peak


take
the
light
,
the
chiaroscuro
of
sun
and
shade
,
and
the
variation
of


light
result
from
it
at
morning
and
evening
...
sum
up
the
impression


I
have
try
to
describe
and
you
will
be
able
to
form
an
idea
of
the


enchant
situation
in
which
I
find
myself
...
the
scene
have
indeed
a


magical
,
a
supernatural
quality
,
which
so
ravish
the
spirit
and
sense


that
one
seem
to
lose
all
exact
notion
of
one
's
surrounding
and


identity
.
"




this
be
a
new
language
to
eighteenth
-
century
reader
.
already
it
have


sweep
through
the
length
and
breadth
of
France
,
like
a
spring
storm
-
wind


burst
open
door
and
window
,
and
fill
close
candle
-
light
room
with


wet
gust
and
the
scent
of
beat
blossom
;
but
south
of
the
Alps
the


new
idea
travel
slowly
,
and
the
Piedmontese
be
as
yet
scarce
aware


of
the
man
who
have
write
thus
of
their
own
mountain
.
it
be
true


that
,
some
thirty
year
early
,
in
one
of
the
very
monastery
on
which


Odo
now
look
down
,
a
swiss
vagrant
call
Rousseau
have
embrace
the


true
faith
with
the
most
move
sign
of
edification
;
but
the
rescue
of


helvetian
heretic
be
a
favourite
occupation
of
the
turinese
nobility


and
it
be
doubtful
if
any
recall
the
name
of
the
strange
proselyte
who


have
hasten
to
signalise
his
conversion
by
rob
his
employer
and


slander
an
innocent
maid
-
servant
.
odo
in
fact
owe
his
first


acquaintance
with
the
french
writer
to
Alfieri
,
who
,
in
the
interval


of
his
wandering
over
Europe
,
now
and
then
reappear
in
Turin
laden


with
the
late
novelty
in
Transalpine
literature
and
haberdashery
.


what
his
eccentric
friend
fail
to
provide
,
Odo
have
little
difficulty


in
obtain
for
himself
;
for
though
most
of
the
new
writer
be
on
the


index
,
and
the
sardinian
censorship
be
notoriously
severe
,
there
be


never
yet
a
barrier
that
could
keep
out
book
,
and
Cantapresto
be
a


skilled
purveyor
of
contraband
dainty
.
Odo
have
thus
acquaint
himself


with
the
light
literature
of
England
and
France
;
and
though
he
have


read
but
few
philosophical
treatise
,
be
yet
dimly
aware
of
the
new


standpoint
from
which
,
north
of
the
Alps
,
man
be
begin
to
test
the


accept
form
of
thought
.
the
first
disturbance
of
his
childish
faith
,


and
the
coincident
reading
of
the
Lettres
Philosophiques
,
have
be


follow
by
a
period
of
moral
perturbation
,
during
which
he
suffer


from
that
sense
of
bewilderment
,
of
inability
to
classify
the
phenomena


of
life
,
that
be
one
of
the
keen
trial
of
inexperience
.
youth
and


nature
have
their
way
with
he
,
however
,
and
a
wholesome
reaction
of


indifference
set
in
.
the
invisible
world
of
thought
and
conduct
have
be


the
frequent
subject
of
his
musing
;
but
the
other
,
tangible
world
be


close
to
he
too
,
spread
like
a
rich
populous
plain
between
himself


and
the
distant
height
of
speculation
.
the
old
doubt
,
the
old


dissatisfaction
,
hang
on
the
edge
of
consciousness
;
but
he
be
too


profoundly
italian
not
to
linger
awhile
in
that
atmosphere
of
careless


acquiescence
that
be
so
pleasant
a
medium
for
the
unhampered
enjoyment


of
life
.
some
day
,
no
doubt
,
the
intellectual
curiosity
and
the
moral


disquietude
would
revive
;
but
what
he
want
now
be
book
which


appeal
not
to
his
reason
but
to
his
emotion
,
which
reflect
as
in
a


mirror
the
rich
and
varied
life
of
the
sense
:
book
that
be
warm
to


the
touch
,
like
the
little
volume
in
his
hand
.




for
it
be
not
only
of
nature
that
the
book
speak
.
amid
scene
of
such


rustic
freshness
be
set
human
passion
as
fresh
and
natural
:
a
great


romantic
love
,
subdue
to
duty
,
yet
break
forth
again
and
again
as


young
shoot
spring
from
the
root
of
a
felled
tree
.
to


eighteenth
-
century
reader
such
a
picture
of
life
be
as
new
as
its


set
.
duty
,
in
that
day
,
to
people
of
quality
,
mean
the
observance


of
certain
fix
convention
:
the
correct
stepping
of
a
moral
minuet
;
as


an
inner
obligation
,
as
a
voluntary
tribute
to
Diderot
's
"
divinity
on


earth
,
"
it
have
hardly
yet
draw
breath
.
to
depict
a
personal
relation
so


much
purer
and
more
profound
than
any
form
of
sentiment
then
in
fashion
,


and
then
to
subordinate
it
,
unflinchingly
,
to
the
ideal
of
those
large


relation
that
link
the
individual
to
the
group
--
this
be
a
stroke
of


originality
for
which
it
would
be
hard
to
find
a
parallel
in
modern


fiction
.
here
at
last
be
an
answer
to
the
blind
impulse
agrope
in


Odo
's
breast
--
the
loosening
of
those
spring
of
emotion
that
gush


forth
in
such
fresh
contrast
to
the
stagnant
rill
of
the
sentimental


pleasure
-
garden
.
to
renounce
a
Julie
would
be
more
thrilling
than--




Odo
,
with
a
sigh
,
thrust
the
book
in
his
pocket
and
rise
to
his
foot
.
it


be
the
hour
of
the
promenade
at
the
Valentino
and
he
have
promise
the


Countess
Clarice
to
attend
she
.
the
old
high
-
roof
palace
of
the
french


princess
lie
below
he
,
in
its
garden
along
the
river
:
he
could
figure
,


as
he
look
down
on
it
,
the
throng
of
carriage
and
chair
,
the


modishly
dress
rider
,
the
pedestrian
crowd
the
footpath
to
watch


the
quality
go
by
.
the
vision
of
all
that
noise
and
glitter
deepen
the


sweetness
of
the
woodland
hush
.
he
sigh
again
.
suddenly
voice
sound


in
the
road
below
--
a
man
's
speech
fleck
with
girlish
laughter
.
odo


hang
back
listen
:
the
girl
's
voice
ring
like
a
bird
-
call
through
his


rustle
fancy
.
presently
she
come
in
sight
:
a
slend

everything

Odo
,
however
,
the
scene
suggest


the
most
tedious
part
of
his
day
's
routine
.
the
compliment
to

,

be
praise
,
the
gewgaw

sarcasm
fall
without

be
pout
at


because

have
fail
to
attend
the
promenade
of
the
Valentino
be
to


odo
but
a
convenient
pretext
for
excuse
himself
from
the
Queen
's


circle
that
evening
.
he
have
engage
with
little
ardour
to
join
Alfieri


in
what
he
guess
to
be
a
sufficiently
commonplace
adventure
;
but
as
he


listen
to
the
Countess
's
chatter
about
the
last
minuet
-
step
,
and
the


relative
merit
of
sanspareil
water
and
oil

of
-
lily
,
of
glove
from


Blois

,
his
impatience

any
alternative
as
a
release
.


meanwhile
,

,

hour
of
servitude

the
lady
's


toilet
complete
,
to
the
adjusting
of
the
last
patch
,

must
attend

to
dinner
,
where
,
place
at
her
side
,
he
be
award
the
honour
of


carve
the
roast

must
sit
through
two
hour
of
biribi
in
company
with


the
abatino

the
doctor

half
-
a

dozen
parasite
of
the

and
for
two
hour
more
must
ride
in
her
gilt
coach
up
and
down
the


promenade
of
the
Valentino
.




escape
from
this
ceremonial
,
with
the
consciousness
that
it
must
be


repeat
on
the
morrow
,
Odo
be
seize
with
that
longing
for
freedom


that
make
the
first
street
-
corner
an
invitation
to
flight
.
how
he


envy
Alfieri
,
whose
travel
-
carriage
stand
at
the
beck
of
such


mood
!
Odo
's
scant
mean
forbade
evasion
,
even
have
his
military
duty


not
keep
he
in
Turin
.
he
feel
himself
no
more
than
a
puppet
dancing
to


the
tune
of
Parini
's
satire
,
a
puny
doll
condemn
,
as
the
string
of


custom
pull
,
to
feign
the
gesture
of
immortal
passion
.






2.3
.




the
night
be
moonless
,
with
cold
dash
of
rain
,
and
though
the
street


of
Turin
be
well
-
light
no
lantern
-
ray
reach
the
winding
of
the
lane


behind
the
Corpus
Domini
.




as
Odo
,
alone
under
the
wall
of
the
church
,
await
his
friend
's


arrival
,
he
wonder
what
risk
have
constrain
the
reckless
Alfieri
to


such
unwonted
caution
.
Italy
be
at
that
time
a
vast
network
of


espionage
,
and
the
piedmontese
capital
pass
for
one
of
the


well
-
police
city
in
Europe
;
but
even
on
a
moonless
night
the
law


distinguish
between
the
noble
pleasure
-
seeker
and
the
obscure


delinquent
whose
fate
it
be
to
pay
the
other
's
shot
.
Odo
know
that
he


would
probably
be
follow
and
his
movement
report
to
the


authority
;
but
he
be
almost
equally
certain
that
there
would
be
no


active
interference
in
his
affair
.
what
chiefly
puzzle
he
be


Alfieri
's
insistence
that
Cantapresto
should
not
be
privy
to
the


adventure
.
the
soprano
have
long
be
the
confidant
of
his
pupil
's


escapade
,
and
his
adroitness
have
often
be
of
service
in
intrigue


such
as
that
on
which
Odo
now
fancy
himself
engage
.
the
place
,
again
,


perplex
he
:
a
sober
quarter
of
convent
and
private
dwelling
,
in
the


very
eye
of
the
royal
palace
,
scarce
seem
the
theatre
for
a
light


adventure
.
these
incongruity
revive
his
former
wonder
;
nor
be
this


dispel
by
Alfieri
's
approach
.




the
poet
,
mask
and
unattended
,
rejoin
his
friend
without
a
word
;
and


Odo
guess
in
he
an
eye
and
ear
alert
for
pursuit
.
guide
by
the


pressure
of
his
arm
,
Odo
be
hurried
round
the
bend
of
the
lane
,
up
a


transverse
alley
and
across
a
little
square
lose
between
high
shutter


building
.
Alfieri
,
at
his
first
word
,
grip
his
arm
with
a
backward


glance
;
then
urge
he
on
under
the
denser
blackness
of
an
arched


passage
-
way
,
at
the
end
of
which
an
oil
-
light
glimmer
.
here
a
gate
in


a
wall
confront
they
.
it
open
at
Alfieri
's
tap
and
Odo
scented
wet


box
-
border
and
feel
the
gravel
of
a
path
under
foot
.
the
gate
be
at


once
lock
behind
they
and
they
enter
the
ground
-
floor
of
a
house
as


dark
as
the
garden
.
here
a
maid

servant
of
close
aspect
meet
they
with

an
affinity

such


investigation

most
abstract
form

whether
we


regard
these

whether

lapidify
by
the


action
of
water

in
either
case

what
speculation
must
their
origin


excite

we
back

that
dark

unexplored
period

listen

confusedly

the
first
word

this
discourse

his
intellectual
curiosity
be
too
great
not

respond
to
such
an


appeal

all
his
perplexity
slip
from

in
the
pursuit
of
the


Professor

thought

one
of
the

look

the
Professor

deprecating
murmur

cut
short
by
an
outburst

the

doubtless
see
whither
such
innovation
tend
.
meanwhile
they
be


content
to
linger
in
that
wide
field
of
speculation

the


development

from
the


perfectibility
of
man
to
the
secondary
origin
of
the
earth
's
surface
.
it


be
evident
to
Odo
that
,

the
Professor

guest
represent
all


shade
of
opinion
,
some
be
clearly
loth
to

safe
anchorage

already
brave
the
sea

enquiry

yet


all
be
at
one
as
to
the
need
of
unhampered
action
and
discussion
.


Odo
's
dormant
curiosity
wake
with
a
start
at
the
summon
of
fresh


knowledge

here
be

to
explore
,

rather
the
actual
world
about


he
,
a
region
then
strange
and
more
unfamiliar
than
the
lost
Atlantis


of
fable
.
Liberty
be
the
word
on
every
lip
,
and
if
to
some
it


represent
the
right
to
doubt
the
diluvial
origin
of
fossil

merely


personal
independence

relief
from
civil
restriction
;
yet
these


fragmentary
conception
seem
,
to
Odo
's
excited
fancy
,
to
blend
in
the


vision
of
a
New
Light
encircle
the
whole
horizon
of
thought

he


understand
at

Alfieri

allusion
to
a
face
for
the
sight
of
which


man
be
ready
to
lay
down
their
life
;

if
,

he
walk
home
before

,
those
heavenly
lineament
be
blent
in
memory
with
feature
of
a


mortal
cast
,

these
be
pure
and
grave
enough
to
stand
for

Alfieri

man

rank
who
feel
an
interest
in

economic
problem
;
for
it
be


hope
that
in
this
manner
the
new
idea
might
imperceptibly
permeate
the


class

privilege
and
tradition
present
the
chief
obstacle
to

their
theory
and
apply
they
to
the
remedy
of
social
abuse

only
by


similar
mean
could
the
ideal
of
the
piedmontese

in

illusion

appear
to

Utopia

all
the

set
out
for
it

picnic
ground

of
Vivaldi
himself
,
Alfieri
speak
with
extravagant
admiration
.
his


affable
exterior
be
say
to
conceal
the
moral
courage
of
one
of


Plutarch
's
hero
.
he
be
a
man
after
the
antique
pattern
,
ready
to
lay


down
fortune
,
credit
and
freedom
in
the
defence
of
his
conviction

"




the
metaphor
be
perhaps
scarcely
to
Odo

taste

in
this
Odo

one
mind
with
he

for
though
Italy

use
to
the


spectacle
of
the
Improvisatrice
and
the
female
doctor
of

it


be
doubtful

the
character
be
one
in

any
admirer

divinity
figure

distinct
satisfaction

thus

how
much
pleasanter
to
picture
she
as

perhaps
a
sharer
in
his
dream

the

Liberty


in
the
secret
sanctuary

of
what


his
feeling
for
the
girl
be
compound
.
the
sentiment
she
have
rouse


be
one
for
which
his
experience
have
no
name

an
emotion
in
which
awe


mingle

an
almost
boyish
sense

fellowship
,

yet
lurk


out
of
sight
as
in
some
hidden
ambush
.
it
be
perhaps
her
association


with
a
world
so
unfamiliar
and
alluring
that
lend
she
for
the
moment
she


great
charm

what

,
of
studious
and
retire


habit
,
lead
the
frugal
life
of
the
italian
middle
-
class
,
a
life
in


dignified
contrast
to
the
wasteful
and
aimless
existence
of
the


nobility
.
Odo
's
sensitiveness
to
outward
impression
make
he
peculiarly


alive
to
this
contrast
.
none
be
more
open
than
he
to
the
seducement
of


luxurious
living
,
the
polish
of
manner
,
the
tacit
exclusion
of
all
that


be
ugly
or
distress
;
but
it
seem
to
he
that
fine
living
should
be


but
the
flower
of
fine
feeling
,
and
that
such
external
grace
,
when
they


adorn
a
dull
and
vapid
society
,
be
as
incongruous
as
the
royal


purple
on
a
clown
.
among
certain
of
his
new
friend
he
find
a


clumsiness
of
manner
somewhat
absurdly
ally
with
an
attempt
at
Roman


austerity
;
but
he
be
fair
-
minded
enough
to
see
that
the
middle
-
class


doctor
or
lawyer
who
try
to
play
the
Cicero
be
,
after
all
,
a
more


respectable
figure
than
the
Marquess
who
ape
Caligula
or
Commodus
.


still
,
his
lurk
dilettantism
make
he
doubly
alive
to
the
elegance
of


the
Palazzo
tournanche
when
he
go
thither
from
a
coarse
meal
in
the


stuffy
dining
-
parlour
of
one
of
his
new
acquaintance
;
as
he
never


relish
the
discourse
of
the
latter
more
than
after
an
afternoon
in
the


society
of
the
Countess
's
parasite
.




Alfieri
's
allusion
to
the
learn
lady
for
whom
Italy
be
note
make


odo
curious
to
meet
the
wife
and
daughter
of
his
new
friend
;
for
he


know
it
be
only
in
their
class
that
woman
receive
something
more
than


the
ordinary
conventual
education
;
and
he
feel
a
secret
desire
to


compare
Fulvia
Vivaldi
with
other
young
girl
of
her
kind
.
learn


lady
he
meet
,
indeed
;
for
though
the
woman
-
folk
of
some
of
the


philosopher
be
content
to
cook
and
darn
for
they
(
and
perhaps


secretly
burn
a
candle
in
their
behalf
to
Saint
Thomas
Aquinas
or
Saint


Dominick
,
refuter
of
heresy
)
,
there
be
other
who
aspire
to
all
the


honour
of
scholarship
,
and
would
order
about
their
servant
-
girl
in


tuscan
,
and
scold
their
baby
in
Ciceronian
Latin
.
among
these
fair


grammarian
,
however
,
he
meet
none
that
wear
she
learn
lightly
.
they


be
forever
trip
in
the
fold
of
their
doctor
'
gown
,
and


deliver
their
most
trivial
view
ex
cathedra
;
and
too
often
the
poor


philosopher
,
their
lord
and
father
,
cower
under
their
harangue


like
frightened
boy
under
the
tongue
of
a
schoolmaster
.




it
be
in
fact
only
in
the
household
of
Orazio
Vivaldi
that
Odo
find


the
simplicity
and
grace
of
live
for
which
he
long
.
Alfieri
have


warn
he
not
to
visit
the
Professor
too
often
,
since
the
latter
,
be


under
observation
,
might
be
compromise
by
the
assiduity
of
his
friend
.


Odo
therefore
wait
for
some
day
before
present
himself
,
and
when


he
do
so
it
be
at
the
angelus
,
when
the
street
be
crowd
and
a


man
's
coming
and
going
the
less
likely
to
be
mark
.
he
find
Vivaldi


read
with
his
daughter
in
the
long
library
where
the
Honey
-
Bees
hold


their
meeting
;
but
Fulvia
at
once
withdraw
,
nor
do
she
show
herself


again
during
Odo
's
visit
.
it
be
clear
that
,
proud
of
she
as
Vivaldi


be
,
he
have
no
wish
to
parade
her
attainment
,
and
that
in
her
daily


life
she
maintain
the
italian
habit
of
seclusion
;
but
to
Odo
she
be


everywhere
present
in
the
quiet
room
with
its
well
-
order
book
and


curiosity
,
and
the
scent
of
flower
rise
through
the
shuttered


window
.
he
be
sensible
of
an
influence
permeate
even
the
inanimate


object
about
he
,
so
that
they
seem
to
reflect
the
spirit
of
those


who
dwell
there
.
no
room
have
give
he
this
sense
of
companionship
since


he
have
spend
his
boyish
holiday
in
the
old
Count
Benedetto
's


apartment
;
but
it
be
of
another
,
intangible
world
that
his
present


surrounding
speak
.
Vivaldi
receive
he
kindly
and
ask
he
to
repeat


his
visit
;
and
Odo
return
as
often
as
he
think
prudent
.




the
Professor
's
conversation
engage
he
deeply
.
Vivaldi
's
familiarity


with
french
speculative
literature
,
and
with
its
source
in
the


experiential
philosophy
of
the
english
school
,
give
Odo
his
first
clear


conception
of
the
origin
and
tendency
of
the
new
movement
.
this


coordination
of
scatter
idea
be
aid
by
his
reading
in
the


Encyclopaedia
,
which
,
though
place
on
the
Index
in
Piedmont
,
be
to
be


find
behind
the
conceal
panel
of
more
than
one
private
library
.
from


his
talk
with
Alfieri
,
and
from
the
page
of
Plutarch
,
he
have
gain
a


certain
insight
into
the
stoical
view
of
reason
as
the
measure
of


conduct
,
and
of
the
inherent
sufficiency
of
virtue
as
its
own
end
.
he


now
learn
that
all
about
he
man
be
endeavour
to
restore
the


human
spirit
to
that
lose
conception
of
its
dignity
;
and
he
long
to


join
the
band
of
new
crusader
who
have
set
out
to
recover
the
tomb
of


truth
from
the
force
of
superstition
.
the
distinguish
mark
of


eighteenth
-
century
philosophy
be
its
eagerness
to
convert
its


acquisition
in
every
branch
of
knowledge
into
instrument
of
practical


beneficence
;
and
this
quality
appeal
peculiarly
to
Odo
,
who
have
ever


be
move
by
abstract
theory
only
as
they
explain
or
modify
the


destiny
of
man
.
Vivaldi
,
please
by
his
new
pupil
's
eagerness
to
learn
,


take
pain
to
set
before
he
this
aspect
of
the
struggle
.




"
you
will
now
see
,
"
he
say
,
after
one
of
their
long
talk
about
the


encyclopaedist
,
"
why
we
who
have
at

the

by

little


chance
against
a
handful

perfectly
logical

her
chief
danger
in
the
Encyclopaedia
's


systematised
marshalling
of
scatter
truth

as
long
as
the
attack
on

it
be
sporadic
,
she
have
little
to

from

find

it
be
a
surprise
to
Odo
to
learn
that
the

have
already
take


such
hold
in

some
of

all


eighteenth

century
Italians

he
have
be
teach
to
look
to


France
as
the
source
of
all
culture
,
intellectual

social
;
and
he
be


amazed
to
find
that
in
jurisprudence
,
and
in
some
of
the
natural


science
,
Italy
lead

her
father
always
contrive
an


excuse
for
dismiss
she

this
be
the
more
noticeable
as
she
continue


to
appear
at
the

of
the
Honey

Bees
,
where
she
join
freely
in


the

sometimes
divert
the
guest
by
play
on
the


harpsichord

by
recitation
from
the
poet

such
art

so
much
simplicity
,
that
it
be
clear
she
be


accustomed
to
the
part
.
Odo
be
thus
drive
to
the
not
unflattering


conclusion
that
she
have
be
instruct
to
avoid
his
company
;
and
after


the
first
disappointment
he
be
too
honest
to
regret
it
.
he
be
deeply


draw
to
the
girl
;
but
what
part
could
she
play
in
the
life
of
a
man
of


his
rank
?
the
cadet
of
an
impoverished
house
,
it
be
unlikely
that
he


would
marry
;
and
should
he
do
so
,
custom
forbid
even
the
thought
of


take
a
wife
outside
of
his
class
.
have
he
be
admit
to
free


intercourse
with
Fulvia
,
love
might
have
route
such
prudent
counsel
;


but
in
the
society
of
her
father
's
associate
,
where
she
move
,
as
in
a


halo
of
learning
,
amid
the
respectful
admiration
of
middle
-
aged


philosopher
and
jurist
,
she
seem
as
inaccessible
as
a
young
Minerva
.




Odo
,
at
first
,
have
be
careful
not
to
visit
Vivaldi
too
often
;
but
the


Professor
's
conversation
be
so
instructive
,
and
his
library
so


invite
,
that
inclination
get
the
well
of
prudence
,
and
the
young
man


fall
into
the
habit
of
turn
almost
daily
down
the
lane
behind
the


Corpus
Domini
.
Vivaldi
,
too
proud
to
betray
any
concern
for
his
personal


safety
,
show
no
sign
of
resent
the
frequency
of
these
visit
;


indeed
,
he
receive
Odo
with
an
increase
cordiality
that
,
to
an
old


observer
,
might
have
betoken
an
effort
to
hide
his
apprehension
.




one
afternoon
,
escape
later
than
usual
from
the
Valentino
,
Odo
have


again
bent
toward
the
quiet
quarter
behind
the
palace
.
he
be
afoot
,


with
a
cloak
over
his
laced
coat
,
and
the
day
be
Easter
Monday
the


street
be
fill
with
a
throng
of
pleasure
-
seeker
amid
whom
it


seem
easy
enough
for
a
man
to
pass
unnoticed
.
odo
,
as
he
cross
the


Piazza
Castello
,
think
it
have
never
present
a
gayer
scene
.
booth


with
brightly
-
stripe
awning
have
be
set
up
under
the
arcade
,
which


be
throng
with
idler
of
all
class
;
court
-
coach
dash
across


the
square
or
roll
in
and
out
of
the
palace
-
gate
;
and
the
Palazzo


Madama
,
lift
against
the
sunset
its
ivory
-
tint
column
and
statue
,


seem
rather
some
picture
fabric
of
Claude
's
or
Bibbiena
's
than
an


actual
building
of
brick
and
marble
.
the
turn
of
a
corner
carry
he


from
this
spectacle
into
the
solitude
of
a
by
-
street
where
his
own
tread


be
the
only
sound
.
he
walk
on
carelessly
;
but
suddenly
he
hear
what


seem
an
echo
of
his
step
.
he
stop
and
face
about
.
no
one
be
in


sight
but
a
blind
beggar
crouch
at
the
side
-
door
of
the
Corpus


Domini
.
Odo
walk
on
,
listen
,
and
again
he
hear
the
step
,
and
again


turn
to
find
himself
alone
.
he
try
to
fancy
that
his
ear
have
trick


he
;
but
he
know
too
much
of
the
subtle
method
of
italian
espionage
not


to
feel
a
secret
uneasiness
.
his
well
judgment
warn
he
back
;
but


the
desire
to
spend
a
pleasant
hour
prevail
.
he
take
a
turn
through


the
neighbouring
street
,
in
the
hope
of
divert
suspicion
,
and
ten


minute
later
be
at
the
Professor
's
gate
.




it
open
at
once
,
and
to
his
amazement
Fulvia
stand
before
he
.
she
have


throw
a
black
mantle
over
her
head
,
and
her
face
look
pale
and
vivid


in
the
fade
light
.
surprise
for
a
moment
silence
Odo
,
and
before
he


could
speak
the
girl
,
without
pause
to
close
the
gate
,
have
draw
he


toward
she
and
fling
her
arm
about
his
neck
.
in
the
first
disorder
of


his
sense
he
be
conscious
only
of
seek
her
lip
;
but
an
instant


later
he
know
it
be
no
kiss
of
love
that
meet
his
own
,
and
he
feel
she


tremble
violently
in
his
arm
.
he
see
in
a
flash
that
he
be
on
unknown


ground
;
but
his
one
thought
be
that
Fulvia
be
in
trouble
and
look
to


he
for
aid
.
he
gently
free
himself
from
her
hold
and
try
to
shape
a


soothe
question
;
but
she
catch
his
arm
and
,
lay
a
hand
over
his


mouth
,
draw
he
across
the
garden
and
into
the
house
.
the
low
floor


stand
dark
and
empty
.
he
follow
Fulvia
up
the
stair
and
into
the


library
,
which
be
also
empty
.
the
shutter
stand
wide
,
admit
the


evening
freshness
and
a
drowsy
scent
of
jasmine
from
the
garden
.




Odo
could
not
control
a
thrill
of
strange
anticipation
as
he
find


himself
alone
in
this
silent
room
with
the
girl
whose
heart
have
so


lately
beat
against
his
own
.
she
have
sink
into
a
chair
,
with
her
face


hide
,
and
for
a
moment
or
two
he
stand
before
she
without
speak
.


then
he
kneel
at
her
side
and
take
her
hand
with
a
murmur
of


endearment
.




at
his
touch
she
start
up
.
"
and
it
be
I
,
"
she
cry
,
"

and
she
sink
back
sob
.




Odo
rise
and
move
away
,
wait
for
her
overwrought
emotion
to
subside
.


at
length
he
gently
ask
,
"

you
wish
I
to
leave
you

"




she
raise
her
head

"
no

she
say
firmly
,
though
her
lip
still


tremble
;
"

an
explanation

scarce
possible

she
add
,
flush
to
the
brow
,
"
that
you
have
not


already
guess
the
purpose
of
this
lamentable
comedy
.
"




"
I
guess
nothing

"
he
reply
,
"

some
way


serve
you

she
cry
,
with
a
flash
of
anger
through
her
tear
.

be
a


late
hour

again

accuse
of
pervert

be
his
ruin

you

the
good
reparation

can
make

one
that
will


naturally

itself
to
a
gentleman

already

fully
engage
.
"

with
that

a
deep
reverence

the
inner


room

when

the
oil

lamp
at
the
end

the
arched
passage

way
shed
its
weak
circle


of
light
on
the
pavement

light
,
as
Odo
emerge
,
fall
on
a


retreat

the
blind
beggar

have
see


crouch
on
the
step
of
the
Corpus

he
run
forward
,

the
man


hurry
across
the
little
square

disappear
in
the
darkness

odo

he
lean


on
a
beggar
's
staff

the

of
Cantapresto

sick
at
heart

Odo
ramble
on
from
one
street
to
another
,
avoid
the


more
crowded
quarter
,
and
lose
himself
more
than
once
in
the


district
near
the
river
,
where
young
gentleman
of
his
figure
seldom


show
themselves
unattended
.
the
populace
,
however
,
be
all
abroad
,
and


he
pass
as
unregarded
as
though
his
sombre
thought
have
envelop
he


in
actual
darkness
.




it
be
late
when
at
length
he
turn
again
into
the
Piazza
Castello
,


which
be
brightly
light

still
throng
with
pleasure

seeker

every
incident

part
of
a

for
their
diversion

lustily

the

dash
across
the


square

Odo
,
turn
to
a
man
at
his
elbow

ask
who
the


distinguished
visitor
might
be

"

I
understand
it

only
an

good
people

in


their

be
ready
to
take
a

Odo
spend
a
restless
night
face
to
face
with
his
first
humiliation
.


though
the
girl
's
rebuff
have
cut
he
to
the
quick

it
be
the
vision

who
have
welcome
he
without
heed
of
personal
risk
,


this
indeed
be
bitter
to
his
youthful
self

sufficiency

the
thought
of


giannone

fate
be
like
a
cold
clutch
at
his
heart

there
any


balm

waste

Cantapresto
break
in
early
on
this
vigil
,
flush
with
the
importance
of


a
letter

the
Countess
Valdu

Odo

be
too
well
acquaint


with
his
mother
's
exaggeration
to
attach
much
importance
to
the


summon

be
glad
of
an
excuse
to
escape
his
daily
visit

more
striking
result

to


Odo

sparkle
under

for
the
moment

confusion

see
again
his

Pianura

the
handsome
youth
with
lace
ruffle


and
a
clouded
amber
cane

who
come
and
go
among
her
other
visitor

an
air
of
such
superiority

bore
the

thirty

the

with
a
delicate
dark
face

an


air
of
arrogance
not
unbecomingly

to
an
insinuate
courtesy

address

his
dress

sombre

with
a
star
on
the
breast

and
a


profusion
of
the
fine
lace

the
desire
to
add
dignity
and


weight
to
his
appearance
without
renounce
the
soft
ambition

his


age

receive
with
a
smile
Donna

painful
impression

past

her
very
effort

preserve


it

bridling
under
the
cool
eye
of
masculine
indifference

be
a
spectacle
the
more
humiliating
that
he
be
too
young
to
be

by
its
human

pathetic
side

all
dewy
freshness

touch
with
death

it
seem
to
he


that
his

tragic
toy

with
disgust

Trescorre

out
with

fruit

excuse
her

the
plea
of
his
official
duty

with
the


late
news

discreetly
on
the
grow
estrangement


between
the
Duke

speak
with
become
gravity
of
the


heir

weak
health

be
clear
that
the
speaker

already
deep
in

counsel

Duchess

;

indiscretion
the
cool
aim
of
the
man

never
waste
a
shot

close
of

withdraw

to
Odo
with
a
graver
manner

"
you
have
perhaps

that
in
venture

claim
the
Countess

hospitality
in
so


private
a
manner

I
have
in
mind
the
wish
to
open
myself
to
you
more


freely
than
would
be
possible
at
court
.
"
he
pause
a
moment
,
as
though


to
emphasise
his
word
;
and
Odo
fancy
he
cultivate
the
trick
of


deliberate
speak
to
counteract
his
natural
arrogance
of
manner
.
"
the


time
have
come
,
"
he
go
on
,
"
when
it
seem
desirable
that
you
should
be


more
familiar
with
the
state
of
affair
at
Pianura
.
for
some
year
it


seem
likely
that
the
duchess
would
give
his
Highness
another
son
;
but


circumstance
now
appear
to
preclude
that
hope
;
and
it
be
the
general


opinion
of
the
court
physician
that
the
young
prince
have
not
many
year


to
live
.
"
he
pause
again
,
fix
his
eye
on
Odo
's
flushed
face
.
"
the


Duke
,
"
he
continue
,
"
have
show
a
natural
reluctance
to
face
a
situation


so
painful
both
to
his
heart
and
his
ambition
;
but
his
feeling
as
a


parent
have
yield
to
his
duty
as
a
sovereign
,
and
he
recognise
the


fact
that
you
should
have
an
early
opportunity
of
acquaint
yourself


more
nearly
with
the
affair
of
the
duchy
,
and
also
of
see
something


of
the
other
court
of
Italy
.
I
be
persuade
,
"
he
add
,
"
that
,
young
as


you
be
,
I
need
not
point
out
to
you
on
what
slight
contingency
all


human
fortune
hang
,
and
how
completely
the
heir
's
recovery
or
the
birth


of
another
prince
must
change
the
aspect
of
your
future
.
you
have
,
I
be


sure
,
the
heart
to
face
such
chance
with
become
equanimity
,
and
to


carry
the
weight
of
conditional
honour
without
any
undue
faith
in
their


permanence
.
"




the
admonition
be
so
lightly
utter
that
it
seem
rather
a
tribute
to


Odo
's
good
sense
than
a
warning
to
his
inexperience
;
and
indeed
it
be


difficult
for
he
,
in
spite
of
an
instinctive
aversion

that
Count
Valdu

financial


situation
be
one
quite
unworthy
the
stepfather
of
a
reign
prince
.




escape
at
length
from
this
parody
of

it
be
clear
that

mission

mainly
a
pretext
for

the
Duke

such
sudden
concern

hardly

caution
Odo

his

the
Duke


himself
be
a
man
not
above
five

thirty
,

more
than
one
chance

be
it
this
contingency
that

his
pulse

rather
the
promise
of
an
immediate

golden
height
of

for
nine

to

among

in
Odo

case
the
joy
of
the
adventure
be
double
by
its


timeliness
.
that
fate

thus
break
at
a
stroke
the
mesh
of

should
stoop
to

of

the

thus
snap
the
toil
of

Odo
the

of
much
feminine


solicitude
,

rouse
the
Countess
Clarice
to
a
vivid
sense

these
circumstance

landscape
seem
an
image
of
anticipation
cloud


with
regret
.
he
have
have
a
stormy
but
tender
parting
with
Clarice
,
whose


effort
to
act
the
forsaken
Ariadne
be
somewhat
mar
by
she


irrepressible
pride
in
her
lover
's
prospect
,
and
whose
last
word
have


charge
he
to
bring
she
back
one
of
the
rare
lap
-
dog
breed
by
the
monk


of
Bologna
.
see
down
the
lengthening
vista
of
separation
even
Clarice


seem
regrettable
;
and
Odo
would
have
be
glad
to
let
his
mind
linger


on
their
farewell
.
but
another
thought
importune
he
.
he
have
leave


Turin
without
news
of
Vivaldi
or
Fulvia
,
and
without
having
do


anything
to
conjure
the
peril
to
which
his
rashness
have
expose
they
.


More
than
once
he
have
be
about
to
reveal
his
trouble
to
Alfieri
;
but


shame
restrain
he
when
he
remember
that
it
be
Alfieri
who
have


vouch
for
his
discretion
.
after
his
conversation
with
Trescorre
he
have


try
to
find
some
way
of
send
a
word
of
warning
to
Vivaldi
;
but
he


have
no
messenger
whom
he
could
trust
;
and
would
not
Vivaldi
justly


resent
a
warning
from
such
a
source
?
he
feel
himself
the
prisoner
of
his


own
folly
,
and
as
he
ride
along
the
wet
country
road
an
invisible


gaoler
seem
to
spur
beside
he
.




the
cloud
lift
at
noon
;
and
leave
the
plain
he
mount
into
a
world


sparkle
with
sunshine
and
quiver
with
new
-
feed
stream
.
the
first


breath
of
mountain
-
air
lift
the
mist
from
his
spirit
,
and
he
begin
to


feel
himself
a
boy
again
as
he
enter
the
high
gorge
in
the
cold
light


after
sunset
.
it
be
about
the
full
of
the
moon
,
and
in
his
impatience


to
reach
Donnaz
he
resolve
to
push
on
after
nightfall
.
the
forest
be


still
thinly
-
leave
,
and
the
rustle
of
wind
in
the
branch
and
the


noise
of
the
torrent
recall
his
first
approach
to
the
castle
,
in
the


wild
winter
twilight
.
the
way
lie
in
darkness
till
the
moon
rise
,
and


once
or
twice
he
take
a
wrong
turn
and
find
himself
engage
in
some


overgrown
woodland
track
;
but
he
soon
regain
the
high
-
road
,
and
his


servant
,
a
young
fellow
of
indomitable
cheerfulness
,
take
the
edge
off


their
solitude
by
frequent
snatch
of
song
.
at
length
the
moon
rise
,


and
toward
midnight
Odo
,
spur
out
of
a
dark
glen
,
find
himself
at


the
opening
of
the
valley
of
Donnaz
.
a
cold
radiance
bathe
the
familiar


pasture
,
the
house
of
the
village
along
the
stream
,
and
the
turret


and
crenellation
of
the
castle
at
the
head
of
the
gorge
.
the
air
be


bitter
,
and
the
horse
'
hoofs
strike
sharply
on
the
road
as
they
trot


past
the
slumber
house
and
halt
at
the
gateway
through
which
odo


have
first
be
carry
as
a
sleepy
child
.
it
be
long
before
the


traveller
'
knock
be
answer
,
but
a
bewildered
porter
at
length


admit
they
,
and
Odo
cry
out
when
he
recognise
in
the
man
's
face


the
feature
of
one
of
the
lad
who
have
teach
he
to
play
pallone
in


the
castle
court
.




within
door
all
be
abe
;
but
the
cavaliere
be
expect
,
and
supper


lay
for
he
in
the
very
chamber
where
he
have
sleep
as
a
lad
.
the
sight


of
so
much
that
be
strange
and
yet
familiar
--
of
the
old
stone
wall
,


the
banner
,
the
flare
lamp
and
wear
slippery
stair
--
all
so
much


barer
,
small
,
more
dilapidated
than
he
have
remember
--
stir
the


deep
spring
of
his
piety
for
inanimate
thing
,
and
he
be
seize
with
a


fancy
to
snatch
up
a
light
and
explore
the
recess
of
the
castle
.
but


he
have
be
in
the
saddle
since
dawn
,
and
the
keen
air
and
the
long


hour
of
riding
be
in
his
blood
.
they
weight
his
lid
,
relax
his


limb
,
and
gently
divest
he
of
his
hope
and
fear
,
press
he
down


in
the
deep
sepulchre
of
a
dreamless
sleep
...




Odo
remain
a
month
at
Donnaz
.
his
grandfather
's
happiness
in
his


presence
would
in
itself
have
suffice
to
detain
he
,
apart
from
his


natural
tenderness
for
old
scene
and
association
.
it
be
one
of
the


compensation
of
his
rapidly
travel
imagination
that
the
past
,
from


each
new
vantage
-
ground
of
sensation
,
acquire
a
fascination
which
to


the
more
sober
-
footed
fancy
only
the
perspective
of
year
can
give
.


life
,
in
childhood
,
be
a
picture
-
book
of
which
the
text
be


undecipherable
;
and
the
youth
now
revisit
the
unchanged
setting
of


his
boyhood
be
spell
out
for
the
first
time
the
legend
beneath
the


picture
.




the
old
Marquess
,
though
break
in
body
,
still
rule
his
household
from


his
seat
beside
the
hearth
.
the
failure
of
bodily
activity
seem
to


have
double
his
moral
vigour
,
and
the
wall
shake
with
the
vehemence
of


his
command
.
the
Marchioness
be
sink
in
a
state
of
placid
apathy
from


which
only
her
husband
's
outburst
rouse

;
one
of
the
canonesse

dead

and
the
other
,
dry
and
more
shrivelled
than
ever
,
pine
in
she


corner

a
statue

dog

long
since

a
corner
of
the
vineyard
;

some


of
the
young
lad
that
Odo
have
know
about
the
place
be
grow
to


sober
-
face
man
with
wife
and
child
.




Don
Gervaso
be
still
chaplain
of
Donnaz
;
and
Odo
see
with
surprise
that


the
grave
ecclesiastic
who
have
formerly
seem
an
old
man
to
he
be
in


fact
scarce
past
the
middle
age
.
in
general
aspect
he
be
unchanged
;
but


his
countenance
have
darken
,
and
what
Odo
have
once
take
for
harshness


of
manner
he
now
perceive
to
be
a
natural
melancholy
.
the
young
man
have


not
be
long
at
Donnaz
without
discover
that
in
that
little
world
of


crystallise
tradition
the
chaplain
be
the
only
person
conscious
of


the
new
force
abroad
.
it
have
never
occur
to
the
Marquess
that


anything
short
of
a
cataclysm
such
as
it
would
be
blasphemy
to
predict


could
change
the
divinely
establish
order
whereby
the
territorial
lord


take
tithe
from
his
peasantry
and
pasture
his
game
on
their
crop
.
the


hierarchy
which
rest
on
the
bow
back
of
the
toil
serf
and


culminate
in
the
figure
of
the
heaven
-
send
King
seem
to
he
as


immutable
as
the
everlasting
hill
.
the
man
of
his
generation
have
not


learn
that
it
be
build
on
a
human
foundation
and
that
a
sudden


movement
of
the
underlie
mass
might
shake
the
structure
to
its


pinnacle
.
the
Marquess
,
who
,
like
Donna
Laura
,
already
beheld
Odo
on
the


throne
of
Pianura
,
be
prodigal
of
counsel
which
show
a
touch


inability
to
discern
the
new
aspect
under
which
old
difficulty
be


likely
to
present
themselves
.
that
a
ruler
should
be
brave
,
prudent
,


personally
abstemious
,
and
nobly
lavish
in
his
official
display
;
that
he


should
repress
any
attempt
on
the
privilege
of
the
Church
,
while
at


the
same
time
protect
his
authority
from
the
encroachment
of
the


Holy
See
;
these
axiom
seem
to
the
old
man
to
sum
up
the
sovereign
's


duty
to
the
state
.
the
relation
,
to
his
mind
,
remain
a
distinctly


personal
and
paternal
one
;
and
Odo
's
attempt
to
put
before
he
the
new


theory
of
government
,
as
a
service
perform
by
the
ruler
in
the


interest
of
the
rule
,
result
only
in
stir
up
the
old
sediment
of


absolutism
which
generation
of
feudal
power
have
deposit
in
the
Donnaz


blood
.




only
the
chaplain
perceive
what
new
agency
be
at
work
;
but
even
he


look
on
as
a
watcher
from
a
distant
tower
,
who
see
oppose
army


far
below
he
in
the
night
,
without
be
able
to
follow
their
movement


or
guess
which
way
the
battle
go

I
have
only
one
answer
to
make
:


Christ
,
as
you
say
just
now
,
die
for
the
poor
--
how
many
of
your


philosopher
would
do
as
much
?
because
man
hunger
and
thirst
,
be
that
a


sign
that
he
have
forsake
they
?
and
since
when
have
earthly
privilege


be
the
token
of
his
favour
?
may
he
not
rather
have
design
that
,
by


continual
suffering
and
privation
,
they
shall
lay
up
for
themselves


treasure
in
Heaven
such
as
your
eye
and
mine
shall
never
see
or
our


ear
hear
?
and
how
dare
you
assume
that
any
temporal
advantage
could


atone
for
that
of
which
your
teaching
must
deprive
they
--
the
heavenly


consolation
of
the
love
of
Christ
?

,
"
to
confound
Christ
with

more
endurable
life
on

most
particular

Cavaliere

and
he

out
a
perfumed
billet

with
a


flame

Odo
's
heart
give
a
leap
at
the
thought
that
the
letter
might
be
from


Fulvia

but
on
break
the
seal
he
read
these
word
,
scrawl
in
an


unformed
hand:--




"
will
the
Cavaliere
Valsecca
accept
from
an
old
friend

who
desire
to

trifling
gift
of

side

box
at
Don


Tartaglia

entertainment
this
evening

"




vex
at
his
credulity
,
Odo
toss
the
invitation
to
Cantapresto
;
but
a


moment
later
,
recall
the
glance
of
the
pretty
girl
in
the


market
-
place
,
he
begin
to
wonder
if
the
billet
might
not
be
the
prelude


to
a
sufficiently
divert
adventure
.
it
at
least
offer
a
way
of


pass
the
evening
;
and
after
a
hurried
supper
he
set
out
with


cantapresto
for
the
Philodramatic
Academy
.
it
be
late
when
they
enter


their
box

already
caper
before
the


footlight

lazzi
with
the
townsfolk
in
the
pit
,
and


address
burlesque
compliment
to
the
quality
in
the
box
.
the


theatre
seem
small
and
shabby
after
those
of
Turin
,
and
there
be


little
in
the
old
-
fashioned
fopperie
of
a
provincial
audience

lady

the
town

for
their
charm

the
main
diversion
of
the
evening

by
this
begin

be
a
comedy
in


the
style
of
Goldoni
's
early
piece
,
represent
the
actual
life
of
the


day
,
but
intersperse
with
the
antic
of
the
mask
,
to
whose
improvise


drollery
the
people
still
clung

and
the
part
of


Tartaglia

take
by
the
manager
,
one
of
the
well

know
interpreter


of
the
character
in
Italy

be
the
guardian
of
the
prima


amorosa

the
enamour

;
and
in
the
Columbine

when


she

upon
the
stage
with
a
pirouette
that
show
her
slender


ankle
and

Odo
instantly
recognise
the
graceful


figure
and
kill
glance
of
his
mask
beauty
.
her
face
,
which
be
now


uncover
,
more
than
fulfil
the
promise
of
her
eye
,
be
indeed
as


arch
and
engage
a
countenance
as

across
the


foot

she
be

with
an
outburst
of
delight
that
cost
she
a


sour
glance
from
the
prima
amorosa
,
and
presently
the
theatre
be


ring
with
her
improvise
sally
,
utter
in
the
gay
staccato
of
the


venetian
dialect
.
there
be
to
Odo
something
perplexingly
familiar
in


this
accent
and
in
the
light
dart
movement
of
her
little
head
frame


in
a
Columbine
's
ruff
,
with
a
red
rose
thrust
behind
one
ear
;
but
after


a
rapid
glance
about
the
house
she
appear
to
take
no
notice
of
he
and


he
begin
to
think
it
must
be
to
some
one
else
he
owe
his
invitation
.




from
this
question
he
be
soon
divert
by
his
increase
enjoyment
of


the
play
.
it
be
not
indeed
a
remarkable
example
of
its
kind
,
be


crudely
enough
put
together
,
and
turn
on
a
series
of
ridiculous
and


disconnected
incident
;
but
to
a
taste
form
on
the
frigid
elegancie


of
Metastasio
and
the
french
stage
there
be
something
refreshing
in


this
plunge
into
the
coarse
homely
atmosphere
of
the
old
popular


theatre
.
extemporaneous
comedy
be
no
long
play
in
the
great


city
,
and
Odo
listen
with
surprise
to
the
swift
thrust
and
parry
,


the
inexhaustible
flow
of
jest
and
repartee
,
the
readiness
with
which


the
comedian
catch
up
each
other
's
lead
,
like
dancer
whirl


without
a
false
step
through
the
maze
of
some
rapid
contradance
.




so
engaged
be
he
that
he
no
long
observe
the
Columbine
save
as
a


figure
in
this
fly
reel
;
but
presently
a
burst
of
laughter
fix
his


attention
and
he
see
that
she
be
dart
across
the
stage

by


Milord

who
,
furious
at
the
coquetry
of
his
betrothed
,
be


avenge
himself
by
his
attention
to

rush
to
the
rescue
;


but
spring
up
instantly
,
and
feign
to
treat
his
advance
as
a
part


of
the
play
,
she
cry
out
with
a
delicious
assumption
of
outraged


dignity:--




"
not
a
step

,
villain
!

sacrilege
for

his
most
illustrious

"

spring
to

.
at
the
same
instant
the


Columbine
turn
about
and
sweep
he
a
deep
curtsey
,
to
the
delight
of


the
audience
,
who
have
no
notion
of

forward
,
but
be
in


the
humour
to
clap
any
whim
of
their
favourite
's
;
then
she
turn
and


dart
off
the
stage
,
and
the
curtain
fall
on
a
tumult
of
applause
.




Odo
have
hardly
recover
from
his
confusion
when
the
door
of
the
box

and
the
young
Scaramouch
he
have
see
in
the
market

in
and

with
alacrity
,

odo
alone
in
the
dimly
-
light
box
,
his
mind
agrope
in

furtive


relish
that
always
proclaim
he

bearer
of
a
tender
message
.
the


one
he
now
bring

to
the
effect
that
the
Signorina
Miranda


Malmocco

justly
renowned
as
one
of
the
first
Columbines
of

her
excuse
for
the


liberty

with
she
after

a
request

be
embolden
to
make
by
the


fact
that
she

lately
from
Pianura

could
give
he
the
last
news


of
the
court

the
message
chime
with
Odo
's
mood
,
and
the
play
over
he
hasten
back


to
the
inn
with
Cantapresto
,
and
bid
the
landlord

carriage


should
be
at
the
door
the
next
morning
an
hour
before

now
repeat
these
instruction
to

charge
he
on
his
life


to
see
that
nothing
interfere
with
their
fulfilment
.
the
soprano


object
that
the
hour
be
already
late
,
and
that
they
could
easily


perform
the
day
's
journey
without
curtail
their
rest
;
but
on
Odo
's


reiteration
of
the
order
he
resign
himself
,

the
remark
that

.




it
be
something
of
a
disappointment
to
Odo

on
enter
the
Signorina


Miranda
's
room
,
to
find
that
she

not
alone

the
young
man
who
have
give
she
his
arm


in
the
Piazza

this
gentleman
,
whom
she
introduce
to
Odo
as
her
cousin


and
travel
companion
,
the
Count
of
Castelrovinato
,
have
the
same
air


of
tarnished
elegance
as
his
richly
-
laced
coat
and
discolour
ruffle
.


he
seem
,
however
,
of
a
lively
and
oblige
humour
,
and
Mirandolina


observe
with
a
smile
that
she
could
give
no
well
notion
of
his


amiability
than
by
mention
that
he
be
know
among
her
friend
as
the


Cavaliere
Frattanto
.
this
praise
,
Odo
think
,
seem
scarcely
to
the


cousin
's
liking
;
but
he
carry
it
off
with
the
philosophic
remark
that


it
be
the
mortar
between
the
brick
that
hold
the
building
together
.




"

fall
desperately
in
love
with
our
prima
amorosa

a


lady
who
lose
her
virtue
under
the
Pharaohs

whom
,
for
his

,
I


have
be
oblige
to
include
in
our
little
supper
.
"




this
,
it
be
clear
,
be
merely
a
way
of
palliate
the
Count
's


infatuation
for
herself
;
but
he
take
the
second
thrust
as
good
-
naturedly


as
the
first
,
remark
that
he
have
be
breed
for
an
archeologist
and


have
never
lose
his
taste
for
the
antique

air
of


apprehension
with
which
Odo
have
appear
to
seek
,
among
the
dowdy
or


vulgar
inmate
of
the
box
,
the
sender
of
the
mysterious
billet
;
and


the
contrast
between
the
elegant
gentleman
in
embroider
coat
and


gold
-
hilted
sword
,
and
the
sleepy
bewildered
little
boy
of
the
midnight


feast
at
Chivasso
,
have
seize
she
with
such
comic
effect
that
she
could


not
resist
a
playful
allusion
to
their
former
meeting

all
this

set


forth
with
so
sprightly
an
air
of
mock
-
contrition
that
,
have
Odo
feel
the


least
resentment

must

the
humour
to
be
pleased
by
whatever

his

to

something
of
what

MIRANDOLINA
'S
story

you
must
know
,
she
continue
,
when
Odo
have
comply
with
her
request

that
soon
after
our
parting
at
Chivasso
the
company
with
which
I
be


travel
come
to
grief

this


bring
we
to
destitution
,

the
troop

disband
.
I
have
nothing


but
the
spangle
frock
on
my
back
,
and
think
to
make
some
use
of
my


sole
possession
I
set
out
as
a
dancer
with
the
flute
-
player
of
the


company
,
a
good
-
natured
fellow
that
have
a
perform
marmozet
from
the


indie

day
attach
ourselves
to
some
band

one
day
,
after
about
a
year
of
this
life
,
I
have
the
good
fortune
,
in
the


market
-
place
of
Parma
,
to
attract
the
notice
of
a
rich
english
nobleman


who
be

in

a
book
on
the
dance
of
the
ancient

this


gentleman
,
though
no
long
young
,
and
afflict
with
that
strange


english
malady
that
oblige
a
man
to
wrap
his
foot
in
swaddling
-
clothe


like
a
new

bear
infant
,
be
of
a
generous
and
paternal
disposition
,
and


offer
,
if
I
would
accompany
he
to
Florence
,
to
give
I
a
home
and
a


genteel
education
.
I
remain
with
he
about
two
year
,
during
which


time
he
have
I
carefully
instruct
in
music
,
french
and
the
art
of
the


needle
.
in
return
for
this
,
my
principal
duty
be
to
perform
in


antique
dance
before
the
friend
of
my
benefactor
--
whose
name
I
could


never
learn
to
pronounce
--
and
to
read
aloud
to
he
the
work
of
the


modern
historian
and
philosopher
.




we
live
in
a
large
palace
with
exceedingly
high
-
ceilinge
room
,
which


my
friend
would
never
have
warm
on
account
of
his
plethoric
habit
,
and


as
I
have
to
dance
at
all
season
in
the
light
drapery
wear
by
the


classical
goddess
,
I
suffer
terribly
from
chilblain
and
contract


a
cruel
cough
.
to
this
,
however
,
I
might
have
resign
myself
;
but
when


I
learn
from
a
young
abate
who
frequent
the
house
that
the
book
I


be
compel
to
read
be
condemn
by
the
Church
,
and
could
not
be


peruse
without
deadly
peril
to
the
soul
,
I
at
once
resolve
to
fly
from


such
contaminating
influence
.
know
that
his
lordship
would
not


consent
to
my
leave
he
,
I
take
the
matter
out
of
his
hand
by


slip
out
one
day
during
the
carnival
,
carry
with
I
from
that


accurse
house
nothing
but
the
few
jewel
that
my
benefactor
have


express
the
intention
of
leave
I
in
his
will
.
at
the
near
church


I
confess
my
involuntary
sin
in
read
the
prohibit
book
,
and


having
receive
absolution
and
the
sacrament
,
I
join
my
friend
the


abate
at
Cafaggiolo
,
whence
we
travel
to
Modena
,
where
he
be


acquaint
with
a
theatrical
manager
just
then
in
search
of
a
Columbine
.


my
dancing
and
posturing
at
Florence
have
give
I
something
of
a
name


among
the
dilettanti
,
and
I
be
at
once
engage
by
the
manager
,
who
take


I
to
Venice
,
where
I
subsequently
join
the
company
of
the
excellent


Tartaglia
with
whom
I
be
now
act
.
since
then
I
have
be
attend
by


continue
success
,
which
I
can
not
but
ascribe
to
my
virtuous
resolve
to


face
poverty
and
distress
rather
than
profit
a
moment
long
by
the


beneficence
of
an
atheist
.




all
this
I
have
relate
to
show
you
how
the
poor
ignorant
girl
you
meet


at
Chivasso
be
able
to
acquire
something
of
the
art
and
usage
of
good


company
;
but
I
will
now
pass
on
to
the
incident
of
my
visit
to
Pianura
.


our
manager
,
then
,
have
engage
some
time
since
to
give
a
series
of


performance
at
Pianura
during
the
last
carnival
.
the
Bishop
's
nephew
,


Don
Serafino
,
who
have
a
pronounce
taste
for
the
theatre
,
have
be


instrumental
in
make
the
arrangement
;
but
at
the
last
moment
he
write


we
that
,
owe
to
the
influence
of
the
Duke
's
confessor
,
the
Bishop
have


be
oblige
to
prohibit
the
appearance
of
woman
on
the
stage
of


Pianura
.
this
be
a
cruel
blow
,
as
we
have
prepare
a
number
of
comedy


in
which
I
be
to
act
the
lead
part
;
and
Don
Serafino
be
equally


vex
,
since
he
do
I
the
honour
of
regard
I
as
the
chief
ornament


of
the
company
.
at
length
it
be
agree
that
,
to
overcome
the


difficulty
,
it
should
be
give
out
that
the
celebrated
Tartaglia
of


Rimini
would
present
himself
at
Pianura
with
his
company
of
comedian
,


among
whom
be
the
popular
favourite
,
Mirandolino
of
Chioggia
,
twin


brother
of
the
Signorina
Miranda
Malmocco
,
and
train
by
that
actress


to
play
in
all
her
principal
part
.




this
satisfy
the
scruple
and
interest
of
all
concerned
,
and
soon


afterward
I
make
my
first
appearance
in
Pianura
.
my
success
be
great


than
we
have
foresee
;
for
I
throw
myself
into
the
part
with
such
z


that
every
one
be
take
in
,
and
even
Don
Serafino
require
the
most


categorical
demonstration
to
convince
he
that
I
be
not
my
own
brother
.


the
illusion
I
produce
be
,
however
,
not
without
its
inconvenience
;


for
,
among
the
lady
who
throng
to
see
the
young
Mirandolino
,
be


several
who
desire
a
close
acquaintance
with
he
;
and
one
of
these
,
as


it
happen
,
be
the
Duke
's
mistress
,
the
Countess
Belverde
.
you
will


see
the
embarrassment
of
my
situation
.
if
I
fail
to
respond
to
she


advance
,
her
influence
be
sufficient
to
drive
we
from
the
town
at
the


opening
of
a
prosperous
season
;
if
I
discover
my
sex
to
she
,
she
might


more
cruelly
avenge
herself
by
throw
the
whole
company
into
prison
,


to
be
deal
with
by
the
Holy
Office
.
under
these
circumstance
,
I


decide
to
appeal
to
the
Bishop
,
but
without
,
of
course
,
reveal
to


he
that
I
be
,
so
to
speak
,
my
own
sister
.
his
lordship
,
who
be
never


sorry
to
do
the
Belverde
a
bad
turn
,
receive
I
with
the
utmost


indulgence
,
and
declare
that
,
to
protect
my
innocence
from
the
design


of
this
new
Potiphar
's
wife
,
he
would
not
only
give
I
a
lodging
in
the


Episcopal
palace
,
but
confer
on
I
the
additional
protection
of
the


minor
order
.
this
be
rather
more
than
I
have
bargain
for
,
but
he
that


want
the
melon
be
a
fool
to
refuse
the
rind
,
and
I
thank
the
Bishop


for
his
kindness
and
allow
he
to
give
out
that
,
my
heart
having
be


touch
by
grace
,
I
have
resolve
,
at
the
end
of
the
season
,
to
withdraw


from
the
stage
and
prepare
to
enter
the
Church
.




I
now
fancy
myself
safe
;
for
I
know
the
Countess
could
not
attempt
my


removal
without
risk
of
have
her
passion
denounce
to
the
Duke
.
I


spend
several
day
very
agreeably
in
the
Episcopal
palace
,
entertain


at
his
lordship
's
own
table
,
and
favour
with
private
conversation


during
which
he
tell
I
many
curious
and
interesting
thing
about
the


Duke
and
the
court
,
and
delicately
abstain
from
all
allusion
to
my


come
change
of
vocation
.
the
Countess
,
however
,
have
not
be
idle
.
one


day
I
receive
notice
that
the
Holy
Office
disapprove
of
the
appearance


on
the
stage
of
a
young
man
about
to
enter
the
Church
,
and
request
I


to
withdraw
at
once
to
the
Barnabite
monastery
,
where
I
be
to
remain


till
I
receive
the
minor
order
.
now
the
Abbot
of
the
Barnabites
be


the
Belverde
's
brother
,
and
I
see
at
once
that
to
obey
his
order
would


place
I
in
that
lady
's
power
.
I
again
address
myself
to
the
Bishop
,


but
to
my
despair
he
declare
himself
unable
to
aid
I
far
,
say


that
he
dared
not
offend
the
Holy
Office
,
and
that
he
have
already
run


considerable
risk
in
protect
I
from
the
Countess
.




I
be
accordingly
transfer
to
the
monastery
,
in
spite
of
my
own


entreaty
and
those
of
the
good
Tartaglia
,
who
move
heaven
and
earth


to
save
his
Columbine
from
sequestration
.
you
may
imagine
my
despair
.
my


fear
of
do
Tartaglia
an
injury
keep
I
from
reveal
my
sex
,
and
for


twenty
-
four
hour
I
languish
in
my
cell
,
refuse
food
and
air
,
and


resist
the
repeat
attempt
of
the
good
monk
to
alleviate
my


distress
.
at
length
however
I
bethought
I
that
the
Countess
would
soon


appear
;
and
it
flash
across
I
that
the
one
person
who
could
protect


I
from
she
be
her
brother
.
I
at
once
seek
an
interview
with
the


Abbot
,
who
receive
I
with
great
indulgence
.
I
explain
to
he
that


the
distress
I
suffer
be
occasion
by
the
loss
that
my
sequestration


be
cause
my
excellent
manager
,
and
beg
he
to
use
his
influence
to


have
I
release
from
the
monastery
.
the
Abbot
listen
attentively
,
and


after
a
pause
reply
that
there
be
but
one
person
who
could
arrange


the
matter
,
and
that
be
his
sister
the
Countess
Belverde
,
whose


well
-
know
piety
give
her
considerable
influence
in
such
matter
.
I
now


see
that
no
alternative
remain
but
to
confess
the
truth
;
and
with


tear
of
agitation
I
avow
my
sex
,
and
throw
myself
on
his
mercy
.




I
be
not
disappoint
in
the
result
.
the
Abbot
listen
with
the


great
benevolence
to
all
the
detail
of
my
adventure
.
he
laugh


heartily
at
his
sister
's
delusion
,
but
say
I
have
do
right
in
not


undeceive
she
,
as
her
dread
of
ridicule
might
have
lead
to
unpleasant


reprisal
.
he
declare
that
for
the
present
he
could
not
on
any
account


consent
to
let
I
out
of
his
protection
;
but
he
promise
if
I
submit


myself
implicitly
to
his
guidance
,
not
only
to
preserve
I
from
the


Belverde
's
machination
,
but
to
ensure
my
reappearing
on
the
stage


within
two
day
at
the
late
.
know
he
to
be
a
very
powerful


personage
I
think
it
well
to
accept
these
condition
,
which
in
any


case
it
would
have
be
difficult
to
resist
;
and
the
next
day
he


inform
I
that
the
Holy
Office
have
consent
to
the
Signorina
Miranda


Malmocco
be
appear
on
the
stage
of
Pianura
during
the
remainder
of
the


season
,
in
consideration
of
the
financial
injury
cause
to
the
manager


of
the
company
by
the
edify
conversion
of
her
twin
-
brother
.




"
in
this
way
,
"
the
Abbot
be
pleased
to
explain
,
"
you
will
be
quite
safe


from
my
sister
,
who
be
a
woman
of
the
most
unexceptionable
moral
,
and


at
the
same
time
you
will
not
expose
our
excellent
Bishop
to
the
charge


of
having
be
a
party
to
a
grave
infraction
of
ecclesiastical


discipline.--my
only
condition
,
"
he
add
with
a
truly
paternal
smile
,


"
be
that
,
after
the
Signorina
Miranda
's
performance
at
the
theatre
she


twin
-
brother
the
Signor
Mirandolino
shall
return
every
evening
to
the


monastery
:
a
condition
which
seem
necessary
to
the
preservation
of
our


secret
,
and
which
I
trust
you
will
not
regard
as
too
onerous
,
in
view
of


the
service
I
have
be
happy
enough
to
render
you
.
"




it
would
have
ill
become
I
to
dispute
the
excellent
ecclesiastic
's


wish
,
and
Tartaglia
and
the
rest
of
the
company
having
be

to


secrecy

that
very
evening

one
of
my

afterward

on

with
some
agitation
that

Miranda
wish
the

Odo
wake
with
a
start
.
he
have
be
try
to
break
down
a
great


gold
-
bar
gate
,
behind
which
Fulvia
,
pale
and
disorder
,
struggle
in


the
clutch
of
the
blind
beggar
of
the
Corpus
Domini
...




he
sit
up
and
look
about
he
.
the
gate
be
still
there
;
but
as
he


gaze
it
resolve
itself
into
his
shuttered
window
,
bar
with
wide


line
of
sunlight
.
it
be
day
,
then
!
he
spring
out
of
bed
and
fling
open


the
shutter

beneath
he
lie
the
piazza
of
Vercelli

bathe
in
the


vertical
brightness
of
a
summer
noon
;
and
as
he
stare
out
on
this


inexorable
scene
,
the
clock
over
the
Hospital
strike
twelve
.




twelve
o'clock
!
and
he
have
promise
to
meet
Vivaldi
at
dawn
behind
the


Umiliati

as
the
truth
force
itself
on
Odo
he
drop
into
a
chair
and


hide
his
face
with
a
groan
.
he
have
fail
they
again
,
then
--
and
this
time


how
cruelly
and
basely
!
he
feel
himself
the
victim
of
a
conspiracy
which


in
some
occult
manner
be
forever
force
he
to
outrage
and
betray
the


two
being

most
long
to

.

idea
of
a
conspiracy
flash
a


sudden
light
on
his
evening
's
diversion
,
and
he
spring
up
with
a
cry
.


yes
!
it
be
a
plot
,
and
any
but
a
dolt
must
have
trace
the
soprano
's


hand
in
this
vulgar
assault
upon
his
sense
.
he
choke
with
anger
at
the


think
of
having
play
the
dupe
when
two
life
he
cherish
be


stake
upon
his
vigilance
...




to
his
furious
summon
Cantapresto
present
a
blank
wall
of
ignorance
.


yes
,
the
Cavaliere
have
give
order
that
the
carriage
should
be
ready


before
daybreak
;
but
who
be
authorise
to
wake
the
cavaliere
?
after


keep
the
carriage
two
hour
at
the
door
Cantapresto
have
venture
to


send
it
back
to
the
stable
;
but
the
horse
should
instantly
be
put
to
,


and
within
an
hour
they
would
be
well
forward
on
their
journey
.


meanwhile
,
should
the
barber
be
summon
at
once
?
or
would
the
cavaliere


first
refresh
himself
with
an
excellent
cup
of
chocolate
,
prepare
under


Cantapresto
's
own
supervision
?




Odo
turn
on
he
savagely
.
"
traitor
--
spy
!
in
whose
pay--
?
"




but
the
word
rouse
he
to
a
fresh
sense
of
peril
.
cantapresto
,
though


he
might
have
guess
Odo
's
intention
,
be
not
privy
to
his
plan
of


rejoin
Vivaldi
and
Fulvia
;
and
it
flash
across
the
young
man
that


his
self
-
betrayal
must
confirm
the
other
'
suspicion
.
his
one
hope
of


protect
his
friend
be
to
affect
indifference
to
what
have
happen
;


and
this
be
make
easy
,
by
the
reflection
that
Cantapresto
be
after


all
but
a
tool
in
more
powerful
hand
.
to
be
spy
on
be
so
natural
to


an
Italian
of
that
day
that
the
victim
's
instinct
be
rather
to


circumvent
the
spy
than
to
denounce
he
.




Odo
dismiss
Cantapresto
with
the
reply
that
he
would
give
order
about


the
carriage
later
;
desire
that
meanwhile
the
soprano
should
purchase


the
handsome
set
of
filigree
ornament
to
be
find
in
Vercelli
,
and


carry
they
with
the
Cavaliere
Valsecca
's
compliment
to
the
Signorina


Malmocco
.




having
thus
rid
himself
of
observation
he
dress
as
rapidly
as


possible
,
try
the
while
to
devise
some
mean
of
trace
Vivaldi
.
but


the
long
he
ponder
the
attempt
the
more
plainly
he
see
its
futility
.


Vivaldi
,
doubtless
from
motive
of
prudence
,
have
not
name
the
friend


with
whom
he
and
Fulvia
be
to
take
shelter
;
nor
do
Odo
even
know
in


what

to
question
the
police
be
to


risk
their
last
chance
of
safety
;
and
for
the
same
reason
he
dare
not


enquire
of
the
posting
-
master
whether
any
traveller
have
set
out
that


morning
for
Lombardy
.
his
natural
activity
of
mind
be
hamper
by
a


leaden
sense
of
remissness
.
with
what
anguish
of
spirit
must
Vivaldi
and


Fulvia
have
await
he
in
that
hour
of
dawn
behind
the
convent
!
what


thought
must
have
visit
the
girl
's
mind
as
day
broaden
,
the
city


wake
,
and
peril
press
on
they
with
every
voice
and
eye
!
and
when
at


length
they
see
that
he
have
fail
they
,
which
way
do
their
hunt


footstep
turn
?
perhaps
they
dared
not
go
back
to
the
friend
who
have


take
they
in
for
the
night
.
perhaps
even
now
they
wander
through
the


street
,
fear
arrest
if
they
reveal
themselves
by
venture
to


engage
a
carriage
,
at
every
turn
of
his
thought
Odo
be
mock
by
some


vision
of
disaster
;
and
an
hour
of
perplexity
yield
no
happy


expedient
than
that
of
repair
to
the
meeting
-
place
behind
the


Umiliati
.
it
be
a
deserted
lane
with
few
passer
;
and
after
vainly


question
the
blank
wall
of
the
convent
and
the
gate
of
a


sinister
-
look
alm
-
house
that
face
it
,
he
retrace
his
step
to
the


inn
.




he
spend
a
day
of
futile
research
and
bitter
thought
,
now
stray


forth
in
the
hope
of
meet
Vivaldi
,
now
hasten
back
to
the
three


crown
on
the
chance
that
some
message
might
await
he
.
he
dared
not
let


his
mind
rest
on
what
might
have
befall
his
friend
;
yet
the


alternative
of
contemplate
his
own
course
be
scarcely
more
endurable
.


Nightfall
bring
the
conviction
that
the
Professor
and
Fulvia
have


pass
beyond
his
reach
.
it
be
clear
that
if
they
be
still
in


Vercelli
they
do
not
mean
to
make
their
presence
know
to
he
,
while
in


the
event
of
their
escape
he
be
without
mean
of
trace
they
far
.


he
know
indeed
that
their
destination
be
Milan
,
but
,
should
they
reach


there
safely
,
what
hope
be
there
of
find
they
in
a
city
of


stranger
?
by
a
stroke
of
folly
he
have
cut
himself
off
from
all


communication
with
they
,
and
his
misery
be
enhance
by
the
discovery
of


his
weakness
.
he
who
have
feed
his
fancy
on
high
vision
,
cherish
in


himself
the
latent
patriot
and
hero
,
have
be
drive
by
a
girl
's
caprice


to
break
the
first
law
of
manliness
and
honour
!
the
event
have
already


justify
she
;
and
in
a
flash
of
self
-
contempt
he
see
himself
as
she
no


doubt
behold
he
--
the
fribble
preying
like
a
summer
insect
on
the
slow


growth
of
difficult
year
...




in
bitterness
of
spirit
he
set
out
the
next
morning
for
Pianura
.
a


half
-
melancholy
interest
draw
he
back
to
the
scene
of
his
lonely


childhood
,

he
have
start
early
in

to
push
on
that
night
to

ceremony
over
,
the
tall
man
advance
to
Odo
with
a
bow
and
ask


pardon
for
the
liberty
he
have
take
.




"
you
be
doubtless
,
"
say
he
,
"
his
Highness
's
cousin
,
the
Cavaliere


Valsecca
;
and
my
excuse
for
intrude
between
yourself
and
the
prince
be


that
I
be
the
Duke
's
physician
,
Count
Heiligenstern
,
and
that
the
heir


be
at
present
undergo
a
course
of
treatment
under
my
care
.
his


health
,
as
you
probably
know
,
have
long
be
a
cause
of
anxiety
to
his


illustrious
parent
,
and
when
I
be
summon
to
Pianura
the
College
of


Physicians
have
give
up
all
hope
of
save
he
.
since
my
coming
,


however
,
I
flatter
myself
that
a
marked
change
be
perceptible
.
my
method


be
that
of
invigorate
the
blood
by
excite
the
passion
most
likely


to
produce
a
generous
vital
ardour
.
thus
,
by
organise
these
juvenile


manoeuvre
,
I
arouse
the
prince
's
martial
zeal
;
by
encourage
he
to


study
the
history
of
his
ancestor
,
I
evoke
his
political
ambition
;
by


cause
he
to
be
lead
about
the
garden
on
a
pony
,
accompany
by
a


miniature
pack
of
maltese
dog
in
pursuit
of
a
tame
doe
,
I
stimulate
the


passion
of
the
chase
;
but
it
be
essential
to
my
system
that
one
emotion


should
not
violently
counteract
another
,
and
I
be
therefore
oblige
to


protect
my
noble
patient
from
the
sudden
intrusion
of
new
impression
.
"




this
explanation
,
deliver
in
a
sententious
tone
,
and
with
a
strong


german
accent
,
seem
to
Odo
no
more
than
a
learn
travesty
of
the


familiar
and
pathetic
expedient
of
distract
a
sick
child
by
the


pretence
of
manly
diversion
.
he
be
strike
,
however
,
by
the
physician
's


aspect
,
and
would
have
engage
he
in
talk
have
not
one
of
the
Duke
's


gentleman
appear
with
the
announcement
that
his
Highness
would
be


pleased
to
receive
the
Cavaliere
Valsecca
.




like
most
dwelling
of
its
kind
in
Italy
,
the
palace
of
Pianura


resemble
one
of
those
shell
which
reveal
by
their
outer
convolution


the
gradual
development
of
the
creature
house
within
.
for
two
or
three


generation
after
Bracciaforte
,
the
terrible
founder
of
the
line
,
have


make
himself
master
of
the
republic
,
his
descendant
have
clung
to
the


old
brick
fortress
or
rocca
which
the
great
condottiere
have
hold


successfully
against
the
burgher
'
arquebus
and
the
battering
-
ram
of


rival
adventurer
,
and
which
still
glass
its
battlement
in
the
slow


water
of
the
Piana
beside
the
city
wall
.
it
be
Ascanio
,
the
first


Duke
,
the
correspondent
of
Politian
and
Castiglione
,
who
,
find
the


ancestral
lair
too
cramp
for
the
court
of
a
humanist
prince
,
have


summon
Luciano
da
Laurana
to
build
a
palace
well
fit
to
his


state
.
Duke
Ascanio
,
in
bronze
by
Verocchio
,
still
look
up
with
pride


from
the
palace
-
square
at
the
brick
and
terra
-
cotta
facade
with
its


fruit
-
wreathe
arch
crown
by
imperial
profile
;
but
a
later
prince


find
the
small
room
and
intricate
passage
of
Laurana
's
structure


inadequate
to
the
pomp
of
an
ally
of
Leo
X.
,
and
Vignola
add
the
state


apartment
,
the
sculpture
gallery
and
the
library
.




the
palace
now
pass
for
one
of
the
wonder
of
Italy
.
the
Duke
's
guest
,


the
witty
and
learn
Aretino
,
celebrate
it
in
verse
,
his
friend


Cardinal
Bembo
in
prose
;
Correggio
paint
the
wall
of
one
room
,
Guilio


romano
the
ceiling
of
another
.
it
seem
that
magnificence
could
go
no


far
,
till
the
seventeenth
century
bring
to
the
throne
a
Duke
who


ask
himself
how
a
self
-
respect
prince
could
live
without
a
theatre
,


a
riding
-
school
and
an
additional
wing
to
lodge
the
ever
-
grow
train


of
court
official
who
have
by
this
time
replace
the
feudal
man
-
at
-
arm
.


he
answer
the
question
by
lay
an
extra
tax
on
his
people
and


invite
to
Pianura
the
great
roman
architect
Carlo
Borromini
,
who


regretfully
admit
that
his
illustrious
patron
be
on
the
whole
less


royally
house
than
their
highness
of
Mantua
and
Parma
.
within
five


year
the
"
cavallerizza
,
"
the
theatre
and
the
garden
fling
defiance
at


these
aspire
potentate
;
and
again
Pianura
take
precedence
of
she


rival
.
the
present
Duke
's
father
have
express
the
most
recent
tendency


of
the
race
by
the
erection
of
a
chapel
in
the
florid
Jesuit
style
;
and


the
group
of
building
thus
chronicle
in
rich
durable
line
the
vary


passion
and
ambition
of
three
hundred
year
of
power
.




as
Odo
follow
his
guide
toward
the
Duke
's
apartment
he
remark
a


change
in
the
aspect
of
the
palace
.
where
formerly
the
corridor
have


be
throng
with
page
,
lacquey
and
gaily
-
dress
cavalier
and


lady
,
only
a
few
ecclesiastic
now
glide
by
:
here
a
Monsignore
in


ermine
and
lace
rochet
,
attend
by
his
chaplain
and
secretary
,
there


a
cowl
Dominican
or
a
sober
-
look
secular
priest
.
the
Duke
be


lodge
in
the
old
portion
of
the
palace
,
and
Odo
,
who
have
never


visit
these
apartment
,
look
with
interest
at
the
projecting


sculpture
chimney
and
vault
ceiling
of
the
page
'
ante
-
chamber
,
which


have
formerly
be
the
guardroom
and
be
still
hang
with
panoply
.


thence
he
be
lead
into
a
gallery
line
with
scriptural
tapestry
and


furnish
in
the
heavy
style
of
the
seventeenth
century
.
here
he
wait


a
few
moment
,
hear
the
sound
of
conversation
in
the
room
beyond
;


then
the
door
of
this
apartment
open
,
and
a
handsome
Dominican
pass


out
,
follow
by
a
page
who
invite
Odo
to
step
into
the
Duke
's
cabinet
.




this
be
a
very
small
room
,
completely
panel
in
delicate
wood
-
carving


touch
with
gold
.
over
this
panelling
,
regardless
of
the
beauty
of
its


design
,
have
be
hang
a
mass
of
reliquary
and
small
devotional


bas
-
relief
and
painting
,
make
the
room
appear
more
like
the
chapel


of
a
wonder
-
work
saint
than
a
prince
's
closet
.
here
again
Odo
find


himself
alone
;
but
the
page
presently
return
to
say
that
his
highness


be
not
well
and
beg
the
cavaliere
to
wait
on
he
in
his
bed
-
chamber
.




the
most
conspicuous
object
in
this
room
be
a
great
bedstead
raise
on


a
dais
.
the
plume
post
and
sumptuous
hanging
of
the
bed
give
it
an


altar
-
like
air
,
and
the
Duke
himself
,
who
lie
between
the
curtain
,
his


wig
replace
by
a
nightcap
,
a
scapular
about
his
neck
,
and
his


shrivelled
body
wrap
in
a
brocade
dressing
-
gown
,
look
more
like
a


relic
than
a
man
.
his
heavy
under
-
lip
tremble
slightly
as
he
offer


his
hand
to
Odo
's
salute
.




"
you
find
I
,
cousin
,
"
say
he
after
a
brief
greeting
,
"
much
trouble
by


a
question
that
have
of
late
incessantly
disturb
my
rest

the
soul
,


after
full
intuition
of
God
,
be
pollute
by
the
sin
of
the
body

"
he


clutch
Odo
's
hand
in
his
burn
grasp
.

it
possible
that
there

human
being
so
heedless
of
their
doom
that
they
can
go
about
their


earthly
pleasure
with
this
awful
problem
unsolved

oh
,
why
have
not
some


Pope
decide
it
?
why
have
God
leave
this
hideous
uncertainty

over


we

you
know
the
doctrine
of
Plotinus--'he
who
have
access
to
God

the
virtue
behind

as
the
image
of

god

the

that
the
Neoplatonists
be


permit
to
foreshadow
in
their
teaching
the
revelation
of
Christ
;
but


on
these
occult
point
much
doubt
remain
,
and
though
certain
of
the


great
theologian

incline
to
this
interpretation

Odo

the
Duke
's
opening
word
an
allusion

little

ill

to
some
political
anxiety

at
a
loss


how
to

to
this
strange
appeal
;

after
a
moment

and


I
be
so
angry
with
you
that
I
get
up
and
turn
my
back
on
the


company
--
do
you
remember
?
but
how
should
you
,
be
such
a
child
at
the


time
?
ah
,
cousin
how
old
you
make
I
feel
!
I
would
to
God
my
son
look


as
you
do
then
;
but
the
Duke
be
kill
he
with
his
nostrum
.
the


child
be
healthy
enough
when
he
be
bear
;
but
what
with
novena
and


touch
of
relic
and
animal
magnetism
and
electrical
treatment
,


there
be
not
a
bone
in
his
little
body
but
the
saint
and
the
surgeon


be
fight
over
its
possession
.
have
you
read
'
emile
,
'
cousin
,
by
the


new
french
author
--
I
forget
his
name
?
well
,
I
would
have
the
child


bring
up
like
'
Emile
,
'
allow
to
run
wild
in
the
country
and
grow
up


sturdy
and
hard
as
a
little
peasant
.
but
what
heresy
be
I
talk
!
the


book
be
on
the
Index
,
I
believe
,
and
if
my
director
know
I
have
it
in
my


library
I
should
be
set
up
in
the
stock
in
the
market
-
place
and
all
my


court
-
gown
burn
at
the
Church
door
as
a
warning
against
the
danger
of


import
the
new
fashion
from
France!--I
hope
you
hunt
,
cousin
?
"
she


cry
suddenly
.
"
'
tis
my
chief
diversion
and
one
I
would
have
my
friend


enjoy
with
I
.
his
Highness
have
lately
see
fit
to
cut
down
my
stable
,


so
that
I
have
scarce
forty
saddle
-
horse
to
my
name
,
and
the
great


part
but
sorry
nag
at
that
;
yet
I
can
still
find
a
mount
for
any
friend


that
will
ride
with
I
and
I
hope
to
see
you
among
the
number
if
the


Duke
can
spare
you
now
and
then
from
mass
and
benediction
.
his
highness


complain
that
I
be
always
surround
by
the
same
company
;
but
be
it
my


fault
if
there
be
not
twenty
person
at
court
that
can
survive
a
day
in


the
saddle
and
a
night
at
card
?
have
you
see
the
Belverde
,
my
mistress


of
the
robe
?
she
follow
the
hunt
in
a
litter
,
cousin
,
and
tell
she


bead
at
the
death
!
I
hope
you
like
card
too
,
cousin
,
for
I
would
have


all
my
weakness
share
by
my
friend
,
that
they
may
be
the
less


disposed
to
criticise

on
the

by
several
member
of
the
group

she


Highness
.
one
of
these
be
Count
Trescorre
,
who
move
among
the


courtier
with
an
air
of
ease
that
seem
to
establish
without


proclaim
the
tie
between
himself
and
the
Duchess
.
when
Maria


Clementina
sit
down
at
play
,
Trescorre
join
Odo
and
with
his
usual


friendliness
point
out
the
most
conspicuous
figure
in
the
circle
.
the


duchess

society
,
as
the
Duke
have
imply
,
be
compose
of
the
lively


member
of
the
court
,
chief
among
whom
be
the
same
Don
Serafino
who
have


figure
so
vividly
in
the
reminiscence
of
Mirandolina
and
Cantapresto
.


this
gentleman
,
a
notorious
loose
-
liver
and
gamester
,
with
some
remain


of
good
look
and
a
gay
boisterous
manner
,
play
the
leader
of
revel


to
her
Highness
's
following
;
and
at
his
heel
come
the
flock
of
pretty


woman
and
dash
spendthrift
who
compose
the
train
of
a
young
and


pleasure

love
princess

on
such
occasion
as
the
present

the
member
of
the
court

oblige
to
pay
their
duty
to
her
Highness
;


and
conspicuous
among
these
less
frequent
visitor
be
the
Duke
's


director
,
the
suave
and
handsome
Dominican
whom
Odo
have
see
leave
his


Highness
's
closet
that
afternoon
.
this
ecclesiastic
be

in


conversation
with
the
Prime
Minister
,
Count
Pievepelago
,
a
small
feeble


mannikin
cover
with
gold
lace
and
order
.
the
deference
with
which
the


latter
follow
the
Dominican
's
discourse
excite
Odo
's
attention
;
but


it
be
soon
divert
by
the
approach
of
a
lady
who
join
herself
to
the


group
with
an
air
of
discreet
familiarity
.
though
no
long
young
,
she


be
still
slender
and
graceful
,
and
her
languid
eye
and
vapourish
manner


seem
to
Odo
to
veil
an
uncommon
alertness
of
perception
.
the
rich


sobriety
of
her
dress
,
the
jewel
rosary
about
her
wrist
,
and
most
of


all
,
perhaps
,
the
murderous
sweetness
of
the
smile
with
which
the


duchess
address
she
,
tell
he
that
here
be
the
Countess
Belverde
;
an


inference
which
Trescorre
confirm
.




"

Countess

he
,

I
should
rather
say

Marchioness

Boscofolto
,
since
the
Duke
have
just
bestow
on
she
the
fief
of
that


name
,
be
impatient
to
make
your
acquaintance
;
and
since
you
doubtless


remember
the
saying
of
the
Marquis
de
Montesquieu
,
that
to
know
a
ruler


one
must
know
his
confessor
and
his
mistress
,
you
will
perhaps
be
glad


to
seize
both
opportunity
in
one
.
"




the
Countess
greet
Odo
with
a
flattering
deference
and
at
once
draw


he
into
conversation
with
Pievepelago

Dominican

to

the
honour

highness

their
return

peril

during
the


great
plague
of
1630

during
the
famine
in

Countess
sigh

down

eye

silent

quietly
to

increase
desire

penetrate
more


deeply
into
the
organisation
of
the
little
world
about

trace
the


operation

various
part

to
put
his
hand
on
the
mainspring


about
which
they
revolve
;

he
wonder
whether
Gamba

whose


connection
with
the
ducal
library
must
give
he
some
insight
into
the


affair

threshold

leave
behind
the
trivial
activity
of
the
palace
,
with
the
fantastic


architecture
which
seem
their
natural
setting

here
all
be

noble
permanence

convergence
of
accumulate
effort

gladly

linger
among

book
which
fill
the
room


with
an
incense
-
like
aroma
of
old
leather

imagination

yellowish
vellum

Aldine
folio

the
heavy
silver
clasp
of
ancient
chronicle

first
object
be
to
find
Gamba
and
renew
the
conversation
of
the


previous
day
.
in
this
he
be
disappointed
.
the
only
occupant
of
the


library

the
hunchback
's
friend
and
protector
,

abate
Crescenti
,
a


tall
white

haired
priest
with
the
roseate
gravity
and
benevolent
air
of


a
donator
in
some
flemish
triptych

abate

certain
ancient
record
of
transaction
between
that


order
and
the
Lords
of
Valsecca

add
that
Gamba
,
on
his
return
,


should
at
once
be
apprise
of
the
cavaliere

his
visitor

collate
manuscript

on
Odo
's
beg
he
to
return
to
his
work

he
say
with
a
smile

such
research

uncivilised
past

my
life

of


contemplate
the
illustrious
deed
of
greek
sage
and
roman
hero
,
I


confidently
reply
that
it
be
more
useful
to
a
man
to
know
his
own


father
's
character
than
that
of
a
remote
ancestor
.
even
in
this
quiet


retreat
,
"
he
go
on
,
"
I
hear
much
talk
of
abuse
and
of
the
need
for


reform
;
and
I
often
think
that
if
they
who
rail
so
loudly
against


exist
institution
would
take
the
trouble
to
trace
they
to
their


source
,
and
would
,
for
instance
,
compare
this
state
as
it
be
today
with


its
condition
five
hundred
or
a
thousand
year
ago
,
instead
of
measure


it
by
the
standard
of
some
imaginary
platonic
republic
,
they
would
find
,


if
not
less
subject
for
complaint
,
yet
full
mean
of
understanding
and


remedy
the
abuse
they
discover
.
"




this
view
of
history
be
one
so
new
in
the
abate
Crescenti
's
day
that
it


surprise
Odo
with
the
revelation
of
unsuspected
possibility
.
how
be


it
that
among
the
philosopher
whose
work
he
have
study
,
none
have


thought
of
trace
in
the
social
and
political
tendency
of
the
race


the
germ
of
wrong
so
confidently
ascribe
to
the
cunning
of
priest
and


the
rapacity
of
prince
?
Odo
listen
with
grow
interest
while


Crescenti
,
encourage
by
his
question
,
point
out
how
the
abuse
of


feudalism
have
arise
from
the
small
land
-
owner
's
need
of
protection


against
the
northern
invader
,
as
the
concentration
of
royal
prerogative


have
be
the
outcome
of
the
king
's
intervention
between
his
great


vassal
and
the
commune
.
the
discouragement
which
have
obscure
Odo
's


outlook
since
his
visit
to
Pontesordo
be
clear
away
by
the
discovery


that
in
a
sympathetic
study
of
the
past
might
lie
the
secret
of
deal


with
present
evil
.
his
imagination
,
take
the
intervene
obstacle
at


a
bound
,
arrive
at
once
at
the
general
axiom
to
which
such
induction


point
;
and
if
he
afterward
learn
that
human
development
follow
no


such
direct
line
of
advance
,
but
must
painfully
stumble
across
the


waste
of
error
,
prejudice
and
ignorance
,
while
the
theoriser
traverse


the
same
distance
with
a
stroke
of
his
speculative
pinion
;
yet
the


influence
of
these
teaching
temper
his
judgment
with
charity
and


dignify
his
very
failure
by
a
tragic
sense
of
their
inevitableness
.




Crescenti
suggest
that
Gamba
should
wait
on
Odo
that
evening
;
but
the


latter
,
be
uncertain
how
far
he
might
dispose
of
his
time
,
enquire


where
the
hunchback
lodge
,
with
a
view
of
send
for
he
at
a


convenient
moment
.
having
dine
at
the
Duchess
's
table
,
and
soon


weary
of
the
vapid
company
of
her
associate
,
he
yield
to
the


desire
for
contrast
that
so
often
guide
his
course
,
and
set
out
toward


sunset
in
search
of
Gamba
's
lodging
.




it
be
his
first
opportunity
of
inspect
the
town
at
leisure
,
and
for


a
while
he
let
his
curiosity
lead
he
as
it
would
.
the
street
near
the


palace
be
full
of
noble
residence
,
recording
,
in
their
sculpture


doorway

in
the
wrought

iron
work
of
torch

holder
and
window

grille
,


and
in
every
architectural
detail
,
the
gradual
change
of
taste
that
have


transform
the
machicolation
of
the
mediaeval
fighter
into
the
open


cortile
and
airy
balcony
of
his
descendant
.
here
and
there
,
amid


these
inveterate
record
of
dominion
,
rise
the
monument
of
a
mighty


and
more
ancient
power
.
of
these
church
and
monastery

great


number
,

only
from
the
ascendancy
of
the
Valseccas

an


order

sumptuous
architecture

from
the
period
of
the
free
city

out
among
they
with
the
austerity


of
desert
saint
in
a
throng

porphyry

generation
of
lounger
;
and
above
the
octagonal
baptistery


run
a
fantastic
basrelief
wherein
the
spiral
of
the
vine
frame
an


allegory
of
man
and
monster
symbolise
,
in
their
mysterious
conflict
,


the
ever
-
recur
Manicheism
of
the
middle
age
.
fresh
from
his
talk


with
Crescenti
,
Odo
linger
curiously
on
these
sculpture
,
which
but


the
day
before
he
might
have
pass
by
as
the
effort
of
ignorant


workman
,
but
which
now
seem
full
of
the
significance
that
belong
to


any
incomplete
expression
of
human
thought
or
feeling
.
of
their
relation


to
the
growth
of
art
he
have
as
yet
no
clear
notion
;
but
as
evidence
of


sensation
that
his
forefather
have
struggle
to
record
,
they
touch


he
like
the
inarticulate
stammering
in
which
childhood
strive
to


convey
its
meaning
.




he
find
Gamba
's
lodge
on
the
upper
floor
of
a
decayed
palace
in
one


of

folly

innocence

"
what
part
I
play
in
this
grim
business
I
leave
your
excellency
to


conceive
.
as
the
Marquess

creature
I
be
force
to
assist
at
the


spectacle
without
power

consequence

when
the
child

bear
I
carry
the
news
to
my
master

beg
he
to
come
to
the


mother

aid

answer
,
he
have
I
beat
by
his
lacquey

fling
out


of
his
house

I
stomach
the
beating

address
myself
to
Trescorre
.


my
noble
brother
,
whose
insight
be
seldom
at
fault

see
that
I
know


enough

the

his
enemy

afford


to
be
generous

he
give
I
a
little
money

the
following
year


obtain
from
the
Duke
my
appointment
as
assistant
librarian

in
this


way
I
be
able
to
give
Momola
a
home
,

to
save
her
child
from
the


Innocenti
.
she
and
I
,
cavaliere

be
the
misshapen
offspring
of
that


cruel
foster

parent
,
who
rear
more
than
half
the
malefactor

heaven
the
boy

have
a
well
start

narrative

so


strangely
on
the
spectacle
of
sordid
misery

witness

inarticulate

a
sickly
growth
of
the
decay
social
order

he
feel


an
almost
physical
longing
for
fresh
air

light
,
the
rush
of
a
purifying


wind
through
the
atmosphere
of
moral
darkness
that
surround
he
.






2.12
.




to
relieve
the
tension
of
his
thought
he
set
forth
to
Gamba
the
purpose


of
his
visit
.




"
I
be
,
"
say
he
,
"
much
like
a
stranger

all
the


mask
be
acquaint
with
each
other

concert
to


mystify
the
visitor

among
the
person
I
have
meet
at
court
several
have


show
themselves
ready
to
guide
I
through
this
labyrinth
;
but
,
till


they
themselves
unmask
and
declare
their
true
character
,
I
be
doubtful


whither
they
may
lead
I
;
nor
do
I
know
of
any
so
well
fit
as


yourself
to
give
I
a
clue
to
my
surrounding
.
as
for
my
own
disguise

"


he
add
with
a
smile
,
"
I
believe
I
remove
it
sufficiently
on
our
first


meet

leave
you
no

as
to
the
use
to
which
your
information


will
be
put

"




Gamba
,
who
seemed
touch
by
this
appeal
,
nevertheless
hesitate
before


reply
.
at
length
he
say
:
"
I
have
the
full
trust
in
your


excellency
's
honour
;
but
I
must
remind
you
that
during
your
stay
here


you
will
be
under
the
close
observation

that
any
opinion
you


express
will
at

attribute
to
the

I
would
not

"
he
continue
hastily
,
"
say
this
for
myself


alone
,
but
I
have
two
mouth
to
feed
and
my
view
be
already
under


suspicion
.
"




reassure
by
Odo
's
protestation
,
or
rather
,
perhaps
,
by
the
more


convince
warrant
of
his
look
and
manner
,
Gamba
proceed
to
give
he
a


detailed
description
of
the
little
world
in
which
chance
have
place


they
.




"
if
you
have
see
the
Duke
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
need
not
tell
you
that
it
be


not
he
who
govern
the
duchy
.
we
be
rule
at
present
by
a
triumvirate

of
the
Belverde
,
the
Dominican

Pievepelago
,


the
Prime
Minister

a
dummy
put
in
place
by
the
Jesuits
and
keep


there
by
the
rivalry
of
the
other
three
;
but
he
be
in
his
dotage
and


the
courtier
be
already
lay
wager
as
to
his
successor
.
many
think


Father
Ignazio
will
replace
he
,
but
I
stake
my
faith
on
Trescorre
.
the


Duke
dislike
he
,
but
he
be
popular
with
the
middle
class
,
who
,
since


they
have
shake
off
the
yoke
of
the
Jesuits
,
would
not
willingly
see
an


ecclesiastic
at
the
head
of
the
state

the
duchess
's
influence

her

you

with
the
austrian
court
,
be
by
tradition
unfavourable
to
the
Church


party
.
the
Duchess
's
preference
would
weigh
little
with
the
Duke
be


it
not
that
she
be
sole
heiress
to
the
old
Duke
of
Monte
Alloro

that
any
attempt
to
bring
that
principality
under
the
control
of
the


Holy
See
might
provoke
the
interference

Austria

"
in
so
ticklish
a
situation
I
see
none
but
Trescorre
to
maintain
the


political
balance

he
have
be
adroit
enough
to
make
himself
necessary


to
the
Duchess
without
alienate
the
Duke

have
introduce
one

have
give
he
a
name
for
liberality
in
spite
of


the
heavy
taxis
with
which
he
have
load
the
peasantry
;

have
in
short


so
play
his
card
as
to
profit
by
the
foible
of
both
party

Highness

"
he
continue
,
in
reply
to
a
question
of
Odo
's
,
"
be
much


take
by
he
when
she
first
come
to
Pianura
;

before
her
feeling
have


cool
he
have
contrive
to
make
himself
indispensable
to
she

she
by
her
besetting
weakness

before

appointment
she


extravagance
be
the
scandal
of
the
town

she
borrow
from
her
lady
,


her
page
,
her
very
lacquey
;
when
she
go
on
a
visit
to
her
uncle
of


Monte
Alloro

pocket
the
money

on
her
servant

nay
,

even

of
rob
the
Marchioness
of
Pievepelago

who
,


having
wear
one
evening
a
diamond
necklace
which
excite
her
Highness
's


admiration
,
be
waylay
on
the
way
home
and
the
jewel
tear
from
she


neck
by
a
crowd
of
mask
ruffian
among
whom
she
be
say
to
have


recognise
one
of
the
ducal
servant
.
these
be
doubtless
idle
report
;


but
it
be
certain
that
Trescorre
's
appointment
engage
he
still
more
to


the
Duchess
by
enable
he
to
protect
she
from
such
calumny
;
while
by


increase
the
land
taxis
he
have
discharge
the
bad
of
her
debt
and


thus
make
himself
popular
with
the
tradesman
she
have
ruin
.
your


excellency
must
excuse
my
attempt
to
paint
the
private
character
of


her
Highness
.
such
fact
as
I
have
report
be
of
public
notoriety
,
but


to
exceed
they
would
be
an
unwarranted
presumption
.
I
know
she
have
the


name
of
be
affable
to
her
dependent
,
capable
of
a
fitful
generosity
,


and
easily
move
by
distress
;
and
it
be
certain
that
her
domestic


situation
have
be
one
to
excite
pity
and
disarm
criticism
.




"
with
regard
to
his
Highness
,
it
be
difficult
either
to
detect
his


motive
or
to
divine
his
preference
.
his
youth
be
spend
in
pious


practice
;
and
a
curious
reason
be
give
for
the
origin
of
this
habit
.


he
be
educate
,
as
your
excellency
be
doubtless
aware
,
by
a
french


philosopher
of
the
school
of
Hobbes
;
and
it
be
say
that
in
the
interval


of
his
task
the
poor
Duke
,
bewilder
by
his
governor
's
distinction


between
conception
and
cognition
,
and
the
object
and
the
sentient
,
use


to
spend
his
time
pray
the
saint
to
assist
he
in
his
atheistical


study
;
indeed
a
satire
of
the
day
ascribe
he
as
make
a
novena
to


the
Virgin
to
obtain
a
clear
understanding
of
the
universality
of


matter
.
other
with
more
likelihood
aver
that
he
frequent
the
church


to
escape
from
the
tyranny
of
his
pedagogue
;
and
it
be
certain
that
from


one
cause
or
another
his
education
throw
he
into
the
opposite
extreme


of
a
superstitious
and
mechanical
piety
.
his
marriage
,
his
difference


with
the
Duchess
,
and
the
evil
influence
of
Cerveno
,
expose
he
to
new


temptation
,
and
for
a
time
he
lead
a
life
which
seem
to
justify
the


bad
charge
of
the
enemy
of
materialism
.
recent
event
have
fling


he
back
on
the
exaggerated
devotion
of
his
youth
,
and
now
,
when
his


health
permit
,
he
spend
his
time
serve
mass
,
singe
in
the
choir
at


benediction
and
make
pilgrimage
to
the
relic
of
the
saint
in
the


different
church
of
the
duchy
.




"
a
few
year
since
,
at
the
instigation
of
his
confessor

ducal
gallery

about

here
you
may
assist
at


interminable
dispute
as
to
the
relative
merit
of

dissertation

as
to
the
question

agitate
the
world
,
they
be
hold
of


less
account
than
a
problem
in
counterpoint

the
construction
of
a


doubtful
line
in
Ovid

as
Truth

she
can
scarce
hope


to
be
receive
in
good
company
;
and
her
appearance
would
probably
cause


as
much
confusion
among
the
Bishop
's
literati
as
in
the
council
of
the


Holy
Office
.
"




the
old
analogy
liken
the
human
mind
to
an
imperfect
mirror
,
which


modify
the
image
it
reflect
,
occur
more
than
once
to
Odo
during


the
hunchback
's
lively
delineation
.
it
be
impossible
not
to
remember


that
the
speaker
owe
his
education
to
the
charity
of
the
order
he


denounce
;
and
this
fact
suggest
to
Odo
that
the
other
light
and


shadow
in
the
picture
might
be
dispose
with
more
art
than
accuracy
.


still
,
they
doubtless
embody
a
negative
truth
,
and
Odo
think
it


probable
that
such
intellectual
diversion
as
he
could
hope
for
must
be


seek
in
the
Bishop

Odo
,
ride
beside
the
Duke
's
litter
,
have
leisure
to
note
not
only
the


diverse
feature
of
the
procession
but
their
vary
effect
on
the


spectator
.
it
be
plain
that
,
as
Trescorre
have
say
,
the
pilgrimage
be


popular
with
the
people
.
that
imaginative
sensuousness
which
have


perpetually
renew
the
Latin
Church
by
give
form
and
colour
to
she


dogmatic
abstraction
,
by
transform
every
successive
phase
of
she


belief
into
something
to
be
see
and
handle
,
find
an
irresistible


outlet
in
a
ceremony
that
seem
to
combine
with
its
devotional
intent
a


secret
element
of
expiation
.
the
little
prince
be
dimly
feel
to
be


pay
for
the
prodigality
of
his
father
,
to
be
in
some
way
a
link
of


suffer
between
the
tongue
-
tie
misery
of
the
field
and
the
insolent


splendour
of
the
court
;
and
a
vague
faith
in
the
vicarious
efficacy
of


his
devotion
draw
the
crowd
into
momentary
sympathy
with
its
ruler
.
yet


this
be
but
an
underlying
element
in
the
instinctive
delight
of
the


people
in
the
outward
form
of
their
religion
.
Odo
's
late
experience


have
waken
he
to
the
influence
act
on
that
obscure
substratum
of


human
life
that
still
seem
,
to
most
man
of
his
rank
,
of
no
more


account
than
the
brick
lining
of
their
marble
-
coat
palace
.
as
he


watch
the
mount
excitement
of
the
throng
,
and
picture
to
himself


the
life
suddenly
light
up
by
this
pledge
of
unseen
promise
,
he
wonder


that
the
enemy
of
the
Church
should
ascribe
her
predominance
to
any


cause
but
the
natural
need
of
the
heart
.
the
people
live
in
unlit


hovel
,
for
there
be
a
tax
on
mental
as
well
as
on
material
window
;


but
here
be
a
light
that
could
pierce
the
narrow
crevice
and
scatter


the
darkness
with
a
single
ray
.




Odo
note
with
equal
interest
the
impression
produce
by
the
various


member
of
the
court
and
the
Church
dignitary
.
the
Duke
's
litter
be


coldly
receive
,
but
a
pity
murmur
widen
about
the
gilt
chair
in


which
Prince
Ferrante
be
seat
at
his
governor
's
side
,
and
the


approach
of
Trescorre
,
mount
on
a
fine
horse
and
dress
with
his


usual
sober
elegance
,
wake
a
shout
that
make
he
for
a
moment
the


central
figure
of
the
procession
.
the
Bishop
be
none
too
warmly


welcome
;
but
when
Crescenti
appear
,
white
-
haired
and
erect
among
the


parish
priest
,
the
crowd
sway
toward
he
like
grass
in
the
suction


of
a
current
;
and
one
of
the
Duke
's
gentleman
,
see
Odo
's
surprise
,


say
with
a
smile
:
"
no
one
do
more
good
in
Pianura
than
our
learn


librarian
.
"




a
different
and
still
more
striking
welcome
await
the
Duchess
,
who


presently
appear
on
her
favourite
white
hackney
,
surround
by
the


member
of
her
household
.
her
reluctance
to
take
part
in
the
pilgrimage


have
be
overcome
by
the
exhilaration
of
show
herself
to
the
public
,


and
as
she
ride
along
in
her
gold
-
embroider
habit
and
plume
hat
she


be
just
such
an
image
of
radiant
and
indulgent
sovereignty
as
turn


enforce
submission
into
a
romantic
allegiance
.
her
flush
cheek
and


kindle
eye
show
the
reaction
of
the
effect
she
produce
,
and
if
she


subject
forget
her
debt
,
her
violence
and
folly
,
she
be
perhaps


momentarily
transform
into
the
be
their
enthusiasm
create
.
she
be


at
any
rate
keenly
alive
to
the
admiration
she
excite
and
eager
to


enhance
it
by
those
showy
impulse
of
benevolence
that
catch
the
public


eye
;
as
when
,
at
the
city
gate
,
she
stop
her
horse
to
intervene
in


behalf
of
a
soldier
who
have
be
put
under
arrest
for
some
slight


infraction
of
duty
,
and
then
ride
on
envelop
in
the
passionate


shout
of
the
crowd
.




the
shrine
at
which
the
young
prince
be
to
pay
his
devotion
stand
just


beyond
the
city
,
on
the
summit
of
one
of
the
low
knoll
which
pass
for


hill
in
the
level
landscape
of
Pianura
.
the
white
-
columne
church
with


its
classical
dome
and
portico
have
be
erect
as
a
thank
-
offering


after
the
plague
of
1630
,
and
the
nave
be
line
with
life
-
sized
votive


figure
of
Dukes
and
Duchesses
clothe
in
the
actual
wig
and
robe
that


have
dress
their
transient
grandeur
.
as
the
procession
wind
into
the


church
,
to
the
ringing
of
bell
and
the
chanting
of
the
choir
,
Odo
be


strike
by
the
spectacle
of
that
line
of
witness
,
watch
in


glassy
-
eye
irony
the
pomp
and
display
to
which
their
moldering
robe


and
tarnish
insignia
seem
to
fix
so
brief
a
term
.
once
or
twice


already
he
have
feel
the
show
of
human
power
as
no
more
than
vanish


reflection
on
the
tide
of
be
;
and
now
,
as
he
knelt
near
the
shrine
,


with
its
central
glitter
of
jewel
and
its
nimbus
of
wavering
light
,


and
listen
to
the
reiterated
ancient
wail
:




    
"
Mater
inviolata
,
ora
pro
nobis
!


    
Virgo
veneranda
,
ora
pro
nobis
!


    
Speculum
justitiae
,
ora
pro
nobis
!
"




it
seem
to
he
as
though
the
bound
of
life
and
death
be
merge
,
and


the
sumptuous
group
of
which
he
form
a
part
already
dust
over
with


oblivion
.






2.13
.




spite
of
the
Mountain
Madonna
's
much
-
vaunted
power
,
the
first
effect
of


the
pilgrimage
be
to
provoke
a
serious
indisposition
in
the
Duke
.


exhaust
by
fasting
and
emotion
,
he
withdraw
to
his
apartment
and
for


several
day
deny
himself
to
all
but
Heiligenstern
,
who
be
suspect


by
some
of
suffer
his
patient
's
disorder
to
run
its
course
with
a


view
to
prove
the
futility
of
such
remedy
.
this
break
in
his


intercourse
with
his
kinsman
leave
Odo
free
to
take
the
measure
of
his


new
surrounding
.
the
company
most
naturally
engage
he
be
that
which


surround
the
Duchess
;
but
he
soon
weary
of
the
trivial
diversion
it


offer
.
it
have
ever
be
necessary
to
he
that
his
pleasure
should


touch
the
imagination
as
well
as
the
sense
;
and
with
such
refinement
of


enjoyment
the
gallant
of
Pianura
be
unacquainted
.
odo
indeed


perceive
with
a
touch
of
amusement
that
,
in
a
society
where
Don


serafino
set
the
pace
,
he
must
need
lag
behind
his
own
lacquey
.


Cantapresto
have
,
in
fact
,
be
hail
by
the
Bishop
's
nephew
with
a


cordiality
that
proclaim
they
old
associate
in
folly
;
and
the


soprano
's
manner
seem
to
declare
that
,
if
ever
he
have
hold
the
candle


for
Don
Serafino
,
he
do
not
grudge
the
grease
that
might
have
drop


on
his
cassock
.
he
be
soon
prime
favourite
and
court
buffoon
in
the


duchess
's
circle
,
organise
pleasure
-
party
,
compose
scenario
for


her
Highness
's
private
theatre
,
and
produce
at
court
any
comedian
or


juggler
the
report
of
whose
ability
reach
he
from
the
market
-
place
.


indefatigable
in
the
contriving
of
such
diversion
,
he
soon
virtually


pass
out
of
Odo
's
service
into
that
of
her
highness
:
a
circumstance


which
the
young
man
the
less
regret
as
it
leave
he
free
to
cultivate


the
acquaintance
of
Gamba
and
his
friend
without
expose
they
to


Cantapresto
's
espionage
.




Odo
have
feel
himself
specially
draw
toward
the
abate
Crescenti
;
and
the


afternoon
after
their
first
meeting
he
have
repair
to
the
librarian
's


dwell
.
Crescenti
be
the
priest
of
an
ancient
parish
lie
near
the


fortress
;
and
his
tiny
house
be
wedge
in
an
angle
of
the
city
wall
,


like
a
bird
's
nest
in
the
mouth
of
a
disused
canon
.
a
long
flight
of


step
lead
up
to
his
study
,
which
on
the
farther
side
open
level
with
a


vine
-
shaded
patch
of
herb
and
damask
rose
in
the
projection
of
a


ruin
bastion
.
this
interior
,
the
home
of
studious
peace
,
be
as


cheerful
and
well
-
order
as
its
inmate
's
mind
;
and
Odo
,
seat
under


the
vine
pergola
in
the
late
summer
light
,
and
taste
the
abate
's
Val


Pulicella
while
he
turn
over
the
warped
page
of
old
code
and


chronicle
,
feel
the
steal
charm
of
a
sequester
life
.




he
have
learn
from
Gamba
that
Crescenti
be
a
faithful
parish
priest
as


well
as
an
assiduous
scholar
,
but
he
see
that
the
librarian
's


beneficence
take
that
purely
personal
form
which
may
coexist
with
a


serene
acceptance
of
the
general
evil
underlie
particular
hardship
.


his
charity
be
perform
in
the
old
unquestione
spirit
of
the


roman
distribution
of
corn
;
and
doubtless
the
good
man
who
carry
his


loaf
of
bread
and
his
word
of
hope
into
his
neighbour
's
hovel
reap
a


more
tangible
return
than
the
lonely
thinker
who
scheme
to
undermine


the
stronghold
of
injustice
.
still
there
be
a
perplexing
contrast


between
the
superficiality
of
Crescenti
's
moral
judgment
and
the


breadth
and
penetration
of
his
historic
conception
.
Odo
be
too


inexperienced
to
reflect
that
a
man
's
sense
of
the
urgency
of


improvement
lie
mainly
in
the
line
of
his
talent
:
as
the
merchant
be


persuade
that
the
road
most
in
need
of
mending
be
those
on
which
his


business
make
he
travel
.
Odo
himself
be
already
conscious
of
live


in
a
many
-
windowed
house
,
with
outlook
diverse
enough
to
justify
more


than
one
view
of
the
universe
;
but
he
have
no
conception
of
that


concentration
of
purpose
that
may
make
the
mind
's
flight
to
its
goal
as


direct
and
unvarying
as
the
course
of
a
home
bird
.
the
talk
turn
on


Gamba
,
Crescenti
speak
of
the
help
which
the
hunchback
give
he
in
his


work
among
the
poor
.




"
his
early
hardship
,
"
say
he
,
"
have
give
he
an
insight
into


character
that
my
happy
circumstance
have
deny
I
;
and
he
have
more


than
once
be
the
mean
of
reclaim
some
wretch
that
I
despair
of
.


unhappily
,
his
part
and
learning
be
beyond
his
station
,
and
will
not


let
he
rest
in
the
performance
of
his
duty
.
his
mind
,
I
often
tell


he
,
be
like
one
of
those
inn
parlour
hang
with
elaborate
map
of
the


three
Heretical
Cities
;
whereas
the
only
topography
with
which
the


virtuous
traveller
need
be
acquaint
be
that
of
the
Heavenly
City
to


which
all
our
journeying
should
tend
.
the
soundness
of
his
heart


reassure
I
as
to
this
distemper
of
the
reason
;
but
other
be
less


familiar
with
his
good
quality
and
I
tremble
for
the
risk
to
which


his
rashness
may
expose
he
.
"




the
librarian
go
on
to
say
that
Gamba
have
a
pretty
poetical
gift
which


he
be
suspect
of
employ
in
the
composition
of
anonymous
satire
on


the
court
,
the
government
and
the
Church
.
at
that
period
every
italian


town
be
as
full
of
lampoon
as
a
marsh
of
mosquito
,
and
it
be
as


difficult
in
the
one
case
as
the
other
for
the
sufferer
to
detect
the


specific
cause
of
his
sting
.
the
moment
in
Italy
be
a
strange
one
.
the


tide
of
reform
have
be
turn
back
by
the
very
act
devise
to
hasten


it
:
the
suppression
of
the
Society
of
Jesus
.
the
shout
of
liberation


that
rise
over
the
downfall
of
the
order
have
sink
to
a
guard
whisper
.


the
dark
legend
already
form
around
Ganganelli
's
death
,
the
hint
of


that
secret
liquor
distil
for
the
order
's
use
in
a
certain
convent
of


Perugia
,
hang
like
a
menace
on
the
political
horizon
;
and
the
disband


society
seem
to
have
tighten
its
hold
on
the
public
conscience
as
a


die
man
's
clutch
close
on
his
victorious
enemy
.




so
profoundly
have
the
Jesuits
impress
the
world
with
the
sense
of


their
mysterious
power
that
they
be
feel
to
be
like
one
of
those


animal
organism
which
,
when
tear
apart
,
carry
on
a
separate
existence


in
every
fragment
.
Ganganelli
's
bull
have
provide
against
their
exert


any
political
influence
,
or
control
opinion
as
confessor
or
as


public
educator
;
but
they
be
know
to
be
everywhere
in
Italy
,
either


hide
in
other
order
,
or
act
as
lie
agent
of
foreign
power
,
as


tutor
in
private
family
,
or
simply
as
secular
priest
.
even
the


confiscation
of
their
wealth
do
not
seem
to
diminish
the
popular
sense


of
their
strength
.
perhaps
because
that
strength
have
never
be


completely
explain
,
even
by
their
immense
temporal
advantage
,
it
be


feel
to
be
latent
in
themselves
,
and
somehow
capable
of
withstand


every
kind
of
external
assault
.
they
have
moreover
benefit
by
the


reaction
which
always
follow
on
the
breaking
up
of
any
great


organisation
.
their
detractor
be
already
begin
to
forget
their


fault
and
remember
their
merit
.
the
people
have
be
teach
to
hate
the


society
as
the
possessor
of
wealth
and
privilege
which
should
have
be


theirs
;
but
when
the
Society
fall
its
possession
be
absorb
by
the


other
power
,
and
in
many
case
the
people
suffer
from
abuse
and


maladministration
which
they
have
not
know
under
their
Jesuit
landlord
.

they
deserve
these


excellent
gift
of
the
Creator
--
when
I
consider
this
,
I
say
,
I
stand


amazed
at
those
who
would
rob
so
beneficent
a
deity
of
the
least
of
his


privileges.--but
why
,
"
he
continue
again
after
a
moment
,
as
Odo


remain
silent
,
"
should
we
vex
ourselves
with
such
question
,
when


providence
have
give
we
so
fair
a
world
to
enjoy
and
such
varied


faculty
with
which
to
apprehend
its
beauty
?
I
think
you
have
not


see
the
Venus
Callipyge
in
bronze
that
I
have
lately
receive
from


Rome
?
"
and
he
rise
and
lead
the
way
to
the
house
.




this
conversation
reveal
to
Odo
a
third
conception
of
the
religious


idea
.
in
Piedmont
religion
impose
itself
as
a
military
discipline
,
the


enforce
duty
of
the
christian
citizen
to
the
heavenly
state
;
to
the


Duke
it
be
a
means
of
purchase
spiritual
immunity
from
the


consequence
of
bodily
weakness
;
to
the
Bishop
,
it
replace
the
panem
et


circense
of
ancient
Rome
.
where
,
in
all
this
,
be
the
share
of
those


whom
Christ
have
come
to
save
?
where
be
Saint
Francis
's
devotion
to
his


heavenly
bride
,
the
Lady
Poverty
?
though
here
and
there
a
good
parish


priest
like
Crescenti
minister
to
the
temporal
want
of
the
peasantry
,


it
be
only
the
free
-
thinker
and
the
atheist
who
,
at
the
risk
of
life


and
fortune
,
labour
for
their
moral
liberation
.
Odo
listen
with
a


sadden
heart
,
think
,
as
he
follow
his
host
through
the
perfumed


shade
of
the
garden
,
and
down
the
long
saloon
at
the
end
of
which
the


Venus
stand
,
of
those
who
for
the
love
of
man
have
deny
themselves
such


delicate
emotion
and
go
forth
cheerfully
to
exile
or
imprisonment
.


these
be
the
true
lover
of
the
Lady
Poverty
,
the
band
in
which
he


long
to
be
enrol
;
yet
how
restrain
a
thrill
of
delight
as
the


slend
dusky
goddess
detach
herself
against
the
cool
marble
of
she


niche
,
look
,
in
the
sun
-
ripple
green
penumbra
of
the
saloon
,
with
a


sound
of
water
fall
somewhere
out
of
sight
,
as
though
she
have
just


step
dripping
from
the
wave
?




in
the
Duchess
's
company
life
strike
another
gait
.
here
be
no
waiting


on
subtle
pleasure
,
but
a
headlong
gallop
after
the
cruder
sort
.


hunting
,
gaming
and
masquerade
fill
her
Highness
's
day
;
and
Odo
have


feel
small
inclination
to
keep
pace
with
the
cavalcade
,
but
for
the


fly
huntress
at
its
head
.
to
the
Duchess
's
"
view
halloo
"
every
drop


of
blood
in
he
respond
;
but
a
vigilant
image
keep
his
bosom
bar
.


so
they
ride
,
dance
,
dice
together
,
but
like
stranger
who
cross
hand


at
a
veglione
.
once
or
twice
he
fancy
the
Duchess
be
for
unmasking
;


but
her
impulse
come
and
go
like
firefly
in
the
dusk
,
and
it
suit


his
humour
to
remain
a
looker
-
on
.




so
life
pipe
to
he
during
his
first
day
at
Pianura
:
a
merry
tune
in


the
Bishop
's
company
,
a
mad
one
in
the
Duchess
's
;
but
always
with
the


same
sad
undertone
,
like
the
cry
of
the
wind
on
a
warm
threshold
.






2.14
.




Trescorre
too
keep
open
house
,
and
here
Odo
find
a
warm
welcome
than


he
have
expect
.
though
Trescorre
be
still
the
Duchess
's
accredit


lover
,
it
be
clear
that
the
tie
between
they
be
no
long
such
as
to


make
he
resent
her
kindness
to
her
young
kinsman
.
he
seem
indeed


anxious
to
draw
Odo
into
her
Highness
's
circle
,
and
surprise
he
by
a


frankness
and
affability
of
which
his
demeanour
at
Turin
have
give
no


promise
.
as
leader
of
the
anti
-
clerical
he
stand
for
such
liberalism
as


dare
show
its
head
in
Pianura
;
and
he
seem
disposed
to
invite
Odo
's


confidence
in
political
matter
.
the
latter
be
,
however
,
too
much
the


child
of
his
race
not
to
hang
back
from
such
an
invitation
.
he
do
not


distrust
Trescorre
more
than
the
other
courtier
;
but
it
be
a
time
when


every
ear
be
alert
for
the
foot
-
fall
of
treachery
,
and
the
rash
man


do
not
care
to
taste
first
of
any
cup
that
be
offer
he
.




these
scruple
Trescorre
make
it
his
business
to
dispel
.
he
be
the
only


person
at
court
who
be
willing
to
discuss
politic
,
and
his
clear
view


of
affair
excite
Odo
's
admiration
if
not
his
concurrence
.
Odo
be
be
in


fact
one
of
those
dual
vision
which
instinctively
see
both
side
of
a


case
and
take
the
defence
of
the
less
popular
.
Gamba
's
principle
be


dear
to
he
;
but
he
do
not
therefore
believe
in
the
personal
baseness


of
every
opponent
of
the
cause
.
he
have
refrain
from
mention
the


hunchback
to
his
supposed
brother
;
but
the
latter
,
in
one
of
their


talk
,
bring
forward
Gamba
's
name
,
without
reference
to
the


relationship
,
but
with
high
praise
for
the
young
librarian
's
part
.


this
,
at
the
moment
,
put
Odo
on
his
guard
;
but
Trescorre
have
one
day


beg
he
to
give
Gamba
warning
of
some
petty
danger
that
threaten


he
from
the
clerical
side
,
it
become
difficult
not
to
believe
in
an


interest
so
attested
;
the
more
so
as
Trescorre
let
it
be
see
that


Gamba
's
political
view
be
not
such
as
to
distract
from
his
sympathy
.




"
the
fellow
's
brain
,
"
say
he
,
"
would
be
of
infinite
use
to
I
;
but


perhaps
he
serve
we
well
at
a
distance
.
all
I
ask
be
that
he
shall
not


risk
himself
too
near
Father
Ignazio
's
talon
,
for
he
would
be
a
pretty


morsel
to
throw
to
the
Holy
Office
,
and
the
weak
point
of
such
a
man
's


position
be
that
,
however
dangerous
in
life
,
he
can
threaten
no
one
from


the
grave
.
"




Odo
report
this
to
Gamba
,
who
hear
with
a
two
-
edge
smile
.
"
yes
,
"
be


his
comment
,

I
enough
to
want
to

safe

his
fold

Odo
flush
at
the
implication
.
"

why
not

"
say
he
.
"

you

.




life
in
Pianura
,
after
the
first
few
week
,
seem
on
the
whole
a
tame


business
to
a
youth
of
his
appetite
;
and
he
secretly
long
for
a


pretext
to
resume
his
travel
.
none
,
however
,
seem
likely
to
offer
;


for
it
be
clear
that
the
Duke
,
in
the
interval
of
more
press


concern
,
wish
to
study
and
observe
his
kinsman
.
when
sufficiently


recover
from
the
effect
of
the
pilgrimage
,
he
send
for
Odo
and


question
he
closely
as
to
the
way
in
which
he
have
spend
his
time


since
come
to
Pianura
,
the
acquaintance
he
have
form
and
the


church
he
have
frequent
.
Odo
prudently
dwell
on
the
lofty
tone
of
the


Belverde
's
circle
,
and
on
the
privilege
he
have
enjoy
in
attend
she


on
a
visit
to
the
holy
Abbot
of
the
Barnabites
;
touch
more
lightly
on


his
connection
with
the
Bishop
,
and
omit
all
mention
of
Gamba
and


Crescenti
.
the
Duke
assume
a
listen
air
,
but
it
be
clear
that
he


could
not
put
off
his
private
thought
long
enough
to
give
an
open
mind


to
other
matter
;
and
Odo
feel
that
he
be
nowhere
so
secure
as
in
his


cousin
's
company
.
he
remember
,
however
,
that
the
Duke
have
plenty
of


eye
to
replace
his
own
,
and
that
a
secret
which
be
safe
in
his
actual


presence
might
be
in
mortal
danger
on
his
threshold
.




his
Highness
on
this
occasion
be
pleased
to
inform
his
kinsman
that
he


have
order
Count
Trescorre
to
place
at
the
young
man
's
disposal
an


income
enable
he
to
keep
a
carriage
and
pair
,
four
saddle
-
horse
and


five
servant
.
it
be
scant
measure
for
an
heir
-
presumptive
,
and
Odo


wonder
if
the
Belverde
have
have
a
hand
in
the
apportionment
;
but
his


indifference
to
such
matter
(
for
though
personally
fastidious
he
care


little
for
display
)
enable
he
to
show
such
gratitude
that
the
Duke
,


fancy
he
might
have
be
content
with
less
,
have
nearly
withdraw
two


of
the
saddle
-
horse
.
this
become
behaviour
greatly
advance
the
young


man
in
the
esteem
of
his
Highness
,
who
accord
he
on
the
spot
the


petite
entree
of
the
ducal
apartment
.
it
be
a
privilege
Odo
have
no


mind
to
abuse
;
for
if
life
move
slowly
in
the
Belverde
's
circle
it
be


at
a
standstill
in
the
Duke
's
.
his
Highness
never
go
abroad
but
to


serve
mass
in
some
church
(
his
almost
daily
practice
)
or
to
visit
one
of


the
numerous
monastery
within
the
city
.
from
Ash
Wednesday
to
Easter


Monday
it
be
his
custom
to
transact
no
public
or
private
business
.


during
this
time
he
receive
none
of
his
minister
,
and
see
his
son
but


for
a
few
moment
once
a
day
;
while
in
Holy
Week
he
make
a
retreat
with


the
Barnabites
,
the
Belverde
withdraw
for
the
same
period
to
the


convent
of
the
Perpetual
Adoration
.




Odo
,
as
his
new
life
take
shape
,
find
his
chief
interest
in
the
society


of
Crescenti
and
Gamba
.
in
the
Duchess
's
company
he
might
have
lose
all


taste
for
soberer
pleasure
,
but
that
his
political
sympathy
wear
a


girl
's
reproachful
shape
.
ever
at
his
side
,
more
vividly
than
in
the


body
,
Fulvia
Vivaldi
become
the
symbol
of
his
good
aim
and
deep


failure
.
sometimes
,
indeed
,
her
look
drive
he
forth
in
the
Duchess
's


train
,
but
more
often
,
draw
he
from
the
crowd
of
pleasure
-
seeker
,


beckon
the
way
to
solitude
and
study
.
under
Crescenti
's
tuition
he


begin
the
reading
of
Dante
,
who
just
then
,
after
generation
of
neglect
,


be
once
more
lift
his
voice
above
the
crowd
of
minor
singer
.
the


mighty
verse
sweep
Odo
out
to
open
sea
of
thought
,
and
from
his
vision


of
that
early
Italy
,
hapless
,
bleeding
,
but
alive
and
breast
to
breast


with
the
foe
,
he
draw
the
presage
of
his
country
's
resurrection
.




pass
from
this
high
music
to
the
company
of
Gamba
and
his
friend
be


like
leave
a
church
where
the
penitential
psalm
be
be
sing
for


the
market
-
place
where
mud
and
egg
be
fly
.
the
change
be
not


agreeable
to
a
fastidious
taste
;
but
,
as
Gamba
say
,
you
can
not
clean


out
a
stable
by
wave
incense
over
it
.
after
some
hesitation
,
he
have


agree
to
make
Odo
acquaint
with
those
who
,
like
himself
,
be


secretly
work
in
the
cause
of
progress
.
these
be
mostly
of
the


middle
class
,
physician
,
lawyer
,
and
such
man
of
letter
as
could


subsist
on
the
scant
want
of
an
unliterary
town
.
Ablest
among
they
be


the
bookseller
,
Andreoni
,
whose
shop
be
the
meeting
place
of
all
the


literati
of
Pianura
.
andreoni
,
famous
throughout
Italy
for
his
edition


of
the
classic
,
be
a
man
of
liberal
view
and
considerable
learning
,


and
in
his
private
room
be
to
be
find
many
prohibit
volume
,
such


as
Beccaria
's
Crime
and
punishment
,
Gravina
's
Hydra
Mystica
,
Concini
's


history
of
Probabilism
and
the
amsterdam
edition
of
the
french


philosophical
work
.




the
reformer
meet
at
various
place
,
and
their
meeting
be
conduct


with
as
much
secrecy
as
those
of
the
Honey
-
Bees
.
Odo
be
at
first


surprise
that
they
should
admit
he
to
their
conference
;
but
he
soon


divine
that
the
gathering
he
attend
be
not
those
at
which
the


private
design
of
the
party
be
discuss
.
it
be
plain
that
they


belong
to
some
kind
of
secret
association
;
and
before
he
have
be
long


in
Pianura
he
learn
that
the
society
of
the
Illuminati
,
that
bugbear


of
priest
and
prince
,
be
suppose
to
have
agent
at
work
in
the


duchy
.
Odo
have
hear
little
of
this
execrated
league
,
but
that
it
be


say
to
preach
atheism
,
tyrannicide
and
the
complete
abolition
of


territorial
right
;
but
this
,
be
the
report
of
the
enemy
,
be
to
be


receive
with
a
measure
of
doubt
.
he
try
to
learn
from
Gamba
whether


the
Illuminati
have
a
lodge
in
the
city
;
but
on
this
point
he
could


extract
no
information
.
meanwhile
he
listen
with
interest
to


discussion
on
taxation
,
irrigation
,
and
such
economic
problem
as
might


safely
be
air
in
his
presence
.




these
talk
bring
vividly
before
he
the
political
corruption
of
the


state
and
the
misery
of
the
unprivileged
class
.
all
the
land
in
the


duchy
be
farm
on
the
metayer
system
,
and
with
such
ill
result
that


the
peasant
be
always
in
debt
to
their
landlord
.
the
weight
of
the


evil
lie
chiefly
on
the
country
-
people
,
who
have
to
pay
on
every
pig
they


kill
,
on
all
the
produce
they
carry
to
market
,
on
their
farm


implement
,
their
mulberry
-
orchard
and
their
silk
-
worm
,
to
say
nothing


of
the
tithe
to
the
parish
.
so
oppressive
be
these
obligation
that


many
of
the
peasant
,
forsake
their
farm
,
enrol
themselves
in
the


mendicant
order
,
thus
actually
strengthen
the
hand
of
their


oppressor
.
of
legislative
redress
there
be
no
hope
,
and
the
Duke
be


inaccessible
to
all
but
his
favourite
.
the
previous
year
,
as
Odo


learn
,
eight
hundred
poor
labourer
,
exasperate
by
want
,
have


petition
his
Highness
to
relieve
they
of
the
corvee
;
but
though
they


have
raise
fifteen
hundred
scudi
to
bribe
the
court
official
who
be
to


present
their
address
,
no
reply
have
ever
be
receive
.
in
the
city


itself
,
the
monopoly
of
corn
and
tobacco
weigh
heavily
on
the


merchant
,
and
the
strict
censorship
of
the
press
make
the
open


ventilation
of
wrong
impossible
,
while
the
Duke
's
sbirri
and
the
agent


of
the
Holy
Office
could
drag
a
man
's
thought
from
his
bosom
and
search


his
midnight
dream
.
the
Church
party
,
in
the
interest
of
their
order
,


foster
the
Duke
's
fear
of
sedition
and
brand
every
innovator
as
an


atheist
;
the
Holy
Office
having
even
cast
grave
doubt
on
the
orthodoxy


of
a
nobleman
who
have
try
to
introduce
the
english
system
of
plough


on
his
estate
.
it
be
evident
to
Odo
that
the
secret
hope
of
the


reformer
centre
in
he
,
and
the
consciousness
of
their
belief
be


sweet
than
love
in
his
bosom
.
it
divert
he
from
the
folly
of
his


class
,
fix
his
thought
at
an
age
when
they
be
apt
to
range
,
and
thus


slowly
shape
and
temper
he
for
high
use
.




in
this
fashion
the
week
pass
and
summer
come
.
it
be
the
Duchess
's


habit
to
escape
the
August
heat
by
retire
to
the
dower
-
house
on
the


Piana
,
a
league
beyond
the
gate
;
but
the
little
prince
be
still


under
the
care
of
the
german
physician
,
who
would
not
consent
to
his


removal
,
her
Highness
reluctantly
linger
in
Pianura
.
with
the
first


leafing
of
the
oak
Odo
's
old
love
for
the
bud
earth
awake
,
and
he


ride
out
daily
in
the
forest
toward
Pontesordo
.
it
be
but
a
flat


stretch
of
shade
,
lack
the
voice
of
stream
and
the
cold
breath
of


mountain
-
gorge
:
a
wood
without
humour
or
surprise
;
but
the
mere


spring
of
the
turf
be
delightful
as
he
canter
down
the
grass
alley


roof
with
level
bough
,
the
outer
sunlight
just
gild
the
lip
of
the


long
green
tunnel
.




sometimes
he
attend
the
Duchess
,
but
oftener
choose
to
ride
alone
,


set
forth
early
after
a
night
at
card
or
a
late
vigil
in


Crescenti
's
study
.
one
of
these
solitary
ride
bring
he
without


premeditation
to
a
low
building
on
the
fenny
edge
of
the
wood
.
it
be
a


small
house
,
add
,
it
appear
,
to
an
ancient
brick
front
adorn
with


pilaster
,
perhaps
a
fragment
of
some
woodland
temple
.
the
door
-
step
be


overgrown
with
a
stealthy
green
moss
and
tufte
with
giant
fennel
;
and
a


shutter
swinge
loose
on
its
hinge
give
a
glimpse
of
inner
dimness
.
odo


guess
at
once
that
this
be
the
hunt
lodge
where
Cerveno
have
find


his
death
;
and
as
he
stood
look
out
across
the
oozy
secret
of
the


marsh
,
the
fever
seem
to
hang
on
his
step
.
he
turn
away
with
a


shiver
;
but
whether
it
be
the
sullen
aspect
of
the
house
,
or
the
close


way
in
which
the
wood
embrace
it
,
the
place
suddenly
lay
a
detain


hand
upon
he
.
it
be
as
though
he
have
reach
the
heart
of
solitude
.


even
the
faint
woodland
noise
seem
to
recede
from
that
dense
circle


of
shade
,
and
the
marsh
turn
a
dead
eye
to
heaven
.




Odo
tether
his
horse
to
a
bough
and
seat
himself
on
the
doorstep

but
presently
his
musing
be
disturb
by
the
sound
of
voice
,
and
the


duchess
,
attend
by
her
gentleman
,
sweep
by
at
the
end
of
a
long
glade
.


he
fancy
she
wave
her
hand
to
he
;
but
be
in
no
humour
to
join
the


cavalcade
,
he
remain
seated
,
and
the
rider
soon
pass
out
of
sight
.


as
he
sit
there
sombre
thought
come
to
he
,
steal
up
like


exhalation
from
the
fen
.
he
see
his
life
stretch
out
before
he
,
full


of
break
purpose
and
ineffectual
effort
.
public
affair
be
in
so


perplex
a
case
that
consistent
action
seem
impossible
to
either


party
,
and
their
chief
effort
be
bent
toward
direct
the
choice
of


a
regent
.
it
be
this
,
rather
than
the
possibility
of
his
accession
,


which
fix
the
general
attention
on
Odo
,
and
pledge
he
to


circumspection
.
while
not
conceal
that
in
economic
question
his


sympathy
be
with
the
liberal
,
he
have
carefully
abstain
from


political
action
,
and
have
hope
,
by
the
strict
observance
of
his


religious
duty
,
to
avoid
the
enmity
of
the
Church
party
.
Trescorre
's


undisguise
sympathy
seem
the
pledge
of
liberal
support
,
and
it
could


hardly
be
doubted
that
the
choice
of
a
regent
in
the
Church
party
would


be
unpopular
enough
to
imperil
the
dynasty
.
with
Austria
hover
on
the


horizon
the
Church
herself
be
not
likely
to
take
such
risk
;
and
thus


all
interest
seem
to
centre
in
Odo
's
appointment
.




new
element
of
uncertainty
be
,
however
,
perpetually
disturb
the


prospect
.
among
these
be
Heiligenstern
's
grow
influence
over
the


duke
.
Odo
have
see
little
of
the
german
physician
since
their
first


meeting
.
Hearsay
have
it
that
he
be
close
-
press
by
the
spy
of
the


Holy
Office
,
and
perhaps
for
this
reason
he
remained
withdraw
in
the


Duke
's
private
apartment
and
rarely
show
himself
abroad
.
the
little


prince
,
his
patient
,
be
as
seldom
see
,
and
the
account
of
the


German
's
treatment
be
as
conflicting
as
the
other
rumour
of
the


court
.
it
be
noise
on
all
side
,
however
,
that
the
Duke
be


ill
-
satisfied
with
the
result
of
the
pilgrimage
,
and
resolve
upon
less


hallowed
measure
to
assure
his
heir
's
recovery
.
Hitherto
,
it
be


believe
,
the
German
have
conform
to
the
ordinary
medical
treatment
;


but
the
clergy
now
diligently
spread
among
the
people
the
report
that


supernatural
agency
be
to
be
employ
.
this
rumour
cause
such


general
agitation
that
it
be
say
both
party
have
make
secret
advance


to
the
Duchess
in
the
hope
of
induce
she
to
stay
the
scandal
.
though


Maria
Clementina
feel
little
real
concern
for
the
public
welfare
,
she


stir
temper
have
more
than
once
rouse
she
to
active
opposition
of


the
government
,
and
her
kinship
with
the
old
Duke
of
Monte
Alloro
make


she
a
strong
factor
in
the
political
game
.
of
late
,
however
,
she
seem


to
have
weary
of
this
sport
,
throw
herself
entirely
into
the


private
diversion
of
her
station
,
and
allude
with
laugh


indifference
to
her
husband
's
necromantic
research
.




such
be
the
conflicting
gossip
of
the
hour
;
but
it
be
in
fact
idle
to


forecast
the
fortune
of
a
state
dependent
on
a
valetudinary
's
whim
;


and
rumour
be
drive
to
feed
upon
her
own
conjecture
.
to
Odo
the
state


of
affair
seem
a
satire
on
his
secret
aspiration
.
in
a
private


station
or
as
a
rule
prince
he
might
have
serve
his
fellow

as
a


princele
on
the
edge
of
power
he
be
no
more
than
the
cardboard
sword


in
a
toy
armoury
.




suddenly
he
hear
his
name
pronounce
and
start
up
see
Maria


Clementina
at
his
side

she
ride
alone
,

hold
out
her

approach

"

lift
she
from

saddle
her
loosened
hair
brush
his
face
like
a
kiss
.
for
a
moment
she


seem
like
life

answer
to
the
dreary
riddle
of
his
fate

take
leave

"
and


with
the
air
of
dignity
he
could
still
assume
on
occasion

rise
and


hand
Odo
his
passport

Odo
leave
the
closet
with
a
beat
heart
.
it
be
clear
that
his


departure
from
Pianura
be
as
strongly
oppose
by
some
one
in
high


authority
as
it
be
favour
by
the
Duchess

why
opposed
and
by
whom


he
could
not
so
much

hazard
a
guess
.
in

of

it


be
difficult
for
the
wary
to
grope
his
way
;
and
Odo
be
still
new
to


such
entanglement

his
first
sensation
be
one
of
release

of
a
future


suddenly
enlarge
and
clear
.
the
door
be
open
again
to
opportunity

and
he
be
of
an
age
to
greet
the
unexpected
like
a
bride
.
only

it

clear
that
Maria

have
pay

his
security
;
and
do
not
her
sacrifice

in

whose


know
favourite
she

she
do
not

he

of
her

if
he


accept
this
chance

escape

the
Bishop

company

here
at
least
the
atmosphere
be
clear
of
mystery
:
the
Bishop


hold
aloof
from
political
intrigue
and
breathe
an
air
untainted
by
the


odium
theologicum
.
Odo
find
his
lordship

in
the
cool
tessellate


saloon

by
an
artificial

force
through
the
conchs

his

once
begin


to

of
the

public
disaffection

he
add
after
a
pause
,

a
warning
I
can
scarce

I
can
only
advise


you
that
the
Duke
's
grow
infatuation
for
his
german
magician
have
breed


the
most
violent
discontent
among
his
subject
,
and
that
both
party


appear
resolve
to
use
this
disaffection
to
their
advantage
.
it
be
say


his
Highness
intend
to
subject
the
little
prince
to
some
mysterious


treatment
connect
with
the
rite
of
the
egyptian
priesthood
,
of
whose


secret
doctrine
Heiligenstern
pretend
to
be
an
adept
.
yesterday
it
be


bruit
that
the
Duchess
loudly
oppose
the
experiment
;
this
afternoon


it
be
give
out
that
she
have
yield
.
what
the
result
may
be
,
none
can


foresee
;
but
whichever
way
the
storm
blow
,
the
chief
danger
probably


threaten
those
who
have
have
any
connection
with
the
secret
society

"




Odo
listen
attentively
,

without
betray
any
great
surprise
;
and


the
Bishop
,
evidently
reassure
by
his
composure
,
suggest
that
,
the


heat
of
the
day
having
decline

should
visit

new

his
volary

the
Bishop
's
hint
have
not
help
his
listener
to
a
decision
.
odo
indeed


give

order

privately
as
possible

departure

rather
to
appear
to

carry
out
the

instruction

with
any
fix
intention

how
to

pretext

be
yet
uncertain

to
disobey
the
Duke
be


impossible
;
but
in
the
general
state
of
tension
it
seem
likely
enough


that
both
his
Highness
and
the
Duchess
might
change
their
mind
within


the
next
twenty

be
couple
with
a
boyish
desire
to
stay
and
see
the


game
out
;

behind
all
his

impulse

to
wait
on

that
there
have

as
to
his
own
risk

temper
to
weigh
personal


danger

draw
on
he


find
himself
wonder
with
some
impatience
if
after
all
nothing

would
happen

he
sup
alone

precaution

hang
over

long
corridor

the
rain
drive
down
with
the
guttural

its
fall

it

,
that
the
circumstance
of
his


flight
be
recall
to
Odo
Valsecca
by
the
sound
of
a
voice
which
at


once
mysteriously
connect
itself
with
the
incident
of
that
wild


night

a
party
of
gentleman

the
excavation
.
the
scene
be
such
as


always
appeal
to
Odo
's
fancy
:
the
spacious
room
,
luxuriously
fit


with
carpet
and
curtain
in
the
english
style
,
and
opening
on
a


prospect
of
classical
beauty
and
antique
renown
;
in
his
hand
the
rare


specimen
of
that
bury
art
which
,
like
some
belate
golden
harvest
,


be
now
everywhere
thrust
itself
through
the
Neapolitan
soil
;

of
taste
and
understanding
,
discuss
the
historic
or


mythological
meaning
of
the
object
before
they
,
and
quote
Homer
or


Horace
in
corroboration
of
their
guess
.




several
visitor
have
join
the
party
since
Odo
's
entrance
;
and
it
be


from
a
group
of
these

that
the
voice
have
reach
he
.
he


look
round
and
see
a
man
of
refined
and
scholarly
appearance
,
dress


en
abbe
,
as
be
the
general
habit
in
Rome
and
Naples
,
and
hold
in
one


hand
the
celebrated
blue
vase
cut
in
cameo
which
Sir
William
have

to
the


grecian
period
of
cameo
-
work
,
and
recall
by
the
purity
of
their
design


the
fine
carving
of
dioskoride
.
"

a

which
seem
to
connect
he
still


more
definitely
with
the
episode
his
voice
recall
.
Odo
turn
to
a


gentleman
at
his
side
and
ask
the
speaker
's
name
.

the

and
at
present
attach
to
the
household


of
the
Papal
Nuncio
.
"




instantly
Odo
behold
the
tumultuous
scene
in
the
Duke
's
apartment
,
and


hear
the
indictment
of
Heiligenstern
fall
in
tranquil
accent
from


the
very
lip
which
be
now
,
in
the
same
tone
,
discuss
the
date
of
a


greek
cameo
vase
.
even
in
that
moment
of
disorder
he
have
be
strike
by


the
voice
and
aspect
of
the
agent
of
the
Holy
Office
,
and
by
a
singular


distinction
that
seem
to
set
the
man
himself
above
the
coil
of


passion
in
which
his
action
be
involve
.
to
Odo
be
spontaneous
yet


reflective
temper
there
be
something
peculiarly
impressive
in
the
kind


of
detachment
which
imply
,
not
obtuseness
or
indifference
,
but
a


high
sensitiveness
discipline
by
choice
.
now
he
feel
a
renew
pang


of
regret
that
such
quality
should
be
find
in
the
service
of
the


opposition
;
but
the
feeling
be
not
incompatible
with
a
wish
to
be
more


nearly
acquaint
with
their
possessor
.




the
two
year
elapse
since
Odo
's
departure
from
Pianura
have
widen
if


they
have
not
lift
his
outlook
.
if
he
have
lose
something
of
his
early


enthusiasm
he
have
exchange
it
for
a
large
experience
of
city
and


man
,
and
for
the
self
-
command
bear
of
varied
intercourse
.
he
have
reach


a
point
where
he
be
able
to
survey
his
past
dispassionately
and
to


disentangle
the
thread
of
the
intrigue
in
which
he
have
so
nearly
lose


his
footing
.
the
actual
circumstance
of
his
escape
be
still
wrap


in
mystery
:
he
could
only
conjecture
that
the
Duchess
,
foresee
the


course
event
would
take
,
have
plan
with
Cantapresto
to
save
he
in


spite
of
himself
.
his
nocturnal
flight
down
the
river
have
carry
he
to


Ponte
di
Po
,
the
point
where
the
Piana
flow
into
the
Po
,
the
latter


river
form
for
a
few
mile
the
southern
frontier
of
the
duchy
.
here


his
passport
have
take
he
safely
past
the
custom
-
officer
,
and


follow
the
indication
of
the
boatman
,
he
have
find
,
outside
the


miserable
village
cluster
about
the
custom
,
a
travel
-
chaise
which


bring
he
before
the
next
night
-
fall
to
Monte
Alloro
.




of
the
real
danger
from
which
this
timely
retreat
have
remove
he
,


Gamba
's
subsequent
letter
have
bring
ample
proof
.
it
be
indeed
mainly


against
himself
that
both
party
,
perhaps
jointly
,
have
direct
their


attack
;
design
to
take
he
in
the
toil
ostensibly
prepare
for
the


Illuminati
.
his
evasion
know
,
the
Holy
Office
have
content
itself
with


imprison
Heiligenstern
in
one
of
the
Papal
fortress
near
the


adriatic
,
while
his
mistress
,
though
breed
in
the
greek
confession
,
be


confine
in
a
convent
of
the
Sepolte
Vive
and
his
oriental
servant
send


to
the
Duke
's
galley
.
as
to
those
suspect
of
affiliation
with
the


forbidden
sect
,
fine
and
penance
be
impose
on
a
few
of
the
least


conspicuous
,
while
the
chief
offender
,
either
from
motive
of
policy
or


thank
to
their
superior
adroitness
,
be
suffer
to
escape
without
a


reprimand
.
after
this
,
Gamba
's
letter
report
,
the
duchy
have
lapse


into
its
former
state
of
quiescence
.
Prince
Ferrante
have
be
seriously


ail
since
the
night
of
the
electrical
treatment
,
but
the
Pope
have


send
his
private
physician
to
Pianura
,
the
boy
have
rally
under
the


latter
's
care
.
the
Duke
,
as
be
natural
,
have
suffer
an
acute
relapse


of
piety
,
spend
his
time
in
expiatory
pilgrimage
to
the
various


votive
church
of
the
duchy
,
and
decline
to
transact
any
public


business
till
he
should
have
compile
with
his
own
hand
a
calendar
of


the
life
of
the
saint
,
with
the
initial
letter
paint
in
miniature
,


which
he
design
to
present
to
his
Holiness
at
Easter
.




meanwhile
Odo
,
at
Monte
Alloro
,
find
himself
in
surrounding
so


different
from
those
he
have
leave
that
it
seem
incredible
they
should


exist
in
the
same
world
.
the
Duke
of
Monte
Alloro
be
that
rare
survival


of
a
strong
age
,
a
cynic
.
in
a
period
of
sentimental
optimism
,
of


fervid
enthusiasm
and
tearful
philanthropy
,
he
represent
the


pleasure
-
love
prince
of
the
Renaissance
,
crush
his
people
with


taxis
but
dazzle
they
with
festivity
;
infuriate
they
by
his


disregard
of
the
public
welfare
,
but
fascinating
they
by
his
good
look
,


his
tolerance
of
old
abuse
,
his
ridicule
of
the
monk
,
and
by
the


careless
libertinage
which
have
found
the
fortune
of
more
than
one


middle
-
class
husband
and
father
--
for
the
Duke
always
pay
well
for
what


he
appropriate
.
he
have
grow
old
in
his
pleasant
sin
,
and
these
,
as


such
raiment
will
,
have
grow
old
and
dingy
with
he
;
but
if
no
long


splendid
he
be
still
splendour
-
love
,
and
draw
to
his
court
the
most


brilliant
adventurer
of
Italy
.
spite
of
his
preference
for
such


company
,
he
have
a
nobler
side
,
the
ruin
of
a
fine
but
uncultivated


intelligence
,
and
a
taste
for
all
that
be
young
,
generous
and
high
in


look
and
courage
.
he
be
at
once
draw
to
Odo
,
who
instinctively


address
himself
to
these
quality
,
and
whose
conversation
and
manner


throw
into
relief
the
vulgarity
of
the
old
Duke
's
crony
.
the
latter


be
the
shrewd
enough
to
enjoy
the
contrast
at
the
expense
of
his


sycophant
'
vanity
;
and
the
cavaliere
Valsecca
be
for
a
while
the


reign
favourite
.
it
would
have
be
hard
to
say
whether
his
patron


be
most
tickle
by
his
zeal
for
economic
reform
,
or
by
his
faith
in


the
perfectibility
of
man
.
both
these
article
of
Odo
's
creed
draw
tear


of
enjoyment
from
the
old
Duke
's
puffy
eye
;
and
he
be
never
tired
of


declare
that
only
his
hatred
for
his
nephew
of
Pianura
induce
he
to


accord
his
protection
to
so
dangerous
an
enemy
of
society
.




odo
at
first
fancy
that
it
be
in
response
to
a
mere
whim
of
the


Duke
's
that
he
have
be
despatch
to
Monte
Alloro
;
but
he
soon


perceive
that
the
invitation
have
be
inspire
by
Maria
Clementina
's


wish
.
some
three
month
after
Odo
's
arrival
,
Cantapresto
suddenly


appear
with
a
packet
of
letter
from
the
Duchess
.
among
they
she


Highness
have
include
a
few
line
to
Odo
,
whom
she
briefly
adjure
not


to
return
to
Pianura
,
but
to
comply
in
all
thing
with
her
uncle
's


desire
.
soon
after
this
the
old
Duke
send
for
Odo
,
and
ask
he
how


his
present
mode
of
life
agree
with
his
taste
.
Odo
,
who
have
learn


that
frankness
be
the
sure
way
to
the
Duke
's
favour
,
reply
that
,


while
nothing
could
be
more
agreeable
than
the
circumstance
of
his


sojourn
at
Monte
Alloro
,
he
must
own
to
a
wish
to
travel
when
the


occasion
offer
.




"
why
,
this
be
as
I
fancy
,
"
reply
the
Duke
,
who
hold
in
his
hand
an


open
letter
on
which
Odo
recognise
Maria
Clementina
's
seal
.
"
we
have


always
,
"
he
continue
,
"
speak
plainly
with
each
other
,
and
I
will
not


conceal
from
you
that
it
be
for
your
good
interest
that
you
should


remain
away
from
Pianura
for
the
present
.
the
Duke
,
as
you
doubtless


divine
,
be
anxious
for
your
return
,
and
her
Highness
,
for
that
very


reason
,
be
urgent
that
you
should
prolong
your
absence
.
it
be
notorious


that
the
Duke
soon
weary
of
those
about
he
,
and
that
your
good
chance


of
regain
his
favour
be
to
keep
out
of
his
reach
and
let
your
enemy


hang
themselves
in
the
noose
they
have
prepare
for
you
.
for
my
part
,
I


be
always
glad
to
do
an
ill
-
turn
to
that
snivel
friar
,
my
nephew
,


and
the
more
so
when
I
can
seriously
oblige
a
friend
;
and
,
as
you
have


perhaps
guess
,
the
Duke
dares
not
ask
for
your
return
while
I
show
a


fancy
for
your
company
.
but
this
,
"
add
he
with
an
ironical
twinkle
,


"
be
a
tame
place
for
a
young
man
of
your
missionary
temper
,
and
I
have
a


mind
to
send
you
on
a
visit
to
that
arch
-
tyrant
Ferdinand
of
Naples
,
in


whose
dominion
a
man
may
yet
burn
for
heresy
or
be
draw
and
quarter


for
poach
on
a
nobleman
's
preserve
.
I
be
advise
that
some
rare


treasure
have
lately
be
take
from
the
excavation
there
and
I
should


be
glad
if
you
would
oblige
I
by
acquire
a
few
for
my
gallery
.
I
will


give
you
letter
to
a
cognoscente
of
my
acquaintance
,
who
will
put
his


experience
at
the
disposal
of
your
excellent
taste
,
and
the
fund
at


your
service
will
,
I
hope
,
enable
you
to
outbid
the
english
brigand


who
,
as
the
Romans
say
,
would
carry
off
the
colosseum
if
it
be


portable
.
"




in
all
this
Odo
discern
Maria
Clementina
's
hand
,
and
an
instinctive


resistance
make
he
hang
back
upon
his
patron
's
proposal
.
but
the
only


alternative
be
to
return
to
Pianura
;
and
every
letter
from
Gamba
urge


on
he
(
for
the
very
reason
the
Duke
have
give
)
the
duty
of
keep
out


of
reach
as
the
sure
mean
of
save
himself
and
the
cause
to
which
he


be
pledge
.
nothing
remain
but
a
graceful
acquiescence
;
and
early
the


next
spring
he
start
for
Naples
.




his
first
impulse
have
be
to
send
Cantapresto
back
to
the
Duchess
.
he


know
that
he
owe
his
escape
I
grave
difficulty
to
the
soprano
's


prompt
action
on
the
night
of
Heiligenstern
's
arrest
;
but
he
be
equally


sure
that
such
action
might
not
always
be
as
favourable
to
his
plan
.
it


be
plain
that
Cantapresto
be
pay
to
spy
on
he
,
and
that
whenever


Odo
's
intention
clash
with
those
of
his
would
-
be
protector
the


soprano
would
side
with
the
latter
.
but
there
be
something
in
the
air


of
Monte
Alloro
which
dispel
such
consideration
,
or
at
least


weaken
the
impulse
to
act
on
they
.
cantapresto
as
usual
have
attract


notice
at
court
.
his
glibness
and
versatility
amuse
the
Duke
,
and
to


Odo
he
be
as
difficult
to
put
off
as
a
bad
habit
.
he
have
become
so


accomplish
a
servant
that
he
seem
a
sixth
sense
of
his
master
's
;
and


when
the
latter
prepare
to
start
on
his
travel
Cantapresto
take
his


usual
seat
in
the
chaise
.




to
a
traveller
of
Odo
's
temper
there
could
be
few
more
agreeable


journey
than
the
one
on
which
he
be
set
out
,
and
the
Duke
be
in


no
haste
to
have
his
commission
execute
,
his
messenger
have
full
leisure


to
enjoy
every
stage
of
the
way
.
he
profit
by
this
to
visit
several
of


the
small
principality
north
of
the
Apennines
before
turn
toward


Genoa
,
whence
he
be
to
take
ship
for
the
South
.
when
he
leave
Monte


Alloro
the
land
have
wear
the
bleach
face
of
February
,
and
it
be


amazing
to
his
northern
-
breed
eye
to
find
himself
,
on
the
sea
-
coast
,
in


the
full
exuberance
of
summer
.
seat
by
this
halcyon
shore
,
Genoa
,
in


its
carved
and
fresco
splendour
,
just
then
celebrate
with
the


customary
gorgeous
ritual
the
accession
of
a
new
Doge
,
seem
to
Odo


like
the
richly
-
inlay
frame
of
some
Renaissance
"
triumph
.
"
but
the


splendid
house
with
their
marble
peristyle
,
and
the
paint
villa
in


their
orange
-
grove
along
the
shore
,
house
a
dull
and
narrow
-
minded


society
,
content
to
amass
wealth
and
play
biribi
under
the
eye
of
their


ancestral
vandyke
,
without
any
concern
as
to
the
question
agitate


the
world
.
a
kind
of
fat
commercial
dulness
,
a
lack
of
that
personal


distinction
which
justify
magnificence
,
seem
to
Odo
the
prevail


note
of
the
place
;
nor
be
he
sorry
when
his
packet
set
sail
for
Naples
.




here
indeed
he
find
all
the
vivacity
that
Genoa
lack
.
few
city


could
at
first
acquaintance
be
more
engaging
to
the
stranger
.
dull
and


brown
as
it
appear
after
the
rich
tint
of
Genoa
,
yet
so
gloriously


do
sea
and
land
embrace
it
,
so
lavishly
the
sun
gild
and
the
moon


silver
it
,
that
it
seem
steep
in
the
surround

of
nature
.
and


what
a
nature
to
eye
subdue
to
the
sober
tint
of
the
north
!
its


spectacular
quality
--
that
study
sequence
of
effect
range
from
the


translucent
outline
of
Capri
and
the
fantastically
blue
mountain
of
the


coast
,
to
Vesuvius
lift
its
torch
above
the
plain
--
this
prodigal


response
to
fancy
's
claim
suggest
the
boundless
invention
of
some


great
scenic
artist
,
some
olympian
Veronese
with
sea
and
sky
for
a


palette
.
and
then
the
city
itself
,
huddle
between
bay
and
mountain
,


and
seethe
and
bubble
like
a
Titan
's
cauldron
!
here
be
life
at
its


source
,
not
check
,
direct
,
utilise
,
but
gush
forth


uncontrollably
through
every
fissure
of
the
brown
wall
and
reek


street
--
love
and
hatred
,
mirth
and
folly
,
impudence
and
greed
,
go


naked
and
unashamed
as
the
lazzaroni
on
the
quay
.
the
variegate


surface
of
it
all
be
fascinating
to
Odo
.
it
set
free
his
power
of


purely
physical
enjoyment
,
keep
all
deep
sensation
in
abeyance
.


these
,
however
,
presently
find
satisfaction
in
that
other
hidden
beauty


of
which
city
and
plain
be
but
the
sumptuous
drapery
.
it
be
hardly
too


much
to
say
that
to
the
train
eye
of
the
day
the

Naples


hardly
exist
,
so
absorb
be
they
in
the
perusal
of
she
bury
past
.


the
fever
of
excavation
be
on
every
one
.
no
social
or
political
problem


could
find
a
hearing
while
the
subject
of
the
last
coin
or
bas
-
relief


from
Pompeii
or
Herculanaeum
remain
undecided
.
Odo
,
at
first
an
amused


spectator
,
gradually
find
himself
engross
in
the
fierce
quarrel


rage
over
the
date
of
an
intaglio
or
the
myth
represent
on
an


amphora
.
the
intrinsic
beauty
of
the
object
,
and
the
light
they
shed
on


one
of
the
most
brilliant
phase
of
human
history
,
be
in
fact


sufficient
to
justify
the
prevail
ardour
;
and
the
reconstructive


habit
he
have
acquire
from
Crescenti
lend
a
live
interest
to
the


dry
discussion
between
rival
collector
.




gradually
other
influence
reassert
themselves
.
at
the
house
of
Sir


William
Hamilton
,
then
the
centre
of
the
most
polished
society
in


Naples
,
he
meet
not
only
artist
and
archeologist
,
but
man
of
letter


and
of
affair
.
among
these
,
he
be
peculiarly
draw
to
the
two


distinguished
economist
,
the
abate
Galiani
and
the
cavaliere


Filangieri
,
in
whose
company
he
enjoy
for
the
first
time
sound


learn
unhampere
by
pedantry
.
the
lively
Galiani
prove
that
social


taste
and
a
broad
wit
be
not
incompatible
with
more
serious
interest
;


and
Filangieri
throw
the
charm
of
a
graceful
personality
over
any
topic


he
discuss
.
in
the
latter
,
indeed
,
courtly
,
young
and
romantic
,
a


thinker
whose
intellectual
acuteness
be
steep
in
moral
emotion
,
Odo


behold
the
type
of
the
new
chivalry
,
an
ideal
leader
of
the
campaign


against
social
injustice
.
Filangieri
represent
the
extreme
optimism


of
the
day
.
his
sense
of
exist
abuse
be
only
equal
by
his
faith


in
their
speedy
amendment
.
love
be
to
cure
all
evil
:
the
love
of
man


for
man
,
the
effusive
all
-
embrace
sympathy
of
the
school
of
the


Vicaire
Savoyard
,
be
to
purge
the
emotion
by
tenderness
and
pity
.
in


Gamba
,
the
victim
of
the
condition
he
denounce
,
the
sense
of
present


hardship
prevail
over
the
faith
in
future
improvement
;
while


Filangieri
's
social
superiority
mitigate
his
view
of
the
evil
and


magnify
the
efficacy
of
the
propose
remedy
.
Odo
's
day
pass


agreeably
in
such
intercourse
,
or
in
the
excitement
of
excursion
to
the


ruin

as
the
court
and
the
high
society
of
Naples
offer


little
to
engage

,

gradually
restrict
himself
to

small


circle

gather
at
the
villa
Hamilton
.
to
these
he


fancy
the
abate
de
Crucis
might
prove
an
interesting
addition
;
and
the


desire
to
learn
something
of
this
problematic
person
induce
he
to
quit


the
villa
at
the
moment
when
the
abate
take
leave
.




they
find
themselves
together
on
the
threshold
;
and
Odo
,
recall
to


the
other
the
circumstance
of
their
first
meeting
,
propose
that
they


should
dismiss
their
carriage
and
regain
the
city
on
foot
.
De
Crucis


readily
consented
;
and
they
be
soon
descend
the
hill
of
Posilipo
.


here
and
there
a
turn
in
the
road
bring
they
to
an
open
space
whence


they
command
the
bay
from
Procida
to
Sorrento
,
with
Capri
afloat
in


liquid
gold
and
the
long
blue
shadow
of
Vesuvius
stretch
like
a


menace
toward
the
city
.
the
spectacle
be
one
of
which
Odo
never


weary
;
but
today
it
barely
divert
he
from
the
charm
of
his


companion
's
talk
.
the
abate
de
Crucis
have
that
quality
of
repress


enthusiasm
,
of
an
intellectual
sensibility
temper
by
self
-
possession
,


which
exercise
the
strong
attraction
over
a
mind
not
yet
master
of


itself
.
though
all
he
say
have
a
personal
note
he
seem
to
withhold


himself
even
in
the
moment
of
great
expansion
:
like
some
prince
who


should
enrich
his
favourite
from
the
public
treasury
but
keep
his


private
fortune
unimpaire
.
in
the
course
of
their
conversation
odo


learn
that
though
of
austrian
birth
his
companion
be
of
mingle


english
and
florentine
parentage
:
a
fact
perhaps
explain
the
mixture


of
urbanity
and
reserve
that
lend
such
charm
to
his
manner
.
he
tell
Odo


that
his
connection
with
the
Holy
Office
have
be
only
temporary
,
and


that
,
having
contract
a
severe
cold
the
previous
winter
in
Germany

he


have
accept
a
secretaryship
in
the
service
of
the
Papal
Nuncio
in
order


to
enjoy
the
benefit
of
a
mild

with
this

themselves

the

what

"




as
though
unwilling

linger
on
such
grave
topic

he
turn
the
talk


to

Odo

the
impression
Naples

make
on

he
listen
courteously
to
the
young
man
's
comment
on


the
wretched
state
of
the
peasantry
,
the
extravagance
of
the
court

nobility

the
judicial
corruption

make
the
low

submit


to
any
injustice
rather
than
seek
redress
through

De
Crucis


agree
with
he
in
the
main
,
admit
that
the
monopoly
of
corn

the


maintenance

feudal
right

the
King

indifference
to
the
graver


duty
of
his

Tuscany

I
think
our
economist

praise

often

hope
,
by
the
study
of
a
volcanic
soil
,
to
enlarge
my
knowledge
of
the


globe
's
formation
.
such
in
fact
be
the
case
,
but
to
my
surprise
my


research
lead
I
to
adopt
the
view
I
have
formerly
combat
,
and
I
now


find
myself
in
the
rank
of
the
Vulcanists
,
or
believer
in
the


secondary
origin
of
the
earth
:
a
view
you
may
remember
I
once
oppose


with
all
the
zeal
of
inexperience
.
having
firmly
establish
every
point


in
my
argument
accord
to
the
baconian
method
of
investigation
,
I
feel


it
my
duty
to
enlighten
my
scholar
;
and
in
the
course
of
my
last


lecture
I
announce
the
result
of
my
investigation
.
I
be
of
course


aware
of
the
inevitable
result
;
but
the
servant
of
Truth
have
no
choice


but
to
follow
where
she
call
,
and
many
have
joyfully
traverse
stonier


place
than
I
be
likely
to
travel
.
"




nothing
could
exceed
the
respect
with
which
Odo
hear
this
simple


confession
of
faith
.
it
be
as
though
the
speaker
have
unconsciously


convict
he
of
remissness
,
of
cowardice
even
;
so
vain
and
windy
his


theorising
seem
,
judge
by
the
other
's
deliberate
act
!
yet
place
as


he
be
,
what
could
he
do
,
how
advance
their
common
end
,
but
by
passively


wait
on
event
?
at
least
,
he
reflect
,
he
could
perform
the
trivial


service
of
try
to
better
his
friend
's
case
;
and
this
he
eagerly


offer
to
attempt
.
the
doctor
thank
he
,
but
without
any
great


appearance
of
emotion
:
Odo
be
strike
by
the
change
which
have


transform
a
heady
and
intemperate
speaker
into
a
model
of
philosophic


calm
.
the
doctor
,
indeed
,
seem
far
more
concerned
for
the
safety
of


his
library
and
his
cabinet
of
mineral
than
for
his
own
.
"
happily
,
"


say
he
,
"
I
be
not
a
man
of
family
,
and
can
therefore
sacrifice
my


liberty
with
a
clear
conscience
:
a
fact
I
be
the
more
thankful
for
when


I
recall
the
moral
distress
of
our
poor
friend
Vivaldi
,
when
compel


to
desert
his
post
rather
than
be
separate
from
his
daughter
.
"




the
name
bring
the
colour
to
Odo
's
brow
,
and
with
an
embarrassed
air


he
ask
what
news
the
doctor
have
of
their
friend
.




"
alas
,
"
say
the
other
,
"
the
last
be
of
his
death
,
which
happen
two


year
since
in
Pavia
.
the
sardinian
government
have
,
as
you
probably


know
,
confiscate
his
small
property
on
his
leave
the
state
,
and
I
be


tell
he
die
in
great
poverty
,
and
in
sore
anxiety
for
his
daughter
's


future
.
"
he
add
that
these
event
have
take
place
before
his
own


departure
from
Turin
,
and
that
since
then
he
have
learn
nothing
of


Fulvia
's
fate
,
save
that
she
be
say
to
have
make
her
home
with
an
aunt


who
live
in
a
town
of
the
Veneto
.




Odo
listen
in
silence
.
the
lapse
of
time
,
and
the
absence
of
any
link


of
association
,
have
dim
the
girl
's
image
in
his
breast
;
but
at
the


mere
sound
of
her
name
it
live
again
,
and
he
feel
her
interwoven
with


his
deep
fibre
.
the
picture
of
her
father
's
death
and
of
her
own


need
fill
he
with
an
ineffectual
pity
,
and
for
a
moment
he
think
of


seek
she
out
;
but
the
other
could
recall
neither
the
name
of
the
town


she
have
remove
to
nor
that
of
the
relative
who
have
give
she
a
home
.




to
aid
the
good
doctor
be
a
simple
business
.
the
intervention
of
de


Crucis
and
Odo
's
own
influence
suffice
to
effect
his
release
,
and
on


the
payment
of
a
heavy
fine
(
in
which
Odo
privately
assist
he
)
he
be


reinstate
in
his
chair
.
the
only
promise
exact
by
the
Holy
Office
be


that
he
should
in
future
avoid
propound
his
own
view
on
question


already
decide
by
scripture
,
and
to
this
he
readily
agree
,
since
,
as


he
shrewdly
remark
to
Odo
,
his
opinion
be
now
well
-
know
,
and
any


who
wish
farther
instruction
have
only
to
apply
to
he
privately
.




the
old
Duke
having
invite
Odo
to
return
to
Monte
Alloro
with
such


treasure
as
he
have
collect
for
the
ducal
gallery
,
the
young
man


resolve
to
visit
Rome
on
his
way
to
the
North
.
his
acquaintance
with
de


Crucis
have
grow
into
something
like
friendship
since
their
joint
effort


in
behalf
of
the
imprisoned
sage
,
and
the
abate
prepare
to
set
out


about
the
same
time
,
the
two
agree
to
travel
together
.
the
road
lead


from
Naples
to
Rome
be
at
that
time
one
of
the
bad
in
Italy
,
and
be


besides
so
ill
-
provide
with
inn
that
there
be
no
inducement
to
linger


on
the
way
.
De
Crucis
,
however
,
succeed
in
enliven
even
this


tedious
journey
.
he
be
a
good
linguist
and
a
sound
classical
scholar
,


besides
have
,
as
he
have
tell
Odo
,
a
pronounced
taste
for
antiquarian


research
.
in
addition
to
this
,
he
perform
agreeably
on
the
violin
,
and


be
well
-
acquaint
with
the
history
of
music
.
his
chief
distinction
,


however
,
lie
in
the
ease
with
which
he
wear
his
accomplishment
,
and
in


a
breadth
of
view
that
make
it
possible
to
discuss
with
he
many


subject
distasteful
to
most
man
of
his
cloth
.
the
sceptical
or


licentious
ecclesiastic
be
common
enough
;
but
Odo
have
never
before
meet


a
priest
who
unite
serious
piety
with
this
indulgent
temper
,
or
who
have


learn
enough
to
do
justice
to
the
argument
of
his
opponent
.




on
his
venture
one
evening
to
compliment
de
Crucis
on
these
quality
,


the
latter
reply
with
a
smile
:
"

to
they

his
violin

I

secular
priest

in


private

never

the
latter
,
see
his
surprise
,
go
on
:
"
once
a
Jesuit
,
always
a


Jesuit

I
suppose

I
at
least
owe
the
Society
too
much
not
to
own
my


debt
when
the
occasion
offer

I
ever
see
the
force
of
the


charge
so
often
bring
against
we

that
we
sacrifice
everything
to
the


glory
of
the
order

for
what
be
the
glory
of
the
order
?
our
own
motto


have
declare
it
:
ad
majorem
Dei
gloriam

who
work

be
sometimes

blood


have
a
thousand
time
witness
to
its
sincerity
.
in
the
Indies
,
in


America
,
in
England
during
the
great
persecution
,
and
lately
on
our
own


unnatural
coast
,
the
Jesuits
have
die
for
Christ
as
joyfully
as
his


first
disciple
die
for
he
.
yet
these
be
but
a
small
number
in


comparison
with
the
countless
servant
of
the
order

,
labour
in


far
country
among
savage
people
,
or
surround
by
the
heretical


enemy
of
our
faith
,
have
die
the
far
bitterer
death
of
moral


isolation
:
set
themselves
to
their
task
with
the
knowledge
that


their
life

but
so
much
indistinguishable
dust
to
be
add
to
the


sum

human
effort

what
association
found
on
human
interest
have


ever
command
such
devotion

and
what
merely
human
authority

count
on
such
unquestione
obedience

he
do
not
again
revert
to
his
connection
with
the
Jesuits

but
in
the


farth
course
of
their
acquaintance
Odo

often
strike
by
the


firmness
with
which
he
testify
to
the
faith
that
be
in
he
,
without


use
the
jargon
of
piety
,

seem
,
by
his
own
attitude
,
to
cast
a


reflection
on
that
of
other

he
be
indeed
master
of
that
worldly


science
which
the
Jesuits

,

small
nature
,
become
in
a
finely
-
temper


spirit
,
the
very
flower
of
christian
courtesy
.




Odo
have
often
speak
to
de
Crucis
of
the
luxurious
life
lead
by
many
of


the
monastic
order
in
Naples
.
it
might
be
true
enough
that
the
monk


themselves
,
and
even
their
abbot
,
fare
on
fish
and
vegetable
,
and


give
their
time
to
charitable
and
educational
work
;
but
it
be


impossible
to
visit
the
famous
monastery
of
San
Martino
,
or
that
of
the


carthusian
at
Camaldoli
,
without
observe
that
the
anchoret
's
cell
have


expand
into
a
delightful
apartment
,
with
bedchamber
,
library
and


private
chapel
,
and
his
cabbage
-
plot
into
a
princely
garden
.
De
Crucis


admit
the
truth
of
the
charge
,
explain
it
in
part
by
the
character


of
the
Neapolitan
people
,
and
by
the
tendency
of
the
northern
traveller


to
forget
that
such
apparent
luxury
as
spacious
room
,
shady
grove


and
the
like
be
regard
as
necessity
in
a
hot
climate
.
he
urge
,


moreover
,
that
the
monastic
life
should
not
be
judge
by
a
few
isolated


instance
;
and
on
the
way
to
Rome
he
propose
that
Odo
,
by
way
of
see


the
other
side
of
the
question
,
should
visit
the
ancient
foundation
of


the
Benedictines
on
Monte
Cassino
.




the
venerable
monastery
,
raise
on
its
height
over
the
busy
vale
of


Garigliano
,
like
some
contemplative
spirit
above
the
conflicting


problem
of
life
,
might
well
be
hold
to
represent
the
nobler
side
of


christian
celibacy
.
for
nearly
a
thousand
year
its
fortified
wall
have


be
the
stronghold
of
the
humanity
,
and
generation
of
student
have


cherish
and
add
to
the
treasure
of
the
famous
library
.
but
the


Benedictine
rule
be
as
famous
for
good
work
as
for
learning
,
and
its


comparative
abstention
from
dogmatic
controversy
and
from
the
mechanical


devotion
of
some
of
the

who
seek
in
the
monastic
life
the
free
exercise
of
the
noble


activity
rather
than
a
sanctified
refuge
from
action
.
this
be


especially
true
of
the
monastery
of
Monte
Cassino
,
whither
many
scholar

where

,
in
addition
to


its
charitable
and
educational
work

maintain
a

to
which
student

the
abbot
,
with
whom
de

be
well

,
welcome
the


traveller
warmly

they
free
of

under
the
spell
of
these


influence
they
linger
on
from
day

day
;
and
to
Odo
they
be
the


pleasantest
day
he
have
know
.
to
be
wake
before
dawn
by
the
bell


ring
for
laud
--
to
rise
from
the
narrow
bed
in
his
white
-
washed
cell
,


and
open
his
casement

forth
over
the
haze

,
the


dark
hill
of
the
Abruzzi
and
the
remote
gleam
of
sea
touch
into
be


by
the
sunrise
--
to
hasten
through
hush
echo
corridor
to
the


church
,
where
in
a
grey
resurrection
-
light
the
father
be
intone
the


solemn
office
of
renewal
--
this
morning
ablution
of
the
spirit
,
so
like


the
bodily
plunge
into
clear
cold
water
,
seem
to
attune
the
mind
to


the
full
enjoyment
of
what
be
to
follow
:
the
hour
of
study
,
the


talk
with
the
monk
,
the
stroll
through
cloister
or
garden
,
all


punctuate
by
the
recur
summon
to
devotion
.
yet
for
all
its
latent


significance
it
remain
to
he
a
purely
sensuous
impression
,
the
vision


of
a
golden
leisure
:
not
a
solution
of
life
's
perplexity
,
but
at
good


an
honourable
escape
from
they

"
to
know
Rome
be
to
have
assist
at
the
council
of
destiny
!
"
this
cry


of
a
more
famous
traveller
must
have
struggle
for
expression
in
Odo
's


breast
as
the
great
city
,
the
city
of
city
,
lay
her
irresistible
hold


upon
he
.
his
first
impression
,
as
he
drive
in
the
clear
evening
light


from
the
Porta
del
Popolo
to
his
lodging
in
the
Via
Sistina
,
be
of
a


prodigious
accumulation
of
architectural
effect
,
a
crowding
of
century


on
century
,
all
fuse
in
the
crucible
of
the
roman
sun
,
so
that
each


style
seem
link
to
the
other
by
some
subtle
affinity
of
colour
.


nowhere
else
,
surely
,
be
the
traveller
's
first
sight
so
crowded
with


surprise
,
with
conflicting
challenge
to
eye
and
brain
.
here
,
as
he


pass
,
be
a
fragment
of
the
ancient
servian
wall
,
there
a
new
stucco


shrine
embed
in
the
brick
of
a
medieval
palace
;
on
one
hand
a
lofty


terrace
crown
by
a
row
of
mouldering
bust
,
on
the
other
a
tower
with


machicolate
parapet
,
its
flank
encrust
with
bit
of
roman
sculpture


and
the
escutcheon
of
seventeenth
-
century
pope
.
opposite
,
perhaps
,
one


of
Fuga

golden

brown
church
,
with
windy
saint
blow
out
of
their


niche
,
overlook
the
nereid
of
a
barocco
fountain
,
or
an
old
house


prop
itself
like
a
palsied
beggar
against
a
row
of
Corinthian


column
;
while
everywhere
flight
of
step
lead
up
and
down
to
hang


garden
or
under
archway
,
and
each
turn
reveal
some
distant
glimpse


of
convent
-
wall
on
the
slope
of
a
vineyard
or
of
red
-
brown
ruin


profile
against
the
dim

the

afterward
,
as
order
be
bear
out
of
chaos
,
and
he
begin
to
thread
his


way
among
the
century
,
this
first
vision
lose
something
of
its


intensity
;
yet
it
be
always
,
to
the
last
,
through
the
eye
that
Rome


possess
he
.
her
life
,
indeed
,
as
though
in
obedience
to
such
a


setting
,
be
an
external
,
a
spectacular
business
,
from
the
wild


animation
of
the
cattle
-
market
in
the
Forum
or
the
huckster
'
traffic


among
the
fountain
of
the
Piazza
Navona
,
to
the
pompous
entertainment


in
the
cardinal
'
palace
and
the
ever
-
recur
religious
ceremony


and
procession
.
Pius
VI
.
,
in
the
reaction
from
Ganganelli
's
democratic


way
,
have
restore
the
pomp
and
ceremonial
of
the
Vatican
with
the


religious
discipline
of
the
Holy
Office
;
and
never
perhaps
have
Rome
be


more
splendid
on
the
surface
or
more
silent
and
empty
within
.
Odo
,
at


time
,
as
he
move
through
some
assemblage
of
cardinal
and
noble
,
have


the
sensation
of
walk
through
a
huge
reverberate
palace
,
deck
out


with
all
the
splendour
of
art
but
long
since
abandon
of
man
.
the


superficial
animation
,
the
taste
for
music
and
antiquity
,
all
the


dilettantism
of
an
idle
and
irresponsible
society
,
seem
to
he
to


shrivel
to
dust
in
the
glare
of
that
great
past
that
light
up
every
corner


of
the
present
.




through
his
own
connection
,
and
the
influence
of
de
Crucis
,
he
see
all


that
be
good
not
only
among
the
nobility
,
but
in
that
ecclesiastical


life
now
more
than
ever
predominant
in
Rome
.
here
at
last
he
be
face
to


face
with
the
mighty
Sphinx
,
and
with
the
bleach
bone
of
those
who


have
try
to
guess
her
riddle
.
wherever
he
go
these
"
lost
adventurer
"


walk
the
street
with
he
,
glide
between
the
Princes
of
the
Church


in
the
ceremony
of
Saint
Peter
's
and
the
Lateran
,
or
mingle
in
the


company
that
ascend
the
state
staircase
at
some
cardinal
's
levee
.




he
meet
indeed
many
accomplished
and
amiable
ecclesiastic
,
but
it
seem


to
he
that
the
more
thoughtful
among
they
have
either
acquire
their


peace
of
mind
at
the
cost
of
a
certain
sensitiveness
,
or
have
take


refuge
in
a
study
of
the
past
,
as
the
early
hermit
flee
to
the
desert


from
the
disorder
of
Antioch
and
Alexandria
.
none
seem
disposed
to


face
the
actual
problem
of
life
,
and
this
attitude
of
caution
or


indifference
have
produce
a
stagnation
of
thought
that
contrast


strongly
with
the
animation
of
Sir
William
Hamilton
's
circle
in
Naples
.


the
result
in
Odo
's
case
be
a
reaction
toward
the
pleasure
of
his
age
;


and
of
these
Rome
have
but
few
to
offer
.
he
spend
some
month
in
the


study
of
the
antique
,
purchase
a
few
good
example
of
sculpture
for


the
Duke
,
and
then
,
without
great
reluctance
,
set
out
for
Monte
Alloro
.




here
he
find
a
change
atmosphere
.
the
Duke
welcome
he
handsomely
,


and
bestow
the
high
praise
on
the
rarity
he
have
collect
;
but


for
the
moment
the
court
be
rule
by
a
new
favourite
,
to
whom
Odo
be


come
be
obviously
unwelcome
.
this
adroit
adventurer
,
whose
name
be


soon
to
become
notorious
throughout
Europe
,
have
take
the
old
prince
by


his
darling
weakness
,
and
Odo
,
have
no
mind
to
share
in
the
excess


of
the
precious
couple
,
seize
the
first
occasion
to
set
out
again
on


his
travel
.




his
course
have
now
become
one
of
aimless
wandering
;
for
prudence
still


forbid
his
return
to
Pianura
,
and
his
patron
's
indifference
leave
he


free
to
come
and
go
as
he
choose
.
he
have
bring
from
Rome
--
that
albergo


d'ira
--
a
settle
melancholy
of
spirit
,
which
seek
refuge
in
such


distraction
as
the
moment
offer
.
in
such
a
mood
change
of
scene
be
a


necessity
,
and
he
resolve
to
employ
the
next
month
in
visit
several


of
the
mid
-
italian
city
.
toward
Florence
he
be
specially
draw
by
the


fact
that
Alfieri
now
live
there
;
but
,
as
often
happen
after
such


separation
,
the
reunion
be
a
disappointment
.
alfieri
,
indeed
,
warmly


welcome
his
friend
;
but
he
be
engross
in
his
dawn
passion
for
the


Countess
of
Albany
,
and
that
lady
's
pitiable
situation
exclude
all


other
interest
from
his
mind
.
to
Odo
,
to
whom
the
year
have
bring
an


increase
detachment
,
this
self
-
absorption
seem
an
arrest
in
growth
;


for
Alfieri
's
early
worship
of
liberty
have
not
yet
find
its
destine


channel
of
expression
,
and
for
the
moment
his
enthusiasm
have
shrink
to


the
compass
of
a
romantic
adventure
.
the
friend
part
after
a
few
day


of
unsatisfying
intercourse
;
and
it
be
under
the
influence
of
this


final
disenchantment
that
Odo
set
out
for
Venice
.




it
be
the
vintage
season
,
and
the
traveller
descend
from
the


apennine
on
a
landscape
diversify
by
the
picturesque
incident
of
the

on
every

some

have
show
great
reluctance
at

where
,
as
he
declare
,
he
find
himself

Odo

in
the
mood
to
allow
any

his
course
.
he
have
an

on
this
occasion

already
apprise
she
of
the

that
she

at

man
with
an
air

careless


kindly
strength
emerge

Odo
.




"
I
be
happy
,

,
"
to

at
Bellocchio
a
member

Pianura
;
and
your
excellency
will
no
doubt
be
as


well
-
pleased
as
ourselves
that
accident
enable
we
to
make
acquaintance


without
the
formality
of
an
introduction
.
"




this
,
then
,
be
the
famous
procuratore
Bra
,
whose
house
have
give
three


dog
to
Venice
,
and
who
be
himself
regard
as
the
most
powerful
if


not
the
most
scrupulous
noble
of
his
day
.
Odo
have
hear
many
tale
of


his
singularity
,
for
in
a
generation
of
elegant
trifler
his
figure


stand
out
with
the
ruggedness
of
a
granite
boulder
in
a
clipped
and


gravel
garden
.
to
hereditary
wealth
and
influence
he
add
a
love
of


power
second
by
great
political
sagacity
and
an
inflexible
will
.
if


his
mean
be
not
always
above
suspicion
they
at
least
tend
to


statesmanlike
end
,
and
in
his
public
capacity
he
be
faithful
to
the


high
interest
of
the
state
.
report
differ
as
to
his
private
use


of
his
authority
.
he
be
note
for
his
lavish
way
of
living
,
and
for
a


hospitality
which
distinguish
he
from
the
majority
of
his
class
,
who
,


however
showy
in
their
establishment
,
seldom
receive
stranger
,
and


entertain
each
other
only
on
the
most
ceremonious
occasion
.
the


procuratore
keep
open
house
both
in
Venice
and
on
the
Brenta
,
and
in
his


drawing
-
room
the
foreign
traveller
be
welcome
as
freely
as
in
Paris


or
London
.
here
,
too
,
be
to
be
meet
the
wit
,
musician
and
literati


whom
a
traditional
morgue
still
exclude
from
many
aristocratic
house
.


yet
in
spite
of
his
hospitality
(
or
perhaps
because
of
it
)
the


procuratore
,
as
Odo
know
,
be
the
butt
of
the
very
poet
he
entertain
,


and
the
worst
satirise
man
in
Venice
.
it
be
his
misfortune
to
be
in


love
with
his
wife
;
and
this
state
of
mind
(
in
itself
sufficiently


ridiculous
)
and
the
shift
and
compromise
to
which
it
reduce
he
,
be


a
source
of
endless
amusement
to
the
humorist
.
nor
be
graver
rumour


want
;
for
it
be
know
that
the
procuratore
,
so
proof
against
other


persuasion
,
be
helpless
in
his
wife
's
hand
,
and
that
honest
man
have


be
undo
and
scoundrel
exalt
at
a
nod
of
the
beautiful


procuratessa
.
that
lady
,
as
famous
in
her
way
as
her
husband
,
be
note


for
quite
different
quality
;
so
that
,
accord
to
one
satirist
,
she


hospitality
begin
where
his
end
,
and
the
Albergo
Bra
(
the
nickname


their
palace
go
by
)
be

in
the
lampoon
of
the
day
as


furnish
both
bed
and
board
.
in
some
respect
,
however
,
the
taste
of


the
noble
couple
agree
,
both
delight
in
music
,
wit
,
good
company
,


and
all
the
adornment
of
life
;
while
,
with
regard
to
their
private


conduct
,
it
doubtless
suffer
by
be
view
through
the
eye
of
a


narrow
and
trivial
nobility
,
apt
to
look
with
suspicion
on
any
deviation


from
the
custom
of
their
class
.
such
be
the
household
in
which
odo


find
himself
unexpectedly
include
.
he
learn
that
his

the
English
Duke
who
have
capture
his

that
morning
;
and
having
exchange
his

dress
for
a

suitable
toilet
he
be
presently

the
Procuratessa
at
once

he
to
the
row
of
gilt
armchair
where


she
sit
with
the
noble
Duke
and
several
lady
of
distinction

the


little

facet
of

in

Odo
be


strike
by
the
refined
brilliancy
of
the
scene

radiant
as
ever

and
dress


with
an
elegance
which
speak
well
for
the
liberality
of
her
new


protector
.
she
be
as
much
at
her
ease
as
before
the
vulgar
audience
of


Vercelli
,

spite
of
the
distinguished
eye
fix
upon
she
,
her
smile

sally
be
pointedly

to
Odo

this
make
he
the
object
of


the
Procuratessa

banter

have
an
opposite
effect
on
the
Marquess
,


who
fix
he
with
an
irritated
eye
and
fidget
restlessly
in
his
seat


as

when

the


terrace
,
which
be
now
bathe
in
the
whiteness
of
a
soar
moon
.
the


colonnade
detach
against
silver
-
misted
foliage
,
the
garden


spectrally
outspread
,
seem
to
enclose
he
in
a
magic
circle
of


loveliness
which
the
first
ray
of
daylight
must
dispel
.
he
wander
on
,


draw
to
the
depth
of
shade
on
the
low
terrace
.
the
hush
grow


deep
,
the
murmur
of
the
river
more
mysterious
.
a
yew
-
arbour
invite


he
and
he
seat
himself
on
the
bench
niche
in
its
inmost
dusk
.
see


through
the
black
arch
of
the
arbour
the
moonlight
lie
like
snow
on


parterre
and
statue
.
he
think
of
Maria
Clementina
,
and
of
the


delight
she
would
have
feel
in
such
a
scene
as
he
have
just
leave
.
then


the
remembrance
of
Mirandolina
's
blandishment
steal
over
he
and
spite


of
himself
he
smile
at
the
Marquess
's
discomfiture
.
though
he
be
in
no


humour
for
an
intrigue
his
fancy
be
not
proof
against
the
romance
of


his
surrounding
,
and
it
seem
to
he
that
Miranda
's
eye
have
never


be
so
bright
or
her
smile
so
full
of
provocation
.
no
wonder
Frattanto


follow
she
like
a
lost
soul
and
the
Marquess
abandon
Rome
and


Baalbec
to
sit
at
the
foot
of
such
a
teacher
!
have
not
that
light


philosopher
after
all
choose
the
true
way
and
guess
the
Sphinx
's


riddle
?
why
should
today
always
be
jilt
for
tomorrow
,
sensation


sacrifice
to
thought
?




as
he
sat
revolve
these
question
the
yew
-
branch
seem
to
stir
,
and


from
some
deep
recess
of
shade
a
figure
steal
to
his
side
.
he
start
,


but
a
hand
be
lay
on
his
lip
and
he
be
gently
force
back
into
his


seat
.
dazzle
by
the
outer
moonlight
he
could
just
guess
the
outline
of


the
figure
press
against
his
own
.
he
sit
speechless
,
yield
to
the


charm
of
the
moment
,
till
suddenly
he
feel
a
rapid
kiss
and
the
visitor


vanish
as
mysteriously
as
she
have
come
.
he
spring
up
to
follow
,
but


inclination
fail
with
his
first
step
.
let
the
spell
of
mystery
remain


unbroken
!
he
sink
down
on
the
seat
again
lull
by
dreamy
musing
...




when
he
look
up
the
moonlight
have
fade
and
he
feel
a
chill
in
the


air
.
he
walk
out
on
the
terrace
.
the
moon
hang
low
and
the
tree

music
cease
and
not
a
sound
be

but
the
stir
of
the


foliage
and
the
murmur
of
the
river
against
its
bank
.
then
,
from
a


loggia
above
the
central
portico
,
a
woman

clear
contralto

or
a
ball

by
the


principal
family
of
the

.
Odo
soon
contrive
to
reassure


the
Marquess
as
to
his
design
upon
Miranda

and
when

not
at

two
young

much
of

together

the


Marquess
be
never
tired
of
extoll
the
taste
and
ingenuity
with
which


the
Venetians
plan
and
carry
out
their
recreation
.
"
nature


herself
,
"
say
he
,
"
seem
the
accomplice
of
their
merry

making
,
and
in


no
other
surrounding
could
man
's
natural
craving
for
diversion
find
so


graceful
and
poetic
an
expression
.
"




the
scene
on
which
they
look
out
seem
to
confirm
his
word
.
it
be


the
last
evening
of
their
stay
at
Bellocchio
,
and
the
Procuratessa
have


plan
a
musical
festival
on
the
river

festoon
of
coloured
lantern

from

the


Procuratore

great
barge

with
crimson
velvet

the
comedian

as


the
guest
step
on
board
they
be
receive
by
Miranda
,
a
rosy
Venus

,

by
Mars

Adonis
,
recite
an
ode
compose
by

with
silk

,
while
the


guest
feast
,
dozen
of
little
boat
hang
with
light
and
fill
with


musician
flit
about
the
Bucentaur
like
a
swarm
of
musical


firefly
...




the
next
day
Odo
accompany
the
Procuratessa
to
Venice
.
have
he
be
a


traveller
from
beyond
the
alp
he
could
hardly
have
be
more
unprepared


for
the
spectacle
that
await
he
.
in
aspect
and
custom
Venice


differ
almost
as
much
from
other
italian
city
as
from
those
of
the


rest
of
Europe
.
from
the
fanciful
stone
embroidery
of
her
church
and


palace
to
a
hundred
singularity
in
dress
and
manner
--
the


full
-
bottomed
wig
and
long
gown
of
the
noble
,
the
black
mantle
and


head
-
drapery
of
the
lady
,
the
white
mask
wear
abroad
by
both
sex
,


the
publicity
of
social
life
under
the
arcade
of
the
Piazza
,
the


extraordinary
freedom
of
intercourse
in
the
casini
,
gaming
-
room
and


theatre
--
the
city
proclaim
,
in
every
detail
of
life
and
architecture
,


her
independence
of
any
tradition
but
her
own
.
this
be
the
more


singular
as
Saint
Mark
's
square
have
for
century
be
the
meeting
-
place


of
East
and
West
,
and
the
goal
of
artist
,
scholar
and
pleasure
-
seeker


from
all
part
of
the
world
.
indeed
,
as
Coeur
-
Volant
point
out
,
the


venetian
custom
almost
appear
to
have
be
devise
for
the


convenience
of
stranger
.
the
privilege
of
going
mask
at
almost
all


season
and
the
enforced
uniformity
of
dress
,
which
in
itself
provide
a


kind
of
incognito
,
make
the
place
singularly
favourable
to
every
kind
of


intrigue
and
amusement
;
while
the
mild
temper
of
the
people
and
the


watchfulness
of
the
police
prevent
the
public
disorder
that
such


license
might
have
occasion
.
these
seem
anomaly
abound
on
every


side
.
from
the
gaming
-
table
where
a
tinker
might
set
a
ducat
against
a


prince
it
be
but
a
few
step
to
the
broglio
,
or
arcade
under
the
ducal


palace
,
into
which
no
plebeian
might
intrude
while
the
nobility
walk


there
.
the
great
lady
,
who
be
subject
to
strict
sumptuary
law
,
and


might
not
display
their
jewel
or
try
the
new
french
fashion
but
on
the


sly
,
be
yet
privilege
at
all
hour
to
go
abroad
alone
in
their


gondola
.
no
society
be
more
haughty
and
exclusive
in
its
tradition
,


yet
the
mask
level
all
class
and
permit
,
during
the
great
part


of
the
year
,
an
equality
of
intercourse
undreame
of
in
other
city
;


while
the
noble
,
though
more
magnificently
house
than
in
any
other


capital
of
Europe
,
generally
seek
amusement
at
the
public
casini
or


assembly
-
room
instead
of
receive
company
in
their
own
palace
.
such


be
but
a
few
of
the
contradiction
in
a
city
where
the
theatre
be


name
after
the
neighbouring
church
,
where
there
be
innumerable


religious
foundation
but
scarce
an
ecclesiastic
to
be
meet
in
company
,


and
where
the
lady
of
the
laity
dress
like
nun
,
while
the
nun
in


the
aristocratic
convent
go
in
gala
habit
and
with
uncover
head
.


no
wonder
that
to
the
bewildered
stranger
the
Venetians
seem
to
keep


perpetual
carnival
and
Venice
herself
to
be
as
it
be
the
mere
stage
of


some
huge
comic
interlude
.




to
Odo
the
setting
be
even
more
astonishing
than
the
performance
.
never


have
he
see
pleasure
and
grace
so
happily
ally
,
all
the
art
of
life


so
combine
in
the
single
effort
after
enjoyment
.
here
be
not
a
mere


tendency
to
linger
on
the
surface
,
but
the
essence
of
superficiality


itself
;
not
an
ignoring
of
what
lie
beneath
,
but
an
elimination
of
it
;


as
though
all
human
experience
should
be
beat
thin
and
spread
out


before
the
eye
like
some
brilliant
tenuous
plaque
of
etruscan
gold
.
and


in
this
science
of
pleasure
--
mere
jeweller
's
work
though
it
be
--
the


great
artist
have
collaborate
,
each
contribute
his
page
to
the


philosophy
of
enjoyment
in
the
form
of
some
radiant
allegory
flowering


from
palace
wall
or
ceiling
like
the
enlarged
reflection
of
the
life


beneath
it
.
nowhere
be
the
mind
arrest
by
a
question
or
an
idea
.


thought
slunk
away
like
an
unmasked
guest
at
the
ridotto
.
sensation


rule
supreme
,
and
each
moment
be
an
iridescent
bubble
fresh
-
blown
from


the
lip
of
fancy
.




Odo
bring
to
the
spectacle
the
humour
well
fit
for
its
enjoyment
.


his
weariness
and
discouragement
seek
refuge
in
the
emotional


satisfaction
of
the
hour
.
here
at
least
the
old
problem
of
living
have


be
solve
,
and
from
the
patrician
take
the
air
in
his
gondola
to
the


gondoli
himself
,
gambling
and
singe
on
the
water
-
step
of
his


master
's
palace
,
all
seem
equally
satisfied
with
the
solution
.
now
if


ever
be
the
time
to
cry
"
halt
!
"
to
the
present
,
to
forget
the
travel


road
and
take
no
thought
for
the
morrow
...




the
month
pass
rapidly
and
agreeably
.
the
Procuratessa
be
the
most


amiable
of
guide
,
and
in
her
company
Odo
enjoy
the
good
that
Venice


have
to
offer
,
from
the
matchless
music
of
the
church
and
hospital
to


the
petit
souper
in
the
private
casini
of
the
nobility
;
while


Coeur
-
Volant
and
Castelrovinato
introduce
he
to
scene
where
even
a


lady
of
the
Procuratessa
's
intrepidity
might
not
venture
.




such
a
life
leave
little
time
for
thoughtful
pleasure
;
nor
do
Odo
find


in
the
society
about
he
any
sympathy
with
his
more
personal
taste
.
at


first
he
yield
willingly
enough
to
the
pressure
of
his
surrounding
,


glad
to
escape
from
thought
of
the
past
and
speculation
about
the


future
;
but
it
be
impossible
for
he
to
lose
his
footing
in
such
an


element
,
and
at
time
he
feel
the
lack
of
such
companionship
as
de


Crucis
have
give
he
.
there
be
no
society
in
Venice
correspond
with


the
polished
circle
of
Milan
or
Naples
,
or
with
the
academic
class
in


such
University
town
as
Padua
and
Pavia
.
the
few
Venetians
destine
to


be
remember
among
those
who
have
contribute
to
the
intellectual


advancement
of
Italy
vegetate
in
obscurity
,
suffer
not
so
much
from


religious
persecution
--
for
the
Inquisition
have
little
power
in


Venice
--
as
from
the
incorrigible
indifference
of
a
society
which
ignore


all
who
do
not
contribute
to
its
amusement
.
Odo
indeed
might
have


seek
out
these
unhonoured
prophet
,
but
that
all
the
influence
about


he
set
the
other
way
,
and
that
he
be
fall
more
and
more
into
the


habit
of
run
with
the
tide
.
now
and
then
,
however
,
a
vague
ennui


drive
he
to
one
of
the
bookshop
which
,
throughout
Italy
be
the
chief


meeting
-
place
of
student
and
author
.
on
one
of
these
occasion
the


dealer
invite
he
into
a
private
room
where
he
keep
some
rare
volume
,


and
here
Odo
be
surprised
to
meet
Andreoni
,
the
liberal
bookseller
of


Pianura
.




andreoni
at
first
seem
somewhat
disconcert
by
the
meeting
;
but


presently
recover
his
confidence
,
he
tell
Odo
that
he
have
be


recently
banish
from
Pianura
,
the
cause
of
his
banishment
be
the


publication
of
a
book
on
taxation
that
be
suppose
to
reflect
on
the


fiscal
system
of
the
duchy
.
though
he
do
not
name
the
author
,
Odo
at


once
suspect
Gamba
;
but
on
his
enquire
if
the
latter
have
also
be


banish
,
Andreoni
merely
reply
that
he
have
be
dismiss
from
his


post
,
and
have
leave
Pianura
.
the
bookseller
go
on
to
say
that
he
have


come
to
Venice
with
the
idea
of
set
up
his
press
either
there
or
in


Padua
,
where
his
wife
's
family
live
.
Odo
be
eager
to
hear
more
;
but


Andreoni
courteously
decline
to
wait
on
he
at
his
lodging
,
on
the


plea
that
it
might
harm
they
both
to
be
see
together
.
they
agree
,


however
,
to
meet
in
San
Zaccaria
after
low
mass
the
next
morning
,
and


here
Andreoni
give
Odo
a
full
report
of
recent
event
in
the
duchy
.




it
appear
that
in
the
incessant
see
-
saw
of
party
influence
the
Church


have
once
more
gain
on
the
liberal
.
Trescorre
be
out
of
favour
,
the


Dominican
have
begin
to
show
his
hand
more
openly
,
and
the
Duke
,
more


than
ever
apprehensive
about
his
health
,
be
seek
to
conciliate


heaven
by
his
renew
persecution
of
the
reformer
.
in
the
general


upheaval
even
Crescenti
have
nearly
lose
his
place
;
and
it
be
rumour


that
he
keep
it
only
through
the
intervention
of
the
Pope
,
who
have


represent
to
the
Duke
that
the
persecution
of
a
scholar
already
famous


throughout
Europe
would
reflect
little
credit
on
the
Church
.




as
for
Gamba
,
Andreoni
,
though
unwilling
to
admit
a
knowledge
of
his


exact
whereabouts
,
assure
Odo
that
he
be
well
and
have
not
lose


courage
.
at
court
matter
remain
much
as
usual
.
the
Duchess
,


surround
by
her
familiar
,
have
enter
on
a
new
phase
of
mad


expenditure
,
drain
the
exchequer
to
indulge
her
private
whim
,


fill
her
apartment
with
mountebank
and
player
,
and
borrow
from


courtier
and
servant
to
keep
her
creditor
from
the
door
.
Trescorre


be
no
long
able
to
check
her
extravagance
,
and
his
influence
with
the


Duke
be
on
the
wane
,
the
court
be
once
more
the
scene
of
unseemly


scandal
and
disorder
.




the
only
new
figure
to
appear
there
since
Odo
's
departure
be
that
of


the
little
prince
's
governor
,
who
have
come
from
Rome
a
few
month


previously
to
superintend
the
heir
's
education
,
which
be
find
to
have


be
grievously
neglect
under
his
former
master
.
this
be
an


ecclesiastic
,
an
ex
-
Jesuit
as
some
say
,
but
without
doubt
a
man
of


part
,
and
apparently
of
more
tolerant
view
than
the
other
churchman


about
the
court
.




"
but
,
"
andreoni
add
,
"
your
excellency
may
chance
to
recall
he
;
for
he


be
the
same
abate
de
Crucis
who
be
send
to
Pianura
by
the
Holy
Office


to
arrest
the
german
astrologer
.
"




Odo
hear
he
with
surprise
.
he
have
have
no
news
of
de
Crucis
since
their


part
in
Rome
,
where
,
as
he
suppose
,
the
latter
be
to
remain
for


some
year
in
the
service
of
Prince
Bracciano
.
Odo
be
at
a
loss
to


conceive
how
or
why
the
Jesuit
have
come
to
Pianura
;
but
,
whatever
his


reason
for
be
there
,
it
be
certain
that
his
influence
must
make


itself
feel
far
beyond
the
range
of
his
immediate
duty
.
whether
this


influence
would
be
exert
for
good
or
ill
it
be
impossible
to


forecast
;
but
much
as
Odo
admire
de
Crucis
,
he
could
not
forget
that


the
Jesuit
,
by
his
own
avowal
,
be
still
the
servant
of
the
great


organise
opposition
to
moral
and
intellectual
freedom
that
the
world


have
ever
know
.
that
this
opposition
be
not
always
actively
manifest


Odo
be
well
aware
.
he
know
that
the
Jesuit
spirit
move
in
many


direction
and
that
its
action
be
often
more
beneficial
than
that
of


its
opponent
;
but
it
remain
an
incalculable
element
in
the


composition
of
human
affair
,
and
one
the
more
to
be
fear
since
,
in


cease
to
have
a
material
existence
,
it
have
acquire
the
dread


pervasiveness
of
an
idea
.




with
the
Epiphany
the
wild
carnival
-
season
set
in
.
nothing
could
surpass


the
excess
of
this
mad
time
.
all
class
seemed
bite
by
the


tarantula
of
mirth
,
every
gondola
hide
an
intrigue
,
the
patrician
's


tabarro
conceal
a
noble
lady
,
the
feminine
hood
and
cloak
a
young


spark
bent
on
mystification
,
the
friar
's
habit
a
man
of
pleasure
and
the


nun
's
veil

of
the

with
merry

the

of
the
nobility
,

the
scene

window
of

and
flock
about
the
rhinoceros


exhibit
in
a
great
canvas
tent
in
the
Piazzetta
.
the
characteristic


contrast
of
venetian
life
seem
to
be
emphasise
by
the
vagary
of


the
carnival
,
and
Odo
never
cease
to
be
divert
by
the
sight
of
a
long


line
of
masquerader
in
every
kind
of
comic
disguise
kneeling
devoutly


before

light
shrine
of
the
Virgin
under
the
arch
of

Procuratie

while
the
friar
who
lead
their
devotion
interrupt
his


litany
whenever
the
quack
on
an
adjoining
platform
begin
to
bawl
through


a
tin
trumpet
the
praise
of
his
miraculous
pill
.




the
mount
madness
culminate
on
Giovedi
Grasso
,
the
last
Thursday


before
Lent
,
when
the
Piazzetta

the
scene
of
ceremony
in
which


the
Doge
himself
take
part
.
these
open
with
the
decapitation
of
three

a
rite

to
commemorate
some
long
-
forget
dispute
between


the
inveterate
enemy
,
Venice
and

bloody
work
,

off
each

with
a
single
stroke
of
his
huge


sword

this
slaughter
be
succeed
by
pleasanter
sight

such
as
the


famous
Vola

themselves
into
a
kind
of

,
shift
their


posture
with
inexhaustible
agility
,
while
burst
of
firework
wove


yellow
arch
through
the
midday
light
.
meanwhile
the
crowd
in
the


street
flee
this
way
and
that
as
a
throng
of
uproarious
young
fellow


drive
before
they
the
bull
that

in

shelter
from
the
rout
,

posture

have
gather


a
crowd
about
his
carpet

Ash
Wednesday
bring
about
a
dramatic
transformation
.
every
travesty


lay
aside
,
every
tent
and
stall
sweep
away
,
the
people
again
gather


in
the
Piazza
to
receive
the
ashe
of
penitence
on
their
head
,
the


church
now
become
the
chief
centre
of
interest
.
Venice
be
note
for


her
sacred
music
and
for
the
lavish
illumination
of
her
favourite


shrine
and
chapel
;
and
few
religious
spectacle
be
more
impressive


than
the
Forty
Hours
'
devotion
in
the
wealthy
church
of
the
city
.


all
the
magic
of
music
,
painting
and
sculpture
be
combine
in
the


service
of
religion
,
and
Odo
's
sense
of
the
dramatic
quality
of
the


catholic
rite
find
gratification
in
the
move
scene
where
,
amid
the


imperishable
splendour
of
his
own
creation
,
man
own
himself
but
dust
.


never
before
have
he
be
so
alive
to
the
symbolism
of
the
penitential


season
,
so
awed
by
the
beauty
and
symmetry
of
that
great
structure
of


the
Liturgical
Year
that
lead
the
soul
up
,
step
by
step
,
to
the
awful


height
of
Calvary
.
the
very
carelessness
of
those
about
he
seem
to


deepen
the
solemnity
of
the
scene
enact
--
as
though
the
Church
,
after


all
her
century
of
dominion
,
be
still
,
as
in
those
early
day
,
but
a


voice
cry
in
the
wilderness
.




the
Easter
bell
usher
in
the
reign
of
another
spirit
.
if
the
carnival


folly
be
spend
,
the
joy
of
return
life
replace
it
.
after
the
winter


diversion
of
card
,
concert
and
theatre
,
come
the
excursion
to
the

no

natural

one

,
but
he


shrink
from
the
thought
of
force
himself
upon
she
.
she
have
promise
to


receive
he
;
but
what
revulsion
of
feeling
might
not
the
morrow
bring
?




unable
to
sleep
,
he
bid
the
boatman
carry
he
to
the
Lido
.
the
sun
be


just
rise
above
the
Friulian
Alps
and
the
lagoon
lie
dull
and
smooth


as
a
breathe
-
on
mirror
.
as
he
pace
the
lonely
sand
he
try
to


reconstruct
Fulvia
's
break
story
,
supplement
it
with
such
detail
as


his
experience
of
venetian
life
suggest
.
it
appear
that
after
she


father
's
death
she
have
find
herself
possess
of
a
small
sum
of
money


which
he
have
painfully
accumulate
for
she
during
the
two
year
they
have


spend
in
Pavia
.
her
only
thought
be
to
employ
this
inheritance
in


publish
the
great
work
on
the
origin
of
civilisation
which
Vivaldi


have
complete
a
few
day
before
his
last
seizure
.
through
one
of
the


professor
of
the
University
,
who
have
be
her
father
's
friend
,
she


negotiate
with
a
printer
of
Amsterdam
for
the
production
of
the
book
,


and
the
term
be
agree
on
,
despatch
the
money
and
the
manuscript


thither
by
a
sure
hand
.
both
be
duly
deliver
and
the
publisher
have


advanced
so
far
in
his
work
as
to
send
Fulvia
the
proof
-
sheet
of
the


first
chapter
,
when
he
take
alarm
at
the
renew
activity
of
the
Holy


Office
in
France
and
Italy
,
declare
there
would
be
no
market
for
the


book
in
the
present
state
of
affair
,
and
refuse
either
to
continue


print
it
,
or
to
restore
the
money
,
which
he
say
have
barely
cover


the
setting
-
up
of
the
type
.
Fulvia
then
attempt
to
recover
the


manuscript
;
but
the
publisher
refuse
to
surrender
it
,
she
find


herself
doubly
beggar
at
a
stroke
.




in
this
extremity
she
turn
to
a
sister
of
her
father
's
,
who
live
near


Treviso
;
and
this
excellent
woman
,
though
persuade
that
her
brother
's


heretical
view
have
doom
he
to
everlasting
torment
,
do
not
scruple


to
offer
his
child
a
home
.
here
Fulvia
have
live
for
two
year
when
her


aunt
's
sudden
death
leave
her
destitute
;
for
the
good
lady
,
to
atone
for


having
give
shelter
to
a
niece
of
doubtful
orthodoxy
,
have
leave
the


whole
of
her
small
property
to
the
Church
.




Fulvia
's
only
other
relation
be
certain
distant
cousin
of
she


mother
's
,
member
of
the
venetian
nobility
,
but
of
the
indigent
class


call
Barnabotti
,
who
live
on
the
bounty
of
the
state
.
while
in


Treviso
she
have
make
the
acquaintance
of
one
of
these
cousin
,
a


stir
noisy
fellow
involve
in
all
the
political
agitation
of
the


state
.
it
be
among
the
Barnabotti
,
the
class
most
indebted
to
the


government
,
that
these
seditious
movement
generally
arise
;
and
Fulvia
's


cousin
be
one
of
the
most
notorious
malcontent
of
his
order
.
she
have


mistaken
his
revolutionary
bluster
for
philosophic
enlightenment
;
and
,


persuade
that
he
share
in
her
view
,
she
rashly
appeal
to
he
for


help
.
with
the
most
eloquent
expression
of
sympathy
he
offer
she
a


home
under
his
own
roof
;
but
on
reach
Venice
she
be
but
ill
-
receive


by
his
wife
and
family
,
who
make
no
scruple
of
declare
that
,
be
but


pensioner
themselves
,
they
be
in
no
state
to
nourish
their
pauper


relative
.
Fulvia
could
not
but
own
that
they
be
right
;
for
they
live


in
the
garret
of
a
half
-
ruin
house
,
pawn
their
very
bed
to
pay
for


ice
in
the
piazza
and
sit
at
home
all
the
week
in
dirty
shift
and


night
-
cap
that
they
might
go
to
mass
in
silk
and
powder
on
a
Sunday
.


after
two
month
of
wretchedness
with
these
unfriendly
host
,
whom
she


vainly
try
to
conciliate
by
a
hundred
little
service
and
attention


the
poor
girl
resolve
to
return
to
Milan
,
where
she
hope
to
obtain


some
menial
position
in
the
household
of
one
of
her
father
's
friend
.


her
cousin
,
at
this
,
make
a
great
outcry
,
protest
that
none
of
their


blood
should
so
demean
herself
,
and
that
they
would
spare
no
effort
to


find
some
well
way
of
provide
for
she
.
their
noble
connection
give


Fulvia
the
hope
that
they
might
obtain
a
small
pension
for
she
,
and
she


unsuspiciously
yield
to
their
wish
;
but
to
her
dismay
she
learn
a


few
week
later
,
that
,
thank
to
their
exertion
,
she
be
to
be
admit


as
a
novice
to
the
convent
of
Santa
Chiara
.
though
it
be
the
common
way


of
dispose
of
portionless
girl
,
the
liberal
view
of
her
cousin
have


reassure
Fulvia
,
and
she
wake
to
her
fate
too
late
to
escape
it
.
she


be
to
enter
on
her
novitiate
on
the
morrow
;
but
even
have
delay
be


possible
she
know
that
both
the
civil
and
religious
authority
would


sustain
her
family
in
their
course
.




her
cousin
,
know
her
independent
spirit
,
and
perhaps
fear
an


outcry
if
they
sequester
she
too
closely
,
have
think
to
soften
she


resistance
by
place
she
in
a
convent
note
for
its
leniency
;
but
to


Fulvia
such
surrounding
be
more
repugnant
than
the
strict
monastic


discipline
.
the
corruption
of
the
religious
order
be
a
favourite
topic


with
her
father
's
friend
,
and
the
Venetian
nun
be
note
throughout


Italy
for
their
frivolous
and
dissipate
life
;
but
nothing
that
Fulvia


have
hear
or
imagine
approach
the
reality
that
await
she
.
at


first
the
mere
sense
of
imprisonment
,
of
be
cut
off
forever
from
the


world
of
free
thought
and
action
which
have
be
her
native
element
,


overwhelm
every
other
feeling
,
and
she
lie
numb
in
the
clutch
of
fate
.


but
she
be
too
young
for
this
merciful
torpor
to
last
,
and
with
the


return
consciousness
of
her
situation
come
the
instinctive
effort
to


amend
it
.
how
she
long
then
to
have
be
bury
in
some
strict
order
,


where
she
might
have
spend
her
day
in
solitary
work
and
meditation
!
how


she
loathe
the
petty
gossip
of
the
nun
,
their
furtive
reaching
after


forbid
pleasure
!
the
blind
bigotry
would
have
be
less


insufferable
than
this
clandestine
commerce
with
the
world
,
the


strict
sequestration
than
this
open
parody
of
the
monastic
calling
.


she
seek
in
vain
among
her
companion
for
an
answer
mind
.
many
,


like
herself
,
be
in
open
rebellion
against
their
lot
;
but
for
reason


so
different
that
the
feeling
be
an
add
estrangement
.
at
last
the


longing
to
escape
over
-
master
every
other
sensation
.
it
become
a
fix


idea
,
a
devouring
passion
.
she
do
not
trust
herself
to
think
of
what


must
follow
,
but
centre
every
faculty
on
the
effort
of
evasion
.




at
this
point
in
her
story
her
grow
distress
have
make
it
hard
for
Odo


to
gather
more
than
a
general
hint
of
her
meaning
.
it
be
clear
,


however
,
that
she
have
find
her
sole
hope
of
escape
lie
in
gain
the


friendship
of
one
of
the
more
favour
nun
.
her
own
position
in
the


community
be
of
the
humblest
,
for
she
have
neither
rank
nor
wealth
to


commend
she
;
but
her
skill
on
the
harpsichord
have
attract
the
notice


of
the
music
-
mistress
and
she
have
be
enrol
in
the
convent
orchestra


before
her
novitiate
be
over
.
this
have
bring
she
into
contact
with
a


few
of
the
more
favoured
sister
,
and
among
they
she
have
recognise
in


Sister
Mary
of
the
Crucifix
the
daughter
of
the
nobleman
who
have
be


her
aunt
's
landlord
at
Treviso
.
Fulvia
's
name
be
not
unknown
to
the


handsome
nun
,
and
the
coincidence
be
enough
to
draw
they
together
in
a


community
where
such
trivial
affinity
must
replace
the
tie
of
nature
.


Fulvia
soon
learn
that
Mary
of
the
Crucifix
be
the
spoiled
darling
of


the
convent
.
her
beauty
and
spirit
,
as
much
perhaps
as
her
family


connection
,
have
give
she
this
predominance
;
and
no
scruple
interfere


with
her
use
of
it
.
find
herself
,
as
she
declare
,
on
the
wrong
side


of
the
grate
,
she
determine
to
gather
in
all
the
pleasure
she
could


reach
through
it
;
and
her
reach
be
certainly
prodigious
.
here
Odo
have


be
oblige
to
fall
back
on
his
knowledge
of
venetian
custom
to


conjecture
the
incident
lead
up
to
the
scene
of
the
previous
night
.


he
divine
that
Fulvia
,
madden
by
having
have
to
pronounce
the


irrevocable
vow
,
have
resolve
to
fly
at
all
hazard
;
that
Sister
Mary
,


unconscious
of
her
design
,
have
propose
to
take
she
on
a
party
of


pleasure
,
and
that
the
rash
girl
,
blind
to
every
risk
but
that
of
delay
,


have
seize
on
this
desperate
mean
of
escape
.
what
must
have
follow


have
she
not
chance
on
Odo
,
she
have
clearly
neither
the
courage
nor
the


experience
to
picture
;
but
she
seem
to
have
have
some
confused
idea
of


throw
herself
on
the
mercy
of
the
foreign
nobleman
she
believe
she


be
to
meet
.




so
much
Odo
have
gather
;
and
her
voice
,
her
gesture
,
the
disorder
of


her
spirit
,
supply
what
her
word
omit
.
not
for
a
moment
,
either
in


listen
to
she
or
in
the
soberer
period
of
revision
,
do
he
question


the
exact
truth
of
her
narrative
.
it
be
the
second
time
that
they
have


meet
under
strange
circumstance
;
yet
now
as
before
the
sense
of
she


candour
be
his
rule
thought
.
he
conclude
that
,
whatever
plight
she


find
herself
in
,
she
would
be
its
immediate
justification
;
and
feel


sure
he
must
have
reach
this
conclusion
though
love
have
not
have
a


stake
in
the
verdict
.
this
perhaps
but
prove
he
the
more
deeply
take
;


for
it
be
when
passion
tighten
the
net
that
reason
flap
her
wing
most


loudly
.




day
be
high
when
he
return
to
his
lodging
,
impatient
for
a
word
from


Fulvia
.
none
have
come
;
and
as
the
hour
pass
he
yield
to
the
most


dishearten
fancy
.
his
wretchedness
be
increase
by
the
thought


that
he
have
once
inflict
on
her
such
suspense
he
be
now
endure
;
and


he
go
so
far
as
to
wonder
if
this
be
her
revenge
for
Vercelli
.
but


if
the
past
be
intolerable
to
consider
the
future
be
all
baffle


fear
.
his
immediate
study
be
how
to
see
she
;
and
this
her
continue


silence
seem
to
refuse
he
.
the
extremity
of
her
plight
be
his
good


ally
;
yet
here
again
anxiety
suggest
that
his
having
be
the
witness


of
her
humiliation
must
insensibly
turn
she
against
he
.
never
perhaps


do
a
man
show
less
knowledge
of
human
nature
than
in
speculate
on


the
conduct
of
his
beloved
;
and
every
step
in
the
labyrinth
of
his


conjecture

Odo
far
from
the
truth

this
rise
on
he
at


nightfall
,
in
the
shape
of
a
letter
slip
in
his
hand
by
a
lay
-
sister


as
he
cross
the
square
before
his
lodging
.
he
step
to
the
light
of


the
near
shrine
and
read
the
few
word
in
a
tumult
.
"

Friday

he
see
her
meaning
in
a
flash
:
his
good
chance
of
speak
with
she
be


in
a
crowd
,
and
his
heart
bound
at
the
significance
of
her
admission
.


now
indeed
he
feel
himself
lord
of
the
future
.
nothing
count
but
that


he
be
to
see
she
.
his
horizon
be
narrow
to
the
bar
through
which


her
hand

greet

parlour

several

already
behind
the

with
a


group
of

gallant

a

moment
the

return
and
inform
Odo
that


Sister
Veronica
be
indispose
and
unable
to
leave

his
heart


sink

ask
if

send
no
message

the
portress
answer
in


the
negative

add
that
the
abbess
beg
he
to
come

doubtless
the

Odo
feel
an

repugnance

he
could
not

afternoon
light

softly
on


her
white

"

pause
a
moment

add
with
an


effort

silent
a

his
heart


sink
with
the
sense

her
remoteness

consciousness

distance

compel
an
add
prudence

once


again
he
find
himself
the
prisoner

his
folly

stand
aghast
at


the

she
ascribe
to
he

at

to
play
it
like
a
man

with
what
composure
he

assure
Fulvia

no
hope

obtain
her

intervening


time
in
devise
the
mean
of
Fulvia
's
rescue
.
he
be
resolve
to
let
no


rashness
or
negligence
hinder
the
attempt
,
and
to
prove
,
by
the


discretion
of
his
course
,
that
he
be
no
long
the
light
fool
who
have


once
hazard
her
safety
.
he
go
about
his
preparation
as
one
that
have


no
private
stake
in
the
venture
;
but
he
be
therefore
the
more


punctilious
to
show
himself
worthy
of
her
trust
and
sensible
of
the


charge
it
lay
upon
he
.




at
their
next
meeting
he
find
she
in
the
same
open
and
friendly
mood
,


and
she
listen
gratefully
as
he
set
forth
his
plan
.
this
be
that
she


should
first
write
to
a
doctor
of
the
University
in
Geneva
,
who
have
be


her
father
's
friend
,
state
her
plight
and
ask
if
he
could
help
she


to
a
living
should
she
contrive
to
reach
Geneva
.
pende
the
reply
,
Odo


be
to
plan
the
stage
of
the
journey
in
such
fashion
that
she
might


count
on
concealment
in
case
of
pursuit
;
and
she
be
not
to
attempt
she


escape
till
these
detail
be
decide
.
Fulvia
be
the
more
ready
to


acquiesce
in
this
postponement
as
she
do
not
wish
to
involve
Sister


Mary
in
her
adventure
,
but
hope
to
escape
unassisted
during
an


entertainment
which
be
to
take
place
in
the
convent
on
the
feast
of


Saint
Michael
,
some
six
week
later
.




to
Odo
the
delay
be
still
more
welcome
;
for
it
give
he
what
he
must


need
regard
as
his
last
opportunity
of
be
in
the
girl
's
company
.
she


have
accept
his
companionship
on
the
journey
with
a
readiness
in
which


he
see
only
the
magnanimity
of
pardon
;
but
in
Geneva
they
must
part
,
and


what
hope
have
he
of
see
she
again
?
the
first
smart
of
vanity
allay
,


he
be
glad
she
choose
to
treat
he
as
a
friend
.
it
be
in
this
character


that
he
could
well
prove
his
disinterestedness
,
his
resolve
to
make


amend
for
the
past
;
and
in
this
character
only
--
as
he
now
feel
--
would


it
be
possible
for
he
to
part
from
she
.




on
his
second
visit
he
venture
to
discharge
his
mind
of
its
heavy


burden
by
enquire
what
have
befall
she
and
her
father
after
he
have


lose
trace
of
they
at
Vercelli
.
she
tell
he
quite
simply
that
,
fail


to
meet
he
at
the
appoint
place
,
they
at
once
guess
that
his
plan


have
be
wind
by
the
abate
who
travel
with
he
;
and
that
after
a


few
hour
'
delay
her
father
have
succeed
in
secure
a
chaise
which
have


take
they
safely
across
the
border
.
she
go
on
to
speak
of
the


hardship
they
have
suffer
after
reach
Milan
.
even
under
a


comparatively
liberal
government
it
be
small
advantage
to
be
mark
by


the
Holy
Office
;
and
though
he
receive
much
kindness
,
and
even
material


aid
,
from
those
of
his
way
of
thinking
,
Vivaldi
be
unable
to
obtain
the


professorship
he
have
hope
for
.




from
Milan
they
go
to
Pavia
;
but
in
this
University
,
the
most
liberal


in
Italy
,
the
chair
be
so
seek
after
that
there
be
no
hope
of
his


receive
a
charge
worthy
of
his
talent
.
here
,
however
,
his
spirit


breathe
its
natural
air
,
and
reluctant
to
lose
the
privilege
of
such


intercourse
he
decide
to
accept
the
post
of
librarian
to
an
eccentric


nobleman
of
the
town
.
if
his
pay
be
modest
his
duty
leave
he
leisure


for
the
work
which
be
his
chief
concern
;
for
his
patron
,
who
have
house


in
Milan
and
Brescia
,
come
seldom
to
Pavia
,
and
Fulvia
and
her
father


have
the
vast
palace
to
themselves
.
they
lodge
in
a
corner
adjoin
the


library
,
spend
their
day
in
studious
seclusion
,
their
evening
in


conversation
with
some
of
the
first
scholar
of
Europe
:
the
learn


botanist
Scopoli
,
Spallanzani
,
Volta
,
and
Father
Fontana
,
the
famous


mathematician
.
in
such
surrounding
Vivaldi
might
have
pursue
his
task


contentedly
enough
,
but
for
the
thought
of
Fulvia
's
future
.
this
,
his


daughter
say
,
continually
prey
on
he
,
drive
he
to
labour
beyond


his
strength
;
for
he
hope
by
the
publication
of
his
book
to
make
good
,


at
least
in
part
,
the
loss
of
the
small
property
which
the
sardinian


government
have
confiscate
.
all
her
entreaty
could
not
dissuade
he


from
over
-
exertion
;
and
in
addition
to
his
regular
duty
he
take
on


himself
(
as
she
afterward
learn
)
the
tedious
work
of
revise
proof


and
copy
manuscript
for
the
professor
.
this
drudgery
,
combine
with


severe
intellectual
effort
,
exceed
his
flagging
power
;
and
the
book


be
hardly
complete
when
his
patron
,
apprise
of
its
content
,
abruptly


remove
he
from
his
post
.
from
that
day
Vivaldi
sink
in
health
;
but
he


end
as
become
a
sage
,
content
to
have
discharge
the
task
for
which
he


have
give
up
home
and
substance
,
and
die
with
the
great
Stoic
's
word


upon
his
lips:--




lex
non
poena
mor
.




Vivaldi
's
friend
in
Milan
come
generously
to
Fulvia
's
aid
,
and
she


would
gladly
have
remain
among
they
;
but
after
the
loss
of
her
small


inheritance
and
of
her
father
's
manuscript
she
be
without
mean
of


repay
their
kindness
,
and
nothing
remain
but
to
turn
to
her
own


kin
.




as
Odo
sit
in
the
quiet
cell
,
listen
to
her
story
,
and
hear
again


the
great
name
his
youth
have
reverence
,
he
feel
himself
an
exile


return
to
his
own
,
mount
the
familiar
height
and
breathe
the


air
that
be
his
birthright
.
look
back
from
this
recover
standpoint


he
see
how
far
behind
his
early
hope
have
be
leave
.
since
his
departure


from
Naples
there
have
be
nothing
to
remind
he
of
that
vast
noiseless


labour
of
the
spirit
go
on
everywhere
beneath
the
social
surface
:


that
baffled
but
undiscouraged
endeavour
in
which
he
have
once
so


impatiently
claim
his
share
.
now
every
word
of
Fulvia
's
smite
the


bone
of
some
dead
purpose
,
till
his
bosom
seem
a
very
valley
of


Ezekiel
.
her
own
trial
have
fan
her
love
of
freedom
,
and
the
near


hope
of
release
lend
an
exaltation
to
her
word
.
of
bitterness
,
of


resentment
she
give
no
sign
;
and
he
be
awe
by
the
same
serenity
of


spirit
which
have
strike
he
in
the
imprison
doctor
.
but
perhaps
the


strong
impression
she
produce
be
that
of
increase
his
point
of


contact
with
life
.
his
other
sentimental
tie
have
be
a
barrier
between


himself
and
the
outer
world
;
but
the
feeling
which
draw
he
to
Fulvia


have
the
effect
of
level
the
bound
of
egoism
,
of
let
into
the


circle
of
his
near
emotion
that
great
tide
of
human
longing
and


effort
that
have
always
faintly
sound
on
the
shore
of
self
.
perhaps
it


be
her
power
of
evoke
this
wide
life
that
give
a
sense
of


permanence
,
of
security
almost
,
to
the
steal
moment
of
their


intercourse
,
lull
the
lover
's
impatience
of
actual
condition
with


the
sense
of
something
that
must
survive
the
accident
of
fortune
.
only


in
some
such
way
could
he
explain
,
in
look
back
,
the
completeness
of


each
moment
spend
with
she
.
he
be
conscious
even
at
the
time
of
a


suspension
of
the
emotional
law
,
a
charmed
surrender
to
the
limitation


of
his
fate
.
when
he
be
away
his
impatience
reassert
itself
;
but
she


presence
be
like
a
soothe
hand
on
his
spirit
,
and
he
know
that
his


quiet
hour
with
she
would
count
among
those
interval
between
the


crisis
of
life
that
flower
in
memory
when
the
crisis
themselves
have


fade
.




it
be
natural
that
in
the
course
of
these
visit
she
in
turn
should


question
he
;
and
as
his
past
rearrange
itself
beneath
her
scrutiny
he


seem
once
more
to
trace
the
thread
of
purpose
on
which
its
fragment


hang
.
he
tell
she
of
his
connection
with
the
liberal
of
Pianura
,
of
the


situation
at
court
,
and
of
the
reason
for
his
prolong
travel
.
as
he


talk
her
eye
convey
the
exquisite
sense
of
her
complete


comprehension
.
she
see
,
before
he
could
justify
himself
,
how
the


uncertainty
of
his
future
,
and
his
inability
to
act
,
have
cast
he
adrift


upon
a
life
of
superficial
enjoyment
;
and
how
his
latent
dissatisfaction


with
this
life
have
inevitably
result
in
self
-
distrust
and
vacillation
.


"
you
wait
your
hour
,
"
she
say
of
he
;
and
he
seize
on
the
phrase
as
a


justification
of
his
inactivity
and
,
when
chance
should
offer
,
a
spur
to


fresh
endeavour
.
her
interest
in
the
liberal
cause
have
be
intensify


and
exalt
by
her
father
's
death
--
his
martyrdom
,
as
she
describe
it
.


like
most
woman
possess
of
an
abstract
idea
she
have
unconsciously


personify
the
idea
and
make
a
religion
of
it
;
but
it
be
a
religion
of


charity
and
not
of
vindictiveness
.
"
I
should
like
my
father
's
death


avenge
by
love
and
not
by
hate
,
"
she
say
;
"
I
would
have
it
bring


peace
,
not
a
sword
.
"




on
one
point
only
she
remain
,
if
not
hostile
yet
unresponsive
.
this


be
when
he
speak
of
de
Crucis
.
her
manner
harden
instantly
,
and
he


perceive
that
,
though
he
dwell
on
the
Jesuit
's
tolerant
view
and


cultivate
taste
,
she
behold
only
the
priest
and
not
the
man
.
she
have


be
eager
to
hear
of
Crescenti
,
whom
she
know
by
name
as
a
student
of


european
repute
,
and
to
the
praise
of
whose
parochial
charity
she


listen
with
outspoken
sympathy
;
but
the
Jesuits
stand
for
the
Holy


Office
,
and
she
have
suffer
too
deeply
at
the
hand
of
the
Holy
Office


to
regard
with
an
open
mind
any
who
might
be
suppose
to
represent
its


principle
.
it
be
impossible
for
Odo
to
make
she
understand
how


distinctly
,
in
de
Crucis
's
case
,
the
man
predominate
over
the
order
;


and
conscious
of
the
painfulness
of
the
subject
,
he
give
up
the
attempt


to
interest
she
in
his
friend
.




three
or
four
time
he
be
permit
to
visit
she
in
her
cell
:
after


that
they
meet
almost
daily
in
the
parlour
,
where
,
about
the
hour
of


benediction
,
they
could
talk
almost
as
privately
under
cover
of
the


general
chatter
.
in
due
time
Fulvia
receive
an
answer
from
the


calvinist
professor
,
who
assure
she
of
a
welcome
in
Geneva
and
shelter


under
his
roof
.
odo
,
meanwhile
,
have
perfect
the
plan
of
their
journey
;


but
as
Michaelmas
approach
he
begin
to
fear
Cantapresto
's
observation
.


he
now
bitterly
regret
that
he
have
not
hold
to
his
purpose
of
send


the
soprano
back
to
Pianura
;
but
to
do
so
at
this
point
would
be
to


challenge
observation
and
he
resolve
instead
on
despatch
he
to


Monte
Alloro
with
a
letter
to
the
old
Duke
.
as
the
way
to
Geneva
lie
in


the
opposite
direction
this
would
at
least
give
the
fugitive
a
three


day
'
lead
;
and
they
have
little
cause
to
fear
pursuit
from
any
other


quarter
.
the
convent
indeed
might
raise
a
hue
and
cry
;
but
the
nun
of


Santa
Chiara
have
lately
give
the
devout
so
much
cause
for
scandal
that


the
abbess
would
probably
be
dispose
to
hush
up
any
fresh
delinquency
.


the
time
too
be
well
-
choose
;
for
the
sister
have
prevail
on
the


Reverend
Mother
to
celebrate
the
saint
's
day
by
a
mask
ball
,
and
the


whole
convent
be
engross
in
the
invention
of
whimsical
disguise
.
the


nun
indeed
be
not
to
take
part
in
the
ball
;
but
a
number
of
they
be


to
appear
in
an
allegorical
entertainment
with
which
the
evening
be
to


open
.
the
new
Papal
Nuncio
,
who
be
lately
arrive
in
Venice
,
have


promise
to
be
present
;
and
as
he
be
know
to
be
a
man
of
pleasure


there
be
scarce
a
sister
in
the
convent
but
have
an
eye
to
his
conquest
.


these
circumstance
give
to
Fulvia
's
plan
the
shelter
of
indifference
;


for
in
the
delightful
effort
of
surpass
the
other
nun
even
Mary
of


the
Crucifix
lose
interest
in
her
friend
's
affair
.




Odo
,
to
preserve
the
secrecy
of
his
design
,
have
be
oblige
to
keep
up


a
pretence
of
his
former
habit
,
show
himself
abroad
with


Coeur

Volant
and
Castelrovinato

frequent

this

,

lately
return
to
the
Brenta
,
have


announce
her
intention
of
come
to
Venice
for
the

at
Santa

and
Coeur

the


entertainment

at
which

should
outshine
all

the
evening
come
at
last
,
and
Odo
find
himself
enter
the
gate
of


Santa
Chiara
with
a
throng
of
merry

maker
.
the
convent
be
note
for


its
splendid
hospitality
,
and
unwonted
preparation
have
be
make
to


honour
the
saint
.
the
brightly

the
square


of
Santa

be
deck
with
a
colonnade
of
pasteboard
and
stiffen


linen
cunningly
paint
,
and
a
classical
portico
mask
the
entrance


gate
.
a
flourish
of
trumpet
and
hautboy
,
and
the
firing
of
miniature


cannon
,
greet
the
arrival
of
the
guest
,
who
be
escort
to
the


parlour
,
which
be
hang
with
tapestry
and
glow
with
light
like
a


Lady
Chapel
.
here
they
be
receive
by
the
abbess
,
who
,
on
the
arrival


of
the
Nuncio
,
lead
the
way
to
the
garden
,
where
a
stage
have
be


erect
.




the
nun
who
be
not
to
take
part
in
the
play
have
be
seat
directly


under
the
stage
,
divide
from
the
rest
of
the
company
by
a
low
screen
of


foliage
.
range
beneath
the
footlight
,
which
shine
on
their
bare


shoulder
and
white
gown
,
and
on
the
gauze
veil
replace
their


monastic
coif
,
they
seem
a
choir
of
pagan
virgin
group
in
the


proscenium
of
an
antique
theatre
.
everything
indeed
combine
to
produce


the
impression
of
some
classic
festival
:
the
setting
of
motionless


foliage
,
the
mild
autumnal
sky
in
which
the
star
hang
near
and
vivid
,


and
the
foreground
throng
with
a
motley
company
light
by
the
shifting


brightness
of
torch
.




as
Odo
,
in
mask
and
travesty
,
stand
observe
the
fantastically
-
dress


audience
,
the
pasteboard
theatre
adorn
with
statuary
,
and
the
nun


flit
across
the
stage
,
his
imagination
,
string
to
the
high
pitch


by
his
own
impending
venture
,
be
thrill
by
the
contrast
between
the


outward
appearance
of
the
scene
and
its
underlying
reality
.
from
where


he
stand
he
look
directly
at
the
abbess
,
who
be
seat
with
the


Nuncio
and
his
suite
under
the
tall
crucifix
in
the
centre
of
the


garden
.
as
if
to
emphasise
the
irony
of
the
situation
,
the
torch
fix


behind
this
noble
group
cast
an
enlarged
shadow
of
the
cross
over
the


abbess
's
white
gown
and
the
splendid
robe
of
her
companion
,
who
,


though
they
wear
the
mask
,
have
not
lay
aside
their
clerical
dress
.
to


Odo
the
juxtaposition
have
the
effect
of
some
supernatural
warning
,
the


shadow
of
the
divine
wrath
project
on
its
heedless
minister
;
an


impression
heighten
by
the
fact
that
,
just
opposite
the
cross
,
a


lively
figure
of
Pan
,
surmount
the
pediment
of
the
theatre
,
seem
to


fle
defiance
at
the
Galilean
intruder
.




the
nun
,
like
the
rest
of
the
company
,
be
mask
;
and
it
have
be


agree
between
Odo
and
Fulvia
that
the
latter
should
wear
a
wreath
of


myrtle
above
her
veil
.
as
almost
all
her
companion
have
choose


brightly
-
colour
flower
this
dark
green
chaplet
be
easily


distinguish
among
the
cluster
head
beneath
the
stage
,
and
Odo
have


no
doubt
of
be
able
to
rejoin
Fulvia
in
the
moment
of
dispersal
that


should
follow
the
conclusion
of
the
play
.
he
know
that
the
sister
be


to
precede
their
guest
and
be
lock
behind
the
grate
before
the
ball


begin
;
but
as
they
pass
through
the
garden
and
cloister
the
barrier


between
nun
and
visitor
would
probably
not
be
too
strictly
maintain
.


as
he
have
foresee
,
the
company
,
attract
by
the
graceful
procession
,


press
forward
regardless
of
the
assistant
mistress
'
protest
,
and


the
shadowy
arcade
be
full
of
laughter
and
whisper
snatch
of
talk


as
the
white
flock
be
drive
back
to
its
fold
.




Odo
have
withdraw
to
the
dark
angle
of
the
cloister
,
close
to
a
door


lead
to
the
pharmacy
.
it
be
here
that
Fulvia
have
tell
he
to
wait
;


and
though
he
have
lose
sight
of
she
when
the
audience
rise
,
he
stand


confidently
watch
for
the
reappearance
of
the
myrtle
-
wreath
.


presently
he
see
it
close
at
hand
;
and
just
then
the
line
of
sister


flow
toward
he
,
drive
forward
by
a
group
of
lively
masquerader
,


among
whom
he
seem
to
recognise
Coeur
-
Volant
's
voice
and
figure
.


nothing
could
have
be
more
opportune
,
for
the
pressure
sweep
the


wearer
of
the
myrtle
-
wreath
almost
into
his
arm
;
and
as
the
intruder


be
disperse
and
the
nun
laughingly
reform
their
line
,
her
hand


linger
in
his
and
he
feel
himself
draw
toward
the
door
.




it
yield
to
her
touch
and
Odo
follow
she
down
a
dark
passageway
to


the
empty
room
where
row
of
old
faenza
jar
and
quaintly
-
shape
flagon


glimmer
in
the
dusk
.
beyond
the
pharmacy
be
another
door
,
the
key
of


which
hang
on
the
wall
with
the
portress
's
hood
and
cloak
.
without
a


word
the
girl
wrap
herself
in
the
cloak
and
,
fit
the
key
to
the


lock
,
softly
open
the
door
.
all
this
be
do
with
a
rapidity
and


assurance
for
which
Odo
be
unprepared
;
but
,
reflect
that
Fulvia
's


whole
future
hang
on
the
promptness
with
which
each
detail
of
her
plan


be
execute
,
he
conclude
that
her
natural
force
of
character
enable


she
to
assume
an
ease
she
could
hardly
feel
.

door
open
on
the
kitchen

garden
,
and
brush
the
lavender

hedge


with
her
fly
skirt
she
speed
on
ahead
of
Odo
to
the
postern
which
the


nun
be
accustom
to
use
for
their
nocturnal
escapade
.
only
the


thickness
of
an
oaken
gate
stand
between
Fulvia
and
the
outer
world
.
to


her
the
opening
of
the
gate
mean
the
first
step
toward
freedom
,
but
to


odo
the
passing
from
their
enchanted
week
of
fellowship
to
the
inner


loneliness
of
his
former
life
.
he
hang
back
silent
while
she
draw
the


bolt
.




a
moment
later
they
have
cross
the
threshold
and
his
gondola
be


slip
toward

out
of
the

Fulvia

on

the
warm

their
daily

have
subdue

in


the
sense
of
her
nearness
he
lose
sight
of
the
condition
which
have


bring
they

out
on

with
the
turn
of
the
boat
and
their

under

release

"




as
she
speak
she
put
out
her
head
and
give
a
whisper
order
to
the


gondolier
;

at
the
word
the
boat
swing
round
and
head
for
the
city

in
the
violent
reaction
which
this
strange
encounter
produce
,
Odo
be


for
the
moment
incapable
of
take
any
clear
note
of
his
surrounding
.


Uncertain
if
he
be
not
once
more
the
victim
of
some
such
mischance
as


seem
to
attend
all
his
effort

succour
Fulvia

he
sit
in
silent


apprehension

the
gondola
shoot
across
the
Grand
Canal
and
enter
the


labyrinth
of
water

way
behind
San
Moise

Sister
Mary
take
his
silence


philosophically
.




"
you
dare
not
speak
to
I
,
for
fear
of
betray
yourself
,
"
she
say
,


"
and
I
scarce
wonder
at
your
distrust
;
for
your
plan
be
so
well
lay


that
I
have
no
notion
of
what
be
on
foot
,

must
have
remain
in


ignorance
if
Veronica
have
not

put
in
Sister
Martha
's
charge
.
but


you
will
both
live
to
thank
I
,
and
I
hope
,
"
she
add
,
laugh
,
"
to


own
that
you
would
have
do
well

take
I
into
your

the
first

"




as
she

the
gondola

at
the
head
of
a
narrow
passage
which


lose
itself
in
the
blackness
of
the
overhang
house
.
Sister
Mary


spring
out
and
draw
Odo
after
she
.
a
few
yard
down
the
alley

enter
a
plain
low

withdraw
behind
its


neighbour

by
Odo

grope
her
way
up
a
dark
flight
of

knock
at
a
door
on
the
upper

movement

by


the
slipping

bolt

aged
woman
look
out
.
she
draw


back
with
an
exclamation
of
welcome
,

Sister
Mary
,
seize
Odo
by
the


shoulder
,
push
he
across
the
threshold
of
a
small
dimly
-
light
kitchen
.




Fulvia
,
in
her
nun
's
habit
,
cower
in
the
dark
corner
;
but
at
sight


of
Odo
she
spring
up
,
and
run
toward
he
with
a
happy
cry
.






3.6
.




an
hour
later
the
two
be
well
on
their
way
toward
Mestre
,
where
a


travel
-
chaise
await
they
.
Odo
,
having
learn
that
Andreoni
be


settle
in
Padua
,
have
ask
he
to
receive
Fulvia
in
his
house
till
the


next
night
-
fall
;
and
the
bookseller
,
whom
he
have
take
into
his


confidence
,
be
eager
to
welcome
the
daughter
of
the
revered
Vivaldi
.




the
extreme
of
hope
and
apprehension
have
leave
Fulvia
too
exhausted
for


many
word
,
and
Odo
,
after
she
have
confirm
every
particular
of
Sister


Mary
's
story
,
refrain
from
question
she
far
.
thank
to
she


friend
's
resource
she
have
be
able
to
exchange
her
nun
's
dress
for
the


plain
gown
and
travelling
-
cloak
of
a
young
woman
of
the
middle
class
;


and
this
dress
painfully
recall
to
Odo
the
day
when
he
have
find
she


stand
beside
the
break
-
down
chaise
on
the
road
to
Vercelli
.




the
recollection
be
not
calculate
to
put
he
at
his
ease
;
and
indeed


it
be
only
now
that
he
begin
to
feel
the
peculiar
constraint
of
his


position
.
to
Andreoni
his
explanation
of
Fulvia
's
flight
have
seem


natural
enough
;
but
on
the
subsequent
stage
of
their
journey
she
must


pass
for
his
mistress
or
his
wife
,
and
he
hardly
know
in
what
spirit
she


would
take
the
misapprehension
that
must
inevitably
arise
.




at
Mestre
their
carriage
wait
,
and
they
drive
rapidly
toward
Padua


through
the
wane
night
.
Andreoni
,
in
his
concern
for
Fulvia
's
safety
,


have
prepare
for
her
reception
a
little
farm
-
house
of
his
wife
's
,
in
a


vineyard
beyond
the
town
;
and
here
at
daybreak
it
be
almost
a
relief
to


odo
to
commit
his
charge
to
the
Signora
Andreoni
's
care
.




the
day
be
spend
indoor
,
and
andreoni
having
think
it
more
prudent


to
bring
no
servant
from
Padua
,
his
wife
prepare
the
meal
for
their


guest
and
the
bookseller
draw
a
jar
of
his
own
wine
from
the
cellar
.


Fulvia
keep
to
herself
during
the
day
;
but
at
dusk
she
surprise
Odo
by


enter
the
room
with
a
trayful
of
plate
and
glass
,
and
help


their
hostess
to
set
out
the
supper
-
table
.
the
few
hour
of
rest
have


restore
to
she
not
only
the
serenity
of
the
convent
,
but
a
lightness
of


step
and
glance
that
Odo
have
not
see
in
she
since
the
early
day
of


their
friendship
.
he
marvel
to
see
how
the
first
breath
of
freedom


have
set
her
blood
in
motion
and
fan
her
languid
eye
;
but
he
could
not


suppress
the
accompanying
thought
that
his
own
presence
have
fail
to


work
such
miracle
.




they
have
plan
to
ride
that
night
to
a
little
village
in
the
hill


beyond
Vicenza
,
where
Fulvia
's
foster
-
mother
,
a
peasant
of
the


Vicentine
,
live
with
her
son
,
who
be
a
vine
-
dresser
;
and
supper
be


hardly
over
when
they
be
tell
that
their
horse
wait
.
their
kind


host
dared
not
urge
they
to
linger
;
and
after
a
hurried
farewell
they


ride
forth
into
the
fresh
darkness
of
the
September
night
.




the
new
moon
be
down
and
they
have
to
thread
their
way
slowly
through


the
stony
lane
between
the
vineyard
.
at
length
they
gain
the
open


country
,
and
grow
more
accustomed
to
the
darkness
put
their
horse
to


a
trot
.
the
change
of
pace
,
and
the
exhilaration
of
traverse
an


unknown
country
in
the
hush
and
mystery
of
night
,
combine
to
free
their


spirit
,
and
Odo
begin
to
be
aware
that
the
barrier
between
they
be


lift
.
to
the
charm
of
their
intercourse
at
Santa
Chiara
be
add
that


close
sympathy
produce
by
the
sense
of
isolation
.
they
be
enclose


in
their
common
risk
as
in
some
secret
meeting
-
place
where
no


consciousness
of
the
outer
world
intrude
;
and
though
their
talk
keep


the
safe
level
of
their
immediate
concern
he
feel
the
change
in
every


inflection
of
Fulvia
's
voice
and
in
the
subtler
emphasis
of
she


silence
.




the
way
be
long
,
and
he
have
fear
that
she
would
be
tax
beyond
she


strength
;
but
the
mile
seem
to
fly
beneath
their
horse
'
foot
,
and


they
could
scarcely
believe
that
the
dark
hill
which
rise
ahead
of
they


against
a
whiten
sky
mark
the
limit
of
their
journey
.




with
some
difficulty
they
find
their
way
to
the
vine
-
dresser
's
house
,
a


mere
hut
in
a
remote
fold
of
the
hill
.
from
motive
of
prudence
they


have
not
warn
the
nurse
of
their
come
;
but
they
find
the
old
woman


already
at
work
in
her
melon
-
patch
and
learn
from
she
that
her
son
have


go
down
to
his
day
's
labour
in
the
valley
.
she
receive
Fulvia
with
a


tender
wonder
,
as
at
some
supernatural
presence
descend
into
she


life
,
too
much
awed
,
till
the
first
embrace
be
over
,
to
risk
any


conjecture
as
to
Odo
's
presence
.
but
with
the
return
sense
of


familiarity
--
the
fancy
recovery
of
the
nursele
's
feature
in
the


girl
's
definite
outline
--
come
the
inevitable
reaction
of
curiosity
,
and


the
fugitive
feel
themselves
couple
in
the
old
woman
's
meaning
smile
.


to
Odo
's
surprise
Fulvia
receive
these
innuendo
with
baffle


composure
,
parry
the
question
she
seem
to
answer
,
and
finally


take
refuge
in
a
plea
for
rest
.
but
the
accord
of
the
previous
night


be
break
;
and
when
the
traveller
set
out
again
,
start
a
little


before
sunset
to
avoid
the
vine
-
dresser
's
return
,
the
constraint
of
the


day
begin
to
weigh
upon
they
.
in
Fulvia
's
case
physical
weariness


perhaps
have
a
share
in
the
change
;
but
whatever
the
cause
,
its
effect


be
to
make
this
stage
of
the
journey
strangely
tedious
to
both
.




their
way
lie
through
the
country
north
of
Vicenza
,
whence
they
hope
by


dawn
to
gain
Peschiera
on
the
lake
of
Garda
,
and
hire
a
chaise
which


should
take
they
across
the
border
.
for
the
first
hour
or
two
they
have


the
new
moon
to
light
they
;
but
as
it
set
the
sky
cloud
and
drop
of


rain
begin
to
fall
.
Fulvia
have
hitherto
show
a
gay
indifference
to
the


discomfort
of
the
journey
;
but
she
presently
begin
to
complain
of
the


cold
and
to
question
Odo
anxiously
as
to
the
length
of
the
way
.
the


hilliness
of
the
country
force
they
to
travel
slowly
,
and
it
seem
to


odo
that
hour
have
elapse
before
they
see
light
in
the
valley
below


they
.
their
plan
have
be
to
avoid
the
town
on
their
way
,
and
Fulvia
,


the
night
before
,
have
content
herself
with
a
half
-
hour
's
rest
by
the


roadside
;
but
a
heavy
rain
be
now
fall
,
and
she
at
once
assent
to


Odo
's
tentative
proposal
that
they
should
take
shelter
till
the
storm


be
over
.




they
dismount
at
an
inn
on
the
outskirt
of
the
village
.
the
sleepy


landlord
stare
as
he
unbar
the
door
and
lead
they
into
the
kitchen
;


but
he
offer
no
comment
beyond
remark
that
it
be
a
good
night
to


be
under
cover
.




Fulvia
sink
down
on
the
wooden
settle
near
the
chimney
,
where
a
fire
have


be
hastily
kindle
.
she
take
no
notice
of
Odo
when
he
remove
the


dripping
cloak
from
her
shoulder
,
but
sat
gaze
before
she
in
a
kind


of
apathy
.




"
I
can
not
eat
,
"
she
say
,
as
Odo
press
she
to
take
her
place
at
the


table
.




the
innkeeper
turn
to
he
with
a
confidential
nod
.
"
your
lady
look


fairly
beat
,
"
he
say
.
"
I
've
a
notion
that
one
of
my
good
bed
would


be
more
to
her
taste
than
the
good
supper
in
the
land
.
shall
I
have
a


room
make
ready
for
your
excellency
?
"




"
no
,
no
,
"
say
Fulvia
,
start
up
.
"
we
must
set
out
again
as
soon
as
we


have
sup
.
"




she
approach
the
table
and
hastily
empty
the
glass
of
country
wine


that
Odo
have
pour
out
for
she
.




the
innkeeper
seem
a
simple
unsuspicious
fellow
,
but
at
this
he
put


down
the
plate
of
cheese
he
be
carry
and
look
at
she
curiously
.




"
start
out
again
at
this
hour
of
the
night
?
"
he
exclaim
.
"
by
the


saint
,
your
excellency
must
be
run
a
race
with
the
sun

or
do

they
that
their

they
ride


out

grey
morning

the

Odo
be
remind
of
the


day
at
Donnaz
when
he
have
ride
up
the
mountain
in
the
same
early


light
.
never
since
then
have
he
feel
,
as
he
do
now
,
the
boy
's
easy


kinship
with
the
unexpected
,
the
sense
that
no
encounter
could
be
too


wonderful
to
fit
in
with
the
mere
wonder
of
living
.




to
avoid
the
road
to
Peschiera
they
have
resolve
to
cross
the
Monte


Baldo
by
a
mule
-
track
which
should
bring
they
out
at
one
of
the
village


on
the
eastern
shore
of
Garda
;
and
the
search
for
this
path
lead
they
up


through
steep
rain
-
scented
wood
where
they
have
to
part
the
wet
bough


as
they
pass
.
from
time
to
time
they
regain
the
highway
and
ride


abreast
,
almost
silent
at
first
with
the
weight
of
their
new
nearness
,


and
then
break
into
talk
that
be
the
mere
overflow
of
what
they
be


think
.
there
be
in
truth
more
to
be
feel
between
they
than
to
be


say
;
since
,
as
each
be
aware
,
the
new
light
that
suffuse
the
present


leave
the
future
as
obscure
as
before
.
but
what
matter
,
when
the
hour


be
theirs
?
the
narrow
kingdom
of
today
be
well
worth
rule
over
than


the
wide
past
or
future
;
but
not
more
than
once
do
a
man
hold
its


fugitive
sceptre
.
the
past
,
however
,
be
theirs
also
:
a
past
so


transform
that
he
must
revisit
it
with
she
,
joyously
confront
she


new
self
with
the
image
of
she
that
meet
they
at
each
turn
.
then
he
have


himself
to
trace
in
her
memory
,
his
transfigured
likeness
to
linger


over
in
the
Narcissus
-
mirror
of
her
faith
in
he
.
this
interchange
of


recollection
serve
they
as
well
as
any
outspoken
expression
of


feeling
,
and
the
most
commonplace
allusion
be
charge
with
happy


meaning
.




Arabia
Petraea
have
be
an
Eden
to
such
traveller
;
how
much
more
the


happy
slope
they
be
now
descend
!
all
the
afternoon
their
path


wound
down
the
western
incline
of
Monte
Baldo
,
first
under
huge
olive
,


then
through
thicket
of
laurel
and
acacia
,
to
emerge
on
a
low
level


of
lemon
and
orange
grove
,
with
the
blue
lake
show
through
a
diaper


of
golden
-
fruit
bough
.
Fulvia
,
to
whom
this
clear
-
cut
southern


foliage
be
as
new
as
the
pure
intensity
of
light
that
bathe
it
,
seem


to
herself
to
be
move
through
the
landscape
of
a
dream
.
it
be
as


though
nature
have
be
remodelle
,
transform
almost
,
under
the
touch


of
their
love
:
as
though
they
have
find
their
way
to
the
Hesperian


glade
in
which
poet
and
painter
place
the
legendary
lover
of


antiquity
.




such
feeling
be
intensify
by
the
strangeness
of
the
situation
.
in


Italy
the
young
girl
of
the
middle
class
,
though
seemingly
allow
a


great
freedom
of
intercourse
than
the
daughter
of
nobleman
,
be
in


reality
as
strictly
guard
.
though
,
like
Fulvia
,
they
might
converse


with
the
elderly
merchant
or
scholar
frequent
the
family
table
,


they
be
never
alone
in
the
company
of
man
,
and
the
high
standard
of


conduct
prevail
in
the
bourgeoisie
forbid
all
thought
of
clandestine


intercourse
.
this
be
especially
true
of
the
family
of
man
of
letter
,


where
the
liberal
education
of
the
young
girl
,
and
their
habit
of


associate
as
equal
with
man
of
serious
and
cultivate
mind
,
give


they
a
self
-
possession
disconcerting
to
the
young
blood
accustomed
to


conquer
with
a
glance
.
these
girl
as
a
rule
,
be
marry
early
to
man


of
their
own
standing
,
and
though
the
cicisbeo
be
not
unknown
after


marriage
he
be
not
an
authorised
member
of
the
household
.
Fulvia
,


indeed
,
belong
to
the
class
most
inaccessible
to
man
of
Odo
's
rank
:


the
only
class
in
Italy
in
which
the
wife
's
fidelity
be
as
much


esteemed
as
the
innocence
of
the
girl
.
such
principle
have
long
be


ridicule
by
person
of
quality
and
satirise
by
poet
and
playwright
.


from
aristophane
to
Beaumarchais
the
cheat
husband
and
the
outwit


guardian
have
be
the
figure
on
which
the
dramatist
rely
for
his


comic
effect
.
even
the
miser
trick
out
of
his
saving
be
a
shade


less
ridiculous
,
less
grotesquely
deserve
of
his
fate
,
than
the


husband
defraud
of
his
wife
's
affection
.
the
plausible
adulteress
and


the
adroit
seducer
have
a
recognise
claim
on
the
sympathy
of
the
public
.


but
the
inevitable
reaction
be
at
hand
;
and
the
new
teacher
to
whom


Odo
's
contemporary
be
begin
to
listen
have
throw
a
strangely


poetic
light
over
the
dull
figure
of
the
domestic
virtue
.
faithfulness


to
the
family
sanctity
,
reverence
for
the
marriage
tie
,
courage
to


sacrifice
the
lofty
passion
to
the
most
plodding
duty
:
these
be


quality
to
touch
the
fancy
of
a
generation
sate
with
derision
.
if


love
as
a
sentiment
be
the
discovery
of
the
medieval
poet
,
love
as
a


moral
emotion
might
be
call
that
of
the
eighteenth
-
century


philosopher
,
who
,
for
all
their
celebration
of
free
union
and
fatal


passion
,
be
really
on
the
side
of
the
angel
,
be
fight
the


battle
of
the
spiritual
against
the
sensual
,
of
conscience
against


appetite
.




the
imperceptible
action
of
these
new
influence
form
the
real
barrier


between
Odo
and
Fulvia
.
the
girl
stand
for
the
embodiment
of
the


purify
emotion
that
be
to
renew
the
world
.
her
candour
,
she


unapproachableness
,
her
simple
trust
in
he
,
be
a
part
of
the
magic


light
which
the
new
idealism
have
shed
over
the
old
social
structure
.
his


be
,
in
short
,
a
love
large
enough
to
include
other
emotion
:
a
widen


rather
than
a
contraction
of
the
emotional
range
.
youth
and
propinquity


have
before
now
break
down
strong
defence
;
but
Fulvia
's
situation


be
an
unspoken
appeal
to
her
lover
's
forbearance
.
the
sense
that
she


safety
depend
on
he
keep
his
sentimental
impulse
in
check
and
make


the
happiness
of
the
moment
seem
,
in
its
exquisite
unreality
,
a
mere


dreamlike
interlude
between
the
fact
of
life
.




toward
sunset
they
rest
in
an
olive
-
orchard
,
tether
their
horse
to


the
low
bough
.
overhead
,
through
the
thin
foliage
of
tarnished
silver
,


the
sky
,
as
the
moon
suffuse
it
,
melt
from
steel
blue
to
a
clear


silver
.
a
peasant
-
woman
whose
hut
stand
close
by
bring
they
a
goat
's


cheese
on
a
vine
-
leaf
and
a
jug
of
spring
-
water
;
and
as
they
sup
,
a


little
goat
-
herd
,
drive
his
flock
down
the
hill
,
pause
to
watch
they


with
furtive
woodland
eye
.




Odo
,
question
he
,
learn
that
at
the
village
on
the
shore
below


they
could
obtain
a
boat
to
carry
they
across
the
lake
.
Fulvia
,
for
lack


of
a
passport
,
dared
not
set
foot
on
austrian
soil
;
but
the
Swiss


authority
be
less
exacting
and
Odo
have
hope
of
cross
the
border


without
difficulty
.
they
set
out
again
presently
,
descend
through
the


grey
dusk
of
the
olive
till
the
path
become
too
steep
for
riding
;
then


Odo
lift
Fulvia
from
the
saddle
and
lead
the
two
horse
after
she
.
here


and
there
,
between
the
tree
,
they
catch
a
momentary
glimpse
of
light


on
the
shore
and
the
pale
gleam
of
the
lake
enclose
in
black
foliage
.


from
the
village
below
come
snatch
of
song
and
the
shrill
wail
of
a


pipe
;
and
as
the
night
deepen
they
see
,
far
out
on
the
water
,
the
wild


flare
of
the
fish
-
spearer
'
torch
,
like
comet
in
an
inverted
sky
.




with
nightfall
the
spirit
of
both
have
sink
.
Fulvia
walk
ahead
in


silence
and
Odo
read
a
mute
apprehension
in
her
droop
outline
.
every


step
bring
they
near
to
the
point
they
both
fear
to
face
,
and


though
each
know
what
lie
in
the
other
's
thought
neither
dare
break


the
silence
.
Odo
's
mind
turn
anxiously
to
the
incident
of
the


morning
,
to
the
finding
of
the
ducal
coat
-
of
-
arm
,
and
to
all
the


possibility
it
suggest
.
what
errand
save
one
could
have
carry
an


envoy
from
Pianura
to
that
remote
hamlet
among
the
hill
?
he
could


scarcely
doubt
that
it
be
in
pursuit
of
himself
that
the
ducal


messenger
travel
;
but
with
what
object
be
the
journey
undertake
?


be
he
to
be
recall
in
obedience
to
some
new
whim
of
the
Duke
's
?
or


have
some
unforeseen
change
--
he
dared
not
let
his
thought
define


it
--
suddenly
make
his
presence
needful
in
Pianura
?
it
be
more
probable


that
the
possibility
of
his
flight
with
Fulvia
have
be
suggest
to
the


duke
by
the
ecclesiastical
authority
,
and
that
the
same
hand
which
have


part
they
before
be
again
secretly
at
work
.
in
any
case
,
it
be
Odo
's


first
business
to
see
his
companion
safely
across
the
border
;
and
in


that
endeavour
he
have
now
little
fear
of
be
thwart
.
if
the
Duke
's


messenger
await
they
at
Peschiera
he
wait
in
vain
;
and
though
their


flight
across
the
lake
might
be
know
before
dawn
it
would
then
be
no


easy
matter
to
overtake
they
.




in
an
hour
's
time
,
as
Odo
have
hope
,
they
be
put
off
from
the


shore
in
a
blunt
-
nosed
fishing
-
boat
which
be
the
light
craft
the


village
could
provide
.
the
lake
be
stark
calm
,
and
the
two
boatman
,


silhouette
against
the
moonlight
,
drive
the
boat
forward
with
even


vigorous
stroke
.
Fulvia
,
shiver
in
the
autumnal
chill
,
have
draw
she


hood
close
about
she
and
sit
silent
,
her
face
in
shade
.
measure
by


their
secret
apprehension
the
boat
's
progress
seem
at
first


indescribably
slow
;
but
gradually
the
sound
from
the
shore
grow


fainter
,
and
the
fugitive
feel
themselves
alone
in
a
world
enclose
by


the
moonlit
circle
of
the
water
.




as
they
advance
this
sense
of
isolation
and
security
grow
deep
and


more
impressive
.
the
motionless
surface
of
the
lake
be
enclose
in
a


wall
of
mountain
which
the
moonlight
seem
to
vein
with
marble
.

Odo
welcome

he
see
at
once
that
it

be


quick
work
to
tack
to
the
other

on

"

the
man

to
the

against
the
sky
hang
a
little
black
cloud

visibly
now

with
every

its
black


menace
dilate
to
the
zenith

fall
suddenly
out

hang
back

fury

to

"

think
Odo
.
he
reach
for
Fulvia
's
hand
and
find


it
in
the
darkness
.
the
rain
be
drive
against
they
now
and
he
draw


her
close
and
wrap
his
cloak
about
she
.
she
lie
still
,
without
a


tremor
,
as
though
in
that
shelter
no
fear
could
reach
she
.
the
night


roar
about
they
and
the
water
seem
to
divide
beneath
their
keel
.


through
the
tumult
Odo
shout
to
the
boatman
to
try
to
make
some


harbour
north
of
Peschiera
.
they
shout
back
that
they
must
go
where


the
wind
will
and
bless
the
saint
if
they
make
any
harbour
at
all
;


and
Odo
see
that
Peschiera
be
their
destiny
.




it
be
past
midnight
when
they
set
foot
on
shore
.
the
rain
still
fall
in


torrent
and
they
could
hardly
grope
their
way
up
the
step
of
the


landing
-
stage
.
Odo
's
first
concern
be
to
avoid
the
inn
;
but
the


boatman
,
exhaust
by
their
effort
and
impatient
to
be
under
shelter
,


could
not
be
bribe
to
seek
out
at
that
hour
another
lodging
for
the


traveller
.
Odo
dared
not
expose
Fulvia
long
to
the
storm
,
and


reluctantly
they
turn
toward
the
inn
,
trust
that
at
that
hour
their


come
would
attract
little
notice
.




a

in
the
courtyard
,

somewhat
to
Odo
's


surprise

landlord
be
still
afoot

he
lead
they
into
the
public


parlour
,
which
be
alight
,
with
a
good
fire
on
the
hearth

a
gentleman


in

dress
sit
near
this
fire
,
his
back
to
the
door
,
read
by


a
shaded
candle
.
he
rise
as
the
traveller
enter
,
and
Odo
recognise


the
abate
de

.




the
latter
advance
with
a
smile
in
which
pleasure
be
more
visible
than


surprise
.
he
bow
slightly
to
Fulvia
,
who
have
shrink
back
into
the


shadow
of
the
doorway
;
then
he
turn
to
Odo
and
say
:

Odo
hear
a
slight
movement

he
turn
and
see
that

its

flight

his

on
such
a
possibility

do
little

its
realisation

fancy
himself
master
of
his
fate

that
now
he
be
again
in

his
first
clear
thought
be
that
nothing

inconscient
irony
the

,

many

those
who

Odo
must
set
himself
to
redeem
the

see
his
way
straight

in

hour
of
insight


his
heart

preservation
make
one

my

he
pause
a

out

the

the
contagion
have
spread
to
the
poor
quarter

the
new
Duke
,
who
be
about
to
enter
his
capital
in
state
,
be


extraordinarily
popular
with
all
class
.
his
popularity
,
as
yet
,
be


mainly
due
to
a
general
detestation
of
the
rule
he
have
replace
;
but


such
a
sentiment
give
to
a
new
sovereign
an
impetus
which
,
if
he
know


how
to
use
it
,
will
carry
he
a
long
way
toward
success
;
and
among
those


in
the
Duke
's
confidence
it
be
rumour
that
he
be
qualified
not
only


to
profit
by
the
expectation
he
have
raise
but
to
fulfil
they
.
the
last


month
of
the
late
Duke
's
life
have
plunge
the
duchy
into
such
political


and
financial
disorder
that
all
party
be
agree
in
welcome
a


change
.
even
those
that
have
most
to
lose
by
the
accession
of
the
new


sovereign
,
or
most
to
fear
from
the
policy
he
be
know
to
favour
,


prefer
the
possibility
of
new
evil
to
a
continuance
of
present


condition
.
the
expert
angler
in
troubled
water
may
find
water
too


troubled
for
his
sport
;
and
under
a
government
where
power
be
pass


from
hand
to
hand
like
the
handkerchief
in
a
child
's
game
,
the
most


adroit
time
-
server
may
find
himself
grasp
the
empty
air
.




it
would
indeed
have
be
difficult
to
say
who
have
rule
during
the
year


precede
the
Duke
's
death
.
prime
minister
have
succeed
each
other


like
the
clown
in
a
harlequinade
.
just
as
the
Church
seem
to
have


gain
the
upper
hand
some
mysterious
revulsion
of
feeling
would
fling


the
Duke
toward
Trescorre
and
the
liberal
;
and
when
these
have


attempt
,
by
some
trifling
concession
to
popular
feeling
,
to
restore


the
credit
of
the
government
,
their
sovereign
,
seize
by
religious


scruple
,
would
hastily
recall
the
clerical
party
.
so
the
administration


stagger
on
,
reel
from
one
policy
to
another
,
clutch
now
at
this


support
and
now
at
that
,
while
Austria
and
the
Holy
See
hang
on
its


step
,
await
the
inevitable
fall
.




a
cruel
winter
and
a
fresh
outbreak
of
the
silkworm
disease
have


aggravate
the
misery
of
the
people
,
while
the
mount
extravagance
of


the
Duchess
have
put
a
last
strain
on
the
exhausted
treasury
.
the


consequent
increase
of
the
salt
-
tax
rouse
such
popular
fury
that
Father


Ignazio
,
who
be
responsible
for
the
measure
,
be
dismiss
by
the


panic
-
stricken
Duke
,
and
Trescorre
,
as
usual
,
call
in
to
repair
his


rival
's
mistake
.
but
it
would
have
take
a
great
statesman
than


trescorre
to
reach
the
root
of
such
evil
;
and
the
new
minister


succeed
neither
in
pacify
the
people
nor
in
reassure
his


sovereign
.




meanwhile
the
Duke
be
sink
under
the
mysterious
disease
which
have


hang
upon
he
since
his
birth
.
it
be
hint
that
his
last
hour
be


darken
by
hallucination
,
and
the
pious
picture
he
as
haunt
by


profligate
vision
,
while
the
free
-
thinker
maintain
that
he
be
the


dupe
of
priestly
jugglery
.
toward
the
end
there
be
the
inevitable


rumour
of
acqua
tofana
,
and
the
populace
cry
out
that
the
Jesuits
be


at
work
again
.
it
seem
more
probable
,
however
,
that
his
Highness
,
who


have
assist
at
the
annual
festival
of
the
Madonna
del
Monte
,
and
have


mingle
on
foot
with
the
swarm
of
devotee
throng
thither
from
all


part
,
have
contract
a
pestilent
disorder
from
one
of
the
pilgrim
.


certain
it
be
that
death
come
in
a
dreadful
form
.
the
Duchess
,
alarm


for
the
health
of
Prince
Ferrante
,
flee
with
he
to
the
dower
-
house
by


the
Piana
;
and
the
strange
nature
of
his
Highness
's
distemper
cause


many
to
follow
her
example
.
even
the
Duke
's
servant
,
and
the
quack


that
live
on
his
bounty
,
be
say
to
have
abandon
the
death
-
chamber
;


and
an
english
traveller
pass
through
Pianura
boast
that
,
by
the


payment
of
a
small
fee
to
the
palace
porter
,
he
have
obtain
leave
to


enter
his
Highness
's
closet
and
peer
through
the
doorway
at
the
die


man
.
however
this
may
be
,
it
would
appear
that
the
Duke
's
confessor
--
a


monk
of
the
Barnabite
order
--
be
not
to
be
find
when
his
Highness


call
for
he
;
and
the
servant
send
forth
in
haste
to
fetch
a
priest


return
,
strangely
enough
,
with
the
abate
Crescenti
,
whose
suspect


orthodoxy
have
so
long
make
he
the
object
of
the
Duke
's
detestation
.
he


it
be
who
alone
witness
the
end
of
that
torment
life
,
and
know
upon


what
hope
or
fear
it
close
.




meanwhile
it
appear
that
the
Duchess
's
precaution
be
not
unfounded
;


for
Prince
Ferrante
presently
sicken
of
the
same
malady
which
have
cut


off
his
father
,
and
when
the
Regent
,
travel
post
-
haste
,
arrive
in


Pianura
,
he
have
barely
time
to
pass
from
the
Duke
's
obsequie
to
the


death
-
bed
of
the
heir
.




Etiquette
require
that
a
year
of
mourning
should
elapse
between
the


accession
of
the
new
sovereign
and
his
state
entry
into
his
capital
;
so


that
if
Duke
Odo
's
character
and
intention
be
still
matter
of


conjecture
to
his
subject
,
his
appearance
be
already
familiar
to
they
.


his
youth
,
his
good
look
,
his
open
mien
,
his
know
affability
of


manner
,
be
so
many
argument
in
his
favour
with
an
impressionable
and


impulsive
people
;
and
it
be
perhaps
natural
that
he
should
interpret
as


a
tribute
to
his
principle
the
sympathy
which
his
person
arouse
.




it
be
certain
that
he
fancy
himself
,
at
that
time
,
as
well
-
acquaint


with
his
subject
as
they
believe
themselves
to
be
with
he
;
and
the


understanding
suppose
to
exist
be
productive
of
equal
satisfaction
to


both
side
.
the
new
Duke
have
throw
himself
with
extraordinary
zeal
into


the
task
of
love
and
understand
his
people
.
it
have
be
his
refuge


from
a
hundred
doubt
and
uncertainty
,
the
one
clearly
-
define
object


in
an
obscure
and
troubled
fate
.
and
their
response
have
,
almost


immediately
,
turn
his
task
into
a
pleasure
.
it
be
so
easy
to
rule
if


one
's
subject
love
one
!
and
so
easy
to
be
love
if
only
one
love


enough
in
return
!
if
he
do
not
,
like
the
Pope
,
describe
himself
to
his


people
as
the
servant
of
the
servant
of
God
,
he
at
least
long
to
make


they
feel
that
this
new
gospel
of
service
be
the
base
on
which
all


sovereignty
must
henceforth
repose
.




it
be
not
that
his
first
year
of
power
have
be
without
moment
of


disillusionment
.
he
have
have
more
than
one
embitter
experience
of


intrigue
and
perfidy
,
more
than
one
glimpse
of
the
pitfall
beset


his
course
;
but
his
confidence
in
his
own
power
and
his
faith
in
his


people
remain
unshaken
,
and
with
two
such
belief
to
sustain
he
it


seem
as
though
no
difficulty
would
prove
insurmountable
.




such
at
least
be
the
mood
in
which
,
on
the
morning
of
his
entry
into


Pianura
,
he
prepare
to
face
his
subject
.
strangely
enough
,
the
state


entry
begin
at
Ponte
di
Po
,
the
very
spot
where
,
on
a
stormy
midnight


some
seven
year
early
,
the
new
Duke
have
land
,
a
fugitive
from
his


future
realm
.
here
,
accord
to
an
ancient
custom
,
the
sovereign


await
the
arrival
of
his
minister
and
court
;
and
then
,
take
seat
in


his
state
barge
,
proceed
by
water
to
Pianura
,
follow
by
an
escort
of


galley
.




a
great
tent
hang
with
tapestry
have
be
set
up
on
the
river
-
bank
;
and


here
Odo
await
the
approach
of
the
barge
.
as
it
touch
at
the


landing
-
stage
he
step
out
,
and
his
prime
minister
,
Count
Trescorre
,


advanced
toward
he
,
accompany
by
the
dignitary
of
the
court
.


Trescorre
have
age
in
the
intervene
year
.
his
delicate
feature
have


wither
like
a
woman
's
,
and
the
fine
irony
of
his
smile
have
take
an


edge
of
cruelty
.
his
face
suggest
a
worn
engraving
,
the
line
of
which


have
be
deepen
by
a
too
-
incisive
instrument
.




the
functionary
attend
he
be
,
with
few
exception
,
the
same
who


have
figure
in
a
like
capacity
at
the
late
sovereign
's
court
.
with
the


pass
of
the
year
they
have
grow
heavy
or
thin
,
more
ponderous


or
stiffer
in
their
movement
,
and
as
they
advance
,
in
their
splendid


but
unwieldy
court
dress
,
they
seem
to
Odo
like
superannuate


marionette
whose
spring
and
wire
have
rust
from
disuse
.




the

here
the

presently
the
heavy

move
slowly
up

.




in
the
clear

the
old
walled
city
,
with
its
dome
and


tower
,
rise
pleasantly
among
bud
orchard
and
field
.
close
at
hand


be
the
crenellation
of
Bracciaforte
's
keep
,
and
just
beyond
,
the


ornate
cupola
of
the
royal
chapel
,
symbolise
in
their
proximity
the


successive
ambition
of
the
ducal
race
;
while
the
round
-
arched
campanile


of
the
Cathedral
and
the
square
tower
of
the
mediaeval
town

hall
spring


up
side
by
side
,
mark
the
centre
of
the
free
city
which
the
Valseccas


have
subjugate
.
it
seem
to
the
new
Duke
,
who
be
give
to
such


reflection
,
that
he
could
read
his
race
's
history
in
that
break


skyline
;
but
he
be
soon
snatch
from
its
perusal
by
the
cheer
of
the


crowd
who
throng
the
river
-
bank
to
greet
his
approach
.




as
the
Bucentaur
touch
at
the
landing
-
stage
and
Odo
step
out
on
the


red
carpet
strew
with
flower
,
while
cannon
thunder
from
the
wall


and
the
bell
burst
into
renew
jubilation
,
he
feel
himself
for
the


first
time
face
to
face
with
his
people
.
the
very
ceremonial
which
in


other
case
keep
they
apart
be
now
a
means
of
close
communication
;
for


it
be
to
show
himself
to
they
that
he
be
make
a
public
entry
into


his
capital
,
and
it
be
to
see
he
that
the
city
have
pour
forth
she


shout
throng
.
the
shout
rise
and
widen
as
he
advance
,
envelop


he
in
a
mount
tide
of
welcome
,
in
which
cannon
,
bell
and


voice
--
the
decreed
and
the
spontaneous
acclamation
--
be


indistinguishably
merge
.
in
like
manner
,
approbation
of
his
person
be


mingle
with
a
simple
enjoyment
of
the
show
of
which
he
form
a
part
;


and
it
must
have
take
a
more
experienced
head
than
Odo
be
to
distinguish


between
the
two
current
of
enthusiasm
on
which
he
feel
himself
sweep


forward
.




the
pageant
be
indeed
brilliant
enough
to
justify
the
popular


transport
;
and
the
fact
that
the
new
Duke
form
a
worthy
centre
to
so


much
magnificence
be
not
lose
on
his
splendour

love
subject
.
the


late
sovereign
have
so
long
hold
himself
aloof
that
the

be


unaccustomed
to
such
show
,

,

of
respect
for
the
late
Duke
,
have
lodge
in
one


of
the
wing
of
the
great
building
;
but
tradition
demand
that
he


should
henceforth
inhabit
the
ducal
apartment
,
and
thither
,
at
the


close
of
the
day
's
ceremony
,
his
gentleman
have
conduct
he
.




Trescorre
have
ask
permission
to
wait
on
he
before
he
sleep
;
and
he


know
that
the
prime
minister
would
be
keep
late
by
his
conference
with


the
secret
police
,
whose
nightly
report
could
not
be
hand
in
till
the


festivity
be
over
.
meanwhile
Odo
be
in
no
mood
for
sleep
.
he
sit


alone
in
the
closet
,
still
hang
with
saint
'
image
and
jewel


reliquary
,
where
his
cousin
have
so
often
give
he
audience
,
and


whence
,
through
the
open
door
,
he
could
see
the
embroider
curtain
and


plume
baldachin
of
the
state
bed
which
be
presently
to
receive
he
.


all
day
his
heart
have
beat
with
high
ambition
;
but
now
a
weight
sank


upon
his
spirit
.
the
reaction
from
the
tumultuous
welcome
of
the
street


to
the
closely
-
guard
silence
of
the
palace
make
he
feel
how
unreal


be
the
fancy
union
between
himself
and
his
people
,
how
insuperable


the
distance
that
tradition
and
habit
have
place
between
they
.
in
the


narrow
closet
where
his
predecessor
have
take
refuge
from
the
detest


task
of
reigning
,
the
new
Duke
feel
the
same
moral
lassitude
steal
over


he
.
how
be
such
a
puny
will
as
his
to
contend
against
the
great
force


of
greed
and
prejudice
?
all
the
influence
array
against


he
--
tradition
,
superstition
,
the
lust
of
power
,
the
arrogance
of


race
--
seem
concentrated
in
the
atmosphere
of
that
silent
room
,
with


its
guard
threshold
,
its
pious
relic
,
and
lie
on
the
desk
in
the


embrasure
of
the
window
,
the
manuscript
litany
which
the
late
Duke
have


not
live
to
complete
.




oppress
by
his
surrounding
,
Odo
rise
and
enter
the
bed
-
chamber
.
a


lamp
burn
before
the
image
of
the
Madonna
at
the
head
of
the
bed
,
and


two
light
flambeaux
flank
the
picture
of
the
last
Judgment
on
the


opposite
wall
.
Odo
remember
the
look
of
terror
which
the
Duke
have


fix
on
the
picture
during
their
first
strange
conversation
.
a


pray
-
stool
stand
beneath
it
,
and
it
be
say
that
here
,
rather
than


before
the
Virgin
's
image
,
the
melancholy
prince
perform
his
private


devotion
.
the
horror
of
the
scene
be
depict
with
a
childish


minuteness
of
detail
,
as
though
the
painter
have
seek
to
produce
an


impression
of
moral
anguish
by
the
accumulation
of
physical
suffering
;


and
just
such
puerile
image
of
the
wrath
to
come
may
have
haunt
the


mysterious
recess
of
the
Duke
's
imagination
.
Crescenti
have
tell
Odo


how
the
die
man
's
thought
have
seem
to
centre
upon
this
dreadful


subject
,
and
how
again
and
again
,
amid
his
raving
,
he
have
cry
out


that
the
picture
must
be
burn
,
as
though
the
sight
of
it
be
become


intolerable
to
he
.




Odo
's
own
mind
,
across
which
the
event
and
emotion
of
the
day
still


throw
the
fantastic
shadow
of
an
expire
illumination
,
be
work
to


the
high
state
of
impressionability
.
he
see
in
a
flash
all
that
the


picture
must
have
symbolise
to
his
cousin
's
fancy
;
and
in
his
desire
to


reconstruct
that
die
vision
of
fleshly
retribution
,
he
step
close


to
the
diptych
,
rest
a
knee
on
the
stool
beneath
it
.
as
he
do
so
,


the
picture
suddenly
open
,
disclose
the
inner
panel
.
Odo
catch
up


one
of
the
flambeaux
,
and
in
its
light
,
as
on
a
sunlit
wave
,
there


step
forth
to
he
the
lose
Venus
of
Giorgione
.




he
know
the
picture
in
an
instant
.
there
be
no
mistaking
the
glow
of


the
limb
,
the
midsummer
languor
of
the
smile
,
the
magical
atmosphere
in


which
the
gold
of
sunlight
,
of
autumn
leave
,
of
amber
grape
,
seem


fuse
by
some
lost
alchemy
of
the
brush
.
as
he
gaze
,
the
scene
change
,


and
he
see
himself
in
a
darken
room
with
cabalistic
hanging
.
he
see


Heiligenstern
's
tall
figure
,
tower
in
supernatural
light
,
the
Duke


lean
eagerly
forward
,
the
Duchess
with
set
lip
and
troubled
eye
,


the
little
prince
bend
wonderingly
above
the
magic
crystal
...




a
step
in
the
antechamber
announce
Trescorre
's
approach
.
Odo
return


to
the
cabinet
and
the
minister
advance
with
a
low
bow
.
the
two
man
have


have
time
to
grow
accustomed
to
the
new
relation
in
which
they
stand
to


one
another
,
yet
there
be
moment
when
,
to
Odo
,
the
past
seem
to
lie


like
fall
leave
beneath
Trescorre
's
step
--
Donna
Laura
,
fond
and


foolish
in
her
weed
,
Gamba
,
Momola
,
and
the
pure
featherhead
Cerveno
,


die
at
nineteen
of
a
distemper
because
he
have
stand
in
the
other
's


way
.
the
impression
be
strong
on
he
now
--
but
it
be
only
momentary
.


Habit
reassert
itself
,
and
the
minister
efface
the
man
.
Odo
sign
to


trescorre
to
seat
himself
and
the
latter
silently
present
his
report
.




he
be
a
diligent
and
capable
administrator
,
and
however
mixed
might
be


the
motive
which
attach
he
to
his
sovereign
,
they
do
not
interfere


with
the
exact
performance
of
his
duty
.
Odo
know
this
and
be
grateful


for
it
.
he
know
that
Trescorre
,
ambitious
of
the
regency
,
have
intrigue


against
he
to
the
last
.
he
know
that
an
intemperate
love
of
power
be


the
mainspring
of
that
seemingly
dispassionate
nature
.
but
death
have


cross
Trescorre
's
scheme
;
and
he
be
too
adroit
an
opportunist
not
to


see
that
his
good
chance
now
lay
in
make
himself
indispensable
to
his


new
sovereign
.
of
all
this
Odo
be
aware
;
but
his
own
motive
in


appoint
Trescorre
do
not
justify
his
look
for
great


disinterestedness
in
his
minister
.
the
irony
of
circumstance
have
force


they
upon
each
other
,
and
each
know
that
the
other
understand
the


situation
and
be
prepared
to
make
the
good
of
it
.




the
Duke
presently
rise
,
and
hand
back
to
Trescorre
the
report
of
the


secret
police
.
they
be
the
document
he
most
dislike
to
handle
.




"
you
have
acquit
yourself
admirably
of
your
disagreeable
duty
,
"
he


say
with
a
smile
.
"
I
hope
I
have
do
as
well
.
at
any
rate
the
day

over

"




Trescorre
return
the
smile
,
with
his
usual
tinge
of
irony
.
"
another


have
already
begin
,
"
say
he
.




"
ah
,
"
say
Odo
,
with
a
touch
of
impatience
,
"
be
we
not
to
sleep
on
our


laurel

Trescorre
bow
.
"
Austria
,
your
highness
,
never

"




Odo
look
at
he
with
surprise
.
"
what
do
you
mean
?
"




"
that
I
have
to
remind
your
highness--
"




"
of
what--
?
"




Trescorre
have
one
of
his
characteristic
pause
.




"
that
the
Duke
of
Monte
Alloro
be
in
fail
health

and
that
she


Highness
's
year
of
widowhood
end
yesterday
.
"




there
be
a
silence
.
Odo
,
who
have
reseat
himself
,
rise
and
walk
to


the
window
.
the
shutter
stand
open
and
he
look
out
over
the
formless


obscurity
of
the
garden
.
above
the
intervene
masse
of
foliage
the


Borromini
wing
raise
its
vague
grey
bulk
.
he
see
light
in
Maria


Clementina
's
apartment
and
wonder
if
she
still
wake
.
an
hour
or
two


early
she
have
give
he
her
hand
in
the
contra
-
dance
at
the
state


ball
.
it
be
her
first
public
appearance
since
the
late
Duke
's
death
,


and
with
the
laying
off
of
her
weed
she
have
regain
something
of
she


former
brilliancy
.
at
the
moment
he
have
hardly
observe
she
:
she
have


seem
a
mere
inanimate
part
of
the
pageant
of
which
he
form
the


throbbing
centre
.
but
now
the
sense
of
her
nearness
press
upon
he
.


she
seem
close
to
he
,
ingrown
with
his
fate
;
and
with
the
curious


duality
of
vision
that
belong
to
such
moment
he
behold
she
again
as


she
have
first
shine
on

the
imperious
child

he
have
anger
by


stroke
her
spaniel

the
radiant
girl
who
have
welcome
he
on
his


return
to
Pianura

Trescorre
's
voice
arouse
he
.




"
at
any
moment
,
"

slowly
from

you
that

murmur
.

look
down

"




the
new
Duke
be
silent
.
his
minister
's
word
be
merely
the
audible


expression
of
his
own
thought

know

of


Pianura

his
pause
seem
to
flash
an
ironical


light
on
the
poverty
of
the
other

defence

"

quietly

Odo

on
he
with
a
start
.
"
do
I
understand
that
you
have


presumed--

his
minister
raise
a
deprecate
hand
.
"
Sir
,

he

"






4.2
.




Odo
,
on
his
return
to
Pianura
,
have
take
it
for
grant
that
de
Crucis


would
remain
in
his
service
.




there
have
be
little
talk
between
the
two
on
the
way
.
the
one
be
deep


in
his
own
wretchedness
,
and
the
other
have
too
fine
a
tact
to
intrude
on


it
;
but
Odo
feel
the
nearness
of
that
penetrate
sympathy
which
be


almost
a
gift
of
divination
.
he
be
glad
to
have
de
Crucis
at
his
side


at
a
moment
when
any
other
companionship
have
be
intolerable
;
and
in


the
egotism
of
his
misery
he
imagine
that
he
could
dispose
as
he


pleased
of
his
friend
's
future
.




after
the
little
Prince
's
death
,
however
,
de
Crucis
have
at
once
ask


permission
to
leave
Pianura
.
he
be
perhaps
not
displease
by
Odo
's


expression
of
surprise
and
disappointment
;
but
they
do
not
alter
his


decision
.
he
remind
the
new
Duke
that
he
have
be
call
to
Pianura
as


governor
to
the
late
heir
,
and
that
,
death
having
cut
short
his
task
,
he


have
now
no
farther
pretext
for
remain
.




Odo
listen
with
a
strange
sense
of
loneliness
.
the
responsibility
of


his
new
state
weigh
heavily
on
the
musing
speculative
side
of
his


nature
.
face
to
face
with
the
sudden
summon
to
action
,
with
the


necessity
for
prompt
and
not
too
-
curious
choice
of
mean
and
method
,
he


feel
a
steal
apathy
of
the
will
,
an
inclination
toward
the
subtle


duality
of
judgment
that
have
so
often
weaken
and
diffuse
his


energy
.
at
such
a
crisis
it
seem
to
he
that
,
de
Crucis
go
,
he


remain
without
a
friend
.
he
urge
the
abate
to
reconsider
his


decision
,
beg
he
to
choose
a
post
about
his
person
.




De
Crucis
shake
his
head
.




"
the
offer
,
"
say
he
,
"
be
more
tempting
to
I
than
your
Highness
can


guess
;
but
my
business
here
be
at
an
end
,
and
must
be
take
up


elsewhere
.
my
calling
be
that
of
a
pedagogue
.
when
I
be
summon
to


take
charge
of
Prince
Ferrante
's
education
I
give
up
my
position
in
the


household
of
Prince
Bracciano
not
only
because
I
believe
that
I
could


make
myself
more
useful
in
train
a
future
sovereign
than
the
son
of
a


private
nobleman
,
but
also
,
"
he
add
with
a
smile
,
"
because
I
be


curious
to
visit
a
state
of
which
your
Highness
have
so
often
speak
,
and


because
I
believe
that
my
residence
here
might
enable
I
to
be
of


service
to
your
Highness
.
in
this
I
be
not
mistaken
;
and
I
will
gladly


remain
in
Pianura
long
enough
to
give
your
Highness
such
counsel
as
my


experience
suggest
;
but
that
business
discharge
,
I
must
ask
leave
to


go
.
"




from
this
position
no
entreaty
could
move
he
;
and
so
fix
be
his


resolve
that
it
confirm
the
idea
that
he
be
still
a
secret
agent
of


the
Jesuits
.
strangely
enough
,
this
do
not
prejudice
Odo
,
who
be
more


than
ever
under
the
spell
of
de
Crucis
's
personal
influence
.
though
Odo


have
be
acquaint
with
many
profess
philosopher
he
have
never
meet


among
they
a
character
so
nearly
resemble
the
old
stoical
ideal
of


temperance
and
serenity
,
and
he
could
never
be
long
with
de
Crucis


without
reflect
that
the
training
which
could
form
and
nourish
so


noble
a
nature
must
be
other
than
the
world
conceive
it
.




De
Crucis
,
however
,
frankly
point
out
that
his
former
connection
with


the
Jesuits
be
too
well
know
in
Pianura
not
to
be
an
obstacle
in
the


way
of
his
usefulness
.




"
I
own
,
"
say
he
,
"
that
before
the
late
Duke
's
death
I
exert
such


influence
as
I
possess
to
bring
about
your
Highness
's
appointment
as


regent
;
but
the
very
connection
that
favour
I
with
your
predecessor


must
stand
in
the
way
of
my
serve
your
Highness
.
nothing
could
be
more


fatal
to
your
prospect
than
to
have
it
say
that
you
have
choose
a


former
Jesuit
as
your
advisor
.
in
the
present
juncture
of
affair
it
be


needful
that
you
should
appear
to
be
in
sympathy
with
the
liberal
,
and


that
whatever
reform
you
attempt
should
seem
the
result
of
popular


pressure
rather
than
of
your
own
free
choice
.
such
an
attitude
may
not


flat
the
sovereign
's
pride
,
and
be
in
fact
merely
a
high
form
of


expediency
;
but
it
be
one
which
the
proud
monarchs
of
Europe
be


find
themselves
constrain
to
take
if
they
would
preserve
their


power
and
use
it
effectually
.
"




soon
afterward
de
Crucis
leave
Pianura
;
but
before
leave
he
impart
to


odo
the
result
of
his
observation
while
in
the
late
Duke
's
service
.
De


Crucis
's
view
be
that
of
the
more
thoughtful
man
of
his
day
who
have
not


break
with
the
Church
,
yet
be
conscious
that
the
whole
social
system


of
Europe
be
in
need
of
renovation
.
the
movement
of
idea
in
France
,


and
their
rapid
transformation
into
legislative
measure
of
unforeseen


importance
,
have
as
yet
make
little
impression
in
Italy
;
and
the
clergy


in
particular
live
in
serene
unconsciousness
of
any
impending
change
.


De
Crucis
,
however
,
have
be
much
in
France
,
and
have
frequent
the


french
churchman
,
who
(
save
in
the
high
rank
of
the
hierarchy
)
be


keenly
alive
to
the
need
of
reform
,
and
ready
,
in
many
instance
,
to


sacrifice
their
own
privilege
in
the
public
cause
.
these
man
,
live
in


their
provincial
cure
or
abbey
,
be
necessarily
in
close
contact


with
the
people
,
well
acquaint
with
their
need
and
more
competent


to
relieve
they
,
than
the
city
demagogue
theorise
in
parisian


coffee
-
house
on
the
Rights
of
Man
and
the
Code
of
Nature
.
but
the
voice


of
the
demagogue
carry
far
than
that
of
the
clergy
;
and
such


revolutionary
notion
as
cross
the
Alps
have
more
to
do
with
the


founding
of
future
Utopias
than
with
the
remedy
of
present
evil
.




even
in
France
the
temperate
counsel
of
the
clergy
be
be
overrule


by
the
sentimental
imprudence
of
the
noble
and
by
the
bluster
of
the


politician
.
it
be
to
put
Odo
on
his
guard
against
these
two
influence


that
de
Crucis
be
chiefly
anxious
;
but
the
intelligent
cooperation
of


the
clergy
be
sadly
lack
in
his
administrative
scheme
.
he
know
that


Odo
could
not
count
on
the
support
of
the
Church
party
,
and
that
he
must


make
what
use
he
could
of
the
liberal
in
his
attempt
at
reform
.
the


clergy
of
Pianura
have
be
in
power
too
long
to
believe
in
the
necessity


of
concede
anything
to
the
new
spirit
;
and
since
the
banishment
of
the


society
of
Jesus
the
presumption
of
the
other
order
have
increase


instead
of
diminish
.
the
priest
,
whatever
their
failing
,
have


attach
the
needy
by
a
lavish
bounty
;
and
they
have
a
powerful
auxiliary


in
the
Madonna
of
the
Mountain
,
who
draw
pilgrim
from
all
part
of


Italy
and
thus
contribute
to
the
material
welfare
of
the
state
as
well


as
to
its
spiritual
privilege
.
to
the
common
people
their
Virgin
be


not
only
a
protection
against
disease
and
famine
,
but
a
kind
of
oracle
,


who
by
diver
sign
and
token
give
evidence
of
divine
approval
or


displeasure
;
and
it
be
naturally
to
the
priest
that
the
faithful


look
for
a
reading
of
these
phenomenon
.
this
give
the
clergy
a
powerful


hold
on
the
religious
sensibility
of
the
people
;
and
more
than
once


the
manif
disapproval
of
the
Mountain
Madonna
have
turn
the
scale


against
some
economic
measure
which
threaten
the
right
of
her
augur
.




De
Crucis
understand
the
force
of
these
traditional
influence
;
but
Odo
,


in
common
with
the
more
cultivated
man
of
his
day
,
have
live
too
long
in


an
atmosphere
of
polite
scepticism
to
measure
the
profound
hold
of


religion
on
the
consciousness
of
the
people
.
Christ
have
be
so
long


banish
from
the
drawing
-
room
that
it
be
have
hard
to
believe
that
he


still
rule
in
field
and
vineyard
.
to
man
of
Odo
's
stamp
the
piety
of


the
masse
be
a
mere
superficial
growth
,
a
kind
of
mental
mould
to
be


dry
off
by
the
first
beam
of
knowledge
.
he
do
not
conceive
it
as
a


habit
of
thought
so
old
that
it
have
become
instinctive
,
so
closely


intertwine
with
every
sense
that
to
hope
to
eradicate
it
be
like


try
to
drain
all
the
blood
from
a
man
's
body
without
kill
he
.
he


know
nothing
of
the
unwearied
working
of
that
power
,
patient
as
a


natural
force
,
which
,
to
reach
spirit
darken
by
ignorance
and
eye


dull
by
toil
,
have
stoop
to
a
thousand
disguise
,
humble
,
tender
and


grotesque
--
people
the
earth
with
a
new
race
of
avenge
or
protect


deity
,
guard
the
babe
in
the
cradle
and
the
cattle
in
the
stall
,


bless
the
good
man
's
vineyard

the
crop

blasphemer

depth

Odo
's
first
act
after
his
accession
have
be
to
recall
the
political


offender
banish
by
his
predecessor
;
and
so
general
be
the
custom
of


mark
the
opening
of
a
new
reign
by
an
amnesty
to
political
exile
,


that
Trescorre
offer
no
opposition
to
the
measure
.
Andreoni
and
his


friend
at
once
return
to
Pianura
,
and
Gamba
at
the
same
time
emerge


from
his
mysterious
hiding
-
place
.
he
be
the
only
one
of
the
group
who


strike
Odo
as
have
any
administrative
capacity
;
yet
he
be
more
likely


to
be
of
use
as
a
pamphleteer
than
as
an
office
-
holder
.
as
to
the
other


philosopher
,
they
be
what
their
name
imply
:
thoughtful
and


high
-
minded
man
,
with
a
generous
conception
of
their
civic
duty
,
and
a


noble
readiness
to
fulfil
they
at
any
cost
,
but
untrained
to
action
,
and


totally
ignorant
of
the
complex
science
of
government
.

find
the
hunchback
change

after

his
cousin
's


widow
.




it
surprise
he
,
in
look
back
,
to
see
how
completely
the
thought
of


Maria
Clementina
have
pass
out
of
his
life
,
how
wholly
he
have
cease
to


reckon
with
she
as
one
of
the
factor
in
his
destiny
.
at
her
child
's


death
-
bed
he
have
see
in
she
only
the
stricken
mother
,
centre
in
she


loss
,
and
recall
,
in
an
agony
of
tear
,
the
little
prince
's
prophetic


vision
of
the
wing
playmate
who
come
to
he
carry
toy
from


Paradise
.
after
Prince
Ferrante
's
death
she
have
go
on
a
long
visit
to


her
uncle
of
Monte
Alloro
;
and
since
her
return
to
Pianura
she
have
live


in
the
dower
-
house
,
refuse
Odo
's
offer
of
a
palace
in
the
town
.
she


have
first
show
herself
to
the
public
on
the
day
of
the
state
entry
;
and


now
,
her
year
of
widowhood
over
,
she
be
again
the
consort
of
a
reigning


Duke
of
Pianura
.




no
one
be
more
ignorant
than
her
husband
of
the
motive
determine
she


act
.
as
Duchess
of
Monte
Alloro
she
might
have
enjoy
the
wealth
and


independence
which
her
uncle
's
death
have
bestow
on
she
,
but
in


marry
again
she
resign
the
right
to
her
new
possession
,
which


become
vested
in
the
crown
of
Pianura
.
be
it
love
that
have
prompt
the


sacrifice
?
as
she
stand
beside
he
on
the
altar
step
of
the
Cathedral
,


as
she
ride
home
beside
he
between
their
shout
subject
,
Odo
ask


himself
the
question
again
and
again
.
the
year
have
deal
lightly
with


she
,
and
she
have
cross
the
threshold
of
the
thirty
with
the
assure


step
of
a
woman
who
have
no
cause
to
fear
what
await
she
.
but
her
blood


no
long
speak
her
thought
,
and
the
transparence
of
youth
have
change


to
a
brilliant
density
.
he
could
not
penetrate
beneath
the
surface
of


her
smile
:
she
seem
to
he
like
a
beautiful
toy
which
might
conceal
a


lacerate
weapon
.




meanwhile
between
himself
and
any
well
understanding
of
she
stand
the


remembrance
of
their
talk
in
the
hunting
-
lodge
of
Pontesordo
.
what
she


have
offer
then
he
have
refuse
to
take
:
be
she
the
woman
to
forget


such
a
refusal
?
be
it
not
rather
to
keep
its
memory
alive
that
she
have


marry
he
?
or
be
she
but
the
flighty
girl
he
have
once
imagine
she
,


drive
hither
and
thither
by
spasmodic
impulse
,
and
incapable
of


consistent
action
,
whether
for
good
or
ill
?
the
barrier
of
their


past
--
of
all
that
lie
unsaid
and
undo
between
they
--
so
completely
cut


she
off
from
he
that
he
have
,
in
her
presence
,
the
strange
sensation
of


a
man
who
believe
himself
to
be
alone
yet
feel
that
he
be


watch
...
the
first
month
of
their
marriage
be
oppress
by
this


sense
of
constraint
;
but
gradually
habit
bridge
the
distance
between


they
and
he
find
himself
at
once
near
to
she
and
less
acutely
aware


of
she
.
in
the
second
year
an
heir
be
bear
and
die
;
and
the
hope
and


grief
thus
share
draw
they
insensibly
into
the
relation
of
the
ordinary


husband
and
wife
,
knit
together
at
the
root
in
spite
of
superficial


divergency
.




in
his
passionate
need
of
sympathy
and
counsel
Odo
long
to
make
the


most
of
this
enforce
community
of
interest
.
already
his
first
zeal
be


flagging
,
his
belief
in
his
mission
waver
:
he
need
the


encouragement
of
a
kindre
faith
.
he
have
no
hope
of
find
in
Maria


Clementina
that
pure
passion
for
justice
which
seem
to
he
the
noble


ardour
of
the
soul
.
he
have
read
it
in
one
woman
's
eye
,
but
these
have


long
be
turn
from
he
.
unconsciously
perhaps
he
count
rather
on


his
wife
's
less
generous
quality
:
the
passion
for
dominion
,
the
blind


arrogance
of
temper
that
,
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
make
her
power


feel
,
have
so
often
draw
she
into
public
affair
.
might
not
this
waste


force
--
which
imply
,
after
all
,
a
certain
prodigality
of
courage
--
be


use
for
good
as
well
as
evil
?
might
not
his
influence
make
of
the


undisciplined
creature
at
his
side
an
unconscious
instrument
in
the


great
work
of
order
and
reconstruction
?




his
first
appeal
to
she
bring
the
answer
.
at
his
request
his
minister


have
draw
up
a
plan
of
financial
reorganisation
,
which
should
include


the
two
duchy
;
for
Monte
Alloro
,
though
wealthy
than
Pianura
,
be
in


even
great
need
of
fiscal
reform
.
as
a
first
step
towards
replenish


the
treasury
the
Duke
have
declare
himself
ready
to
limit
his
private


expenditure
to
a
fix
sum
;
and
he
now
ask
the
Duchess
to
pledge


herself
in
the
same
manner
.
Maria
Clementina
,
since
her
uncle
's
death
,


have
be
in
receipt
of
a
third
of
the
annual
revenue
of
Monte
Alloro
.


this
should
have
enable
she
to
pay
her
debt
and
put
some
dignity
and


order
into
her
establishment
;
but
the
first
year
's
income
have
go
in


the
building
of
a
villa
on
the
Piana
,
in
imitation
of
the
country
-
seat


along
the
Brenta
;
the
second
be
spend
in
establish
a
menagerie
of


wild
animal
like
that
of
the
French
Queen
at
Versailles
;
and
rumour
have


it
that
the
Duchess
carry
her
imitation
of
her
royal
cousin
so
far
as


to
be
involve
in
an
ugly
quarrel
with
her
jeweller
about
a
necklace


for
which
she
owe
a
thousand
ducat
.




all
these
report
have
of
course
reach
Odo
;
but
he
still
hope
that
an


appeal
to
her
love
of
dominion
might
prove
strong
than
the
habit
of


self
-
indulgence
.
he
say
to
himself
that
nothing
have
ever
be
do
to


rouse
her
ambition
,
that
hitherto
,
if
she
have
meddle
in
politic
,
it


have
be
merely
from
thwarted
vanity
or
the
desire
to
gratify
some


personal
spite
.
now
he
hope
to
take
she
by
high
passion
,
and
by


associate
she
with
his
own
scheme
to
utilise
her
dormant
energy
.




for
the
first
moment
she
listen
with
the
strained
fixity
of
a
child
;


then
her
attention
flicker
and
die
out
.
the
life
-
long
habit
of


refer
every
question
to
a
personal
standpoint
make
it
difficult
for


she
to
follow
a
general
argument
,
and
she
lean
back
with
the
resign


eyelid
of
piety
under
the
pulpit
.
Odo
,
resolve
to
be
patient
,
and


see
that
the
subject
be
too
large
for
she
,
try
to
take
it
apart
,


put
it
before
her
bit
by
bit
,
and
at
such
an
angle
that
she
should


catch
her
own
reflection
in
it
.
he
think
to
take
she
by
the
austrian


side
,
touch
on
the
well
-
know
antagonism
between
Vienna
and
Rome
,
on


the
reform
of
the
Tuscan
Grand
-
Duke
,
on
the
Emperor
Joseph
's
open


defiance
of
the
Church
's
feudal
claim
.
but
she
scent
a
personal


application
.




"
my
cousin
the
Emperor
should
be
a
priest
himself
,
"
she
shrug
,
"
for


he
belong
to
the
preaching
order
.
he
never
go
to
France
but
he
give


the
poor
Queen
such
a
scolding
that
her
eye
be
red
for
a
week
.
have


Joseph
be
try
to
set
our
house
in
order
?
"




discouraged
,
but
more
than
ever
bent
on
patience
,
he
try
the
chord
of


vanity
,
of
her
love
of
popularity
.
the
people
call
she
the
beautiful


duchess
--
why
not
let
history
name
she
the
great
?
but
the
mention
of


history
be
unfortunate
.
it
remind
she
of
her
lesson
-
book
,
and
of
the


stupid
Greeks
and
Romans
,
whose
date
she
could
never
recall
.
she
hope


she
should
never
be
anything
so
dull
as
an
historical
personage
!
and


besides
,
greatness
be
for
the
man
--
it
be
enough
for
a
princess
to
be


virtuous
.
and
she
look
as
edify
as
her
own
epitaph
.




he
catch
this
up
and
try
to
make
she
distinguish
between
the
public


and
the
private
virtue
.
but
the
word
"
responsibility
"
slip
from
he


and
he
feel
her
stiffen
.
this
be
preach
,
and
she
hate
preach


even
more
than
history
.
her
attention
stray
again
and
he
rally
his


force
in
a
last
appeal
.
but
he
know
it
be
a
lost
battle
:
every


argument
break
against
the
close
front
of
her
indifference
.
he
be


talk
a
language
she
have
never
learn
--
it
be
all
as
remote
from
she


as
Church
Latin
.
a
princess
do
not
need
to
know
Latin
.
she
let
her
eye


linger
suggestively
on
the
clock
.
it
be
a
fine
hunting
morning
,
and
she


have
mean
to
kill
a
stag
in
the
Caccia
del
Vescovo
.




when
he
begin
to
sum
up
,
and
the
question
narrow
to
a
direct
appeal
,


her
eye
leave
the
clock
and
return
to
he
.
now
she
be
listen
.
he


press
on
to
the
matter
of
retrenchment
.
would
she
join
he
,
would
she


help
to
make
the
great
work
possible
?
at
first
she
seem
hardly
to


understand
;
but
as
his
meaning
grow
clear
to
her--"Is
the
money
no


long
ours
?

about

at
the
delicate
adornment
of
the


wall

the
curtain

she
rise
,

from
her
full
height
drop
a
brilliant
smile
on
he
;


then
her
eye
turn
to
the
portrait
of
the
great
fighting
Duke

in


the
monumental
stucchi

the

the

strip
of

pious
relic

the


Venus

Twilight

fall
on
the

through
it
a
young
moon
float
above
the


cypress
.




on
just
such
an
evening
three
year
early
he
have
ride
down
the
slope


of
the
Monte
Baldo
with
Fulvia
Vivaldi
at
his
side
.
how
often
,
since
,
he


have
relive
the
incident
of
that
night
!
with
singular
precision
they


succeed
each
other
in
his
thought
.
he
feel
the
wild
sweep
of
the


storm
across
the
lake
,
the
warmth
of
her
nearness
,
the
sense
of
she


complete
trust
in
he
;
then
their
arrival
at
the
inn
,
the
dazzle
of


light
as
they
cross
the
threshold
,
and
de
Crucis
confront
they


within
.
he
hear
her
voice
plead
with
he
in
every
accent
that
pride


and
tenderness
and
a
noble
loyalty
could
command
;
he
feel
she
will


slowly
dominate
his
,
like
a
supernatural
power
force
he
into
his


destine
path
;
he
feel
--
and
with
how
profound
an
irony
of
spirit!--the


passion
of
self
-
dedication
in
which
he
have
take
up
his
task
.




he
have
know
moment
of
happiness
since
;
moment
when
he
believe
in


himself
and
in
his
calling
,
and
feel
himself
indeed
the
man
she
think


he
.
that
be
in
the
exaltation
of
the
first
month
,
when
his


opportunity
have
seem
as
boundless
as
his
dream
,
and
he
have
not
yet


learn
that
the
sovereign
's
power
may
be
a
kind
of
spiritual
prison
to


the
man
.
since
then
,
indeed
,
he
have
know
another
kind
of
happiness
,
have


be
aware
of
a
secret
voice
whispering
within
he
that
she
be
right


and
have
choose
wisely
for
he
;
but
this
be
when
he
have
realise
that
he


live
in
a
prison
,
and
have
begin
to
admire
the
sumptuous
adornment
of


its
wall
.
for
a
while
the
mere
external
show
of
power
amuse
he
,
and


his
imagination
be
charm
by
the
historic
dignity
of
his
surrounding
.


in
such
a
setting
,
against
the
background
of
such
a
past
,
it
seem
easy


to
play
the
benefactor
and
friend
of
the
people
.
his
sensibility
be


touch
by
the
contrast
,
and
he
see
himself
as
a
picturesque
figure


link
the
new
dream
of
liberty
and
equality
to
the
feudal
tradition


of
a
thousand
year
.
but
this
masquerade
soon
cease
to
divert
he
.


the
round
of
court
ceremonial
weary
he
,
and
book
and
art
lose
their


fascination
.
the
more
he
vary
his
amusement
the
more
monotonous
they


become
,
the
more
he
crowd
his
life
with
petty
duty
the
more
empty
of


achievement
it
seem
.




at
first
he
have
hope
to
bury
his
personal
disappointment
in
the
task


of
reconstruct
his
little
state
;
but
on
every
side
he
feel
a
mute


resistance
to
his
effort
.
the
philosophical
faction
have
indeed
pour


forth
pamphlet
celebrate
his
reform
,
and
compare
his
reign
to
the


return
of
the
Golden
Age
.
but
it
be
not
for
the
philosopher
that
he


labour
;
and
the
benefit
of
free
speech
,
a
free
press
,
a
secular


education
do
not
,
after
all
,
reach
those
over
whom
his
heart
yearn
.


it
be
the
people
he
long
to
serve
;
and
the
people
be
hungry
,
be


fever
-
stricken
,
be
crush
with
tithe
and
taxis
.
it
be
hopeless
to


try
to
reach
they
by
the
diffusion
of
popular
knowledge
.
they
must
first


be
feed
and
clothe
;
and
before
they
could
be
feed
and
clothe
the
chain


of
feudalism
must
be
break
.




man
like
Gamba
and
Andreoni
see
this
clearly
enough
;
but
it
be
not
from


they
that
help
could
come
.
the
nobility
and
clergy
must
be
coax
or


coerce
into
sympathy
with
the
new
movement
;
and
to
accomplish
this


exceed
Odo
's
power
.
in
France
,
the
revolt
from
feudalism
have
find


some
of
its
bold
leader
in
the
very
class
that
have
most
to
lose
by


the
change
;
but
in
Italy
few
cause
be
at
work
to
set
such


disintereste
passion
in
motion
.
south
of
the
Alps
liberalism
be


merely
one
of
the
new
fashion
from
France
:
the
man
run
after
the


pamphlet
from
Paris
as
the
woman
run
after
the
cosmetic
;
and
the


politic
go
no
deep
than
the
powder
.
even
among
the
free


intellect
liberalism
result
in
a
new
way
of
think
rather
in
a
new


way
of
living
.
nowhere
among
the
well
class
be
there
any
desire
to


attack
exist
institution
.
the
Church
have
never
trouble
the
Latin


consciousness
.
the
Renaissance
have
teach
cultivate
Italians
how
to


live
at
peace
with
a
creed
in
which
they
no
long
believe
;
and
their


easy
-
go
scepticism
be
combine
with
a
traditional
conviction
that


the
priest
know
well
than
any
one
how
to
deal
with
the
poor
,
and
that


the
clergy
be
of
distinct
use
in
relieve
the
individual
conscience


of
its
obligation
to
its
fellow
.




it
be
against
such
deep
-
seat
habit
of
thought
that
Odo
have
to


struggle
.
century
of
fierce
individualism
,
or
of
sullen
apathy
under
a


foreign
rule
,
have
leave
the
Italians
incapable
of
any
concerted
political


action
;
but
suspicion
,
avarice
and
vanity
,
combine
with
a
lurk
fear


of
the
Church
,
unite
all
party
in
a
kind
of
passive
opposition
to


reform
.
thus
the
Duke
's
resolve
to
put
the
University
under
lay


direction
have
excite
the
enmity
of
the
Barnabites
,
who
have
be
at
its


head
since
the
suppression
of
the
Society
of
Jesus
;
his
effort
to


partition
among
the
peasantry
the
Caccia
del
Vescovo
,
that
great
waste


domain
of
the
see
of
Pianura
,
have
rouse
a
storm
of
fear
among
all
who


lay
claim
to
feudal
right
;
and
his
own
personal
attempt
at


retrenchment
,
which
necessitate
the
suppression
of
numerous
court


office
,
have
do
more
than
anything
else
to
increase
his
unpopularity
.


even
the
people
,
in
whose
behalf
these
sacrifice
be
make
,
look


askance
at
his
diminished
state
,
and
show
a
perverse
sympathy
with
the


dispossess
official
who
have
take
so
picturesque
a
part
in
the
public


ceremonial
of
the
court
.
all
Odo
's
philosophy
could
not
fortify
he


against
such
disillusionment
.
he
feel
the
lack
of
Fulvia
's


unquestione
faith
not
only
in
the
abstract
beauty
of
the
new
ideal


but
in
their
immediate
adaptability
to
the
complex
condition
of
life
.


only
a
woman
's
conviction
,
nourish
on
sentiment
and
self
-
sacrifice
,


could
burn
with
that
clear
unwavering
flame
:
his
own
belief
be
at
the


mercy
of
every
wind
of
doubt
or
ingratitude
that
blow
across
his


unsheltered
sensibility
.




it
be
more
than
a
year
since
he
have
have
news
of
Fulvia
.
for
a
while


they
have
exchange
letter
,
and
it
have
be
a
consolation
to
tell
she
of


his
struggle
and
experiment
,
of
his
many
failure
and
few
result
.
she


have
encourage
he
to
continue
the
struggle
,
have
analyse
his
various


plan
of
reform
,
and
have
give
her
enthusiastic
support
to
the


partition
of
the
Bishop
's
fief
and
the
secularisation
of
the


university
.
her
own
life
,
she
say
,
be
too
uneventful
to
write
of
;
but


she
speak
of
the
kindness
of
her
host
,
the
Professor
and
his
wife
,
of


the
simple
unceremonious
way
of
live
in
the
old
Calvinist
city
,
and
of


the
number
of
distinguished
person
draw
thither
by
its
atmosphere
of


intellectual
and
social
freedom
.




Odo
suspect
a
certain
colourlessness
in
the
life
she
depict
.
the


tone
of
her
letter
be
too
uniformly
cheerful
not
to
suggest
a
lack
of


emotional
variety
;
and
he
know
that
Fulvia
's
nature
,
however
much
she


fancy
it
under
the
rule
of
reason
,
be
in
reality
feed
by
profound


current
of
feeling
.
something
of
her
old
ardour
reappear
when
she


write
of
the
possibility
of
publish
her
father
's
book
.
her
friend
in


Geneva
,
having
hear
of
her
difficulty
with
the
dutch
publisher
,
have


undertake
to
vindicate
her
claim
;
and
they
have
every
hope
that
the


matter
would
be
successfully
conclude
.
the
joy
of
renew
activity
with


which
this
letter
glow
would
have
communicate
itself
to
Odo
have
he


receive
it
at
a
different
time
;
but
it
come
on
the
day
of
his
marriage
,


and
since
then
he
have
never
write
to
she
.




now
he
feel
a
sudden
longing
to
break
the
silence
between
they
,
and


seat
himself
at
his
desk
he
begin
to
write
.
a
moment
later
there
be


a
knock
on
the
door
and
one
of
his
gentleman
enter
.

glow
of
pleasure
that
the
news
of
Alfieri
's
come


always
bring
.
here
be
a
friend
at
last
!
he
forget
the
constraint
of


their
last
meeting
in
Florence
,
and
remember
only
the
happy


interchange
of
idea
and
emotion
that
have
be
one
of
the
quickening


influence
of
his
youth
.




Alfieri
,
in
the
intervene
year
,
be
grow
to
be
one
of
the
foremost


figure
in
Italy
.
his
love
for
the
Countess
of
Albany
,
persist


through
the
vicissitude
of
her
tragic
marriage
,
have
rally
the


scatter
force
of
his
nature
.
ambitious
to
excel
for
her
sake
,
to
show


himself
worthy
of
such
a
love
,
he
have
at
last
shake
off
the
strange


torpor
of
his
youth
,
and
reveal
himself
as
the
poet
for
whom
Italy


wait
.
in
ten
month
of
feverish
effort
he
have
pour
forth
fourteen


tragedy
--
among
they
the
Antigone
,
the
Virginia
,
and
the
Conjuration
of


the
Pazzi
.

start
up
at
the
sound
of
a
new
voice
vibrate
with


passion
she
have
long
since
unlearned
.
since
Filicaja
's
thrilling
appeal


to
his
enslaved
country
no
poet
have
challenge
the
old
roman
spirit


which
petrarch
have
strive
to
rouse
.
while
the
literati
be
busy


discuss
Alfieri
's
blank
verse
,
while
the
grammarian
wrangle
over


his
syntax
and
ridicule
his
solecism
,
the
public
,
heedless
of
such


nicety
,
be
glow
with
the
new
wine
which
he
have
pour
into
the
old


vessel
of
classic
story
.
"
liberty
"
be
the
cry
that
ring
on
the
lip
of


all
his
hero
,
in
accent
so
new
and
stir
that
his
audience
never


weary
of
its
repetition
.
it
be
no
secret
that
his
story
of
ancient


Greece
and
Rome
be
but
allegory
mean
to
teach
the
love
of
freedom
;


yet
the
Antigone
have
be
perform
in
the
private
theatre
of
the


spanish
Ambassador
at
Rome
,
the
Virginia
have
be
receive
with
applause


on
the
public
board
at
Turin
,
and
after
the
usual
difficulty
with
the


censorship
the
happy
author
have
actually
succeed
in
publish
his


play
at
Siena
.
these
volume
be
already
in
Odo
's
hand
,
and
a


manuscript
copy
of
the
Odes
to
Free
America
be
be
circulate
among


the
liberal
in
Pianura
,
and
have
be
bring
to
his
notice
by
Andreoni
.




to
those
hopeful
spirit
who
look
for
the
near
approach
of
a
happy


era
,
Alfieri
be
the
inspire
spokesman
of
reform
,
the
heaven
-
send


prophet
who
be
to
lead
his
country
out
of
bondage
.
the
eye
of
the


italian
reformer
be
fix
with
passionate
eagerness
on
the
course
of


event
in
England
and
France
.
the
conclusion
of
peace
between
England


and
America
,
recently
celebrate
in
Alfieri
's
fifth
Ode
,
seem
to
the


most
sceptical
convincing
proof
that
the
right
of
man
be
destine
to


a
speedy
triumph
throughout
the
civilised
world
.
it
be
not
of
a
united


Italy
that
these
enthusiast
dream
.
they
be
not
so
much
patriot
as


philanthropist
;
for
the
teaching
of
Rousseau
and
his
school
,
while


intensify
the
love
of
man
for
man
,
have
proportionately
weaken
the


sense
of
patriotism
,
of
the
interet
du
clocher
.
the
new
man
pride


himself
on
be
a
citizen
of
the
world
,
on
sympathise
as
warmly
with


the
poetic
savage
of
Peru
as
with
his
own
prosaic
and
narrow
-
minded


neighbour
.
indeed
,
the
prevalent
belief
that
the
savage
's
mode
of
life


be
much
nearer
the
truth
than
that
of
civilised
Europeans
,
make
it


appear
superfluous
to
enter
into
the
grievance
and
difficulty
of
what


be
but
a
pass
phase
of
human
development
.
to
cast
off
clothe
and


code
,
and
live
in
a
peaceful
socialism
"
under
the
amiable
reign
of


truth
and
Nature
,
"
seem
on
the
whole
much
easy
than
to
undertake
the


systematic
reform
of
exist
abuse
.




to
such
dreamer
--
whose
idea
be
those
of
the
majority
of
intelligent


man
in
France
and
Italy
--
Alfieri
's
high
-
sound
tirade
embody
the


noblest
of
political
creed
;
and
even
the
soberer
judgment
of
statesman


and
man
of
affair
be
captivate
by
the
grandeur
of
his
verse
and
the


heroic
audacity
of
his
theme
.
for
the
first
time
in
century
the


Italian
Muse
speak
with
the
voice
of
a
man
;
and
every
man
's
heart
in


Italy
spring
up
at
the
call
.




in
the
midst
of
these
triumph
,
fate
in
the
shape
of
Cardinal
York
have


momentarily
separate
Alfieri
from
his
mistress
,
despatch
the


too
-
tender
Countess
to
a
discreet
retreat
in
Alsace
,
and
signify
to


her
turbulent
adorer
that
he
be
not
to
follow
she
.
distract
by
this


prohibition
,
Alfieri
have
resume
the
nomadic
habit
of
his
youth
,
now


wander
from
one
italian
city
to
another
,
now
push
as
far
as
Paris
,


which
he
hate
but
be
always
revisit
,
now
dash
across
the
Channel


to
buy
thoroughbred
in
England
--
for
his
passion
for
horse
be


unabated
.
he
be
lately
return
from
such
an
expedition
,
having
lead
his


cavalcade
across
the
Alps
in
person
,
with
a
boyish
delight
in
the


astonishment
which
this
fantastic
exploit
excited
.




the
meeting
between
the
two
friend
be
all
that
Odo
could
have
wish
.


though
affect
to
scorn
the
court
of
prince
,
Alfieri
be
not
averse


to
show
himself
there
as
the
poet
of
the
democracy
,
and
to
hear


his
hero
mouth
their
tyrannicidal
speech
on
the
board
of
royal
and


ducal
stage
.
he
have
lately
make
some
stay
in
Milan
,
where
he
have


arrive
in
time
to
see
his
antigone
perform
before
the
vice
-
regal


court
,
and
to
be
enthusiastically
acclaim
as
the
high
-
priest
of


liberty
by
a
community
live
placidly
under
the
austrian
yoke
.
alfieri


be
not
the
man
to
be
strike
by
such
incongruity
.
it
be
his
fate
to


formulate
creed
in
which
he
have
no
faith
:
to
recreate
the
political


ideal
of
Italy
while
bitterly
oppose
to
any
actual
effort
at
reform
,


and
to
be
regard
as
the
mouthpiece
of
the
Revolution
while
he


execrate
the
Revolution
with
the
whole
force
of
his
traditional


instinct
.
as
usual
he
be
too
deeply
engross
in
his
own
affair
to


feel
much
interest
in
any
other
;
but
it
be
enough
for
Odo
to
clasp
the


hand
of
the
man
who
have
give
a
voice
to
the
high
aspiration
of
his


countryman
.
the
poet
give
more
than
he
could
expect
from
the
friend
;
and


he
be
satisfied
to
listen
to
Alfieri
's
account
of
his
triumph
,


intersperse
with
bitter
diatribe
against
the
public
whose
applause
he


court
,
and
the
Pope
to
whom
,
on
bended
knee
,
he
have
offer
a
copy
of


his
play
.




Odo
eagerly
press
Alfieri
to
remain
in
Pianura
,
offer
to
put
one
of


the
ducal
villa
at
his
disposal
,
and
suggest
that
the
Virginia


should
be
perform
before
the
court
on
the
Duchess
's
birthday
.




"
it
be
true
,
"
he
say
,
"
that
we
can
offer
you
but
an
indifferent
company


of
actor
;
but
it
might
be
possible
to
obtain
one
or
two
of
the
lead


tragedian
from
Turin
or
Milan
,
so
that
the
principal
part
should
at


least
be
worthily
fill

"




Alfieri
reply
with
a
contemptuous
gesture
.
"
your
Highness
,

lead


tragedian

to
dance
to
the
tune
of
Goldoni
and


Metastasio

good
be
no
well
than
the
bad

no

no

draw


himself
up
and
thrust
a
hand
in
his
bosom

"
ah
!

he
exclaim
,
"
if
I


could
see
the
part
of
Virginia
act

the
lady

recently
recite
,


before
a
small
company

Odes

a
scant


day
's
journey
would
bring

to
her
side
!
it
be
strange
how
the
mere


think
seem
to
fill
the
room
with
her
presence
.
he
feel
she
in
the


quicken
beat
of
his
pulse
,
in
the
sudden
lightness
of
the
air
,
in
a


lift
and
widening
of
the
very
bound
of
thought
.




from
Alfieri
he
learn
that
she
have
live
for
some
month
in
the


household
of
the
distinguished
naturalist
,
Count
Castiglione
,
with
whose


daughter
's
education
she
be
charge
.
in
such
surrounding
her
wit
and


learn
could
not
fail
to
attract
the
good
company
of
Milan
,
and
she


be
become
one
of
the
most
noted
figure
of
the
capital
.
there
have
be


some
talk
of
offer
she
the
chair
of
poetry
at
the
Brera
;
but
the


report
of
her
liberal
view
have
deter
the
faculty
.
meanwhile
the
very


fact
that
she
represent
the
new
school
of
thought
give
an
add
z


to
her
conversation
in
a
society
which
make
up
for
its
mild
servitude


under
the
Austrian
by
much
talk
of
liberalism

Signorina

the
fashion
.
the
literati
celebrate
she


scholarship

the
sonneteer

eloquence

beauty
;
and
no
foreigner


on
the
grand
tour
be
content
to
leave
Milan
without
having
behold
the


fair
prodigy

recite
Petrarch
's
Ode

the
late


elegy
of

Odo
scarce
know
with
what
feeling
he
listen
.
he
could
not
but


acknowledge
that
such
a
life
be
well
suited
to
one
of
Fulvia
's
gift


and
ambition
than
the
humdrum
existence
of
a
swiss
town
;
yet
his
first


sensation
be
one
of
obscure
jealousy
,
of
reluctance
to
think
of
she
as


having
definitely
break
with
the
past
.
he
have
picture
she
as
adrift
,


like
himself
,
on
a
dark
sea
of
uncertainty
;
and
to
learn
that
she
have


find
a
safe
anchorage
be
almost
to
feel
himself
desert
.




the
court

busy
with
preparation
for
the

the
rehearsal
go
rapidly
forward
under
the
noble
author

the
great

arrive
,

for
the
first
time
in


the
history
of

turn
to

dismissal

to

that
the
publication
of

father

the
immediate
cause

more
profoundly

Beccaria

the

a
pretext

the
development
of
his
political


theory

set
forth
with
singular
daring
and
audacity

and


support
by
all
the
argument
that
his
long
study
of

command
.
the
temperate
and
judicial
tone
which
he
have
succeed
in


preserve
enhance
the
effect
of
his
arraignment
of
Church

,


and
while
his
immense
erudition
commend
his
work
to
the
learn
,
its


directness
of
style
give
it
an
immediate
popularity

the
general


reader

it
be
an
age
when
every

on
the
great


question
of

eagerly

of
the
business

the

faction

the


comparative
leniency
of
the

the
story
of
the
difficulty
that


Fulvia
have
encounter
in
its
publication
make
she
the
heroine
of
the


moment

she
have
never
conceal
her
devotion
to
her
father
's
doctrine

in
the
first
glow
of
filial
pride
she
may
have
yield
too
openly
to


the
desire

on
as
having
share
in
the
writing
of
the
book

as
be
at
least
an


active
exponent
of
its
principle
.
even
in
Lombardy
it
be
not
well
to


be
too
openly
associate
with
the
authorship
of
a
condemn
book

and


Fulvia
be
suddenly
advise
by
the
police
that
her
presence
in
Milan
be


no
long
acceptable
to
the
government

the
news
excite
great
indignation
among
her
friend
,

Count


castiglione
and
several
other
gentleman
of
rank
hasten
to
intervene
in


her
behalf
;
but
the
governor
declare
himself
unwilling
to
take
issue


with
the
Holy
Office
on
a
doctrinal
point
,
and
privately
add
that
it


would
be
well
for
the
Signorina
Vivaldi
to
withdraw
from
Lombardy
before


the
clergy
bring
any
direct
charge
against
she
.
to
ignore
this
hint


would
have
be
to
risk
not
only
her
own
safety

that
of
the


gentleman
who
have
befriend
she

Fulvia
at
once
set
out
for

only
place

Andreoni

gladly
have

a
home

on


learn
that
the
Holy

be
on
her
track

she
have
refuse
to

by
remain
under
their
roof

have
insist
that

should
wait
on
the
Duke

obtain
a
safe
-
conduct
for
she
that


very
night
.




Odo
listen
to
this
story
with
an
agitation
compound
of
strangely


contradictory
sensation
.
to
learn
that
Fulvia
,
at
the
very
moment
when


he
have
picture
she
as
separate
from
he
by
the
happiness
and
security


of
her
life
,
be
in
reality
a
proscribe
wanderer

none
but
himself


to
turn
to
,
fill
he
with
a
confused
sense
of
happiness
;
but
the


discovery
that
,
in
his
own
dominion
,
the
political
refugee
be
not
safe


from
the
threat
of
the
Holy
Office
,
excite
a
different
emotion
.
all


these
consideration
,
however
,
be
subordinate
to
the
thought
that
he


must
see
Fulvia
at
once
.
it
be
impossible
to
summon
she
to
the
palace


at
that
hour
,

even
to
secure
her
safety

by

attention

a
moment

at

loss
how
to

and
if
your
Highness


desire
I
will
see
that
the
lady
find
her
way
there
before
sunrise
.
"




the
sun
have
hardly
rise
the
next
morning
when
the
Duke
himself
set


forth
.
he
ride
alone
,
dress
like
one
of
his
own
esquire
,
and
give
the


word
unremarke
to
the
sleepy
sentinel
at
the
gate
.
as
it
close
behind


he
and
he
set
out
down
the
long
road
that
lead
to
the
chase
,
it
seem


to
he
that
the
morning
solitude
be
throng
with
spectral
memory
.


melancholy
and
fanciful
they
flit
before
he
,
now
in
the
guise
of


Cerveno
and
Momola
,
now
of
Maria
Clementina
and
himself
.
every
detail
of


the
scene
be
interweave
with
the
fibre
of
early
association
,
from
the


far
off
year
when
,
as
a
lonely
child
on
the
farm
at
Pontesordo
,
he
have


gaze
across
the
marsh
at
the
mysterious
woodland
of
the
chase
,
to
the


later
day
when
,
in
the
deserted
hunting
-
lodge
,
the
Duchess
have
fling
she


whip
at
the
face
in
the
Venice
mirror
.




he
press
forward
impatiently
,
and
presently
the
lodge
rise
before
he


in
its
grassy
solitude
.
the
level
sunbeam
have
not
yet
penetrate
the


surround
palisade
of
bough
,
and
the
house
lie
in
a
chill
twilight


that
seem
an
emanation
from
its
mouldering
wall
.
as
Odo
approach
,


Gamba
appear
from
the
shadow
and
take
his
horse
;
and
the
next
moment


he
have
push
open
the
door
,
and
stand
in
Fulvia
's
presence
.




she
be
seat
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
,
and
as
she
rise
to
meet


he
it
chance
that
her
head
,
envelop
in
its
black
travelling
-
hood
,


be
relieve
for
a
moment
against
the
tarnished
background
of
the
break


mirror
.
the
impression
strike
a
chill
to
his
heart
;
but
it
be
replace


by
a
glow
of
boyish
happiness
as
their
eye
meet
and
he
feel
her
hand
in


his
.




for
a
moment
all
his
thought
be
lose
in
the
mere
sense
of
she


nearness
.
she
seem
simply
an
envelop
atmosphere
in
which
he
draw


fresh
breath
;
but
gradually
her
outline
emerge
from
this
haze
of


feeling
,
and
he
find
himself
look
at
she
with
the
wonder
gaze
of


a
stranger
.
she
have
be
a
girl
of
sixteen
when
they
first
meet
.
twelve


year
have
pass
since
then
,
and
she
be
now
a
woman
of
twenty
-
eight
,


belong
to
a
race
in
which
beauty
ripen
early
and
as
soon
decline
.


but
some
happy
property
of
nature
--
whether
the
rare
mould
of
she


feature
or
the
gift
of
the
spirit
that
inform
they
--
have
hold
she


loveliness
intact
,
preserve
the
clear
line
of
youth
after
its
bloom


be
go
,
and
make
she
seem
like
a
lover
's
memory
of
herself
.
so
she


appear
at
first
,
a
bright
imponderable
presence
glide
toward
he
out


of
the
past

but
as
her
hand
lie
in
his
the
warm
current
of
life
be


renew
between
they

unpublished
fragment
from
Mr.
Arthur
Young
's
diary
of
his
travel
in


Italy
in
the
year
1789
.




October
1st
.




having
agree
with
a
vetturino
to
carry
I
to
Pianura
,
set
out
this


morning
from
Mantua
.
the
country
mostly
arable
,
with
row
of
elm
and


maple
pollard
.
dine
at
Casal
Maggiore
,
in
an
infamous
filthy
inn
.
at


dinner
be
join
by
a
gentleman
who
have
take
the
other
seat
in
the


vettura
as
far
as
Pianura
.
we
engage
in
conversation
and
I
find
he
a


man
of
lively
intelligence
and
the
most
polished
address
.
though
dress


in
the
foreign
style
,
en
abbe
,
he
speak
English
with
as
much
fluency
as


myself
,
and
but
for
the
philosophical
tone
of
his
remark
I
have
take


he
for
an
ecclesiastic
.
altogether
a
striking
and
somewhat
perplexing


character
:
able
,
keen
,
intelligent
,
evidently
use
to
the
good
company
,


yet
acquaint
with
the
condition
of
the
people
,
the
method
of
farming
,


and
other
economical
subject
such
as
be
seldom
think
worthy
of


attention
among
Italians
of
quality
.




it
appear
he
be
newly
from
France
,
where
he
have
be
as
much
strike


as
myself
by
the
general
state
of
ferment
.
though
own
that
there
be


much
reason
for
discontent
,
and
that
the
conduct
of
the
court
and


minister
be
blind
and
infatuate
beyond
belief
,
he
yet
declare


himself
gravely
apprehensive
of
the
future
,
say
that
the
people
know


not
what
they
want
,
and
be
unwilling
to
listen
to
those
that
might


have
prove
their
good
advisor
.
whether
by
this
he
mean
the
clergy
I


know
not
;
though
I
observe
he
speak
favourably
of
that
body
in
France
,


point
out
that
,
long
before
the
recent
agitation
,
they
have
defend


the
civil
right
of
the
Third
Estate
,
and
cite
many
case
in
which
the


country
curate
have
show
themselves
the
true
friend
of
the
people
:
a


fact
my
own
observation
hath
confirm
.




I
remark
to
he
that
I
be
surprised
to
find
how
little
talk
there
be


in
Italy
of
the
distracted
condition
in
France
;
and
this
though
the


country
be
overrun
with
french
refugee
,
or
emigre
,
as
they
call


themselves
,
who
bring
with
they
report
that
might
well
excite
the
alarm


of
neighbouring
government
.
he
say
he
have
remark
the
same


indifference
,
but
that
this
be
consonant
with
the
italian
character
,


which
never
look
to
the
morrow
;
and
he
add
that
the
mild
disposition


of
the
people
,
and
their
profound
respect
for
religion
,
be
sufficient


assurance
against
any
political
excess
.




to
this
I
could
not
forbear
reply
that
I
could
not
regard
as
excess


the
just
protest
of
the
poor
against
the
unlawful
tyranny
of
the


privileged
class
,
nor
forbear
to
hail
with
joy
the
dawn
of
that
light


of
freedom
which
hath
already
shed
so
sublime
an
effulgence
on
the
wild


of
the
New
World
.
the
abate
take
this
in
good
part
,
though
I
could
see


he
be
not
wholly
of
my
way
of
thinking
;
but
he
declare
that
in
his


opinion
different
race
need
different
law
,
and
that
the
sturdy
and


temperate
american
colonist
be
fit
to
enjoy
a
great
measure
of


political
freedom
than
the
more
volatile
French
and
Italians
--
as
though


liberty
be
not
destine
by
the
Creator
to
be
equally
share
by
all


mankind
!

I

this
passage
stand
,

the
late
unhappy


event
in
France

prove
that

nearer

myself

)




in
the
afternoon
through
a
poor
country
to
Ponte
di
Po
,
a
miserable


village
on
the
border
of
the
duchy
,
where
we
lay
,
not
sleep
,
in
our


clothe
,
at
the
bad
inn
I
have
yet
encounter
.
here
our
luggage
be


plumb
for
Pianura
.
the
impertinence
of
the
petty
sovereign
to


traveller
in
Italy
be
often
intolerable
,
and
the
custom
officer
show


the
utmost
insolence
in
the
search
for
seditious
pamphlet
and
other


contraband
article
;
but
here
I
be
agreeably
surprise
by
the
courtesy


of
the
official
and
the
despatch
with
which
our
luggage
be
examine
.


on
my
remark
this
,
my
companion
reply
that
the
Duke
of
Pianura
be


a
man
of
liberal
view
,
anxious
to
encourage
foreigner
to
visit
his


state
,
and
the
last
to
put
petty
obstacle
in
the
way
of
travel
.
I


answer
,
this
be
the
report
I
have
hear
of
he
;
and
it
be
in
the
hope


of
learn
something
more
of
the
reform
he
be
say
to
have
effect
,


that
I
have
turn
aside
to
visit
the
duchy
.
my
companion
reply
that


his
Highness
have
in
fact
introduce
some
innovation
in
the
government
;


but
that
change
which
seem
the
most
beneficial
in
one
direction
often


work
mischief
in
another
,
so
that
the
wise
ruler
be
perhaps
not
he


that
do
the
great
amount
of
good
,
but
he
that
be
cause
of
the


few
evil
.




the
2nd
.




from
Ponte
di
Po
to
pianura
the
most
convenient
way
be
by
water
;
but
the


river
Piana
be
greatly
swollen
by
the
late
rain
,
my
friend
,
who


seem
well
-
acquaint
with
the
country
,
propose
drive
thither
:
a


suggestion
I
readily
accept
,
as
it
give
I
a
good
opportunity
to
study


the
road
and
farm
of
the
duchy
.




cross
the
Piana
,
drive
near
four
hour
over
horrible
road
across


waste
land
,
thinly
woode
,
without
house
or
cultivation
.
on
my


express
surprise
that
the
territory
of
so
enlighten
a
prince
would


lie
thus
neglect
,
the
abate
say
this
land
be
a
fief
of
the
see
of


Pianura
,
and
that
the
Duke
be
desirous
of
annex
it
to
the
duchy
.
I


ask
if
it
be
true
that
his
Highness
have
give
his
people
a


constitution
model
on
that
of
the
Duke
of
Tuscany
.
he
say
he
have


hear
the
report
;
but
that
for
his
part
he
must
deplore
any
measure


tend
to
debar
the
clergy
from
the
possession
of
land
.
see
my


surprise
,
he
explain
that
,
in
Italy
at
least
,
the
religious
order


be
far
well
landlord
than
the
great
noble
or
the
petty
sovereign
,


who
,
be
for
the
most
part
absent
from
their
estate
,
leave
their


peasantry
to
be
pillage
by
rapacious
middleman
and
steward
:
an


argument
I
have
hear
advance
by
other
traveller
,
and
have
myself
have


frequent
occasion
to
corroborate
.




on
leave
the
Bishop
's
domain
,
remark
an
improvement
in
the
road
.


flat
land
,
well
irrigated
,
and
divide
as
usual
into
small
holding
.
the


pernicious
metayer
system
exist
everywhere
,
but
I
be
tell
the
Duke
be


oppose
to
it
,
though
it
be
uphold
not
only
by
the
land
class
,
but
by


the
numerous
economist
that
write
on
agriculture
from
their
closet
,


but
would
doubtless
be
sorely
puzzle
to
distinguish
a
beet
-
root
from
a


turnip
.




the
3rd
.




set
out
early
to
visit
Pianura
.
the
city
clean
and
well
-
keep
.
the
Duke


have
introduce
street
-
lamp
,
such
as
be
use
in
Turin
,
and
the
pavement


be
remarkably
fair
and
even
.
few
beggar
be
to
be
see
and
the
people


have
a
thriving
look
.
visit
the
Cathedral
and
Baptistery
,
in
the


gothic
style
,
more
curious
than
beautiful
;
also
the
Duke
's
picture


gallery
.




learn
that
the
duchess
be
to
ride
out
in
the
afternoon
,
have
the


curiosity
to
walk
abroad
to
see
she
.
a
good
view
of
she
as
she
leave
the


palace
.
though
no
long
in
her
first
youth
she
be
one
of
the
handsome


woman
I
have
see
.

here
I
learn
some
particular
of
the
Duke
's
attempt


reform
.
he
have
undertake
the
work
of
drain

vast
marsh
of


Pontesordo
,
to
the
west

the
city
,
notorious
for
its
mal'aria
;
have


renounce
the
monopoly
of

;
have
take
the
University
out


of

physical
science
,
formerly
prohibit
by
the
Church
;
have
spend
since


his
accession
near
200,000
liv
.
on
improve
the
road
throughout
the


duchy
,
and
be
now
engage
in
frame
a
constitution
which
shall
deprive


the
clergy
of
the
great
part
of
their
privilege
and
confirm
the


sovereign
be
right
to
annex
ecclesiastical
territory
for
the
benefit
of


the
people
.




in
spite
of
these
radical
measure
,
his
Highness
be
not
popular
with
the


masse
.
he
be
accuse
of
irreligion
by
the
monk
that
he
have
remove


from
the
University

and
his

drive
from
Piedmont
by
the
Inquisition
,
be
say
to


have
an
unholy
influence
over

.
I
be
tell
these
rumour
be


diligently
foment
by
the
late
Duke
's
minister
,
now
prior
of
the


dominican
monastery
,
a
man
of
bigoted
view
but
great
astuteness
.
the


truth
be
,
the
people
be
so
completely
under
the
influence
of
the
friar


that
a
word
be
enough
to
turn
they
against
their
true
benefactor
.




in
the
afternoon
I
be
set
out
to
visit
the
Bishop

gallery
when


Count
Trescorre
's
secretary

with
an
invitation
to
inspect


the
estate
of
the
Marchioness
of
Boscofolto
:
an
offer
I
readily


accept
--
for
what
be
the
masterpiece
of
Raphael
or
Cleomenes
to
the


sight
of
a
good
turnip
field
or
of
a
well
-
keep
dairy
?




I
have
hear
of
Boscofolto
,
which
be
give
by
the
late
Duke
to
his


mistress
,
as
one
of
the
most
productive
estate
of
the
duchy
;
but
great


be
my
disappointment
on
behold
it
.
fine
garden
there
be
,
to
be


sure
,
clipt
walk
,
leaden
statue
,
and
water
-
work
;
but
as
for
the


farm
,
all
be
dirt
,
neglect
,
disorder
.
spite
of
the
lady
's
wealth
,
all


be
let
out
alla
meta
,
and
farm
on
principle
that
would
disgrace
a


savage
.
the
spade
use
instead
of
the
plough
,
the
hedge
neglect
,


mole
-
cast
in
the
pasture
,
good
land
run
to
waste
,
the
peasant


starve
and
indebted
--
where
,
with
a
little
thrift
and
humanity
,
all
have


be
smile
plenty
!
learn
that
on
the
owner
's
death
this
great


property
revert
to
the
Barnabites
.




from
Boscofolto
to
the
church
of
the
Madonna
del
Monte
,
where
be
one
of


their
wonder
-
work
image
,
say
to
be
annually
visit
by
close
on


thirty
thousand
pilgrim
;
but
there
be
always
some
exaggeration
in
such


figure
.
a
fine
building
,
richly
adorn
,
and
hang
with
an
extraordinary


number
of
votive
offering
:
silver
arm
,
leg
,
heart
,
wax
image
,
and


painting
.
some
of
these
latter
be
clearly
the
work
of
village
artist
,


and
depict
the
miraculous
escape
of
the
peasantry
from
various


calamitie
,
and
the
preservation
of
their
crop
from
flood
,
drought
,


lightning
and
so
forth
.
these
poor
wretch
have
do
more
to
well


their
crop
by
spend
their
saving
in
good
ploughshare
and
harrow


than
by
hang
gew
-
gaw
on
a
wooden
idol
.




the
Rector
receive
we
civilly
and
show
we
the
treasury
,
full
of


jewel
and
costly
plate
,
and
the
building
where
the
pilgrim
be


lodge
.
learn
that
the
Giubileo
or
centenary
festival
of
the
Madonna


be
shortly
to
be
celebrate
with
great
pomp
.
the
poor
class
delight


in
these
ceremony
,
and
I
be
tell
this
be
to
surpass
all
previous
one
,


the
clergy
intend
to
work
on
the
superstition
of
the
people
and
thus


turn
they
against
the
new
charter
.
it
be
say
the
Duke
hope
to


counteract
these
design
by
offer
a
jewel
diadem
to
the
Virgin
;


but
this
will
no
doubt
do
he
a
bad
turn
with
the
esprit
libre
.
these


little
state
be
as
full
of
intrigue
as
a
foul
fruit
of
maggot
.




the
5th
.




to
dinner
at
Count
Trescorre
's
where
,
as
usual
,
I
be
the


plainest
-
dress
man
in
the
company
.
have
long
since
cease
to
be


concern
by
this
:
why
should
a
mere
english
farmer
compete
in
elegance


with
these
Monsignori
and
Illustrissimi
?
surprised
to
find
among
the


company
my
travel
-
companion
of
the
other
day
.
learn
that
he
be
the


abate
de
Crucis
,
a
personal
friend
of
the
Duke
's
.
he
greet
I


cordially
,
and
on
hear
my
name
,
say
that
he
be
acquaint
with
my


work
in
the
translation
of
Mons
.
Freville
,
and
now
understand
how
it


be
that
I
have
get
the
well
of
he
in
our
farming
disputation
on
the


way
hither
.




be
surprised
to
be
tell
by
Count
Trescorre
that
the
Duke
desire
I
to


wait
on
he
that
evening
.
though
in
general
not
ambitious
of
such


honour
,
yet
in
this
case
nothing
could
be
more
gratifying
.




the
6th
.




yesterday
evening
to
the
palace
,
where
his
Highness
receive
I
with


great
affability
.
he
be
in
his
private
apartment
,
with
the
abate
de


Crucis
and
several
other
learn
man
;
among
they
the
famous
abate


Crescenti
,
librarian
to
his
Highness
and
author
of
the
celebrated


chronicle
of
the
Italian
States
.
happy
indeed
be
the
prince
who


surround
himself
with
scholar
instead
of
courtier
!
yet
I
can
not
say


that
the
impression
his
Highness
produce
on
I
be
one
of
HAPPINESS
.


his
countenance
be
sad
,
almost
careworn
,
though
with
a
smile
of
engage


sweetness
;
his
manner
affable
without
condescension
,
and
open
without


familiarity
.
I
be
tell
he
be
oppress
by
the
care
of
his
station
;
and


from
a
certain
irresolution
of
voice
and
eye
,
that
bespeak
not
so
much


weakness
as
a
speculative
cast
of
mind
,
I
can
believe
he
less
fit


for
active
government
than
for
the
meditation
of
the
closet
.
he


appear
,
however
,
zealous
to
perform
his
duty
;
question
I
eagerly


about
my
impression
of
Italy
,
and
show
a
flattering
familiarity
with


my
work
,
and
a
desire
to
profit
by
what
he
be
pleased
to
call
my


exceptional
knowledge
of
agriculture
.
I
think
I
perceive
in
he
a


sincere
wish
to
study
the
welfare
of
his
people
;
but
be
disappoint
to


find
among
his
choose
associate
not
one
practical
farmer
or
economist
,


but
only
the
usual
closet
-
theorist
that
be
too
busy
plan
Utopias


to
think
of
plant
turnip
.




the
7th
.




visit
his
Highness
's
estate
at
Valsecca
.
here
he
have
convert
a


handsome
seat
into
a
school
of
agriculture
,
tear
down
an
immense


orangery
to
plant
mulberry
,
and
replace
costly
garden
and
statuary


by
well
-
till
field
:
a
good
example
to
his
wealthy
subject
.


unfortunately
his
bailiff
be
not
what
we
should
call
a
practical
farmer
;


and
many
acre
of
valuable
ground
be
give
up
to
a
botanic
garden
,


where
exotic
plant
be
grow
at
great
expense
,
and
rather
for
curiosity


than
use
:
a
common
error
of
noble
agriculturist
.




in
the
afternoon
with
the
abate
de
Crucis
to
the
Benedictine
monastery
,


a
league
beyond
the
city
.
here
I
see
the
good
farming
in
the
duchy
.
the


prior
receive
we
politely
and
converse
with
intelligence
on
drainage
,


crop
and
irrigation
.
I
urge
on
he
the
cultivation
of
turnip
and
he


appeared
strike
by
my
argument
.
the
tenant
on
this
great
estate


appear
well
house
and
feed
than
any
I
have
see
in
Pianura
.
the


monk
have
a
school
of
agriculture
,
less
pretentious
but
well
-
manage


than
the
Duke
's
.
some
of
they
study
physics
and
chemistry
,
and
there
be


good
chirurgeon
among
they
,
who
care
for
the
poor
without
pay
.
the
aged


and
infirm
peasant
be
house
in
a
neat
almshouse
,
and
the
sick
nurse


in
a
clean
well
-
build
lazaret
.
altogether
an
agreeable
picture
of
rural


prosperity
,
though
I
have
rather
it
have
be
the
result
of
FREE
LABOUR


than
of
MONASTIC
BOUNTY
.




the
8th
.




by
appointment
,
to
the
Duke
's
Egeria
.
this
lady
,
the
Signorina
F.V.
,


having
hear
that
I
be
in
Pianura
,
have
desire
the
Signor
Andreoni
to


bring
I
to
she
.




I
have
expect
a
female
of
the
loud
declamatory
type
:
something
of
the


Corilla
Olimpica
order
;
but
in
this
be
agreeably
disappointed
.
the


Signorina
V.
be
modestly
lodge
,
live
in
the
frugal
style
of
the
middle


class
,
and
refuse
to
accept
a
title
,
though
she
be
thus
debar
from


go
to
court
.
be
it
not
indiscreet
to
speculate
on
a
lady
's
age
,
I


should
put
hers
at
somewhat
above
thirty
.
though
without
the
Duchess
's


command
elegance
she
have
,
I
believe
,
more
beauty
of
a
quiet
sort
:
a


countenance
at
once
soft
and
animate
,
agreeably
tinge
with
melancholy
,


yet
light
up
by
the
incessant
play
of
thought
and
emotion
that
succeed


each
other
in
her
talk
.
well
conversation
I
never
hear
;
and
can


heartily
confirm
the
assurance
of
those
who
have
tell
I
that
the
lady


be
as
agreeable
in
discourse
as
learn
in
the
closet
.

it

that
the
free
and
volatile
manner
of


foreign
lady

to
blind
the

traveller

the
inferiority
of


their

on
enter
,
find
a
numerous
company
assemble
to
compliment
my
hostess


on
her
recent
appointment
as
doctor
of
the
University
.
this
be
an
honour


not
uncommonly
confer
in
Italy
,
where
female
learning
,
perhaps
from


its
rarity
,
be
highly
esteemed
;
but
I
be
tell
the
lady
thus


distinguished
seldom
speak
in
public
,
though
their
degree
entitle
they


to
a
chair
in
the
University
.
in
the
Signorina
V.
's
society
I
find
the


most
advanced
reformer
of
the
duchy
:
among
other
Signor
Gamba
,
the


famous
pamphleteer
,
author
of
a
remarkable
treatise
on
taxation
,
which


have
nearly
cost
he
his
liberty
under
the
late
Duke
's
reign
.
he
be
a
man


of
extreme
view
and
sarcastic
tongue
,
with
an
irritability
of
manner


that
be
perhaps
the
result
of
bodily
infirmity
.
his
idea
,
I
be
tell
,


have
much
weight
with
the
fair
doctoress
;
and
in
the
lampoon
of
the
day


the
new
constitution
be
say
to
be
the
offspring
of
their
amour
,
and
to


have
inherit
its
father
's
deformity
.




the
company
presently
withdraw
,
my
hostess
press
I
to
remain
.
she


be
eager
for
news
from
France
,
speak
admiringly
of
the
new


constitution
,
and
recite
in
a
move
manner
an
Ode
of
her
own


composition
on
the
Fall
of
the
Bastille
.
though
live
so
retire
she


make
no
secret
of
her
connection
with
the
Duke
;
say
he
have
tell
she
of


his
conversation
with
I
,
and
ask
what
I
think
of
his
plan
for


drain
the
marsh
of
Pontesordo
.
on
my
attempt
to
reply
to
this
in


detail
,
I
see
that
,
like
some
of
the
most
accomplished
of
her
sex
,
she


be
impatient
of
minutiae
,
and
preferred
general
idea
to
particular


instance
;
but
when
the
talk
turn
on
the
right
of
the
people
I
be


strike
by
the
energy
and
justice
of
her
remark
,
and
by
a
tone
of


resolution
and
courage
that
make
I
to
say
to
myself
:
"
here
be
the
hand


that
rule
the
state
.
"




she
question
I
earnestly
about
the
state
of
affair
in
France
,
beg


I
to
lend
she
what
pamphlet
I
could
procure
,
and
while
make
no


secret
of
her
republican
sympathy
,
express
herself
with
a
moderation


not
always
find
in
her
sex
.
of
the
clergy
alone
she
appear


intolerant
:
a
fact
hardly
to
be
wonder
at
,
consider
the
persecution


to
which
she
and
her
father
have
be
subject
.
she
detain
I
near


two
hour
in
such
discourse
,
and
on
my
taking
leave
ask
with
some
show


of
feel
what
I
,
as
a
practical
economist
,
would
advise
the
Duke
to
do


for
the
benefit
of
his
people
;
to
which
I
reply
,
"
plant
turnip
,


madam
!
"
and
she
laugh
heartily
,
and
say
no
doubt
I
be
right
.
but
I


fear
all
the
head
here
be
too
full
of
fine
theory
to
condescend
to


such
simple
improvement
...






4.6
.




Fulvia
,
in
the
twilight
,
sit
await
the
Duke
.




the
room
in
which
she
sit
look
out
on
a
stone
-
flag
cloister


enclose
a
plot
of
ground
plant
with
yew
;
and
at
the
farther
end
of


this
cloister
a
door
communicate
by
a
cover
way
with
the
ducal


garden
.
the
house
have
form
a
part
of
the
convent
of
the
Perpetual


adoration
,
which
have
be
sell
by
the
nun
when
they
move
to
the
new


building
the
late
Duke
have
give
they
.
a
portion
have
be
tear
down
to


make
way
for
the
Marquess
of
Cerveno
's
palace
,
and
in
the
remain


fragment
,
a
low
building
wedge
between
high
wall
,
Fulvia
have
find
a


lodge
.
her
whole
dwelling
consist
of
the
Abbess
's
parlour
,
in
which


she
now
sit
,
and
the
two
or
three
adjoining
cell
.
the
tall
press
in


the
parlour
have
be
fill
with
her
father
's
book
,
and
surmount
by


his
globe
and
other
scientific
instrument
.
but
for
this
the
apartment


remain
as
unadorned
as
in
her
predecessor
's
day
;
and
Fulvia
,
in
she


austere
black
gown
,
with
a
lawn
kerchief
fold
over
her
breast
,
and
the


unpowdered
hair
draw
back
from
her
pale
face
,
might
herself
have
pass


for
the
head
of
a
religious
community
.




she
cultivate
with
almost
morbid
care
this
severity
of
dress
and


surrounding
.
there
be
moment
when
she
could
hardly
tolerate
the
pale


autumnal
beauty
which
her
glass
reflect
,
when
even
this
phantom
of


youth
and
radiance
become
a
stumble
-
block
to
her
spiritual
pride
.
she


be
not
ashamed
of
be
the
Duke
of
Pianura
's
mistress
;
but
she
have
a


horror
of
be
think
like
the
mistress
of
other
prince
.
she


loathe
all
that
the
position
represent
in
man
's
mind
;
she
have


refuse
all
that
,
accord
to
the
convention
of
the
day
,
it
entitle


she
to
claim
:
wealth
,
patronage
,
and
the
rank
and
estate
which
it
be


customary
for
the
sovereign
to
confer
.
she
have
take
nothing
from
Odo


but
his
love
,
and
the
little
house
in
which
he
have
lodge
she
.




three
year
have
pass
since
Fulvia
's
flight
to
Pianura
.
from
the
moment


when
she
and
Odo
have
stand
face
to
face
again
,
it
have
be
clear
to
he


that
he
could
never
give
she
up
,
to
she
that
she
could
never
leave
he
.


Fate
seem
to
have
throw
they
together
in
derision
of
their
long


struggle
,
and
both
feel
that
lassitude
of
the
will
which
be
the
reaction


from
vain
endeavour
.
the
discovery
that
he
need
she
,
that
the
task
for


which
he
have
give
she
up
could
after
all
not
be
accomplish
without


she
,
serve
to
overcome
her
last
resistance
.
if
the
end
for
which
both


strove
could
well
be
attain
together
--
if
he
need
the
aid
of
she


unfaltere
faith
as
much
as
she
need
that
of
his
wealth
and


power
--
why
should
any
personal
scruple
stand
between
they
?
why
should


she
who
have
give
all
else
to
the
cause
--
ease
,
fortune
,
safety
,
and
even


the
happiness
that
lie
in
her
hand
--
hesitate
to
make
the
final
sacrifice


of
a
private
ideal
?
accord
to
the
standard
of
her
day
there
be
no


dishonour
to
a
woman
in
be
the
mistress
of
a
man
whose
rank
forbid


his
marry
she
:
the
dishonour
lie
in
the
conduct
which
have
come
to
be


associate
with
such
relation
.
under
the
old
dispensation
the
influence


of
the
prince
's
mistress
have
stand
for
the
last
excess
of
moral
and


political
corruption
;
why
might
it
not
,
under
the
new
law
,
come
to


represent
as
unlimited
a
power
for
good
?




so
love
,
the
casuist
,
argue
;
and
during
those
first
month
,
when


happiness
seem
at
last
its
own
justification
,
Fulvia
live
in
every


fibre
.
but
always
,
even
then
,
she
be
on
the
defensive
against
that


high
tribunal
which
her
own
conception
of
life
have
create
.
in
spite


of
herself
she
be
a
child
of
the
new
era
,
of
the
universal
reaction


against
the
falseness
and
egotism
of
the
old
social
code
.
a
standard
of


conduct
regulate
by
the
need
of
the
race
rather
than
by
individual


passion
,
a
conception
of
each
existence
as
a
link
in
the
great
chain
of


human
endeavour
,
have
slowly
shape
itself
out
of
the
wild
theory
and


vague
"
code
"
of
the
eighteenth
-
century
moralist
;
and
with
this
sense


of
the
sacramental
nature
of
human
tie
,
come
a
renew
reverence
for


moral
and
physical
purity
.




Fulvia
be
of
those
who
require
that
their
life
shall
be
an
affirmation


of
themselves
;
and
the
lack
of
inner
harmony
drive
she
to
seek
some


outward
expression
of
her
ideal
.
she
throw
herself
with
renew
passion


into
the
political
struggle
.
the
good
,
the
only
justification
of
she


power
,
be
to
use
it
boldly
,
openly
,
for
the
good
of
the
people
.
all
the


repress
force
of
her
nature
be
pour
into
this
single
channel
.
she


have
no
desire
to
conceal
her
situation
,
to
disguise
her
influence
over


odo
.
she
wish
it
rather
to
be
so
visible
a
factor
in
his
relation


with
his
people
that
she
should
come
to
be
regard
as
the
ultimate


pledge
of
his
good
faith
.
but
,
like
all
the
casuistical
virtue
,
this


position
have
the
rigidity
of
something
create
to
fit
a
special
case
;


and
the
result
be
a
fixity
of
attitude
,
which
spread
benumbingly
over


her
whole
nature
.
she
be
conscious
of
the
change
,
yet
dare
not


struggle
against
it
,
since
to
do
so
be
to
confess
the
weakness
of
she


case
.
she
have
choose
to
be
regard
as
a
symbol
rather
than
a
woman
,
and


there
be
moment
when
she
feel
as
isolate
from
life
as
some
marble


allegory
in
its
niche
above
the
market
-
place
.




it
be
the
desire
to
associate
herself
with
the
Duke
's
public
life
that


have
induce
she
,
after
much
hesitation
,
to
accept
the
degree
which
the


University
have
confer
on
she
.
she
have
share
eagerly
in
the
work
of


reconstruct
the
University
,
and
have
be
the
mean
of
draw
to


pianura
several
teacher
of
distinction
from
Padua
and
Pavia
.
it
be
she


dream
to
build
up
a
seat
of
learning
which
should
attract
student
from


all
part
of
Italy
;
and
though
many
young
man
of
good
family
have


withdraw
from
the
class
when
the
Barnabites
be
dispossess
,
she


be
confident
that
they
would
soon
be
replace
by
scholar
from
other


state
.
she
be
resolve
to
identify
herself
openly
with
the
educational


reform
which
seem
to
her
one
of
the
most
important
step
toward
civic


emancipation
;
and
she
have
therefore
accede
to
the
request
of
the


faculty
that
,
on
receive
her
degree
,
she
should
sustain
a
thesis


before
the
University
.
this
ceremony
be
to
take
place
a
few
day
hence
,


on
the
Duke
's
birthday
;
and
,
as
the
new
charter
be
to
be
proclaim
on


the
same
day
,
Fulvia
have
choose
as
the
subject
of
her
discourse
the


Constitution
recently
promulgate
in
France
.




she
push
aside
the
bundle
of
political
pamphlet
which
she
have
be


study
,
and
sat
look
out
at
the
strip
of
garden
beyond
the
arch


of
the
cloister
.
the
narrow
horizon
bound
by
convent
wall
symbolise


fitly
enough
the
life
she
have
choose
to
lead
:
a
life
of
artificial


restraint
and
renunciation
,
passive
,
conventual
almost
,
in
which
even


the
central
point
of
her
love
burn
,
now
,
with
a
calm
devotional
glow
.




the
door
in
the
cloister
open
and
the
Duke
cross
the
garden
.
he


walk
slowly
,
with
the
listless
step
she
have
observe
in
he
of
late
;


and
as
he
enter
she
see
that
he
look
pale
and
weary
.




"
you
have
be
at
work
again
,
"
she
say
.
"
a
cabinet
-
meeting
?
"




"
yes
,
"
he
answer
,
sink
into
the
Abbess
's
high
carved
chair
.




he
glance
musingly
about
the
dim
room
,
in
which
the
shadow
of
the


cloister
make
an
early
dusk
.
its
atmosphere
of
monastic
calm
,
of
which


the
significance
do
not
escape
he
,
fall
soothingly
on
his
spirit
.
it


simplify
his
relation
to
Fulvia
by
tacitly
restrict
it
within
the


bound
of
a
tranquil
tenderness
.
any
other
setting
would
have
seem


less
in
harmony
with
their
fate
.




well
,
perhaps
,
than
Fulvia
,
he
know
what
ail
they
both
.
happiness


have
come
to
they
,
but
it
have
come
too
late
;
it
have
come
tinge
with


disloyalty
to
their
early
ideal
;
it
have
come
when
delay
and


disillusionment
have
imperceptibly
weaken
the
spring
of
passion
.
for


it
be
the
sad
thing
about
sorrow
that
it
deaden
the
capacity
for


happiness
;
and
to
Fulvia
and
Odo
the
joy
they
have
renounce
have
return


with
an
exile
's
alien
face
.




see
that
he
remain
silent
,
she
rise
and
light
the
shaded
lamp
on
the


table
.
he
watch
she
as
she
move
across
the
room
.
her
step
have
lose


none
of
its
flow
grace
,
of
that
harmonious
impetus
which
year
ago


have
draw
his
boyish
fancy
in
its
wake
.
as
she
bend
above
the
lamp
,
the


circle
of
light
throw
her
face
into
relief
against
the
deepen
shadow


of
the
room
.
she
have
change
,
indeed
,
but
as
those
change
in
whom
the


spring
of
life
be
clear
and
abundant
:
it
be
a
development
rather
than


a
diminution
.
the
old
purity
of
outline
remain
;
and
deep
below
the


surface
,
but
still
visible
sometimes
to
his
lessening
insight
,
the
old


girlish
spirit
,
radiant
,
tender
and
impetuous
,
stir
for
a
moment
in


her
eye
.




the
lamplight
fall
on
the
pamphlet
she
have
push
aside
.
Odo
pick
one


up
.
"
what
be
these
?
"
he
ask
.




"
they
be

I
by
the
english
traveller
whom
Andreoni
bring


here
.
"




he
turn
a
few
page
.
"

he
say
.
"

"




"

old

she
exclaim
.
"

very


eye

"




Odo
lay
the
treatise
aside
.
"

the
next


page

he
ask
.

"

may
be

"




she
utter
a
quick
exclamation
;
then
her
face
harden
,
and
she
say
in


a
low
tone
:
"
De
Crucis
have
be
with
you
.
"




he
make
the
half
-
resigned
,
half
-
impatient
gesture
of
the
man
who
feel


himself
draw
into
a
familiar
argument
from
which
there
be
no
issue
.




"

leave
yesterday
for
Germany
.
"




"
he
be
here
too
long
!
"
she
say
,
with
an
uncontrollable
escape
of


bitterness
.




Odo
sigh
.
"
if
you
would
but
let
I
bring
he
to
you
,
you
would
see


that
his
influence
over
I
be
not
what
you
think
it
.
"




she
be
silent
a
moment
;
then
she
say
:
"
you
be
tired
tonight
.
let
we


not
talk
of
these
thing
.
"




"
as
you
please
,
"
he
answer
,
with
an
air
of
relief
;
and
she
rise
and


go
to
the
harpsichord
.




she
play
softly
,
with
a
veiled
touch
,
glide
from
one
crepuscular


melody
to
another
,
till
the
room
be
fill
with
drift
of
sound
that


seem
like
the
voice
of
its
own
shadow
.
there
have
be
time
when
he


could
have
yield
himself
to
this
languid
tide
of
music
,
let
it


loosen
the
tie
of
thought
till
he
float
out
into
the
soothe
dimness


of
sensation
;
but
now
the
present
hold
he
.
to
Fulvia
,
too
,
he
know
the


music
be
but
a
forced
interlude
,
a
mechanical
refuge
from
thought
.
she


have
deliberately
narrow
their
intercourse
to
one
central
idea
;
and
it


be
her
punishment
that
silence
have
come
to
be
merely
an
intensify


expression
of
this
idea
.




when
she
turn
to
Odo
she
see
the
same
consciousness
in
his
face
.
it


be
useless
for
they
to
talk
of
other
thing
.
with
a
pang
of
unreasone


regret
she
feel
that
she
have
become
to
he
the
embodiment
of
a
single


think
--
a
formula
,
rather
than
a
woman
.




"
tell
I
what
you
have
be
do
,
"
she
say
.




the
question
be
a
relief
.
at
once
he
begin
to
separation
of
his
work
.


all
his
thought
,
all
his
time
,
be
give
to
the
constitution
which
be


to
define
the
power
of
Church
and
state
.
the
difficulty
increase
as


the
work
advance
;
but
the
grave
difficulty
be
one
of
which
he
dare


not
tell
she
:
his
own
grow
distrust
of
the
idea
for
which
he


labour
.
he
be
too
keenly
aware
of
the
difference
in
their
mental


operation
.
with
Fulvia
,
idea
be
either
reject
or
at
once
convert


into
principle
;
with
himself
,
they
remained
store
in
the
mind
,
serve


rather
as
commentary
on
life
than
as
incentive
to
action
.
this


perpetual
accessibility
to
new
impression
be
a
quality
she
could
not


understand
,
or
could
conceive
of
only
as
a
weakness
.
her
own
mind
be


like
a
garden
in
which
nothing
be
ever
transplant
.
she
allow
for
no


intermediate
stage
between
error
and
dogma
,
for
no
shifting
of
the


bound
of
conviction
;
and
this
security
give
she
the
singleness
of


purpose
in
which
he
find
himself
more
and
more
deficient
.




Odo
remember
that
he
have
once
think
her
nearness
would
dispel
his


hesitation
.
at
first
it
have
be
so
;
but
gradually
the
contact
with
she


fix
enthusiasm
have
set
up
within
he
an
opposing
sense
of
the
claim


ignore
.
the
element
of
dogmatism
in
her
faith
show
the
discouraging


sameness
of
the
human
mind
.
he
perceive
that
to
a
spirit
like
Fulvia
's


it
might
become
possible
to
shed
blood
in
the
cause
of
tolerance
.




the
rapid
march
of
event
in
France
have
necessarily
produce
an
opposite


effect
on
mind
so
differently
constitute
.
to
Fulvia
the
year
have
be


a
year
of
victory
,
a
glorious
affirmation
of
her
political
creed
.
step


by
step
she
have
see
,
as
in
some
old
allegorical
painting
,
error
fly


before
the
shaft
of
truth
.
where
Odo
behold
a
conflagration
she
see
a


sunrise
;
and
all
that
be
bare
and
cold
in
her
own
life
be
warm
and


transfigure
by
that
ineffable
brightness
.




she
listen
patiently
while
he
enlarge
on
the
difficulty
of
the


case
.
the
constitution
be
frame
in
all
its
detail
,
but
with
its


completion
he
feel
more
than
ever
doubtful
of
the
wisdom
of
grant
it
.


he
would
have
welcome
any
postponement
that
do
not
seem
an
admission


of
fear
.
he
dread
the
inevitable
break
with
the
clergy
,
not
so
much


because
of
the
consequent
danger
to
his
own
authority
,
as
because
he
be


increasingly
conscious
of
the
newness
and
clumsiness
of
the
instrument


with
which
he
propose
to
replace
their
tried
and
complex
system
.
he


mention
to
Fulvia
the
rumour
of
popular
disaffection
;
but
she
sweep


they
aside
with
a
smile
.




"
the
people
mistrust
you
,
"
she
say
.
"
and
what
do
that
mean
?
that
you


have
give
your
enemy
time
to
work
on
their
credulity
.
the
long
you


delay
the
more
opposition
you
will
encounter
.
Father
Ignazio

rather

the
state
than

once
before

have
see
it
so
illumined
,

with
how
different
a
brightness
!
the


remembrance
stir
in

never

so
keenly

the
difference

their
practical
application

he
still
long
above
all

his
fellow

the
condition
of
such
service
be
not
what
he
have


dream
.
how
different
a
calling
it

be
in
Saint

day
,

forth

admonition

to
love


one

become
a
much
more
complex
business
,
one
that
tax


the
intelligence
as
much
as
the
heart
,

in
the
course
of
which


feeling
must
be
hold
in
firm
subjection
to
reason

he
be
discourage
by


Fulvia
's
inability
to
understand
the
change
.
Hers
be
the
missionary


spirit
;
and
he
could
not
but
reflect
how
much
happy
she
would
have


be
as
a
nun
in
a
charitable
order
,
a
unit
in
some
organised
system
of


beneficence
.




he
too
would
have
be
happy
to
serve
than
to
command
!
but
it
be
not


give
to
the
lover
of
the
Lady
Poverty
to
choose
their
special
rank
in


her
household
.
Don
Gervaso
's
word
come
back
to
he
with
deepen


significance
,
and
he
think
how
truly
the
old
chaplain
's
prayer
have


be
fulfil
.
honour
and
power
have
come
to
he
,
and
they
have
abase


he
to
the
dust
.
the
"
Humilitas
"
of
his
father
,
weave
,

and


paint
on

side

pursue
he
with
an
ironical
reminder
of
his


impotence
.




Fulvia
have
not
be
mistake
in
attribute
his
depression
of
spirit
to


de
Crucis
's
visit
.
it
be
the
first
time
that
de
Crucis
have
return
to


Pianura
since
the
new
Duke
's
accession
.
Odo
have
welcome
he
eagerly
,


have
again
press
he
to
remain
;
but
de
Crucis
be
on
his
way
to


Germany
,
bind
on
some
business
which
could
not
be
defer
.
odo
,
aware


of
the
renew
activity
of
the
Jesuits
,
suppose
that
this
business
be


connect
with
the
flight
of
the
french
refugee
,
many
of
whom
be
go


to
Coblentz
;
but
on
this
point
the
abate
be
silent
.
of
the
state
of


affair
in
France
he
speak
openly
and
despondently
.
the
immoderate
haste


with
which
the
reform
have
be
grant
fill
he
with
fear
for
the


future
.
Odo
know
that
Crescenti
share
these
fear
,
and
the
judgment
of


these
two
man
,
with
whom
he
differ
on
fundamental
principle
,
weigh


with
he
far
more
than
the
opinion
of
the
party
he
be
suppose
to


represent
.
but
he
be
in
the
case
of
many
great
sovereign
of
his
day
.


he
have
set
free
the
water
of
reform
,
and
the
frail
bark
of
his


authority
have
be
tear
from
its
mooring
and
sweep
headlong
into
the


central
current
.




the
next
morning
,
to
his
surprise
,
the
Duchess
send
one
of
her
gentleman


to
ask
an
audience
.
odo
at
once
reply
that
he
would
wait
on
she


Highness
;
and
a
few
moment
later
he
be
usher
into
his
wife
's
closet
.




she
have
just
leave
her
toilet
,

be
still
in
the
morning

during
that
prolonged
and
public
ceremonial
.
freshly
perfume
and


powder
,
her
eye
bright
,
her
lip
set
in
a
nervous
smile
,
she


curiously
recall
the
arrogant
child
who
have
snatch
her
spaniel
away


from
he
year
ago
in
that
same
room
.
and
be
she
not
that
child
,
after


all
?
have
she
ever
grow
beyond
the
imperious
instinct
of
her
youth
?
it


seem
to
he
now
that
he
have
judge
she
harshly
in
the
first
month
of


their
marriage
.
he
have
feel
a
momentary
impatience
when
he
have
try
to


force
her
roving
impulse
into
the
line
of
his
own
endeavour
:
it
be


easy
to
view
she
leniently
now
that
she
have
almost
pass
out
of
his


life
.




he
wonder
why
she
have
send
for
he
.
some
dispute
with
her
household
,


doubtless
;
a
quarrel
with
a
servant
,
even
--
or
perhaps
some
sordid


difficulty
with
her
creditor
.
but
she
begin
in
a
new
key
.




"

reply
with
a
smile

Maria
Clementina
make
an
impatient
gesture
;
then
her
face
soften
.


contradictory
emotion
flit
over
it
like
the
reflection
cast
by
a


hurry

she
come
close
to

away

herself

full

doubtless
quicken

in

the


scene
with
a
renew
appreciation
of
the
Church
's
unfaile
dramatic


instinct
.
at
first
he
see
in
the
spectacle
only
this
outer
and
symbolic


side
,
of
which
the
mere
sensuous
beauty
have
always
deeply
move
he
;
but


as
he
watch
the
effect
produce
on
the
great
throng
fill
the


aisle
,
he
begin
to
see
that
this
external
splendour
be
but
the
veil


before
the
sanctuary
,
and
to
realise
what
de
Crucis
mean
when
he
speak


of
the
deep
hold
of
the
Church
upon
the
people
.
every
colour
,
every


gesture
,
every
word
and
note
of
music
that
make
up
the
texture
of
the


gorgeous
ceremonial
might
indeed
seem
part
of
a
long
-
study
and


astutely
-
plan
effect
.
yet
each
have
its
root
in
some
instinct
of
the


heart
,
some
natural
development
of
the
inner
life
,
so
that
they
be
in


fact
not
the
cunningly
-
adjust
fragment
of
an
arbitrary
pattern
but


the
inseparable
fibre
of
a
live
organism
.
it
be
Odo
's
misfortune
to


see
too
far
ahead
on
the
road
along
which
his
destiny
be
urge
he
.
as


he
sit
there
,
face
to
face
with
the
people
he
be
try
to
lead
,
he


hear
above
the
music
of
the
mass
and
the
chant
of
the
kneeling
throng


an
echo
of
the
question
that
Don
Gervaso
have
once
put
to
him:--"If
you


take
Christ
from
the
people
,
what
have
you
to
give
they
instead
?
"




he
be
rouse
by
a
burst
of
silver
clarion
.
the
mass
be
over
,
and
the


Duke
and
Duchess
be
to
descend
from
their
tribune
and
venerate
the


holy
image
before
it
be
carry
through
the
church

Odo
rise
and
give
his
hand
to
his
wife
.
they
have
not
see
each
other
,


save
in
public
,
since
their
last
conversation
in
her
closet

the
Duchess


walk
with
set
lip
and
head
erect
,
keep
her
profile
turn
to
he


as
they
descend
the
step
and
advanced
to
the
choir
.
none
know
well


how
to
take
her
part
in
such
a
pageant
.
she
have
the
gift
of
draw
upon


herself
the
undivided
attention
of
any
assemblage
in
which
she
move
;


and
the
consciousness
of
this
power
lend
a
kind
of
olympian
buoyancy
to


her
gait
.
the
richness
of
her
dress
and
her
extravagant
display
of


jewel
seem
almost
a
challenge
to
the
sacred
image
blazing
like
a


rainbow
beneath
its
golden
canopy
;
and
Odo
smile
to
think
that
his


childish
fancy

once
compare
the
brilliant
being
at
his
side
to
the


humble
tinsel

deck

of
the

couple

full

clerestory

prismatic
splendour

rigid

flamboyancy

wonder

out

her
worshipper
.
the
Duke
and


duchess
pause
,

deeply
,
below
the
choir

then
they

the


step

before
the
shrine

they
do
so

crash

startled
devotee

that

from

's

as
on
the
day

with
far
different
effect

Enthusiasm

give

a
cold
curiosity

the
excitement

the


spectator

itself
in

morning

sight

ardour

out

it
die
again
without
kindle
another
in
the


uninflammable
mass
.
odo
could
not
tell
how
much
of
this
indifference
be


due
to
a
natural
reaction
from
the
emotion
of
the
morning
,
how
much
to


his
personal
unpopularity
,
how
much
to
the
ominous
impression
produce


by
the

himself

off
from

impassable
barrier

how

easy
it
would
be
to
face
a
rain

the
statuesque
erectness

ancestral
effigy

his

group
of
people
on
the
balcony

though
they
be
close
at


hand

he
see
they
in
a
blur
,
against
which
Fulvia

figure
suddenly


detach
itself

have
tell

that

through
the

faint
happiness

over

she
continue
to
gaze
out
steadily
upon
the
throng

the
balcony

involuntarily
his
glance

hers

he

that
she

herself
the
centre

attention

her
plain
,

quakerish
habit

the
tranquil
dignity
of
her
carriage
,
make
she
a


conspicuous
figure
among
the
animated
group
in
the
adjoining
window

and
Odo
,
with
the
acuteness
of
perception

a
public
life
develop

be
instantly
aware
that
her
name
be
on
every
lip

at
the

a

up
her
child

make


the

Odo

the
familiar
sign

with


malignant
rapidity
to
the
furth
limit

gleam

rapidly
,

the
Borromini
wing
on
his
left
,

skirt
the
outstanding
mass
of
the
old
building

behind
the
marble


buttress
of

chapel

cross
the
dense
obscurity
of
a
court


between
high
wall

find
a
door
under
an
archway
,

a
key
in
the


lock

a
spiral
stairway

court

his


way
up
the
stair

pause
a
moment
on
the
landing
to
listen
.
then
he


open
another
door
,
lift
a
heavy
hanging
of
tapestry
,

step


into
the
Duke

closet

stand
empty

a
lamp

low

off

into

chair

hand

4.9
.




it
be
the
eve
of
the
Duke
's
birthday
.
a
cabinet
council
have
be
call


in
the
morning
,
and
his
Highness
's
minister
have
submit
to
he
the


revise
draft
of
the
constitution
which
be
to
be
proclaim
on
the


morrow
.




throughout
the
conference
,
which
be
brief
and
formal
,
Odo
have
be


conscious
of
a
subtle
change
in
the
ministerial
atmosphere
.
instead
of


the
current
of
resistance
against
which
he
have
grow
use
to
force
his


way
,
he
become
aware
of
a
tacit
yield
to
his
will
.
Trescorre
have


apparently
withdraw
his
opposition
to
the
charter
,
and
the
other


minister
have
follow
suit
.
to
Odo
's
overwrought
imagination
there
be


something
ominous
in
the
change
.
he
have
count
on
the
goad
of


opposition
to
fight
off
the
fatal
languor
which
he
have
learn
to
expect


at
such
crisis
.
now
that
he
find
there
be
to
be
no
struggle
he


understand
how
largely
his
zeal
have
of
late
depend
on
such
factitious


incentive
.
he
feel
an
irrational
longing
to
throw
himself
on
the
other


side
of
the
conflict
,
to
tear
in
bit
the
paper
await
his
signature
,


and
disown
the
policy
which
have
dictate
it
.
but
the
tide
of


acquiescence
on
which
he
be
afloat
be
no
stagnant
back
-
water
of


indifference
,
but
the
glassy
reach
just
above
the
fall
of
a
river
.
the


current
be
as
swift
as
it
be
smooth
,
and
he
feel
himself
hurry


forward
to
an
end
he
could
no
long
escape
.
he
take
the
pen
which


Trescorre
hand
he
,
and
sign
the
constitution
.




the
meeting
over
,
he
summon
Gamba
.
he
feel
the
need
of
such


encouragement
as
the
hunchback
alone
could
give
.
Fulvia
's
enthusiasm


be
too
unreal
,
too
abstract
.
she
live
in
a
region
of
ideal
,
whence


ugly
fact
be
sweep
out
by
some
process
of
mental
housewifery
which


keep
her
world
perpetually
smile
and
immaculate
.
gamba
at
least
feed


his
conviction
on
fact
.
if
his
outlook
be
narrow
it
be
direct
:
no


roseate
medium
of
fancy
be
interpose
between
his
vision
and
the
truth
.




he
stand
listen
thoughtfully
while
Odo
pour
forth
his
doubt
.




"
your
highness
may
well
hesitate
,
"
he
say
at
last
.
"
there
be
always


more
good
reason
against
a
new
state
of
thing
than
for
it
.
I
be
not


surprise
that
Count
Trescorre
appear
to
have
withdraw
his
opposition
.


I
believe
he
now
honestly
wish
your
Highness
to
proclaim
the


constitution
.
"




Odo
look
up
in
surprise
.
"
you
do
not
mean
that
he
have
come
to
believe


in
it
?
"




Gamba
smile
.
"
probably
not
in
your
Highness
's
sense
;
but
he
may
have


find
a
use
of
his
own
for
it
.
"




"
what
do
you
mean
?

Odo
ask
.




"

not
believe
it
will
benefit
the
state

may
think
it
will


injure
your
Highness
.
"




"
Ah--
"
say
the
Duke
slowly
.




there
be
a
pause
,
during
which
he
be
possess
by
the
same
shudder


reluctance
to
fix
his
mind
on
the
fact
before
he
as
when
he
have


question
the
hunchback
about
Momola

death

he
long

cast
the


whole
business
aside

be
up

away
from

breath

afternoon

constitution
have
be
proclaim
,
with
much
firing
of
cannon
and
display


of
official
firework
;
but
even
these
great
news
,
and
their
attendant


manifestation
,
have
fail
to
enliven
the
populace
,
who
,
instead
of


fill
the
street
with
their
usual
stir
,
hang
mass
at
certain


point
,
as
though
curiously

on
event

there
be
few

more


ominous

that
of

crowd

observe
itself
,
watch
in


inconscient
suspense
for
the
unknown
crisis
which
its
own
passion
have


engender
.




it
be
know
that
his
Highness

public
banquet
at
the
palace

to
proceed
in
state
to
the
University

thick


about
the
palace

in
the
street
betwixt
it

Signoria
.


here
the
square

close

dozen

horse
that
precede
he
.
the
small
escort
,
and


the
marked
absence
of
military
display
,
perhaps
disappoint
the


splendour

love
crowd
;

from
this
cause

another
,
scarce

up
to
the
row
of
armchair
beneath
the

room

his
Highness

excuse


himself
on
the
plea
of
indisposition

only
a
few


gentleman
-
in
-
waiting
accompany
the
Duke
;
but
in
the
brown
half
-
light


of
the
old
Gothic
hall
their
glitter
uniform
contrast
brilliantly


with
the
black
gown
of
the
student

the
sober
broadcloth
of
the


learn
profession
.
a
discreet
murmur
of
enthusiasm
rise
at
their


approach
,
mount
almost
to
a
cheer
as
the
Duke
bow
before
take
his


seat
;
for
the
audience
represent
the
class
most
in
sympathy
with
his


policy
and
most
confident
of
its
success
.




the
meeting
of
the
faculty
be
hold
in
the
great
council
-
chamber
where


the
Rectors
of
the
old
free
city
have
assemble
;
and
such
a
setting
be


regard
as
peculiarly
appropriate
to
the
present
occasion
.
the
fact
be


allude
to
,
with
much
wealth
of
historical
and
mythological
analogy
,
by


the
President
,
who
open
the
ceremony
with
a
polysyllabic
Latin


oration
,
in
which
the
Duke
be
compare
to
Apollo
,
Hercules
and
Jason
,


as
well
as
to
the
flower
of
sublunary
hero
.




this
feat
of
rhetoric
over
,
the
candidate
be
call
on
to
advance
and


receive
their
degree
.
the
man
come
first
,
profiting
by
the
momentary


advantage
of
sex
,
but
clearly
aware
of
its
inability
to
confer
even


momentary
importance
in
the
eye
of
the
impatient
audience
.
a
pause


follow
,
and
then
Fulvia
appear
.
against
the
red
-
robe
faculty
at
the


back
of
the
dai
,
she
stand
tall
and
slend
in
her
black
cap
and
gown
.


the
high
window
of
paint
glass
shed
a
paleness
on
her
face
,
but
she


carriage
be
light
and
assure
as
she
advance
to
the
President
and


knelt
to
receive
her
degree
.
the
parchment
be
place
in
her
hand
,
the


fur
hood
lay
on
her
shoulder
;
then
,
after
another
flourish
of


rhetoric
,
she
be
lead
to
the
lectern
from
which
her
discourse
be
to
be


deliver
.
Odo
sit
just
below
she
,
and
as
she
take
her
place
their
eye


meet
for
an
instant
.
he
be
catch
up
in
the
serene
exaltation
of
she


look
,
as
though
she
soar
with
he
above
wind
and
cloud
to
a
region
of


unshadowed
calm
;
then
her
eye
fall
and
she
begin
to
speak
.




she
have
a
pretty
mastery
of
Latin
,
and
though
she
have
never
before


speak
in
public
,
her
poetical
recitation
,
and
the
early
habit
of


intercourse
with
her
father
's
friend
,
have
give
she
a
fair
measure
of


fluency
and
self
-
possession
.
these
quality
be
raise
to
eloquence
by


the
sweetness
of
her
voice
,
and
by
the
grave
beauty
which
make
the


academic
gown
seem
her
natural
wear
,
rather
than
a
travesty
of
learning
.


odo
at
first
have
some
difficulty
in
fix
his
attention
on
what
she


say
;
and
when
he
control
his
thought
she
be
in
the
height
of
she


panegyric
of
constitutional
liberty
.
she
have
begin
slowly
,
almost


coldly
;
but
now
her
theme
possess
she
.
one
by
one
she
evoke
the


familiar
formula
with
which
his
mind
have
once
reverberate
.
they
wake


no
echo
in
he
now
;
but
he
see
that
she
could
still
set
they
ring


through
the
sensibility
of
her
hearer
.
as
she
stand
there
,
a
slight


impassioned
figure
,
warm
to
her
high
argument
,
his
sense
of
irony
be


touch
by
the
incongruity
of
her
background
.
the
wall
behind
she
be


cover
by
an
ancient
fresco
,
fast
fading
under
its
touch
of
renew


gilding
,
and
represent
the
patron
scholar
of
the
mediaeval
world
:


the
theologian
,
law
-
giver
and
logician
under
whose
protection
the


free
city
have
place
its
bud
liberty
.
there
they
sit
,
rigid
and


sumptuous
on
their
gothic
throne
:
Origen
,
Zeno
,
David
,
Lycurgus
,


Aristotle
;
listen
in
a
kind
of
cataleptic
helplessness
to
a


confession
of
faith
that
scatter
their
doctrine
to
the
wind
.
as
he


look
and
listen
,
a
weary
sense
of
the
reiterance
of
thing
come
over


he
.
for
what
be
these
ancient
manipulator
of
idea
,
prestidigitator


of
a
vanished
world
of
thought
,
but
the
forbear
of
the
long
line
of


theorist
of
whom
Fulvia
be
the
last
inconscient
mouthpiece
?
the
new


game
be
still
play
with
the
old
counter
,
the
new
juggler
repeat


the
old
trick
;
and
the
very
word
now
pour
out
in
defence
of
the
new


cause
be
but
mercenary
scarred
in
the
service
of
its
enemy
.
for


generation
,
for
century
,
man
have
fight
on
;
cry
for
liberty
,


dream
it
be
win
,
wake
to
find
himself
the
slave
of
the
new
force


he
have
generate
,
burn
and
be
burn
for
the
same
belief
under


different
guise
,
call
his
instinct
idea
and
his
idea
revelation
;


destroy
,
rebuild
,
fall
,
rise
,
mend
broken
weapon
,


champion
extinct
illusion
,
mistake
his
failure
for
achievement


and
plant
his
flag
on
the
rampart
as
they
fall
.
and
as
the
vision
of


this
inveterate
conflict
rise
before
he
,
Odo
see
that
the
beauty
,
the


power
,
the
immortality
,
dwell
not
in
the
idea
but
in
the
struggle
for


it
.




his
resistance
yield
as
this
sense
steal
over
he
,
and
with
an
almost


physical
relief
he
feel
himself
draw
once
more
into
the
familiar


current
of
emotion
.
yes
,
it
be
well
after
all
to
be
one
of
that
great


unconquerable
army
,
though
,
like
the
Trojans
fight
for
a
phantom


Helen
,
they
might
be
do
battle
for
the
shadow
of
a
shade
;
well
to


march
in
their
rank
,
endure
with
they
,
fight
with
they
,
fall
with
they
,


than
to
miss
the
great
enveloping
sense
of
brotherhood
that
turn


defeat
to
victory
.




as
the
conviction
grow
in
he
,
Fulvia
's
word
regain
their
lose


significance
.
through
the
set
mask
of
language
the
live
thought


look
forth
,
old
indeed
as
the
world
,
but
renew
with
the
new
life
of


every
heart
that
bear
they
.
she
have
leave
the
abstract
and
drop
to


concrete
issue
:
to
the
gift
of
the
constitution
,
the
benefit
and


obligation
it
imply
,
the
new
relation
it
establish
between
ruler


and
subject
and
between
man
and
man
.
Odo
see
that
she
approach
the


question
without
flinch
.
no
trace
remain
of
the
tremble
woman
who


have
clung
to
he
the
night
before
.
her
old
conviction
repossess
she


and
she
soar
above
human
fear
.




so
engross
be
he
that
he
have
be
unaware
of
a
grow
murmur
of


sound
which
seem
to
be
force
its
way
from
without
through
the
wall


of
the
ancient
building
.
as
Fulvia
's
oration
near
its
end
the
murmur


rise
to
a
roar
.
startled
face
be
turn
toward
the
door
of
the


council
-
chamber
,
and
one
of
the
Duke
's
gentleman
leave
his
seat
and
make


his
way
through
the
audience
.
Odo
sit
motionless
,
his
eye
on
Fulvia
.
he


notice
that
her
face
pale
as
the
sound
reach
she
,
but
there
be
no


break
in
the
voice
with
which
she
utter
the
closing
word
of
she


peroration
.
as
she
end
,
the
noise
be
momentarily
drown
under
a
loud


burst
of
clapping
;
but
this
die
in
a
hush
of
apprehension
through
which


the
outer
tumult
become
more
ominously
audible
.
the
equerry
reentere


the
hall
with
a
disorder
countenance
.
he
hasten
to
the
Duke
and


address
he
urgently
.




"
your
highness
,
"
he
say
,
"
the
crowd
have
thicken
and
wear
an
ugly


look

have
climb
to

mass


themselves
in

the
handful
of


light
-
horse
who
have
escort
the
Duke
's
carriage
form
a
single
line
at


the
foot
of
the
step
,
so
that
the
approach
to
the
porch
be
still


clear
;
but
it
be
plain
that
the
crowd
,
with
its
next
movement
,
would


break
through
this
slender
barrier
and
hem
in
the
Duke
.




at
Odo
's
appearance
the
shouting
have
cease
and
every
eye
be
turn
on


he
.
he
stand
there
,
a
brilliant
target
,
in
his
laced
coat
of


peach
-
colour
velvet
,
his
breast
cover
with
order
,
a
hand
on
his


jewel
sword
-
hilt
.
for
a
moment
sovereign
and
subject
measure
each


other
;
and
in
that
moment
Odo
drank
his
deep
draught
of
life
.
he
be


not
think
now
of
the
constitution
or
its
opponent
.
his
present


business
be
to
get
down
the
step
and
into
the
carriage
,
return
to


the
palace
as
openly
as
he
have
come
.
he
be
conscious
of
neither
pity


nor
hatre
for
the
throng
in
his
path
.
for
the
moment
he
regard
they


merely
as
a
natural
force
,
to
be
fight
against
like
storm
or
flood
.
his


clear
sensation
be
one
of
relief
at
have
at
last
some
material


obstacle
to
spend
his
strength
against
,
instead
of
the
impalpable
power


which
have
so
long
beset
he
.
he
feel
,
too
,
a
boyish
satisfaction
at
his


own
steadiness
of
pulse
and
eye
,
at
the
absence
of
that
fatal
inertia


which
he
have
come
to
dread
.
so
clear
be
his
mental
horizon
that
it


embrace
not
only
the
present
crisis
,
but
a
dozen
incident
lead
up


to
it
.
he
remember
that
Trescorre
have
urge
he
to
take
a
large


escort
,
and
that
he
have
refuse
on
the
ground
that
any
military
display


might
imply
a
doubt
of
his
people
.
he
be
glad
now
that
he
have
do
so
.


he
would
have
hate
to
slink
to
his
carriage
behind
a
barrier
of
draw


sword
.
he
want
no
help
to
see
he
through
this
business
.
the
blood


sing
in
his
vein
at
the
thought
of
face
it
alone
.




the
silence

but
a
moment

then
an

he
lift

the
hush
that

the
barracks
to
summon
a
regiment

but
the


soldiery
be
no
long
need
.
the
blind
fury
of
the
mob
have
die
of


its

excess
.

by


the
soldier

presently
the
square

bare
as
a
storm

though
the
people

at
the


first
threat

solitude

their
ineffectual


effort
.
for
a
long
time
Odo
knelt
beside
she
,
unconscious
of
all
but


that
one
wild
moment
when
life
at
its
high
have
be
dash
into
the


gulf
of
death
.
Thought
have
cease
,
and
neither
rage
nor
grief
move
as


yet
across
the
chaos
of
his
being
.
all
his
life
be
in
his
eye
,
as
they


draw
up
,
drop
by
drop
,
the
precious
essence
of
her
loveliness
.
for
she


have
grow
,
beneath
the
simplify
hand
of
death
,
strangely
yet
most


humanly
beautiful
.
life
have
fall
from
she
like
the
husk
from
the


flower
,
and
she
wear
the
face
of
her
first
hope
.
the
transition
have


be
too
swift
for
any
backward
look
,
any
anguished
rending
of
the


fibre
,
and
he
feel
himself
,
not
detach
by
the
stroke
,
but
catch
up


with
she
into
some
great
calm
within
the
heart
of
change
.




he
know
not
how
he
find
himself
once
more
on
the
step
above
the


square
.
below
he
his
state
carriage
stand
in
the
same
place
,
flank
by


the
regiment
of
cavalry
.
down
the
narrow
street
he
see
the
brooding


cloud
of
people
,
and
the
sight
rouse
his
blood
.
they
be
his
enemy


now
--
he
feel
the
warm
hate
in
his
vein
.
they
be
his
enemy
,
and
he


would
face
they
openly
.
no
closed
chariot
guard
by
troop
--
he
would


not
have
so
much
as
a
pane
of
glass
between
himself
and
his
subject
.
he


descend
the
step
,
bid
the
colonel
of
the
regiment
dismount
,
and


spring
into
his
saddle
.
then
,
at
the
head
of
his
soldier
,
at
a


foot
-
pace
,
he
ride
back
through
the
pack
street
to
the
palace
.




in
the
palace
,
courtyard
and
vestibule
be
throng
with
courtier
and


lacquey
.
he
walk
through
they
with
his
head
high
,
the
cut
on
his
lip


like
the
mark
of
a
hot
iron
in
the
dead
whiteness
of
his
face
.
at
the


head
of
the
great
staircase
Maria
Clementina
wait
.
she
spring
forward
,


distraught
and
tremble
,
her
face
as
blanched
as
his
.




"
you
be
safe
--
you
be
safe
--
you
be
not
hurt--
"
she
stammer
,
catch


at
his
hand
.




a
shudder
seize
he
as
he
put
she
aside
.




"
odo
!
odo
!
"
she
cry
passionately
,
and
make
as
though
to
bar
his
way
.




he
give
she
a
blind
look
and
pass
on
down
the
long
gallery
to
his


closet
.






4.11
.




the
joy
of
reprisal
last
no
long
than
a
summer
storm
.
to
hurt
,
to


silence
,
to
destroy
,
be
too
easy
to
be
satisfy
.
the
passion
of
his


ancestor
burn
low
in
Odo
's
breast
:
though
he
feel
Bracciaforte
's
fury


in
his
vein
he
could
taste
no
answer
gratification
of
revenge
.
and


the
spirit
on
which
he
would
have
spend
his
hatred
be
not
here
or


there
,
as
an
embody
faction
,
but
everywhere
as
an
intangible


influence
.
the
acqua
tofana
of
his
enemy
have
pervade
every
fibre
of


the
state
.




the
mist
of
anguish
lift
,
he
see
himself
alone
among
ruin
.
for
a


moment
Fulvia
's
glow
faith
have
hang
between
he
and
a
final
vision
of


the
truth
;
and
as
his
conviction
weaken
he
have
replace
they
with
an


immense
pity
,
an
all
-
sufficing
hope
.
sentimental
verbiage
:
he
see
it


clearly
now
.
he
have
be
the
dupe
of
the
old
word
-
jugglery
which
be


forever
confound
fact
and
fancy
in
man
's
mind
.
for
it
be


essentially
an
age
of
word
:
the
world
be
drunk
with
they
,
as
it
have


once
be
drunk
with
action
;
and
the
former
be
the
deadly
drug
of
the


two
.
he
look
about
he
languidly
,
let
the
fact
of
life
filter


slowly
through
his
faculty
.
the
source
of
energy
be
so
benumb
in


he
that
he
feel
like
a
man
whom
long
disease
have
reduce
to


helplessness
and
who
must
laboriously
begin
his
bodily
education
again
.


hate
be
the
only
passion
which
survive
,
and
that
be
but
a
deaf


intransitive
emotion
coil
in
his
nature
's
depth
.




Sickness
at
last
bring
its
obliteration
.
he
sink
into
gulfs
of


weakness
and
oblivion
,
and
when
the
rise
of
the
tide
float
he
back
to


life
,
it
be
to
a
life
as
faint
and
colourless
as
infancy
.
colourless


too
be
the
boundary
on
which
he
look
out
:
the
narrow
enclosure
of


white
wall
,
open
on
a
slit
of
pale
spring
landscape
.
his
hand
lay


before
he
,
white
and
helpless
on
the
white
coverlet
of
his
bed
.
he


raise
his
eye
and
see
de
Crucis
at
his
side
.
then
he
begin
to


remember
.
there
have
be
precede
interval
of
consciousness
,
and
in


one
of
they
,
in
answer
perhaps
to
some
vaguely
-
uttered
wish
for
light


and
air
,
he
have
be
carry
out
of
the
palace
and
the
city
to
the


Benedictine
monastery
on
its
woode
knoll
beyond
the
Piana
.
then
the


veil
have
drop
again
,
and
his
spirit
have
wander
in
a
dim
place
of


shade
.
there
be
a
faint
sweetness
in
come
back
at
last
to
familiar


sight
and
sound
.
they
no
long
hurt
like
pressure
on
an
aching
nerve
:


they
seem
rather
,
now
,
the
touch
of
a
reassuring
hand
.




as
the
contact
with
life
become
close
and
more
sustained
he
begin
to


watch
himself
curiously
,
wonder
what
instinct
and
habit
of
thought


would
survive
his
long
mental
death
.
it
be
with
a
bitter
,
almost


pitiable
disappointment
that
he
find
the
old
man
grow
again
in
he
.


life
,
with
a
mocking
hand
,
bring
he
the
cast
-
off
vesture
of
his
past
,


and
he
feel
himself
gradually
compress
again
into
the
old
passion
and


prejudice
.
yet
he
wear
they
with
a
difference
--
they
be
a
cramp


garment
rather
than
a
living
sheath
.
he
have
bring
back
from
his
lonely


voyaging
a
sense
of
estrangement
deeply
than
any
surface
-
affinity
with


thing
.




as
his
physical
strength
return
,
and
he
be
able
to
leave
his
room
and


walk
through
the
long
corridor
to
the
outer
air
,
he
feel
the
old
spell


which
the
life
of
Monte
Cassino
have
cast
on
he
.
the
quiet
garden
,
with


its
clump
of
box
and
lavender
between
path
converge
to
the
statue
of


Saint
Benedict
;
the
cloister
pave
with
the
monk
'
nameless
grave
;
the


trace
of
devotional
painting
leave
here
and
there
on
the
weather
-
beat


wall
,
like
fragment
of
prayer
in
a
world
-
wear
mind
:
these
form
a


circle
of
tranquillising
influence
in
which
he
could
gradually


reacquire
the
habit
of
living
.




he
have
never
deceive
himself
as
to
the
cause
of
the
riot
.
he
know
from


Gamba
and
Andreoni
that
the
liberal
and
the
court
,
for
once
work
in


unison
,
have
provoke
the
blind
outburst
of
fanaticism
which
a
rasher


judgment
might
have
ascribe
to
the
clergy
.
the
Dominicans
,
bigote
and


eager
for
power
,
have
be
ready
enough
to
serve
such
an
end
,
and
some
of


the
beg
order
have
furnish
the
necessary
point
of
contact
with


the
people
;
but
the
movement
be
at
bottom
purely
political
,
and


represent
the
resistance
of
the
privileged
class
to
any
attack
on


their
inherit
right
.




as
such
,
he
could
no
long
regard
it
as
completely
unreasonable
.
he
be


begin
to
feel
the
social
and
political
significance
of
those
old


restriction
and
barrier
against
which
his
early
zeal
have
tilt
.


certainly
in
the
ideal
state
the
right
and
obligation
of
the
different


class
would
be
more
evenly
adjust
.
but
the
ideal
state
be
a
figment


of
the
brain
.
the
real
one
,
as
Crescenti
have
long
ago
point
out
,
be


the
gradual
and
heterogeneous
product
of
remote
social
condition
,


wherein
every
seeming
inconsistency
have
its
root
in
some
bygone
need
,


and
the
character
of
each
class
,
with
its
special
passion
,
ignorance


and
prejudice
,
be
the
sum
total
of
influence
so
ingrown
and


inveterate
that
they
have
become
a
law
of
thought
.
all
this
,
however
,


seem
rather
matter
for
philosophic
musing
than
for
definite
action
.


his
predominant
feeling
be
still
that
of
remoteness
from
the
immediate


issue
of
life
:
the
soeva
indignatio
have
be
succeed
by
a
great
calm
.




the
soothe
influence
of
the
monastic
life
have
doubtless
help
to


tide
he
over
the
stormy
passage
of
return
consciousness
.
his


sensitiveness
to
these
influence
incline
he
for
the
first
time
to


consider
they
analytically
.
Hitherto
he
have
regard
the
Church
as
a


skilfully
-
adjust
engine
,
the
product
of
human
passion
scientifically


combine
to
obtain
the
great
sum
of
tangible
result
.
now
he
see
that


he
have
never
penetrate
beneath
the
surface
.
for
the
Church
which


grasp
,
contrive
,
calculate
,
struggle
for
temporal
possession
and


use
material
weapon
against
spiritual
foe
--
this
outer
Church
be


nothing
more
than
the
body
,
which
,
like
any
other
animal
body
,
have
to


care
for
its
own
gross
need
,
nourish
,
clothe
,
defend
itself
,
fight
for


a
footing
among
the
material
resistance
of
life
--
while
the
soul
,
the


inner
animating
principle
,
might
dwell
aloof
from
all
these
thing
,
in
a


clear
medium
of
its
own
.




to
this
soul
of
the
Church
his
daily
life
now
bring
he
close
.
he
feel


it
in
the
order
beneficence
of
the
great
community
,
in
the
simplicity


of
its
external
life
and
the
richness
and
suavity
of
its
inner


relation
.
no
alliance
base
on
material
interest
,
no
love
of
power


work
toward
a
common
end
,
could
have
create
that
harmony
of
thought


and
act
which
be
reflect
in
every
face
about
he
.
each
of
these
man


seem
to
have
find
out
something
of
which
he
be
still
ignorant
.




what
it
be
,
de
Crucis
try
to
tell
he
as
they
pace
the
cloister


together
or
sit
in
the
warm
stillness
of
the
bud
garden
.
at
the


first
news
of
the
Duke
's
illness
the
Jesuit
have
hasten
to
Pianura
.
no


companionship
could
have
be
so
satisfying
to
Odo
.
De
Crucis
's
mental


attitude
toward
mankind
might
have
be
define
as
an
illuminate


charity
.
to
love
man
,
or
to
understand
they
,
be
not
as
unusual
as
to
do


both
together
;
and
it
be
the
intellectual
acuteness
of
his
friend
's


judgment
that
make
their
christian
amenity
so
seductive
to
Odo
.




"
the
high
claim
of
Christianity
,
"
the
Jesuit
say
one
morning
,
as


they
sit
on
a
worn
stone
bench
at
the
end
of
the
sunny
vine
-
walk
,
"
be


that
it
have
come
near
to
solve
the
problem
of
man
's
relation
to


each
other
than
any
system
invent
by
themselves
.
this
,
after
all
,
be


the
secret
principle
of
the
Church
's
vitality
.
she
give
a
spiritual


charter
of
equality
to
mankind
long
before
the
philosopher
think
of


give
they
a
material
one
.
if
,
all
the
while
,
she
have
be
fight
for


dominion
,
arrogate
to
herself
special
privilege
,
struggle
to


preserve
the
old
line
of
social
and
legal
demarcation
,
it
have
be


because
for
nigh
two
thousand
year
she
have
cherish
in
her
breast
the


one
free
city
of
the
spirit
,
because
to
guard
its
liberty
she
have
have


to
defend
and
strengthen
her
own
position
.
I
do
not
ask
you
to
consider


whence
come
this
insight
into
the
need
of
man
,
this
mysterious
power


over
he
;
I
ask
you
simply
to
confess
they
in
their
result
.
I
be
not
of


those
who
believe
that
God
permit
good
to
come
to
mankind
through
one


channel
only
,
and
I
doubt
not
that
now
and
in
time
past
the
thinker


whom
your
Highness
follow
have
do
much
to
raise
the
condition
of


their
fellow
;
but
I
would
have
you
observe
that
,
where
they
have
do


so
,
it
have
be
because
,
at
bottom
,
their
aim
coincide
with
the


church
's
.
the
deep
you
probe
into
her
secret
source
of
power
,
the


more
you
find
there
,
in
the
germ
if
you
will
,
but
still
potentially


active
,
all
those
humanise
energy
which
work
together
for
the


lifting
of
the
race
.
in
her
wisdom
and
her
patience
she
may
have
see


fit
to
withhold
their
expression
,
to
let
they
seek
another
outlet
;
but


they
be
there
,
store
in
her
consciousness
like
the
archetype
of
the


platonist
in
the
Universal
Mind
.
it
be
the
knowledge
of
this
,
the
sure


knowledge
of
it
,
which
create
the
atmosphere
of
serenity
that
you
feel


about
you
.
from
the
tilling
of
the
vineyard
,
or
the
dressing
of
a


beggar
's
sore
,
to
the
lofty
and
most
complicated
intellectual
labour


impose
on
he
,
each
brother
know
that
his
daily
task
be
part
of
a


great
scheme
of
action
,
work
ever
from
imperfection
to
perfection
,


from
human
incompleteness
to
the
divine
completion
.
this
sense
of
being
,


not
straw
on
a
blind
wind
of
chance
,
but
unit
in
an
ordered
force
,


give
to
the
humblest
Christian
an
individual
security
and
dignity
which


king
on
their
throne
might
envy
.




"
but
not
only
do
the
Church
anticipate
every
tendency
of
mankind
;


alone
of
all
power
she
know
how
to
control
and
direct
the
passion
she


excite
.
this
it
be
which
make
she
an
auxiliary
that
no
temporal
prince


can
well
despise
.
it
be
in
this
aspect
that
I
would
have
your
highness


consider
she
.
do
not
underrate
her
power
because
it
seem
base
on
the


commoner
instinct
rather
than
on
the
high
faculty
of
man
.
that
be


one
of
the
source
of
her
strength
.
she
can
support
her
claim
by
reason


and
argument
,
but
it
be
because
her
work
,
like
that
of
her
divine


Founder
,
lie
chiefly
among
those
who
can
neither
reason
nor
argue
,
that


she
choose
to
rest
her
appeal
on
the
simple
and
most
universal


emotion
.
as
,
in
our
town
,
the
street
be
light
mainly
by
the
taper


before
the
shrine
of
the
saint
,
so
the
way
of
life
would
be
dark
to


the
great
multitude
of
man
but
for
the
light
of
faith
burn
within


they
...
"




meanwhile
the
shuffling
of
destiny
have
bring
to
Trescorre
the
prize


for
which
he
wait
.
during
the
Duke
's
illness
he
have
be
appoint


regent
of
Pianura
,
and
his
sovereign
's
reluctance
to
take
up
the
care


of
government
have
now
leave
he
for
six
month
in
authority
.
the
day


after
the
proclaiming
of
the
constitution
Odo
have
withdraw
his


signature
from
it
,
on
the
ground
that
the
concession
it
contain
be


inopportune
.
the
function
of
government
go
on
again
in
the
old
way
.


the
old
abuse
persist
,
the
old
offence
be
condone
:
it
be
as


though
the
apathy
of
the
sovereign
have
be
communicate
to
his
people
.


century
of
submission
be
in
their
blood
,
and
for
two
generation


there
have
be
no
warfare
south
of
the
Alps
.




for
the
moment
man
's
mind
be
turn
to
the
great
event
go
forward


in
France
.
it
have
not
yet
occur
to
the
Italians
that
the
recoil
of


these
event
might
be
feel
among
themselves
.
they
be
simply
amused


spectator
,
rouse
at
last
to
the
significance
of
the
show
,
but
never


dream
that
they
might
soon
be
call
from
the
wing
to
the


footlight
.
to
de
Crucis
,
however
,
the
possibility
of
such
a
call
be


already
present
,
and
it
be
he
who
press
the
Duke
to
return
to
his


post
.
a
deep
reluctance
hold
Odo
back
.
he
would
have
like
to
linger
on


in
the
monastery
,
lead
the
tranquil
yet
busy
life
of
the
monk
,
and


try
to
read
the
baffling
riddle
of
its
completeness
.
at
that
moment


it
seem
to
he
of
vastly
more
importance
to
discover
the
exact
nature


of
the
soul
--
whether
it
be
in
fact
a
metaphysical
entity
,
as
these
man


believe
,
or
a
mere
secretion
of
the
brain
,
as
he
have
be
teach
to


think
--
than
to
go
back
and
govern
his
people
.
for
what
matter
the


rest
,
if
he
have
be
mistake
about
the
soul
?




with
a
start
he
realise
that
he
be
go
as
his
cousin
have
go
--
that


this
be
but
another
form
of
the
fatal
lethargy
that
hang
upon
his
race
.


an
effort
of
the
will
draw
he
back
to
Pianura
,
and
make
he
resume
the


semblance
of
authority
;
but
it
carry
he
no
far
.
Trescorre


ostensibly
become
prime
minister
,
and
in
reality
remain
the
head
of


the
state
.
the
Duke
be
present
at
the
cabinet
meeting
but
take
no
part


in
the
direction
of
affair
.
his
mind
be
lose
in
a
maze
of
metaphysical


speculation
;
and
even
these
serve
he
merely
as
some


cunningly
-
contrive
toy
with
which
to
trick
his
leisure
.




his
revocation
of
the
charter
have
necessarily
separate
he
from
Gamba


and
the
advanced
liberal
.
he
know
that
the
hunchback
,
ever
scornful
of


expediency
,
charge
he
with
disloyalty
to
the
people
;
but
such
charge


could
no
long
wound
.
the
event
follow
the
Duke
's
birthday
have


serve
to
crystallise
the
scheme
of
the
little
liberal
group
,
and
they


now
form
a
campaign
of
active
opposition
to
the
government
,
attack


it
by
mean
of
pamphlet
and
lampoon
,
and
by
such
public
speak
as


the
police
allow
.
the
new
professor
of
the
University
,
ardently
in


sympathy
with
the
constitutional
movement
,
use
their
lecture
as
mean


of
political
teaching
,
and
the
old
stronghold
of
dogma
become
the
centre


of
destructive
criticism
.
but
as
yet
these
idea
form
but
a
single


live
point
in
the
general
numbness
.




two
year
pass
in
this
way
.
north
of
the
Alps
,
all
Europe
be


convulse
,
while
Italy
be
still
but
a
sleeper
who
toss
in
his
sleep
.


in
the
two
Sicilies
,
the
arrogance
and
perfidy
of
the
government
give
a


few
martyr
to
the
cause
,
and
in
Bologna
there
be
a
brief
revolutionary


outbreak
;
but
for
the
most
part
the
italian
state
be
sink
into


inanition
.
Venice
,
by
recall
her
fleet
from

fall
the


dominion
of

twenty
year

basely

the
Pope
condemn
the

for
their
outrage
on


religion
,
and
his
subject
murder
Basseville
,
the
agent
of
the
new


republic
.
the
sympathy
and
impulse
of
the
various
state
be
as


contradictory
as
they
be
ineffectual
.




meanwhile
,
in
France
,
Europe
be
try
to
solve
at
a
stroke
the


problem
of
a
thousand
year
.
all
the
repressed
passion
which


civilisation
have
seek
,
however
imperfectly
,
to
curb
,
stalk
abroad


destructive
as
flood

fire
.
the
great
generation
of
the


encyclopaedist
have
pass
away
,
and
the
teaching
of
Rousseau
have


prevail
over
those
of
Montesquieu

Voltaire
.
the
sober
sense
of
the


economist
be
sweep
aside
by
the
sound
and
fury
of
the
demagogue
,
and


France
be
become
a
very
Babel
of
tongue
.
the
old
malady
of
word
have


sweep
over
the
world
like
a
pestilence

wing

the


wild
flight
of

leave
loosen
by
the
first
blast
of
the


storm
.
month
by
month
they
pour
across
the
Alps
in
ever
-
increase


number
,
bring
confused
contradictory
tale
of
anarchy
and
outrage
.


among
those
whom
chance
thus
carry
to
Pianura
be
certain
familiar


of
the
Duke
's
early
life
--
the
Count
Alfieri
and
his
royal
mistress
,


fly
from
Paris
,
and
arrive
breathless
with
the
tale
of
their


private
injury
.
to
the
poet
of
revolt
this
sudden
realisation
of
his


doctrine
seem
in
fact
a
purely
personal
outrage
.
it
be
as
though
a


man
write
an
epic
poem
on
an
earthquake
should
suddenly
find
himself


engulphe
.
to
Alfieri
the
downfall
of
the
french
monarchy
and
the


triumph
of
democratic
idea
mean
simply
that
his
french
investment
have


shrink
to
nothing
,
and
that
he
,
the
great
poet
of
the
age
,
have
be


oblige
,
at
an
immense
sacrifice
of
personal
dignity
,
to
plead
with
a


drunken
mob
for
leave
to
escape
from
Paris
.
to
the
wide
aspect
of
the


"
tragic
farce
,
"
as
he
call
it
,
his
eye
remain
obstinately
closed
.


he
view
the
whole
revolutionary
movement
as
a
conspiracy
against
his


comfort
,
and
boast
that
during
his
enforce
residence
in
France
he
have


not
so
much
as
exchange
a
word
with
one
of
the
"
french
slave
,


instigator
of
false
liberty
,
"
who
,
by
try
to
put
into
action
the


principle
teach
in
his
previous
work
,
have
so
grievously
interfere


with
the
composition
of
fresh
masterpiece
.




the
royal
pretension
of
the
Countess
of
Albany
--
pretention
affirm


rather
than
abate
as
the
tide
of
revolution
rise
--
make
it
impossible


that
she
should
be
receive
at
the
court
of
Pianura
;
but
the
Duke
find


a
mild
entertainment
in
Alfieri
's
company
.
the
poet
's
revulsion
of


feeling
seem
to
Odo
like
the
ironic
laughter
of
the
fate
.
his


thought
return
to
the
midnight
meeting
of
the
Honey
Bees
,
and
to
the


first
vision
of
that
face
which
man
have
lain
down
their
life
to
see
.


man
have
look
on
that
face
since
then
,
and
its
horror
be
reflect
in


their
own
.




other
fugitive
to
Pianura
bring
another
impression
of
event
--
that


comic

life
,

dramatic
artist

from
she


tragedy
.
these
be
the
Duke
's
old
friend
the
Marquis
de
Coeur
-
Volant
,


flee
from
his
chateau
as
the
peasant
put
the
torch
to
it
,
and


arrive
in
Pianura
destitute
,
gouty
and
middle
-
aged
,
but
imperturbable


and
epigrammatic
as
ever
.
with
he
come
his
Marquise
,
a
dark
-
eyed
lady
,


stout
to
unwieldiness
and
much
give
to
devotion
,
in
whom
it
be


whisper
(
though
he
introduce
she
as
the
daughter
of
a
Venetian


Senator
)
that
a
reminiscent
eye
might
still
detect
the
outline
of
the


gracefullest
Columbine
who
have
ever
flit
across
the
italian
stage
.


these
visitor
be
lodge
by
the
Duke
's
kindness
in
the
Palazzo


Cerveno
,
near
the
ducal
residence
;
and
though
the
lady
of
Pianura
be


inclined
to
look
askance
on
the
Marquise
's
genealogy
,
yet
his
Highness
's


condescension
,
and
her
own
edify
piety
,
have
soon
allay
these


scruple
,
and
the
salon
of
Madame
de
Coeur
-
Volant
become
the
rival
of


Madame
d'Albany
's
.




it
be
,
in
fact
,
the
more
entertaining
of
the
two
;
for
,
in
spite
of
his


lady
's
austere
view
,
the
Marquis
retain
that
gift
of
social


flexibility
that
be
already
become
the
tradition
of
a
happy
day
.
to


the
Marquis
,
indeed
,
the
revolution
be
execrable
not
so
much
because
of


the
hardship
it
inflict
,
as
because
it
be
the
forerunner
of
social


dissolution
--
the
breaking
-
up
of
the
regime
which
have
make
manner
the


high
morality
,
and
conversation
the
chief
end
of
man
.
he
could
have


live
gaily
on
a
crust
in
good
company
and
amid
smile
face
;
but
the


social
deficiency
of
Pianura
be
more
difficult
to
endure
than
any


material
privation
.
in
Italy
,
as
the
Marquis
have
more
than
once


remark
,
people
love
,
gamble
,
write
poetry
,
and
patronise
the
art
;


but
,
alas
,
they
do
not
converse
.
Coeur
-
Volant
could
not
conceal
from


his
highness
that
there
be
no
conversation
in
Pianura
;
but
he
do
his


good
to
fill
the
void
by
the
constant
exercise
of
his
own
gift
in
that


direction
,
and
to
Odo
at
least
his
talk
seem
as
good
as
it
be


copious
.
Misfortune
have
give
a
fine
savour
to
the
Marquis
's


philosophy
,
and
there
be
a
kind
of
heroic
grace
in
his
undisturbed


cultivation
of
the
amenity
.




while
the
Marquis
be
struggle
to
preserve
the
conversational
art
,
and


Alfieri
planning
the
savage
revenge
of
the
Misogallo
,
the
course
of


affair
in
France
have
gain
a
wilder
impetus
.
the
abolition
of
the


nobility
,
the
flight
and
capture
of
the
King
,
his
enforce
declaration


of
war
against
Austria
,
the
massacre
of
Avignon
,
the
sack
of
the


tuilerie
--
such
event
seem
incredible
enough
till
the
next
have


crowd
they
out
of
mind
.
the
new
year
rise
in
blood
and
mount
to
a


bloody
noon
.
all
the
old
defence
be
fall
.
religion
,
monarchy
,


law
,
be
suck
down
into
the
whirlpool
of
liberated
passion
.
across


that
sanguinary
scene
pass
,
like
a
mocking
ghost
,
the
philosopher
'


vision
of
the
perfectibility
of
man
.
Man
be
free
at
last
--
free
than


his
would
-
be
liberator
have
ever
dream
of
make
he
--
and
he
use
his


freedom
like
a
beast
.
for
the
multitude
have
rise
--
that
multitude
which


no
man
could
number
,
which
even
the
demagogue
who
rant
in
its
name


have
never
seriously
reckon
with
--
that
dim
,
grovel


indistinguishable
mass
on
which
the
whole
social
structure
rest
.
it


be
as
though
the
very
soil
move
,
rise
in
mountain
or
yawn
in


chasm
about
the
foot
of
those
who
have
so
long
securely
batten
on
it
.


the
earth
shake
,
the
sun
and
moon
be
darken
,
and
the
people
,
the


terrible
unknown
people
,
have
put
in
the
sickle
to
the
harvest
.




Italy
rouse
herself
at
last
.
the
emissary
of
the
new
France
be


swarm
across
the
Alps
,
pervade
the
peninsula
as
the
Jesuits
have


once
pervade
Europe
;
and
in
the
mind
of
a
young
general
of
the


republican
army
vision
of
italian
conquest
be
already
form
.
in


pianura
the
revolutionary
agent
find
a
strong
republican
party
head


by
Gamba
and
his
friend
,
and
a
government
weaken
by
debt
and


dissension
.
the
air
be
thick
with
intrigue
.
the
little
army
could
no


long
be
count
on
,
and
a
prolong
bread
-
riot
have
drive
Trescorre


out
of
the
ministry
and
compel
the
Duke
to
appoint
Andreoni
in
his


place
.
behind
Andreoni
stand
Gamba
and
the
radical
.
there
could
be
no


doubt
which
way
the
fortune
of
the
duchy
tended
.
the
Duke
's
would
-
be


protector
,
Austria
and
the
Holy
See
,
be
too
busy
organise
the
hasty


coalition
of
the
power
to
come
to
his
aid
,
have
he
care
to
call
on


they
.
but
to
do
so
would
have
be
but
another
way
of
annihilation
.
to


preserve
the
individuality
of
his
state
,
or
to
merge
it
in
the
vision
of


a
United
Italy
,
seem
to
he
the
only
alternative
worth
fight
for
.


the
former
be
a
futile
dream
,
the
latter
seem
for
a
brief
moment


possible
.
Piedmont
,
ever
loyal
to
the
monarchical
principle
,
be
call


on
her
sister
state
to
arm
themselves
against
the
french
invasion
.
but


the
response
be
reluctant
and
uncertain
.
private
ambition
and
petty


jealousy
hamper
every
attempt
at
union
.
Austria
,
the
Bourbons
and


the
Holy
See
hold
the
italian
principality
in
a
network
of
conflict


interest
and
obligation
that
render
free
action
impossible
.
sadly


Victor
Amadeus
arm
himself
alone
against
the
enemy
.




under
such
condition
Odo
could
do
little
to
direct
the
course
of


event
.
they
have
pass
into
more
powerful
hand
than
his
.
but
he
could


at
least
declare
himself
for
or
against
the
mighty
impulse
which
be


behind
they
.
the
idea
he
have
strive
for
have
triumph
at
last
,
and
his


sure
hold
on
authority
be
to
share
openly
in
their
triumph
.
a


profound
horror
drag
he
back
.
the
new
principle
be
not
those
for


which
he
have
strive
.
the
goddess
of
the
new
worship
be
but
a
bloody


Maenad
who
have
borrow
the
attribute
of
freedom
.
he
could
not
bow
the


knee
in
such
a
charnel
-
house
.
tranquilly
,
resolutely
,
he
take
up
the


policy
of
repression
.
he
know
the
attempt
be
foredoom
to
failure
,
but


that
make
no
difference
now
:
he
be
simply
act
out
the
inevitable
.




the
last
act
come
with
unexpected
suddenness
.
the
Duke
wake
one
morning


to
find
the
citadel
in
the
possession
of
the
people
.
the
impregnable


stronghold
of
Bracciaforte
be
in
the
hand
of
the
serf
whose
father


have
toil
to
build
it
,
and
the
last
descendant
of
Bracciaforte
be


virtually
a
prisoner
in
his
palace
.
the
revolution
take
place
quietly
,


without
violence
or
bloodshed
.
Andreoni
wait
on
the
Duke
,
and
a


cabinet
-
council
be
summon
.
the
minister
affect
to
have
yield


reluctantly
to
popular
pressure
.
all
they
ask
be
a
constitution
and


the
assurance
that
no
resistance
would
be
offer
to
the
French
.




the
Duke
request
a
few
hour
for
deliberation
.
leave
alone
,
he
summon


the
Duchess
's
chamberlain
.
the
ducal
pair
no
long
meet
save
on


occasion
of
state
:
they
have
not
exchange
a
word
since
the
death
of


Fulvia
Vivaldi
.
Odo
send
word
to
her
Highness
that
he
could
no
long


answer
for
her
security
while
she
remain
in
the
duchy
,
and
that
he


beg
she
to
leave
immediately
for
Vienna
.
she
reply
that
she
be


oblige
for
his
warning
,
but
that
while
he
remain
in
Pianura
her
place


be
at
his
side
.
it
be
the
answer
he
have
expect
--
he
have
never
doubt


her
courage
--
but
it
be
essential
to
his
course
that
she
should
leave


the
duchy
without
delay
,
and
after
a
moment
's
reflection
he
write
a


letter
in
which
he
inform
she
that
he
must
insist
on
her
obedience
.
no


answer
be
return
,
but
he
learn
that
she
have
turn
white
,
and


tear
the
letter
in
shred
have
call
for
her
travel
-
carriage


within
the
hour
.
he
send
to
enquire
when
he
might
take
leave
of
she
,
but


she
excuse
herself
on
the
plea
of
indisposition
,
and
before
nightfall


he
hear
the
depart
rattle
of
her
wheel
.




he
immediately
summon
Andreoni
and
announce
his
unconditional
refusal


of
the
term
propose
to
he
.
he
would
not
give
a
constitution
or


promise
allegiance
to
the
French
.
the
minister
withdraw
,
and
Odo
be


leave
alone
.
he
have
dismiss
his
gentleman
,
and
as
he
sit
in
his
closet


a
sense
of
deathlike
isolation
come
over
he
.
never
have
the
palace


seem
so
silent
or
so
vast
.
he
have
not
a
friend
to
turn
to
.
De
Crucis


be
in
Germany
,
and
Trescorre
,
it
be
report
,
have
privately
attend


the
Duchess
in
her
flight
.
the
wave
of
destiny
seem
close
over
Odo
,


and
the
circumstance
of
his
past
rise
,
poignant
and
vivid
,
before
his


drown
sight
.




and
suddenly
,
in
that
moment
of
failure
and
abandonment
,
it
seem
to


he
again
that
life
be
worth
the
living
.
his
indifference
fall
from
he


like
a
garment
.
the
old
passion
of
action
awake
and
he
feel
a
new
warmth


in
his
breast
.
after
all
,
the
struggle
be
not
yet
over
:
though
Piedmont


have
call
in
vain
on
the
italian
state
,
an
italian
sword
might
still


be
draw
in
her
service
.
if
his
people
would
not
follow
he
against


France
he
could
still
march
against
her
alone
.
old
memory
hum
in


he
at
the
thought
.
he
recall
how
his
piedmontese
ancestor
have
go


forth
against
the
same
foe
,
and
the
stout
Donnaz
blood
begin
to
bubble


in
his
vein
.




a
knock
rouse
he
and
Gamba
enter
by
the
private
way
.
his
appearance


be
not
unexpected
to
Odo
,
and
serve
only
to
reinforce
his
new
-
find


energy
.
he
feel
that
the
issue
be
at
hand
.
as
he
expect
,
Gamba
have


be
send
to
put
before
he
more
forcibly
and
unceremoniously
the
veiled


threat
of
the
minister
.
but
the
hunchback
have
come
also
to
plead
with


his
master
in
his
own
name
,
and
in
the
name
of
the
idea
for
which
they


have
once
labour
together
.
he
could
not
believe
that
the
Duke
's


reaction
be
more
than
momentary
.
he
could
not
calculate
the
strength
of


the
old
association
which
,
now
that
the
tide
have
set
the
other
way
,


be
drag
Odo
back
to
the
belief
and
tradition
of
his
caste
.




the
Duke
listen
in
silence

himself
now

the

light
of
morning

a
fugitive


too
harmless

ahead

wood

Valsecca

some
obscure
instinct
lay
a
detain


hand
on
he
,
and
at
the
cross
-
road
he
bend
to
the
right
and
ride
across


the
marshland
to
the
old
manor

house
.




the
farmyard
lie
hush
and
desert
.
the
peasant
who
live
there
would


soon
be
afoot
;

for
the
moment
Odo
have
the
place
to
himself
.
he


tether
his
horse
to
a
gate
-
post
and
walk
across
the
rough


cobble
-
stone
to
the
chapel
.
its
floor
be
still
heap
with
farm
-
tool


and
dry
vegetable
,
and
in
the
dimness
a
heavy
veil
of
dust
seem


to
obscure
the
paint
wall
.
Odo
advance
,
pick
his
way
among
break


ploughshare
and
stack
of
maize
,
till
he
stand
near
the
old
marble


altar
,
with
its
sea
-
god
and
acanthus
volute
.
the
place
lay
its


tranquillising
hush
on
he
,
and
he
kneel
on
the
step
beneath
the
altar
.


something
stir
in
he
as
he
kneel
there
--
a
prayer
,
yet
not
a


prayer
--
a
reach
out
,
obscure
and
inarticulate
,
toward
all
that
have


survive
of
his
early
hope
and
faith
,
a
loosening
of
old
fount
of


pity
,
a
longing
to
be
somehow
,
somewhere
reunite
to
his
old
belief
in


life
.




how
long
he
kneel
he
know
not
;
but
when
he
look
up
the
chapel
be
full


of
a
pale
light
,
and
in
the
first
shaft
of
the
sunrise
the
face
of
Saint


Francis
shine
out
on
he
...
he
go
forth
into
the
daybreak
and
ride
away


toward
Piedmont
