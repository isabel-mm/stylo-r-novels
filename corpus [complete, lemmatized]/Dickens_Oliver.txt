TREATS
of
the
PLACE
where
OLIVER
TWIST
be
BORN
and
of
the


circumstances
attend
his
birth


among
other
public
building
in
a
certain
town
,
which
for
many
reason


it
will
be
prudent
to
refrain
from
mention
,
and
to
which
I
will


assign
no
fictitious
name
,
there
be
one
anciently
common
to
most
town
,


great
or
small
:
to
wit
,
a
workhouse
;
and
in
this
workhouse
be
bear
;
on


a
day
and
date
which
I
need
not
trouble
myself
to
repeat
,
inasmuch
as


it
can
be
of
no
possible
consequence
to
the
reader
,
in
this
stage
of


the
business
at
all
event
;
the
item
of
mortality
whose
name
be


prefix
to
the
head
of
this
chapter
.


for
a
long
time
after
it
be
usher
into
this
world
of
sorrow
and


trouble
,
by
the
parish
surgeon
,
it
remain
a
matter
of
considerable


doubt
whether
the
child
would
survive
to
bear
any
name
at
all
;
in
which


case
it
be
somewhat
more
than
probable
that
these
memoir
would
never


have
appear
;
or
,
if
they
have
,
that
be
comprise
within
a
couple
of


page
,
they
would
have
possess
the
inestimable
merit
of
be
the


most
concise
and
faithful
speciman
of
biography
,
extant
in
the


literature
of
any
age
or
country
.


although
I
be
not
disposed
to
maintain
that
the
be
bear
in
a


workhouse
,
be
in
itself
the
most
fortunate
and
enviable
circumstance


that
can
possibly
befall
a
human
being
,
I
do
mean
to
say
that
in
this


particular
instance
,
it
be
the
good
thing
for
Oliver
Twist
that
could


by
possibility
have
occur
.
the
fact
be
,
that
there
be
considerable


difficulty
in
induce
Oliver
to
take
upon
himself
the
office
of


respiration
,
-
a
troublesome
practice
,
but
one
which
custom
have
render


necessary
to
our
easy
existence
;
and
for
some
time
he
lie
gasp
on
a


little
flock
mattress
,
rather
unequally
poise
between
this
world
and


the
next
:
the
balance
be
decidedly
in
favour
of
the
latter
.
now
,


if
,
during
this
brief
period
,
Oliver
have
be
surround
by
careful


grandmother
,
anxious
aunt
,
experienced
nurse
,
and
doctor
of


profound
wisdom
,
he
would
most
inevitably
and
indubitably
have
be


kill
in
no
time
.
there
be
nobody
by
,
however
,
but
a
pauper
old


woman
,
who
be
render
rather
misty
by
an
unwonted
allowance
of
beer
;


and
a
parish
surgeon
who
do
such
matter
by
contract
;
Oliver
and


nature
fight
out
the
point
between
they
.
the
result
be
,
that
,
after


a
few
struggle
,
Oliver
breathe
,
sneeze
,
and
proceed
to
advertise


to
the
inmate
of
the
workhouse
the
fact
of
a
new
burden
having
be


impose
upon
the
parish
,
by
set
up
as
loud
a
cry
as
could


reasonably
have
be
expect
from
a
male
infant
who
have
not
be


possess
of
that
very
useful
appendage
,
a
voice
,
for
a
much
long


space
of
time
than
three
minute
and
a
quarter
.


as
Oliver
give
this
first
proof
of
the
free
and
proper
action
of
his


lung
,
the
patchwork
coverlet
which
be
carelessly
fling
over
the
iron


bedstead
,
rustle
;
the
pale
face
of
a
young
woman
be
raise
feebly


from
the
pillow
;
and
a
faint
voice
imperfectly
articulate
the
word
,


'
let
I
see
the
child
,
and
die
.
'


the
surgeon
have
be
sit
with
his
face
turn
towards
the
fire
:


give
the
palm
of
his
hand
a
warm
and
a
rub
alternately
.
as
the


young
woman
speak
,
he
rise
,
and
advance
to
the
bed
's
head
,
say
,
with


more
kindness
than
might
have
be
expect
of
he
:


'
oh
,
you
must
not
talk
about

yet
.
'


'
Lor
bless

interpose
the
nurse
,
hastily

in
her
pocket

green
glass
bottle
,
the
content
of
which


she

in
a
corner
with
evident
satisfaction

what
it

to

a
mother

consolatory
perspective

a
mother

prospect

its
due
effect

patient

her
head

stretch


out
her
hand
towards
the
child

surgeon
deposit
it
in
her
arm
.
she
imprint
her
cold
white


lip
passionately
on
its
forehead
;
pass
her
hand
over
her
face
;


gaze
wildly
round
;
shudder
;

back

the
parish


authority
inquire
with
dignity
of
the
workhouse
authority
,
whether


there
be
no
female

the
consolation

nourishment
of


which

stand
in
need

the
workhouse
authority
reply
with


humility
,
that
there
be
not
.
upon
this
,
the
parish
authority


magnanimously
and
humanely
resolve
,
that
Oliver
should
be
'
farmed
,
'


or
,
in
other
word
,
that
he
should
be
dispatch
to
a
branch
-
workhouse


some
three
mile
off
,
where
twenty

thirty
other
juvenile
offender


against
the
poor

,
roll
about
the
floor
all
day
,
without
the


inconvenience
of
too
much
food
or
too
much
clothing
,
under
the
parental


superintendence
of
an
elderly
female
,
who
receive
the
culprit
at
and


for
the
consideration
of
sevenpence

halfpenny
per
small
head
per
week
.


sevenpence
-
halfpenny
's
worth
per
week
be
a
good
round
diet
for
a
child
;


a
great
deal
may
be
get
for
sevenpence
-
halfpenny
,
quite
enough
to


overload
its
stomach
,
and
make
it
uncomfortable
.
the
elderly
female
be


a
woman
of
wisdom
and
experience
;
she
know
what
be
good
for
child
;


and
she
have
a
very
accurate
perception
of
what
be
good
for
herself
.


so
,
she
appropriate
the
great
part
of
the
weekly
stipend
to
her
own


use
,

consign
the
rise
parochial
generation
to
even
a
short


allowance
than
be
originally
provide
for
they
.
thereby
find
in


the
low
depth
a
deep
still
;
and
prove
herself
a
very
great


experimental
philosopher
.


everybody
know
the
story
of
another
experimental
philosopher
who
have
a


great
theory
about
a
horse
be
able
to
live
without
eat
,
and
who


demonstrate
it
so
well
,
that
he
have
get
his
own
horse
down
to
a
straw


a
day
,
and
would
unquestionably
have
render
he
a
very
spirited
and


rampacious
animal
on
nothing
at
all
,
if
he
have
not
die
,


four
-
and
-
twenty
hour
before
he
be
to
have
have
his
first
comfortable


bait
of
air
.
unfortunately
for
,
the
experimental
philosophy
of
the


female
to
whose
protect
care
Oliver
Twist
be
deliver
over
,
a


similar
result
usually
attend
the
operation
of
her
system
;
for
at


the
very
moment
when
the
child
have
contrive
to
exist
upon
the
small


possible
portion
of
the
weak
possible
food
,
it
do
perversely
happen


in
eight
and
a
half
case
out
of
ten
,
either
that
it
sicken
from
want


and
cold
,
or
fall
into
the
fire
from
neglect
,
or
get
half
-
smother
by


accident
;
in
any
one
of
which
case
,
the
miserable
little
be
be


usually
summon
into
another
world
,
and
there
gather
to
the
father


it
have
never
know
in
this
.


occasionally
,
when
there
be
some
more
than
usually
interesting
inquest


upon
a
parish
child
who
have
be
overlook
in
turn
up
a
bedstead

washing
-
though
the
latter
accident
be
very
scarce
,
anything


approach
to
a
washing
being
of
rare
occurrence
in
the
farm
-
the
jury


would
take
it
into
their
head
to
ask
troublesome
question
,
or
the


parishioner
would
rebelliously
affix
their
signature
to
a


remonstrance
.
but
these
impertinence
be
speedily
check
by
the


evidence
of
the
surgeon
,
and
the
testimony
of
the
beadle
;
the
former
of


whom
have
always
open
the
body
and
find
nothing
inside
 
which
be


very
probable
indeed
,
and
the
latter
of
whom
invariably
swear
whatever


the
parish
want
;
which
be
very
self
-
devotional
.
besides
,
the
board


make
periodical
pilgrimage
to
the
farm
,
and
always
send
the
beadle
the


day
before
,
to
say
they
be
go
.
the
child
be
neat
and
clean


to
behold
,
when
they
go
;
and
what
more
would
the
people
have
!


it
can
not
be
expect
that
this
system
of
farming
would
produce
any


very
extraordinary
or
luxuriant
crop
.

protection
of
the
power
of
wickedness

.
Mr.

sanguine
estimate

could
not
raise
they
within
full
five
pound
of
the

amount
;


and
,
in

when

Mr.
Gamfield
to
the
donkey
.


the
donkey
be
in
a
state
of
profound
abstraction
:
wonder
,
probably
,


whether
he
be
destine
to
be
regale
with
a

-
stalk
or
two

eye
;
and
,
run
after
he
,
bestow
a
blow


on
his
head
,
which
would
inevitably
have

,
he
give

wrench
,
by

not
his

by
these
mean
turn
he
round
.
he
then
give

another
blow
on
the


head
,
just
to

he
till
he

a
very
foolish
action

Oliver

,

quite
enough
water

as
Mr.

in
a
gentle
hint
,
that
if

either
particular
,
there

no
tell
what

Mr.

heart

for
half
an
hour
.

time

that

positively

either
in

,
or

,
for
the


young
man

be
grow
up
,
it
be
a
very
general
custom
to
send
he
to


sea
.
the
board
,
in
imitation
of
so
wise
and
salutary
an
example
,
take


counsel
together
on
the
expediency
of
shipping
off
Oliver
Twist
,
in


some
small
trading
vessel
bind
to
a
good
unhealthy
port

this


suggest
itself
as
the
very
good
thing
that
could
possibly
be
do


with
he
:
the
probability
being
,
that
the
skipper
would
flog
he
to


death
,
in
a
playful
mood
,
some
day
after

would
knock
his

out
with

more
manifold
the
advantage
of
the
step


appear
;
so
,
they
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
only
way
of


provide
for
Oliver
effectually
,
be
to
send
he
to

the
undertaker
in
a
tone

half
admit

half


dispute
the
probability

the
event

the
price

the


board

very
small

Mr.

.
'


'
so
be
the
coffin
,
'
reply
the
beadle
:
with
precisely
as
near
an


approach
to
a
laugh
as
a
great
official
ought
to
indulge
in
.


Mr.
Sowerberry
be
much
tickled
at
this
:
as
of
course
he
ought
to
be
;


and
laugh
a
long
time
without
cessation
.
'
well
,

,
Mr.

,
'


he
say
at
length
,
'
there
be
no
deny
that
,
since
the
new
system
of


feeding
have
come
in
,
the
coffin
be
something
narrow
and
more


shallow
than
they
use
to
be
;
but
we
must
have
some
profit

Mr.

.


well

'
of

,

the

if
I
do

get
a


profit
upon
this

I
make
it
up

Mr.

'
though
I
must
say
,
'
continue
the
undertaker
,
resume
the
current
of


observation
which
the
beadle
have
interrupt
:
'
though
I
must
say
,
Mr.


Bumble
,
that
I
have
to
contend
against
one
very
great
disadvantage
:


which
be
,
that
all
the
stout
people
go
off
the
quick
.
the
people


who
have
be
well
off
,

have
pay
rate
for
many
year
,
be
the


first
to
sink
when
they
come
into
the
house
;
and
let
I
tell
you
,
Mr.


Bumble
,
that
three
or
four
inch
over
one
's
calculation
make
a
great


hole
in
one
's
profit
:

when
one
have
a
family
to
provide
for
,


sir
.
'


as
Mr.
Sowerberry
say
this
,
with
the
become
indignation
of
an


ill
-
use
man
;
and
as
Mr.
Bumble
feel
that
it
rather
tend
to
convey
a


reflection
on
the
honour
of
the
parish
;
the
latter
gentleman
think
it


advisable
to
change
the
subject
.
Oliver
Twist
be
uppermost
in
his


mind

may
say
,
round
the
porochial
throat

Mr.
Sowerberry
,
liberal
term

'
as
Mr.

speak
,
he
raise
his


cane
to
the
bill
above
he
,

give
three
distinct
rap
upon
the
word

five

take
Mr.

by
the
gild

of
his
official
coat
;

that
be
just
the
very
thing
I
want

speak
to
you
about

dear
I
,
what
a
very
elegant
button

,
Mr.

!
I
never
notice
it
before
.
'


'
yes
,
I
think
it
rather
pretty
,
'
say
the
beadle
,
glance
proudly


downward
at
the
large
brass
button
which
embellish
his
coat
.
'
the


die
be
the
same
as

porochial
seal

good
Samaritan

the


sick
and
bruised
man

board
present
it
to
I
on
Newyear
's


morning
,
Mr.
Sowerberry
.
I
put
it
on
,
I
remember
,
for
the
first
time
,


to
attend
the
inquest
on
that
reduce
tradesman
,
who
die
in
a
doorway


at
midnight
.
'


'
I
recollect
,

the
undertaker

'
the
jury
bring
it
in

"
die
from


exposure

cold
,

,
"


do
n't
 
they
?
'


Mr.
Bumble
nod
.


'
and
they
make
it
a
special
verdict
,
I
think
,
'
say
the
undertaker
,
'
by


add
some
word
to
the
effect
,
that
if
the
relieve
officer
have
-
'


'
tush
!
Foolery
!
'
interpose
the
beadle
.
'
if
the
board
attend
to
all


the
nonsense
that
ignorant
juryman
talk
,
they
'd
have
enough
to
do
.
'


'
very
true
,
'

the
undertaker
;
'
they
would
indeed
.
'


'
jury
,
'
say
Mr.
Bumble
,
grasp
his
cane
tightly
,
as
be
his
wo
nt


when
work
into
a
passion
:
'
jury
be
ineddicate
,
vulgar
,
grovel


wretch
.
'


'
so
they
be
,
'
say
the
undertaker
.


'
they
have
n't
 
no
more
philosophy
nor
political
economy
about
'em
than


that
,
'
say
the
beadle
,
snap
his
finger
contemptuously
.


'
no
more
they
have
,
'
acquiesce
the
undertaker
.


'
I
despise
'em
,
'
say
the
beadle
,
grow
very
red
in
the
face
.


'
so
do
I
,
'
rejoin
the
undertaker
.


'
and
I
only
wish
we
'd
a
jury
of
the
independent
sort
,
in
the
house
for


a
week
or
two
,
'
say
the
beadle
;
'
the
rule
and
regulation
of
the


board
would
soon
bring
their
spirit
down
for
'em
.
'


'
let
'em
alone
for
that
,
'
reply
the
undertaker
.
so
say
,
he


smile
,
approvingly
:
to
calm
the
rise
wrath
of
the
indignant
parish


officer
.


Mr
Bumble
lift
off
his
cocked
hat
;
take
a
handkerchief
from
the


inside
of
the
crown
;
wipe
from
his
forehead
the
perspiration
which
his


rage
have
engender
;
fix
the
cocked
hat
on
again
;
and
,
turn
to
the


undertaker
,
say
in
a
calm
voice
:


'
well
;
what
about
the
boy
?
'


'
oh
!
'

the
undertaker
;
'
why
,
you
know
,
Mr.

,
I
pay
a
good


deal
towards
the
poor
's
rate
.

'
Hem
!
'

Mr.

.
'
well
?
'


'
well
,
'
reply
the
undertaker
,
'
I
be
think
that
if
I
pay
so
much


towards
'em
,
I
've
 
a
right
to
get
as
much
out
of
'em
as
I
can
,
Mr.


Bumble
;

so
-
I
think
I
'll
take
the
boy
myself

Mr.

grasp
the

a
phrase
which
mean
,
in
the
case
of
a
parish
apprentice
,
that


if
the
master
find
,
upon
a
short
trial
,
that
he
can
get
enough
work
out


of
a
boy
without
put
too
much
food
into
he
,
he
shall
have
he
for


a
term
of
year
,
to
do
what
he
like
with
.


when
little
Oliver
be
take
before
'
the
gentleman
'
that
evening
;
and


inform
that
he
be
to
go
,
that
night
,
as
general
house
-
lad
to
a


coffin
-
maker
's
;
and
that
if
he
complain
of
his
situation
,
or
ever


come
back
to
the
parish
again
,
he
would
be
send
to
sea
,
there
to
be


drown
,
or
knock
on
the
head
,
as
the
case
might
be
,
he
evince
so


little
emotion
,
that
they
by
common
consent
pronounce
he
a
harden


young
rascal
,
and
order
Mr.
Bumble
to
remove
he
forthwith
.


now
,
although
it
be
very
natural
that
the
board
,
of
all
people
in
the


world
,
should
feel
in
a
great
state
of
virtuous
astonishment
and
horror


at
the
small
token
of
want
of
feeling
on
the
part
of
anybody
,
they


be
rather
out
,
in
this
particular
instance
.
the
simple
fact
be
,


that
Oliver
,
instead
of
possess
too
little
feeling
,
possess
rather


too
much
;
and
be
in
a
fair
way
of
be
reduce
,
for
life
,
to
a
state


of
brutal
stupidity
and
sullenness
by
the
ill
usage
he
have
receive
.


he
hear
the
news
of
his
destination
,
in
perfect
silence
;
and
,
have


have
his
luggage
put
into
his
hand
-
which
be
not
very
difficult
to


carry
,
inasmuch
as
it
be
all
comprise
within
the
limit
of
a
brown


paper
parcel
,
about
half

square

three

deep

he
pull


his

over

once
more

himself
to

lead
away

for
some
time

draw
Oliver
along
,
without
notice

remark
;


for
the
beadle

his

very
erect
,
as
a

always
should

and
,
it
be
a
windy
day
,
little
Oliver
be
completely
enshroud
by


the
skirt
of
Mr.

open
,

to


great
advantage

flap
waistcoat

drab
plush
knee
-
breech
.
as


they
draw
near
to
their
destination
,
however
,
Mr.
Bumble
think
it


expedient
to
look
down
,
and
see
that
the
boy
be
in
good
order
for


inspection
by
his
new
master
:

thus

,
Mr.

put
on
his
cocked
hat
wrong
side

,
in
a


fever
of
parochial
excitement
;
and
flounce
out
of
the
shop
.


'
why
,
he
be
so
angry
,
Oliver
,
that
he

even
to

after
you

'

Mr.

Oliver

carefully
keep

,
during
the
interview
;
and
who
be
shake
from
head
to
foot
at


the
mere
recollection
of
the
sound
of
Mr.

's
voice

he
need
n't
 
haven
take
the
trouble
to
shrink
from
Mr.

glance

however

for
that
functionary
,
on

the
prediction
of
the
gentleman


in
the
white
waistcoat
have
make
a
very
strong
impression
,
think
that


now
the
undertaker
have
get
Oliver
upon
trial
the
subject
be
well


avoid
,
until
such
time
as
he
should
be
firmly
bind
for
seven
year
,


and
all
danger
of
his
be
return
upon
the
hand
of
the
parish


should
be
thus
effectually
and
legally
overcome
.


'
well
,
'
say
Mr.
Sowerberry
,
take
up
his
hat
,
'
the
soon
this
job
be


do
,
the
well
.
Noah
,
look
after
the
shop
.
Oliver
,
put
on
your
cap
,


and
come
with
I
.
'
Oliver
obey
,
and
follow
his
master
on
his


professional
mission
.


they
walk
on
,
for
some
time
,
through
the
most
crowded
and
densely


inhabit
part
of
the
town
;
and
then
,
strike
down
a
narrow
street


more
dirty
and
miserable
than
any
they
have
yet
pass
through
,
pause


to
look
for
the
house
which
be
the
object
of
their
search
.
the
house


on
either
side
be
high
and
large
,
but
very
old
,
and
tenant
by


people
of
the
poor
class
:
as
their
neglect
appearance
would
have


sufficiently
denote
,
without
the
concurrent
testimony
afford
by
the


squalid
look
of
the
few
man
and
woman
who
,
with
fold
arm
and
body


half
double
,
occasionally
skulk
along
.
a
great
many
of
the


tenement
have
shop
-
front
;
but
these
be
fast
close
,
and
moulder


away
;
only
the
upper
room
be
inhabit
.
some
house
which
have


become
insecure
from
age
and
decay
,
be
prevent
from
fall
into


the
street
,
by
huge
beam
of
wood
rear
against
the
wall
,
and
firmly


plant
in
the
road
;
but
even
these
crazy
den
seem
to
have
be


select
as
the
nightly
haunt
of
some
houseless
wretche
,
for
many
of


the
rough
board
which
supply
the
place
of
door
and
window
,
be


wrench
from
their
position
,
to
afford
an
aperture
wide
enough
for


the
passage
of
a
human
body
.
the
kennel
be
stagnant
and
filthy
.
the


very
rat
,
which
here
and
there
lay
putrefy
in
its
rottenness
,

hideous
with
famine
.


there
be
neither
knocker
nor
bell
-
handle
at
the
open
door
where
Oliver


and
his
master
stop
;
so
,
grope
his
way
cautiously
through
the
dark


passage
,
and
bid
Oliver
keep
close
to
he
and
not
be
afraid
the


undertaker
mount
to
the
top
of
the
first
flight
of
stair
.
stumble


against
a
door
on
the
landing
,
he
rap
at
it
with
his
knuckle
.


it
be
open
by
a
young
girl
of
thirteen
or
fourteen
.
the
undertaker


at
once
see
enough
of
what
the
room
contain
,
to
know
it
be
the


apartment
to
which
he
have
be
direct
.
he
step
in
;
Oliver


follow
he
.


there
be
no
fire
in
the
room
;
but
a
man
be
crouch
,
mechanically
,


over
the
empty
stove
.
an
old
woman
,
too
,
have
draw
a
low
stool
to
the


cold
hearth
,
and
be
sit
beside
he
.
there
be
some
ragged


child
in
another
corner
;
and
in
a
small
recess
,
opposite
the
door
,


there
lie
upon
the
ground
,
something
cover
with
an
old
blanket
.


Oliver
shudder
as
he
cast
his
eye
toward
the
place
,
and
crept


involuntarily
close
to
his
master
;
for
though
it
be
cover
up
,
the


boy
feel
that
it
be
a
corpse
.


the
man
's
face
be
thin
and
very
pale
;
his
hair
and
beard
be
grizzly
;


his
eye
be
bloodshot
.
the
old
woman
's
face
be
wrinkle
;
her
two


remain
tooth
protrude
over
she
under
lip
;
and
her
eye
be
bright


and
pierce
.
Oliver
be
afraid
to
look
at
either
she
or
the
man
.


they
seem
so
like
the
rat
he
have
see
outside
.


'
nobody
shall
go
near
she
,
'
say
the
man
,
start
fiercely
up
,
as
the


undertaker
approach
the
recess
.
'
keep
back
!
damn
you
,
keep
back
,
if


you
've
 
a
life
to
lose
!
'


'
nonsense
,
my
good
man
,
'

the
undertaker
,
who
be
pretty
well
use


to
misery
in
all
its
shape
.
'
nonsense
!
'


'
I
tell
you
,
'
say
the
man
:
clench
his
hand
,
and
stamp


furiously
on
the
floor
,
-
'
I
tell
you
I
wo
n't
 
have
she
put
into
the


ground
.
she
could
n't
 
rest
there
.
the
worm
would
worry
she
-
not
eat


she
-
she
be
so
wear
away
.
'


the
undertaker
offer
no
reply
to
this
raving
;
but
produce
a
tape


from
his
pocket
,
kneel
down
for
a
moment
by
the
side
of
the
body
.


'
ah
!
'
say
the
man
:
burst
into
tear
,
and
sink
on
his
knee
at


the
foot
of
the
dead
woman
;
'
kneel
down
,
kneel
down
-
kneel
round
she
,


every
one
of
you
,
and
mark
my
word
!
I
say
she
be
starve
to
death
.


I
never
know
how
bad
she
be
,
till
the
fever
come
upon
she
;
and
then


her
bone
be
start
through
the
skin
.
there
be
neither
fire
nor


candle
;
she

in
the
dark

in
the
dark

she
could
n't
 
even
see
she


child
's
face

we
hear
she
gasp
out
their
name
.
I
beg


for
she
in
the
street

they
send
I
to
prison
.
when
I
come
back
,


she
be
die
;

all
the
blood
in
my
heart
have
dry
up
,
for
they

she
to
death

I
swear
it
before
the
God
that

it

he
twine
his
hand
in
his
hair

,
with
a
loud


scream

grovel
upon
the
floor

his
eye
fix
,

the
foam


cover
his
lip

the
terrified
child
cry
bitterly
;

the
old
woman
,

have


hitherto
remain
as
quiet
as
if
she
have
be
wholly
deaf
to
all
that


pass

they
into
silence

unloosened
the
cravat
of
the


man

woman

her
head
in
the


direction
of
the
corpse
;

speak
with
an
idiotic
leer
,
more


ghastly

even
the
presence

death

such
a
place

woman

OLIVER
,
be
GOADED
by
the
taunt
of
NOAH
,
rous
into
ACTION
,
and


rather
ASTONISHES
HIM


the
month
's
trial
over
,
Oliver
be
formally
apprentice
.
it
be
a
nice


sickly
season
just
at
this
time
.
in
commercial
phrase
,
coffin
be


look
up
;
and
,
in
the
course
of
a
few
week
,
Oliver
acquire
a
great


deal
of
experience
.
the
success
of
Mr.
Sowerberry
's
ingenious


speculation
,
exceed
even
his
most
sanguine
hope
.
the
old


inhabitant
recollect
no
period
at
which
measle
have
be
so


prevalent
,
or
so
fatal
to
infant
existence
;
and
many
be
the
mournful


procession
which
little
Oliver
head
,
in
a
hat
-
band
reach
down
to


his
knee
,
to
the
indescribable
admiration
and
emotion
of
all
the


mother
in
the
town
.
as
Oliver
accompany
his
master
in
most
of
his


adult
expedition
too
,
in
order
that
he
might
acquire
that
equanimity


of
demeanour
and
full
command
of
nerve
which
be
essential
to
a


finish
undertaker
,
he
have
many
opportunity
of
observe
the


beautiful
resignation
and
fortitude
with
which
some
strong
-
minded


people
bear
their
trial
and
loss
.


for
instance
;
when
Sowerberry
have
an
order
for
the
burial
of
some
rich


old
lady
or
gentleman
,
who
be
surround
by
a
great
number
of
nephews


and
niece
,
who
have
be
perfectly
inconsolable
during
the
previous


illness
,
and
whose
grief
have
be
wholly
irrepressible
even
on
the
most


public
occasion
,
they
would
be
as
happy
among
themselves
as
need


be
-
quite
cheerful
and
contented
-
conversing
together
with
as
much


freedom
and
gaiety
,
as
if
nothing
whatever
have
happen
to
disturb


they
.
husband
,
too
,
bear
the
loss
of
their
wife
with
the
most
heroic


calmness
.
wife
,
again
,
put
on
weed
for
their
husband
,
as
if
,
so
far


from
grieve
in
the
garb
of
sorrow
,
they
have
make
up
their
mind
to


render
it
as
become
and
attractive
as
possible
.
it
be
observable
,


too
,
that
lady
and
gentleman
who
be
in
passion
of
anguish
during


the
ceremony
of
interment
,
recover
almost
as
soon
as
they
reach


home
,
and
become
quite
compose
before
the
tea
-
drinking
be
over
.
all


this
be
very
pleasant
and
improve
to
see
;
and
Oliver
behold
it
with


great
admiration
.


that
Oliver
Twist
be
move
to
resignation
by
the
example
of
these
good


people
,
I
can
not
,
although
I
be
his
biographer
,
undertake
to
affirm


with
any
degree
of
confidence
;
but
I
can
most
distinctly
say
,
that
for


many
month
he
continue
meekly
to
submit
to
the
domination
and


ill
-
treatment
of
Noah
Claypole
:
who
use
he
far
bad
than
before
,
now


that
his
jealousy
be
rouse
by
see
the
new
boy
promote
to
the


black
stick
and
hatband
,
while
he
,
the
old
one
,
remain
stationary
in


the
muffin
-
cap
and
leather
.
Charlotte
treat
he
ill
,
because
Noah


do
;
and
Mrs.
Sowerberry
be
his
decide
enemy
,
because
Mr.
Sowerberry


be
disposed
to
be
his
friend
;
so
,
between
these
three
on
one
side
,
and


a
glut
of
funeral
on
the
other
,
Oliver
be
not
altogether
as


comfortable
as
the
hungry
pig
be
,
when
he
be
shut
up
,
by
mistake
,
in


the
grain
department
of
a
brewery
.


and
now
,
I
come
to
a
very
important
passage
in
Oliver
's
history
;
for
I


have
to
record
an
act
,
slight
and
unimportant
perhaps
in
appearance
,


but
which
indirectly
produce
a
material
change
in
all
his
future


prospect
and
proceeding
.


one
day
,
Oliver
and
Noah
have
descend
into
the
kitchen
at
the
usual


dinner
-
hour
,
to
banquet
upon
a
small
joint
of
mutton
-
a
pound
and
a


half
of
the
bad
end
of
the
neck
-
when
Charlotte
be
call
out
of


the
way
,
there
ensue
a
brief
interval
of
time
,
which
Noah
Claypole
,


be
hungry
and
vicious
,
consider
he
could
not
possibly
devote
to
a


worthy
purpose
than
aggravate
and
tantalise
young
Oliver
Twist
.


intent
upon
this
innocent
amusement
,
Noah
put
his
foot
on
the


table
-
cloth
;
and
pull
Oliver
's
hair
;
and
twitch
his
ear
;
and


express
his
opinion
that
he
be
a
'
sneak
'
;
and
furthermore
announce


his
intention
of
come
to
see
he
hang
,
whenever
that
desirable


event
should
take
place
;
and
enter
upon
various
topic
of
petty


annoyance
,
like
a
malicious
and
ill
-
condition
charity
-
boy
as
he
be
.


but
,
make
Oliver
cry
,
Noah
attempt
to
be
more
facetious
still
;
and


in
his
attempt
,
do
what
many
sometimes
do
to
this
day
,
when
they
want


to
be
funny
.
he
get
rather
personal
.


'
Work'us
,
'
say
Noah
,
'
how
be
your
mother
?
'


'
she
be
dead
,
'
reply
Oliver
;
'
do
n't
 
you
say
anything
about
she
to
I
!
'


Oliver
's
colour
rise
as
he
say
this
;
he
breathe
quickly
;
and
there


be
a
curious
working
of
the
mouth
and
nostril
,
which
Mr.
Claypole


thought
must
be
the
immediate
precursor
of
a
violent
fit
of
crying
.


under
this
impression
he
return
to
the
charge
.


'
what
do
she
die
of
,
Work'us
?

Noah
.


'
of
a
broken
heart
,

of
our
old
nurse

I
,
'
reply
Oliver
:


more
as
if
he
be
talk
to
himself
,
than
answer
Noah
.
'
I
think
I


know
what
it
must
be
to
die
of
that
!

nobody

some

recommence


kicking
,
with
a
violence
that
render
every
other
sound
inaudible

at
this
juncture
.
Oliver
's
offence

be


explain
to
he
,
with
such
exaggeration
as
the

good

his
ire
,
he
unlock
the
cellar

boldly
on

quite


undismayed

Oliver
.


Mrs.

into
a
flood
of
tear
.


this
flood
of
tear
leave
Mr.
Sowerberry
no
alternative
.
if
he
have


hesitate
for
one
instant
to
punish
Oliver
most
severely
,
it
must
be


quite
clear
to
every
experienced
reader
that
he
would
have
be
,


accord
to
all
precedent
in
dispute
of
matrimony
establish
,
a


brute
,
an
unnatural
husband
,
an
insulting
creature
,
a
base
imitation
of


a
man
,
and
various
other
agreeable
character
too
numerous
for
recital


within
the
limit
of
this
chapter
.
to
do
he
justice
,
he
be
,
as
far


as
his
power
go
-
it
be
not
very
extensive
-
kindly
disposed
towards


the
boy
;
perhaps
,
because
it
be
his
interest
to
be
so
;
perhaps
,


because
his
wife
dislike
he
.
the
flood
of
tear
,
however
,
leave
he
no


resource
;
so
he
at
once
give
he
a
drubbing
,
which
satisfy
even
Mrs.


sowerberry
herself
,
and
render
Mr.
Bumble
's
subsequent
application
of


the
parochial
cane
,
rather
unnecessary
.
for
the
rest
of
the
day
,
he


be
shut
up
in
the
back
kitchen
,
in
company
with
a
pump
and
a
slice
of


bread
;
and
at
night
,
Mrs.
Sowerberry
,
after
make
various
remark


outside
the
door
,
by
no
mean
complimentary
to
the
memory
of
his


mother
,
look
into
the
room
,
and
,
amidst
the
jeer
and
pointing
of


Noah
and
Charlotte
,
order
he
upstairs
to
his
dismal
bed
.


it
be
not
until
he
be
leave
alone
in
the
silence
and
stillness
of
the


gloomy
workshop
of
the
undertaker
,
that
Oliver
give
way
to
the
feeling


which
the
day
's
treatment
may
be
suppose
likely
to
have
awaken
in
a


mere
child
.
he
have
listen
to
their
taunt
with
a
look
of
contempt
;


he
have
bear
the
lash
without
a
cry
:
for
he
feel
that
pride
swell
in


his
heart
which
would
have
keep
down
a
shriek
to
the
last
,
though
they


have
roast
he
alive
.
but
now
,
when
there
be
none
to
see
or
hear


he
,
he
fall
upon
his
knee
on
the
floor
;
and
,
hide
his
face
in
his


hand
,
weep
such
tear
as
,
God
send
for
the
credit
of
our
nature
,
few


so
young
may
ever
have
cause
to
pour
out
before
he
!


for
a
long
time
,
Oliver
remain
motionless
in
this
attitude
.
the


candle
be
burn
low
in
the
socket
when
he
rise
to
his
foot
.
have


gaze
cautiously
round
he
,
and
listen
intently
,
he
gently
undo
the


fastening
of
the
door
,
and
look
abroad
.


it
be
a
cold
,
dark
night
.
the
star
seem
,
to
the
boy
's
eye
,


far
from
the
earth
than
he
have
ever
see
they
before
;
there
be
no


wind
;
and
the
sombre
shadow
throw
by
the
tree
upon
the
ground
,


look
sepulchral
and
death
-
like
,
from
be
so
still
.
he
softly


reclose
the
door
.
having
avail
himself
of
the
expire
light
of
the


candle
to
tie
up
in
a
handkerchief
the
few
article
of
wear
apparel


he
have
,
sit
himself
down
upon
a
bench
,
to
wait
for
morning
.


with
the
first
ray
of
light
that
struggle
through
the
crevice
in
the


shutter
,
Oliver
arise
,
and
again
unbar
the
door
.
one
timid
look


around
-
one
moment
's
pause
of
hesitation
-
he
have
close
it
behind
he
,


and
be
in
the
open
street
.


he
look
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
,
uncertain
whither
to
fly
.


he
remember
to
have
see
the
waggon
,
as
they
go
out
,
toil
up


the
hill
.
he
take
the
same
route
;
and
arrive
at
a
footpath
across


the
field
:
which
he
know
,
after
some
distance
,
lead
out
again
into
the


road
;
strike
into
it
,
and
walk
quickly
on
.


along
this
same
footpath
,
Oliver
well
-
remember
he
have
trot
beside


Mr.

,
when
he

the
workhouse
from
the
farm
.


his
way
lie
directly
in
front
of
the
cottage
.
his
heart
beat
quickly


when
he
bethink
himself
of
this
;
and
he
half
resolve
to
turn
back
.


he
have
come
a
long
way
though
,
and
should
lose
a
great
deal
of
time
by


do
so
.
besides
,
it
be
so
early
that
there
be
very
little
fear
of


his
be
see
;
so
he
walk
on
.


he
reach
the
house
.
there
be
no
appearance
of
its
inmate

at
that
early
hour
.

,
and
peep
into
the
garden

face
and

the
feature
of
one
of

VIII


OLIVER
WALKS
to
LONDON
.
he
encounter
on
the
ROAD
A
STRANGE
sort
of


young
GENTLEMAN


Oliver
reach
the
stile
at
which
the
by
-
path
terminate
;
and
once
more


gain
the
high
-
road
.
it
be
eight
o'clock
now
.
though
he
be
nearly


five
mile
away
from
the
town
,
he
run
,
and
hide
behind
the
hedge
,
by


turn
,
till
noon
:
fear
that
he
might
be
pursue
and
overtake
.
then


he
sit
down
to
rest
by
the
side
of
the
milestone
,
and
begin
to
think
,


for
the
first
time
,
where
he
have
well
go
and
try
to
live
.


the
stone
by
which
he
be
seat
,
bore
,
in
large
character
,
an


intimation
that
it
be
just
seventy
mile
from
that
spot
to
London
.
the


name
awaken
a
new
train
of
idea
in
the
boy
's
mind
.


London
!
-
that
great
place
!
-
nobody
-
not
even
Mr.
Bumble
-
could
ever


find
he
there
!
he
have
often
hear
the
old
man
in
the
workhouse
,
too
,


say
that
no
lad
of
spirit
need
want
in
London
;
and
that
there
be
way


of
live
in
that
vast
city
,
which
those
who
have
be
breed
up
in


country
part
have
no
idea
of
.
it
be
the
very
place
for
a
homeless


boy
,
who
must
die
in
the
street
unless
some
one
help
he
.
as
these


thing
pass
through
his
thought
,
he
jump
upon
his
foot
,
and
again


walk
forward
.


he
have
diminish
the
distance
between
himself
and
London
by
full
four


mile
more
,
before
he
recollect
how
much
he
must
undergo
ere
he
could


hope
to
reach
his
place
of
destination
.
as
this
consideration
force


itself
upon
he
,
he
slacken
his
pace
a
little
,
and
meditate
upon
his


mean
of
get
there
.
he
have
a
crust
of
bread
,
a
coarse
shirt
,
and


two
pair
of
stocking
,
in
his
bundle
.
he
have
a
penny
too
-
a
gift
of


Sowerberry
be
after
some
funeral
in
which
he
have
acquit
himself
more


than
ordinarily
well
-
in
his
pocket
.
'
a
clean
shirt
,
'
think
Oliver
,


'
be
a
very
comfortable
thing
;
and
so
be
two
pair
of
darn
stocking
;


and
so
be
a
penny
;
but
they
be
small
help
to
a
sixty
-
five
mile
'
walk


in
winter
time
.
'
but
Oliver
's
thought
,
like
those
of
most
other


people
,
although
they
be
extremely
ready
and
active
to
point
out
his


difficulty
,
be
wholly
at
a
loss
to
suggest
any
feasible
mode
of


surmount
they
;
so
,
after
a
good
deal
of
thinking
to
no
particular


purpose
,
he
change
his
little
bundle
over
to
the
other
shoulder
,
and


trudge
on
.


Oliver
walk
twenty
mile
that
day
;
and
all
that
time
taste
nothing


but
the
crust
of
dry
bread
,
and
a
few
draught
of
water
,
which
he


beg
at
the
cottage
-
door
by
the
road
-
side
.
when
the
night
come
,
he


turn
into
a
meadow
;
and
,
creep
close
under
a
hay
-
rick
,
determine


to
lie
there
,
till
morning
.
he
feel
frightened
at
first
,
for
the
wind


moan
dismally
over
the
empty
field
:
and
he
be
cold
and
hungry
,
and


more
alone
than
he
have
ever
feel
before
.
be
very
tired
with
his


walk
,
however
,
he
soon
fall
asleep
and
forget
his
trouble
.


he
feel
cold
and
stiff
,
when
he
get
up
next
morning
,
and
so
hungry
that


he
be
oblige
to
exchange
the
penny
for
a
small
loaf
,
in
the
very


first
village
through
which
he
pass
.
he
have
walk
no
more
than


twelve
mile
,
when
night
close
in
again
.
his
foot
be
sore
,
and
his


leg
so
weak
that
they
tremble
beneath
he
.
another
night
pass
in


the
bleak
damp
air
,
make
he
bad
;
when
he
set
forward
on
his
journey


next
morning
he
could
hardly
crawl
along
.


he
wait
at
the
bottom
of
a
steep
hill
till
a
stage
-
coach
come
up
,
and


then
beg
of
the
outside
passenger
;
but
there
be
very
few
who
take


any
notice
of
he
:
and
even
those
tell
he
to
wait
till
they
get
to
the


top
of
the
hill
,
and
then
let
they
see
how
far
he
could
run
for
a


halfpenny
.
Poor
Oliver
try
to
keep
up
with
the
coach
a
little
way
,


but
be
unable
to
do
it
,
by
reason
of
his
fatigue
and
sore
foot
.
when


the
outside
see
this
,
they
put
their
halfpence
back
into
their
pocket


again
,
declare
that
he
be
an
idle
young
dog
,
and
do
n't
 
deserve


anything
;
and
the
coach
rattle
away
and
leave
only
a
cloud
of
dust


behind
.


in
some
village
,
large
paint
board
be
fix
up
:
warn
all


person
who
beg
within
the
district
,
that
they
would
be
send
to


jail
.
this
frighten
Oliver
very
much
,
and
make
he
glad
to
get
out


of
those
village
with
all
possible
expedition
.
in
other
,
he
would


stand
about
the
inn
-
yard
,
and
look
mournfully
at
every
one
who
pass
:


a
proceeding
which
generally
terminate
in
the
landlady
's
order
one


of
the
post
-
boy
who
be
lounge
about
,
to
drive
that
strange
boy
out


of
the
place
,
for
she
be
sure
he
have
come
to
steal
something
.
if
he


beg
at
a
farmer
's
house
,
ten
to
one
but
they
threaten
to
set
the


dog
on
he
;
and
when
he
show
his
nose
in
a
shop
,
they
talk
about


the
beadle
-
which
bring
Oliver
's
heart
into
his
mouth
,
-
very
often


the
only
thing
he
have
there
,
for
many
hour
together
.


in
fact
,
if
it
have
not
be
for
a
good
-
hearted
turnpike
-
man
,
and
a


benevolent
old
lady
,
Oliver
's
trouble
would
have
be
shorten
by
the


very
same
process
which
have
put
an
end
to
his
mother
's
;
in
other
word
,


he
would
most
assuredly
have
fall
dead
upon
the
king
's
highway
.
but


the
turnpike
-
man
give
he
a
meal
of
bread
and
cheese
;
and
the
old
lady
,


who
have
a
shipwreck
grandson
wander
barefoot
in
some
distant
part


of
the
earth
,
take
pity
upon
the
poor
orphan
,
and
give
he
what
little


she
could
afford
-
and
more
-
with
such
kind
and
gentle
word
,
and
such


tear
of
sympathy
and
compassion
,
that
they
sink
deeply
into
Oliver
's


soul
,
than
all
the
suffering
he
have
ever
undergo
.


early
on
the
seventh
morning
after
he
have
leave
his
native
place
,
Oliver


limp
slowly
into
the
little
town
of
Barnet
.
the
window
-
shutter
be


close
;
the
street
be
empty
;
not
a
soul
have
awaken
to
the
business


of
the
day
.
the
sun
be
rise
in
all
its
splendid
beauty
;
but
the


light
only
serve
to
show
the
boy
his
own
lonesomeness
and
desolation
,


as
he
sit
,
with
bleed
foot
and
cover
with
dust
,
upon
a
door
-
step
.


by
degree
,
the
shutter
be
open
;
the
window
-
blind
be
draw
up
;


and
people
begin
pass
to
and
fro
.
some
few
stop
to
gaze
at


Oliver
for
a
moment
or
two
,
or
turn
round
to
stare
at
he
as
they


hurry
by
;
but
none
relieve
he
,
or
trouble
themselves
to
inquire


how
he
come
there
.
he
have
no
heart
to
beg
.
and
there
he
sit
.


he
have
be
crouch
on
the
step
for
some
time
:
wonder
at
the
great


number
of
public
-
house
 
every
other
house
in
Barnet
be
a
tavern
,


large
or
small
,
gaze
listlessly
at
the
coach
as
they
pass


through
,
and
think
how
strange
it
seem
that
they
could
do
,
with


ease
,
in
a
few
hour
,
what
it
have
take
he
a
whole
week
of
courage
and


determination
beyond
his
year
to
accomplish
:
when
he
be
rouse
by


observe
that
a
boy
,
who
have
pass
he
carelessly
some
minute


before
,
have
return
,
and
be
now
survey
he
most
earnestly
from
the


opposite
side
of
the
way
.
he
take
little
heed
of
this
at
first
;
but


the
boy
remain
in
the
same
attitude
of
close
observation
so
long
,


that
Oliver
raise
his
head
,
and
return
his
steady
look
.
upon
this
,


the
boy
cross
over
;
and
walk
close
up
to
Oliver
,
say
,


'
Hullo
,
my
covey
!
what
be
the
row
?
'


the
boy
who
address
this
inquiry
to
the
young
wayfarer
,
be
about
his


own
age
:
but
one
of
the
queer
look
boy
that
Oliver
have
even


see
.
he
be
a
snub
-
nosed
,
flat
-
browed
,
common
-
face
boy
enough
;
and


as
dirty
a
juvenile
as
one
would
wish
to
see
;
but
he
have
about
he
all


the
air
and
manner
of
a
man
.
he
be
short
of
his
age
:
with
rather


bow
-
leg
,
and
little
,
sharp
,
ugly
eye
.
his
hat
be
stick
on
the
top


of
his
head
so
lightly
,
that
it
threaten
to
fall
off
every


moment
-
and
would
have
do
so
,
very
often
,
if
the
wearer
have
not
have
a


knack
of
every
now
and
then
give
his
head
a
sudden
twitch
,
which


bring
it
back
to
its
old
place
again
.
he
wear
a
man
's
coat
,
which


reach
nearly
to
his
heel
.
he
have
turn
the
cuff
back
,
half
-
way
up


his
arm
,
to
get
his
hand
out
of
the
sleeve
:
apparently
with
the


ultimate
view
of
thrust
they
into
the
pocket
of
his
corduroy


trouser
;
for
there
he
keep
they
.
he
be
,
altogether
,

old


gentleman
as
life
there
,
wot'll
give
you
lodging
for
nothink

!
'


the
young
gentleman
smile
,
as
if
to
intimate
that
the
latter
fragment


of
discourse
be
playfully
ironical
;
and
finish
the
beer
as
he
do


so
.


this
unexpected
offer
of
shelter
be
too
tempting
to
be
resist
;


especially
as
it
be
immediately
follow
up
,
by
the
assurance
that
the


old
gentleman
refer
to
,
would
doubtless
provide
Oliver
with
a


comfortable
place
,
without
loss
of
time
.
this
lead
to
a
more
friendly


and
confidential
dialogue
;
from
which
Oliver
discover
that
his


friend
's
name
be
Jack
Dawkins
,
and
that
he
be
a
peculiar
pet
and


protege
of
the
elderly
gentleman
before
mention
.


Mr.
Dawkin
's
appearance
do
not
say
a
vast
deal
in
favour
of
the


comfort
which
his
patron
's
interest
obtain
for
those
whom
he
take


under
his
protection
;
but
,
as
he
have
a
rather
flightly
and
dissolute


mode
of
conversing
,
and
furthermore
avow
that
among
his
intimate


friend
he
be
well
know
by
the
sobriquet
of
'
the
artful
Dodger
,
'


Oliver
conclude
that
,
be
of
a
dissipated
and
careless
turn
,
the


moral
precept
of
his
benefactor
have
hitherto
be
throw
away
upon


he
.
under
this
impression
,
he
secretly
resolve
to
cultivate
the
good


opinion
of
the
old
gentleman
as
quickly
as
possible
;
and
,
if
he
find


the
Dodger
incorrigible
,
as
he
more
than
half
suspect
he
should
,
to


decline
the
honour
of
his
farther
acquaintance
.


as
John
Dawkins
object
to
their
enter
London
before
nightfall
,
it


be
nearly
eleven
o'clock
when
they
reach
the
turnpike
at
Islington
.


they
cross
from
the
Angel
into
St.

Road
;
strike
down
the

down

Hole

thence
into
Little
Saffron

so
into


Saffron
Hill

along

the
Dodger
scud
at
a
rapid
pace
,


direct
Oliver
to
follow
close
at
his
heel
.


although
Oliver
have
enough
to
occupy
his
attention
in
keep
sight
of


his
leader
,
he
could
not
help
bestow
a
few
hasty
glance
on
either


side
of
the
way
,
as
he
pass
along

dirty

wretched
place

have
never

very
narrow
and
muddy
,
and
the
air


be
impregnate
with
filthy
odour
.


there
be
a
good
many
small

the
only
stock

,
even
at
that
time
of
night
,
be


crawl
in
and
out
at
the
door
,
or
scream
from
the
inside
.
the


sole
place
that
seem
to
prosper
amid
the
general
blight
of
the


place
,

little
knot
of


house

drunken

whether

HOPEFUL
PUPILS


it
be
late
next
morning
when
Oliver
awake
,
from
a
sound
,
long
sleep
.


there
be
no
other
person
in
the
room
but
the
old
Jew
,
who
be
boil


some
coffee
in
a
saucepan
for
breakfast
,
and
whistle
softly
to


himself
as
he
stir
it
round
and
round
,
with
an
iron
spoon
.
he
would


stop
every
now
and
then
to
listen
when
there
be
the
least
noise
below
:


and
when
he
have
satisfy
himself
,
he
would
go
on
whistling
and


stir
again
,
as
before
.


although
Oliver
have
rouse
himself
from
sleep
,
he
be
not
thoroughly


awake
.
there
be
a
drowsy
state
,
between
sleep
and
waking
,
when
you


dream
more
in
five
minute
with
your
eye
half
open
,
and
yourself
half


conscious
of
everything
that
be
pass
around
you
,
than
you
would
in


five
night
with
your
eye
fast
close
,
and
your
sense
wrapt
in


perfect
unconsciousness
.
at
such
time
,
a
mortal
know
just
enough
of


what
his
mind
be
do
,
to
form
some
glimmer
conception
of
its


mighty
power
,
its
bounding
from
earth
and
spurn
time
and
space
,


when
free
from
the
restraint
of
its
corporeal
associate
.


Oliver
be
precisely
in
this
condition
.
he
see
the
Jew
with
his


half
-
closed
eye
;
hear
his
low
whistling
;
and
recognise
the
sound
of


the
spoon
grate
against
the
saucepan
's
side
:
and
yet
the
self
-
same


sense
be
mentally
engage
,
at
the
same
time
,
in
busy
action
with


almost
everybody
he
have
ever
know
.


when
the
coffee
be
do
,
the
Jew
draw
the
saucepan
to
the
hob
.


stand
,
then
in
an
irresolute
attitude
for
a
few
minute
,
as
if
he


do
not
well
know
how
to
employ
himself
,
he
turn
round
and
look
at


Oliver
,
and
call
he
by
his
name
.
he
do
not
answer
,
and
be
to
all


appearance
asleep
.


after
satisfy
himself
upon
this
head
,
the
Jew
step
gently
to
the


door
:
which
he
fasten
.
he
then
draw
forth
:
as
it
seem
to
Oliver
,


from
some
trap
in
the
floor
:
a
small
box
,
which
he
place
carefully
on


the
table
.
his
eye
glisten
as
he
raise
the
lid
,
and
look
in
.


drag
an
old
chair
to
the
table
,
he
sit
down
;
and
take
from
it
a


magnificent
gold
watch
,
sparkle
with
jewel
.


'
aha
!
'
say
the
Jew
,
shrug
up
his
shoulder
,
and
distort
every


feature
with
a
hideous
grin
.
'
clever
dog
!

why

'


with
these

reflection
of
the
like
nature
,
the
Jew

place
of
safety

in
the
palm
of
his
hand

there
seem
to
be
some
very
minute

on
it
;
for
the
Jew

it
flat
upon
the
table

over
it
,
long
and
earnestly
.
at
length
he
put


it
down
,
as
if
despairing
of
success
;
and
,
lean
back
in
his

mutter
:

;
which
laugh
,
meet

when

smooth
Oliver

make
he
wonder
more
and
more
;
for
it

plain
from
the
reply


of
the
two
boy
that
they
have
both
be
there
;
and
Oliver
naturally


wonder
how
they

possibly
have
find
time
to
be
so
very


industrious
.


when

out
of
his

nimbly
,
every
time
he
turn
round
,
that


it
be
impossible
to

accidently
,
while

a
great
number

the
two

,
regularly
,
every
morning

at
length
,

to
languish
for
fresh
air
,
and
take
many
occasion
of


earnestly
entreat
the
old
gentleman
to

he
to
go
out
to
work


with
his
two
companion

Oliver
be
render
the
more
anxious
to
be
actively
employ
,
by
what


he
have
see
of
the
stern
morality
of
the
old
gentleman

character
.


whenever
the
Dodger
or
Charley
Bates
come
home
at
night
,
empty
-
handed
,


he
would
expatiate
with
great
vehemence
on
the
misery
of
idle
and
lazy


habit
;
and
would
enforce
upon
they
the
necessity
of
an
active
life
,
by


send
they
supperless
to
bed

on
one
occasion
,
indeed
,

even
go


so
far
as
to
knock
they
both
down
a
flight
of
stair
;
but
this
be


carry
out
his
virtuous
precept
to
an
unusual
extent
.


at
length
,
one
morning
,
Oliver
obtain
the
permission
he
have
so


eagerly
seek
.
there
have
be
no
handkerchief

upon
,
for
two


or
three
day
,
and
the
dinner
have
be
rather
meagre
.
perhaps
these


be
reason
for
the
old
gentleman
be
give
his
assent
;
but
,
whether


they
be
or
no
,
he
tell
Oliver
he
might
go
,
and
place
he
under
the


joint
guardianship
of
Charley

;
Master
Bates
saunter
along
with
his


hand
in
his
pocket
;
and
Oliver
between
they
,
wonder
where
they


be
go
,
and
what
branch
of
manufacture
he
would
be
instruct
in
,


first
.


the
pace
at
which
they
go
,
be
such
a
very
lazy
,
ill
-
look
saunter
,


that
Oliver
soon
begin
to
think
his
companion
be
go
to
deceive


the
old
gentleman
,
by
not
go
to
work
at
all
.
the
Dodger
have
a


vicious
propensity
,
too
,
of
pull
the
cap
from
the
head
of
small


boy
and
toss
they
down
area
;
while
Charley
Bates
exhibit
some


very
loose
notion
concern
the
right
of
property
,
by
pilfer


diver
apple
and
onion
from
the
stall
at
the
kennel
side
,
and


thrust
they
into
pocket
which
be
so
surprisingly
capacious
,
that


they
seem
to
undermine
his
whole
suit
of
clothe
in
every
direction
.


these
thing
look
so
bad
,
that
Oliver
be
on
the
point
of
declare


his
intention
of
seek
his
way
back
,
in
the
good
way
he
could
;
when


his
thought
be
suddenly
direct
into
another
channel
,
by
a
very


mysterious
change
of
behaviour
on
the
part
of
the
Dodger
.


they
be
just
emerge
from
a
narrow
court

from
the
open


square
in

some
strange
perversion


of
term

Dodger
make
a
sudden
stop
;

his
finger
on
his
lip
,
draw
his
companion
back
again
,
with
the


great
caution
and
circumspection

the
matter

have
take
up
a
book
from

there
he
stand
,

away

hard
as
if
he
be
in
his


elbow

chair

in
his
own
study

it

very
possible

he

himself
there

it

plain
,
from
his
abstraction

straight
through

over

what
be
Oliver

horror

alarm
as
he

a
few
pace
off
,
look


on
with
his
eyelid
as
wide
open
as
they
would
possibly
go
,
to
see
the


Dodger
plunge
his
hand
into
the
old
gentleman
's
pocket
,
and
draw
from


thence
a
handkerchief

to
see
he
hand
the

to
Charley

to
behold

away
round

whole

the
Jew

upon
the
boy
's
mind

he
stand
,
for
a
moment
,
with
the
blood
so
tingle
through
all
his


vein
from
terror
,
that
he
feel
as
if
he

in

then
,


confused

to
his
heel
;

there
,


retire
into
a
corner
,

up
before
his
mind
's
eye
a
vast

brightness
of

smile

beam


of
the
soul

its
mask
of

away
beneath
the
dry
and

the


worm
do
not
work
more
surely
on
the
dead
body

do
this
slow


creep
fire
upon
the
living
frame

weak
,

thin
,

,

from
what
seem
to
have

a
long
and
troubled
dream

he
utter
these
word
in
a
feeble
voice
,

very
faint

overhear
at
once

curtain

the
bed

hastily

back
,

motherly
old
lady
,
very
neatly
and
precisely


dress
,
rise
as
she
undrew
it
,
from

chair
close
by
,
in
which


she
have

sit
at
needle

work
.


'
Hush
,
my
dear
,
'

the
old
lady
softly
.
'
you
must
be
very
quiet
,
or


you
will
be
ill
again
;
and
you

very
bad
,

as
bad
as
bad

,
pretty
nigh
.
lie
down
again
;
there
be
a
dear
!
'
with
those
word
,


the
old
lady
very
gently
place
Oliver
's
head
upon
the
pillow
;
and
,


smooth
back
his
hair
from
his
forehead
,
look
so
kindly
and
love


in
his
face
,
that
he
could
not
help
place
his
little
withered
hand
in


her
,
and
draw
it
round
his
neck
.


'
save
we
!
'
say
the
old
lady
,
with
tear
in
her
eye
.
'
what
a
grateful


little
dear
it
be
.
pretty
creetur
!
what
would
his
mother
feel
if
she


have
sit
by
he
as
I
have
,
and
could
see
he
now
!
'


'
perhaps
she
do
see
I
,
'
whisper
Oliver
,
fold
his
hand


together
;
'
perhaps
she
have
sit
by
I
.
I
almost
feel
as
if
she
have
.
'


'
that
be
the
fever
,
my
dear
,
'

the
old
lady
mildly
.


'
I
suppose
it
be
,
'
reply
Oliver
,
'
because
heaven
be
a
long
way
off
;


and
they
be
too
happy
there
,
to
come
down
to
the
bedside
of
a
poor


boy
.
but
if
she
know
I
be
ill
,
she
must
have
pity
I
,
even
there
;


for
she
be
very
ill
herself
before
she
die
.
she
ca
n't
 
know
anything


about
I
though
,
'
add
Oliver
after
a
moment
's
silence
.
'
if
she
have


see
I
hurt
,
it
would
have
make
she
sorrowful
;
and
her
face
have
always


look
sweet
and
happy
,
when
I
have
dream
of
she
.
'


the
old
lady
make
no
reply
to
this
;
but
wipe
her
eye
first
,
and
she


spectacle
,
which
lie
on
the
counterpane
,
afterwards
,
as
if
they
be


part
and
parcel
of
those
feature
,
bring
some
cool
stuff
for
Oliver


to
drink
;
and
then
,
pat
he
on
the
cheek
,
tell
he
he
must
lie
very


quiet
,
or
he
would
be
ill
again
.


so
,
Oliver
keep
very
still
;
partly
because
he
be
anxious
to
obey
the


kind
old
lady
in
all
thing
;
and
partly
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
because
he


be
completely
exhausted
with
what
he
have
already
say
.
he
soon
fall


into

frequent
interval

sundry
tumbling


forward

diver
moan

no
bad


effect

the
wall

darkness

the
deep
stillness
of
the
room

very
solemn
;

dread
of
his


awful
presence
,
he
turn
his
face
upon
the
pillow

deep
tranquil
sleep

suffer
alone
impart
;
that
calm
and
peaceful
rest

it
well
not

no


soon

his
spectacle
on
his

thrust
his
hand


behind
the
skirt
of
his
dressing

gown
to
take
a
good
long
look
at

a
supply
of
tear

face
.
it
be
impossible
to
doubt
he
;


there
be
truth
in
every
one
of
its
thin
and
sharpen
lineament
.


'
some
mistake
,
'
say
Mr.
Brownlow
.
but
,
although
his
motive
for


look
steadily
at
Oliver
no
long
exist
,
the
old
idea
of
the


resemblance
between
his
feature
and
some
familiar
face
come
upon
he


so
strongly
,
that
he
could
not
withdraw
his
gaze
.


'
I
hope
you
be
not
angry
with
I
,
sir
?
'
say
Oliver
,
raise
his
eye


beseechingly
.


'
no
,
no
,
'
reply
the
old
gentleman
.
'
why
!
what
be
this
?
Bedwin
,
look


there
!
'


as
he
speak
,
he
point
hastily
to
the
picture
over
Oliver
's
head
,
and


then
to
the
boy
's
face
.
there
be
its
living
copy
.
the
eye
,
the
head
,


the
mouth
;
every
feature
be
the
same
.
the
expression
be
,
for
the


instant
,
so
precisely
alike
,
that
the
minute
line
seemed
copy
with


startling
accuracy
!


Oliver
know
not
the
cause
of
this
sudden
exclamation
;
for
,
not
be


strong
enough
to
bear
the
start
it
give
he
,
he
faint
away
.
a


weakness
on
his
part
,
which
afford
the
narrative
an
opportunity
of


relieve
the
reader
from
suspense
,
in
behalf
of
the
two
young
pupil


of
the
Merry
Old
Gentleman
;
and
of
recording
-


that
when
the
Dodger
,
and
his
accomplished
friend
Master
Bates
,
join


in
the
hue
-
and
-
cry
which
be
raise
at
Oliver
's
heel
,
in
consequence


of
their
execute
an
illegal
conveyance
of
Mr.
Brownlow
's
personal


property
,
as
have
be
already
describe
,
they
be
actuate
by
a
very


laudable
and
become
regard
for
themselves
;
and
forasmuch
as
the


freedom
of
the
subject
and
the
liberty
of
the
individual
be
among
the


first
and
proudest
boast
of
a
true
-
hearted
englishman
,
so
,
I
need


hardly
beg
the
reader
to
observe
,
that
this
action
should
tend
to
exalt


they
in
the
opinion
of
all
public
and
patriotic
man
,
in
almost
as
great


a
degree
as
this
strong
proof
of
their
anxiety
for
their
own


preservation
and
safety
go
to
corroborate
and
confirm
the
little
code


of
law
which
certain
profound
and
sound
-
judge
philosopher
have
lay


down
as
the
main
-
spring
of
all
Nature
's
deed
and
action
:
the
say


philosopher
very
wisely
reduce
the
good
lady
's
proceeding
to


matter
of
maxim
and
theory
:
and
,
by
a
very
neat
and
pretty
compliment


to
her
exalted
wisdom
and
understanding
,
put
entirely
out
of
sight


any
consideration
of
heart
,
or
generous
impulse
and
feeling
.
for
,


these
be
matter
totally
beneath
a
female
who
be
acknowledge
by


universal
admission
to
be
far
above
the
numerous
little
foible
and


weakness
of
her
sex
.


if
I
want
any
further
proof
of
the
strictly
philosophical
nature
of


the
conduct
of
these
young
gentleman
in
their
very
delicate


predicament
,
I
should
at
once
find
it
in
the
fact
 
also
record
in
a


forego
part
of
this
narrative
,
of
their
quit
the
pursuit
,
when


the
general
attention
be
fix
upon
Oliver
;
and
make
immediately
for


their
home
by
the
shortest
possible
cut
.
although
I
do
not
mean
to


assert
that
it
be
usually
the
practice
of
renowned
and
learn
sage
,


to
shorten
the
road
to
any
great
conclusion
 
their
course
indeed
be


rather
to
lengthen
the
distance
,
by
various
circumlocution
and


discursive
staggering
,
like
unto
those
in
which
drunken
man
under
the


pressure
of
a
too
mighty
flow
of
idea
,
be
prone
to
indulge
;
still
,
I


do
mean
to
say
,
and
do
say
distinctly
,
that
it
be
the
invariable


practice
of
many
mighty
philosopher
,
in
carry
out
their
theory
,


to
evince
great
wisdom
and
foresight
in
provide
against
every


possible
contingency
which
can
be
suppose
at
all
likely
to
affect


themselves
.
thus
,
to
do
a
great
right
,
you
may
do
a
little
wrong
;
and


you
may
take
any
means
which
the
end
to
be
attain
,
will
justify
;
the


amount
of
the
right
,
or
the
amount
of
the
wrong
,
or
indeed
the


distinction
between
the
two
,
be
leave
entirely
to
the
philosopher


concerned
,
to
be
settle
and
determine
by
his
clear
,
comprehensive
,


and
impartial
view
of
his
own
particular
case
.


it
be
not
until
the
two
boy
have
scour
,
with
great
rapidity
,
through


a
most
intricate
maze
of
narrow
street
and
court
,
that
they
venture


to
halt
beneath
a
low
and
dark
archway
.
having
remain
silent
here
,


just
long
enough
to
recover
breath
to
speak
,
Master
Bates
utter
an


exclamation
of
amusement
and
delight
;
and
,
burst
into
an


uncontrollable
fit
of
laughter
,
fling
himself
upon
a
doorstep
,
and


roll
thereon
in
a
transport
of
mirth
.


'
what
be
the
matter
?
'
inquire
the
Dodger
.

Charley

cautiously
round

Charley
,

I

it
!
to
see
he


split
away
at
that
pace
,
and
cut
round
the
corner
,
and


knock
up
again

the
post
,
and
start
on
again
as

I
with

out


arter

-
oh
,

'
the
vivid
imagination
of
Master
Bates
present


the
scene
before
he
in
too
strong
colour
.
as
he
arrive
at
this


apostrophe
,
he
again
roll
upon
the
door
-
step
,
and
laugh
louder
than


before
.


'
what
'll
Fagin
say
?
'
inquire
the
Dodger
;
take
advantage
of
the
next


interval
of
breathlessness
on
the
part
of
his
friend
to
propound
the


question
.


'
what
?
'
repeat
Charley
Bates
.


'
ah
,

the
Dodger

'
why
,
what
should
he
say
?
'
inquire
Charley
:
stop
rather
suddenly


in
his
merriment
;
for
the
Dodger
's
manner
be
impressive
.
'
what
should


he
say
?
'


Mr.

whistle
for
a
couple
of
minute
;
then
,
take
off
his

,


scratch
his
head
,

nod
thrice
.

the
Dodger

a
slight
sneer
on
his
intellectual


countenance
.


this
be
explanatory
,

not
satisfactory
.
Master
Bates

it
so
;

,

who


deem
it
prudent
in

side

at
one

,
clean
out

back

more
agility

I

little
harm

the
man
by
the
sleeve

towards
the
boy
.


Mr.
Sikes
content
himself
with
tie
an
imaginary
knot
under
his
left


ear
,
and
jerk
his
head
over
on
the
right
shoulder
;
a
piece
of
dumb


show
which
the
Jew
appear
to
understand
perfectly
.
he
then
,

ca
nt


term
,
with
which
his
whole
conversation
be
plentifully
besprinkle
,

which
would
be
quite
unintelligible
if
they
be
record
here
,


demand
a
glass
of
liquor
.


'
and
mind
you
do
n't
 
poison
it
,
'
say
Mr.
Sikes
,
lay
his
hat
upon
the


table
.


this
be
say
in
jest
;
but
if
the
speaker
could
have
see
the
evil
leer


with
which
the
Jew
bite
his
pale
lip
as
he
turn
round
to
the
cupboard
,


he
might
have
think
the
caution
not
wholly
unnecessary
,
or
the
wish


 
at
all
event
 
to
improve
upon
the
distiller
's
ingenuity
not
very
far


from
the
old
gentleman
's
merry
heart
.


after
swallow
two
of
three
glass
of
spirit
,
Mr.
Sikes


condescend
to
take
some
notice
of
the
young
gentleman
;
which
gracious


act
lead
to
a
conversation
,
in
which
the
cause
and
manner
of
Oliver
's


capture
be
circumstantially
detailed
,
with
such
alteration
and


improvement
on
the
truth
,
as
to
the
Dodger
appear
most
advisable


under
the
circumstance
.


'
I
be
afraid
,
'
say
the
Jew
,
'
that
he
may
say
something
which
will
get


we
into
trouble
.
'


'
that
be
very
likely

Sikes
with
a
malicious
grin

'
you

blow
upon

Fagin

'

I
be
afraid
,
you
see
,

add
the
Jew
,
speak
as
if
he
have
not


notice
the
interruption
;
and
regard
the
other
closely
as
he
do


so
,
-
'
I
be
afraid
that
,
if
the
game
be
up
with
we
,
it
might
be
up
with


a
good
many
more
,
and
that
it
would
come
out
rather
bad
for
you
than


it
would
for
I
,
my
dear
.
'


the
man
start
,
and
turn
round
upon
the
Jew
.
but
the
old


gentleman
's
shoulder
be
shrug
up
to
his
ear
;
and
his
eye
be


vacantly
stare
on
the
opposite
wall
.


there
be
a
long
pause
.
every
member
of
the
respectable
coterie


appear
plunge
in
his
own
reflection
;
not
except
the
dog
,
who
by


a
certain
malicious
licking
of
his
lip
seem
to
be
meditate
an


attack
upon
the
leg
of
the
first
gentleman
or
lady
he
might
encounter


in
the
street
when
he
go
out
.


'
somebody
must
find
out
wot
be
be
do
at
the
office
,
'
say
Mr.
Sikes


in
a
much
low
tone
than
he
have
take
since
he
come
in
.


the
Jew
nod
assent
.


'
if
he
have
n't
 
peach
,
and
be
commit
,
there
be
no
fear
till
he
come


out
again
,
'
say
Mr.
Sikes
,
'
and
then
he
must
be
take
care
on
.
you


must
get
hold
of
he
somehow
.
'


again
the
Jew
nod
.


the
prudence
of
this
line
of
action
,
indeed
,
be
obvious
;
but
,


unfortunately
,
there
be
one
very
strong
objection
to
its
being


adopt
.
this
be
,
that
the
Dodger
,

Charley
Bates
,

Fagin
,

Mr.
William
Sikes
,
happen
,
one
and
all
,
to
entertain
a
violent
and


deeply
-
root
antipathy
to
go
near
a
police
-
office
on
any
ground
or


pretext
whatever
.


how
long
they
might
have
sit
and
look
at
each
other
,
in
a
state
of


uncertainty
not
the
most
pleasant
of
its
kind
,
it
be
difficult
to


guess
.
it
be
not
necessary
to
make
any
guess
on
the
subject
,


however
;
for
the
sudden
entrance
of
the
two
young
lady
whom
Oliver


have
see
on
a
former
occasion

up
to
the

my

the

coaxingly

it
be
due
to
the
young
lady
to
say
that
she
do
not
positively
affirm


that
she
would
not

that
she
merely

emphatic

earnest

frill
that
border

despite
that
important
personal
advantage
,
that
she
go
so


far
as
to
say
:
look
at

with
great
complacency
from

to


foot
,
that
she
really
do
n't
 
think
it
would
have
be
possible
,
on
the


long
notice

to
make
the

more
experienced
people
than

in
the
object

endeavour
to
benefit
;
but
I
feel
strongly
disposed
to
trust
you
,


nevertheless
;
and
I
be
more
interested
in
your

than
I
can
well


account
for
,
even
to
myself

the
happiness

life
lie
bury
there
too

as
the
old
gentleman
say
this
in
a
low
voice

more
to

to

silent
for
a
short
time
afterwards

old
gentleman
at
length
,
in
a
more
cheerful


tone
,
'
I
only
say
this
,
because
you

a
young
heart
;

know


that
I
have
suffer
great
pain

will
be
more
careful
,


perhaps
,

I
again

an
orphan

be
able
to
make

confirm
the
statement

I
hear
your
story
;
where

a
little
rough
in


his
manner

inmost
recess

heart

strongly
disposed
to
admit
that
Oliver
's
appearance

manner
be
unusually
prepossess
;
but
he
have
a
strong
appetite
for


contradiction

sharpen
on
this
occasion
by
the
finding
of
the


orange
-
peel
;

well
-
look

admit
that
on
no
one


point
of
inquiry
could
he
yet
return
a
satisfactory
answer
;
and
that
he


have
postpone
any
investigation
into
Oliver
's
previous
history
until
he


think
the
boy
be
strong
enough
to
hear
it
;
Mr.

chuckle


maliciously
.
and
he
demand
,
with
a
sneer
,
whether
the
housekeeper


be
in
the
habit
of
count
the
plate
at
night
;
because
if

do
n't


find
a
table

spoon
or
two
miss
some
sunshiny
morning
,
why
,
he
would


be
content

so
forth
.

,

of

the


moment

,

silent
expectation
,
with
the
watch

it
be
worthy
of
remark
,
as
illustrate
the
importance
we
attach
to
our


own
judgment
,

the
pride
with
which
we
put
forth
our
most
rash

hasty
conclusion

that
,

Mr.

a


bad

hearted

be
unfeignedly
sorry
to
see


his
respected
friend
dupe

deceive

he
really
do
most
earnestly

strongly
hope
at
that
moment

that
Oliver

so
dark
,
that
the
figure
on
the
dial

scarcely


discernible
;

there
the
two

very
FOND
of
OLIVER

,
the
MERRY
old
JEW
and
MISS
NANCY


be


in
the
obscure
parlour
of
a
low
public
-
house
,
in
the
filthy
part
of


Little
Saffron
Hill
;
a
dark
and
gloomy
den
,
where
a
flare
gas
-
light


burn
all
day
in
the
winter
-
time
;
and
where
no
ray
of
sun
ever
shine
in


the
summer
:
there
sit
,
brood
over
a
little
pewter
measure
and
a


small
glass
,
strongly
impregnated
with
the
smell
of
liquor
,
a
man
in
a


velveteen
coat
,
drab
short
,
half
-
boot
and
stocking
,
whom
even
by


that
dim
light
no
experienced
agent
of
the
police
would
have
hesitate


to
recognise
as
Mr.
William
Sikes
.
at
his
foot
,
sit
a
white
-
coated
,


red
-
eyed
dog
;
who
occupy
himself
,
alternately
,
in
wink
at
his


master
with
both
eye
at
the
same
time
;
and
in
lick
a
large
,
fresh


cut
on
one
side
of
his
mouth
,
which
appear
to
be
the
result
of
some


recent
conflict
.


'
keep
quiet
,
you
warmint
!
keep
quiet
!
'
say
Mr.
Sikes
,
suddenly


break
silence
.
whether
his
meditation
be
so
intense
as
to
be


disturb
by
the
dog
's
winking
,
or
whether
his
feeling
be
so
wrought


upon
by
his
reflection
that
they
require
all
the
relief
derivable


from
kick
an
unoffending
animal
to
allay
they
,
be
matter
for


argument
and
consideration
.
whatever
be
the
cause
,
the
effect
be
a


kick
and
a
curse
,
bestow
upon
the
dog
simultaneously
.


dog
be
not
generally
apt
to
revenge
injury
inflict
upon
they
by


their
master
;
but
Mr.
Sikes
's
dog
,
have
fault
of
temper
in
common


with
his
owner
,
and
labour
,
perhaps
,
at
this
moment
,
under
a


powerful
sense
of
injury
,
make
no
more
ado
but
at
once
fix
his
tooth


in
one
of
the
half
-
boot
.
having
give
in
a
hearty
shake
,
he
retire
,


growl
,
under
a
form
;
just
escape
the
pewter
measure
which
Mr.


sike
level
at
his
head
.


'
you
would
,
would
you
?
'
say
Sikes
,
seize
the
poker
in
one
hand
,
and


deliberately
open
with
the
other
a
large
clasp
-
knife
,
which
he
draw


from
his
pocket
.
'
come
here
,
you
bear
devil
!
come
here
!
d'ye
hear
?
'


the
dog
no
doubt
hear
;
because
Mr.
Sikes
speak
in
the
very
harsh


key
of
a
very
harsh
voice
;
but
,
appear
to
entertain
some


unaccountable
objection
to
have
his
throat
cut
,
he
remain
where
he


be
,
and
growl
more
fiercely
than
before
:
at
the
same
time
grasp


the
end
of
the
poker
between
his
tooth
,
and
bite
at
it
like
a
wild


beast
.


this
resistance
only
infuriate
Mr.
Sikes
the
more
;
who
,
drop
on


his
knee
,
begin
to
assail
the
animal
most
furiously
.
the
dog
jump


from
right
to
left
,
and
from
left
to
right
;
snap
,
growling
,
and


bark
;
the
man
thrust
and
swore
,
and
strike
and
blasphemed
;
and
the


struggle
be
reach
a
most
critical
point
for
one
or
other
;
when
,
the


door
suddenly
open
,
the
dog
dart
out
:
leave
Bill
Sikes
with
the


poker
and
the
clasp
-
knife
in
his
hand
.


there
must
always
be
two
party
to
a
quarrel
,
say
the
old
adage
.
Mr.


Sikes
,
be
disappoint
of
the
dog
's
participation
,
at
once

his
share
in

quarrel
to
the
new
comer

in

an
injunction

the
bell

it
be
answer
by
another
Jew
:
young
than
Fagin
,

nearly
as
vile


and
repulsive
in
appearance
.


Bill
Sikes
merely
point
to
the
empty
measure
.
the
Jew
,
perfectly


understand
the
hint
,
retire
to
fill
it
:
previously
exchange
a


remarkable
look
with
Fagin
,
who
raise
his
eye
for
an
instant
,
as
if


in
expectation
of
it
,
and
shake
his
head
in
reply
;
so
slightly
that
the


action
would
have
be
almost
imperceptible
to
an
observant
third


person
.
it
be
lose
upon
Sikes

at
the
moment
to
tie


the
boot

lace

possibly
,
if

the


brief
interchange
of
signal

a
penny
trumpet

lock
up

the
night
,
the
row

din
outside
make
the
thunder
old
jail
so
silent
,
that
I
could


almost
have
beat
my
brain
out
against
the
iron
plate
of
the
door
.
'


'
poor
fellow
!
'

Nancy
,

have
her

turn
towards
the


quarter

well
,

.
'


with
this
consolation
,
Mr.

appear
to
repress
a
rise
tendency


to
jealousy
,
and
,
clasp
Oliver
's
wrist
more
firmly
,
tell
he
to

out
again
.

Bill

I
'd
walk
round

round
the
place
till
I
drop
,
if
the
snow


be
on
the
ground
,
and
I
have

a
shawl
to
cover
I
.
'


'
and
what
good
would
that
do
?
'
inquire
the
unsentimental
Mr.
Sikes
.


'
unless
you
could
pitch
over
a
file
and
twenty
yard
of
good
stout


rope

you
might
as

walk
fifty
mile
off

at


all
,
for
all
the

'


the
girl
burst
into
a
laugh
;
draw
her
shawl
more
closely
round
she
;

they
walk
away
.
but
Oliver
feel
her
hand
tremble
,
and
,
look
up
in


her
face
as
they
pass
a
gas
-
lamp
,
see
that
it
have
turn
a
deadly


white
.


they
walk
on
,
by
little
-
frequent
and
dirty
way
,
for
a
full


half
-
hour
:
meet
very
few
people
,
and
those
appear
from
their


look
to
hold
much
the
same
position
in
society
as
Mr.
Sikes
himself
.


at
length
they
turn
into
a
very
filthy
narrow
street
,
nearly
full
of


old
-
clothe
shop
;
the
dog
run
forward
,
as
if
conscious
that
there


be
no
further
occasion
for
his
keeping
on
guard
,
stop
before
the


door
of
a
shop
that
be
closed
and
apparently
untenanted
;
the
house
be


in
a
ruinous
condition
,
and
on
the
door
be
nail
a
board
,
intimate


that
it
be
to
let
:

there
for
many

Sikes

cautiously
about

below
the
shutter
,
and
Oliver

the
sound
of
a
bell
.


they
cross
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
,
and
stand
for
a
few


moment
under
a
lamp
.
a
noise
,
as
if
a
sash
window

gently
raise
,


be
hear
;
and
soon
afterwards
the
door
softly
open
.
Mr.
Sikes
then


seize
the
terrified
boy
by
the
collar
with
very
little
ceremony
;
and


all
three
be
quickly
inside
the
house
.


the
passage
be
perfectly
dark
.
they
wait
,

person

glad

'


the
style
of
this
reply
,
as
well
as
the
voice
which
deliver
it
,


seem
familiar
to
Oliver
's
ear
:
but
it
be
impossible
to
distinguish


even
the
form
of
the
speaker
in
the
darkness
.


'
let

have
a
glim

recede
footstep
of
the
speaker

;

,
in
another
minute
,


the
form
of
Mr.
John
Dawkins
,

Artful
Dodger

in

not

to
bestow
any
other
mark
of


recognition
upon
Oliver
than
a
humourous
grin
;

,
turn
away
,


beckon
the
visitor
to

he
down
a
flight
of
stair

himself


flat
on
the
floor

pause
,

stare
at

tell
you
in
good

clear
of
I

there
be
something
about
a

woman
:

if
she
add
to
all


her
other
strong
passion
,
the
fierce
impulse
of
recklessness

despair
;
which
few
man
like
to
provoke
.
the
Jew
see
that
it
would
be


hopeless
to
affect
any
further
mistake
regard
the
reality
of
Miss


Nancy
's
rage
;
and
,
shrink
involuntarily
back
a
few
pace
,
cast
a


glance
,
half
imploring
and
half
cowardly
,
at
Sikes
:
as
if
to
hint
that


he
be
the
fit
person
to
pursue
the
dialogue
.


Mr.

thus
mutely
appeal
to
;

possibly
feel
his
personal


pride

influence
interested
in
the
immediate
reduction
of
Miss
Nancy


to
reason
;
give
utterance
to
about
a
couple
of
score
of
curse
and


threat
,
the
rapid
production
of
which
reflect
great
credit
on
the


fertility
of
his
invention

they

more


tangible
argument

'
what
do
you
mean
by
this
?
'

Sikes
;
back
the
inquiry
with
a
very


common
imprecation
concern
the
most
beautiful
of
human
feature
:


which
,

,
only
once
out
of
every
fifty
thousand

below

would
render
blindness

quiet

OLIVER
's
DESTINY
continue
UNPROPITIOUS
,
bring
a
great
man
to
LONDON


to
injure
his
reputation


it
be
the
custom
on
the
stage
,
in
all
good
murderous
melodrama
,
to


present
the
tragic
and
the
comic
scene
,
in
as
regular
alternation
,
as


the
layer
of
red
and
white
in
a
side
of
streaky
bacon
.
the
hero
sink


upon
his
straw
bed
,
weigh
down
by
fetter
and
misfortune
;
in
the


next
scene
,
his
faithful
but
unconscious
squire
regale
the
audience


with
a
comic
song
.
we
behold
,
with
throbbing
bosom
,
the
heroine
in


the
grasp
of
a
proud
and
ruthless
baron
:
her
virtue
and
her
life
alike


in
danger
,
draw
forth
her
dagger
to
preserve
the
one
at
the
cost
of


the
other
;
and
just
as
our
expectation
be
work
up
to
the
high


pitch
,
a
whistle
be
hear
,
and
we
be
straightway
transport
to
the


great
hall
of
the
castle
;
where
a
grey
-
head
seneschal
sing
a
funny


chorus
with
a
funny
body
of
vassal
,
who
be
free
of
all
sort
of


place
,
from
church
vault
to
palace
,
and
roam
about
in
company
,


carol
perpetually
.


such
change
appear
absurd
;
but
they
be
not
so
unnatural
as
they
would


seem
at
first
sight
.
the
transition
in
real
life
from
well
-
spread


board
to
death
-
bed
,
and
from
mourning
-
weed
to
holiday
garment
,
be


not
a
whit
less
startling
;
only
,
there
,
we
be
busy
actor
,
instead
of


passive
looker
-
on
,
which
make
a
vast
difference
.
the
actor
in
the


mimic
life
of
the
theatre
,
be
blind
to
violent
transition
and
abrupt


impulse
of
passion
or
feeling
,
which
,
present
before
the
eye
of


mere
spectator
,
be
at
once
condemn
as
outrageous
and
preposterous
.


as
sudden
shifting
of
the
scene
,
and
rapid
change
of
time
and
place
,


be
not
only
sanction
in
book
by
long
usage
,
but
be
by
many


consider
as
the
great
art
of
authorship
:
an
author
's
skill
in
his


craft
being
,
by
such
critic
,
chiefly
estimate
with
relation
to
the


dilemma
in
which
he
leave
his
character
at
the
end
of
every
chapter
:


this
brief
introduction
to
the
present
one
may
perhaps
be
deem


unnecessary
.
if
so
,
let
it
be
consider
a
delicate
intimation
on
the


part
of
the
historian
that
he
be
go
back
to
the
town
in
which
Oliver


Twist
be
bear
;
the
reader
take
it
for
grant
that
there
be
good


and
substantial
reason
for
make
the
journey
,
or
he
would
not
be


invite
to
proceed
upon
such
an
expedition
.


Mr.
Bumble
emerge
at
early
morning
from
the
workhouse
-
gate
,
and
walk


with
portly
carriage
and
commanding
step
,
up
the
High
Street
.
he
be


in
the
full
bloom
and
pride
of
beadlehood
;
his
cock
hat
and
coat
be


dazzle
in
the
morning
sun
;
he
clutch
his
cane
with
the
vigorous


tenacity
of
health
and
power
.
Mr.
Bumble
always
carry
his
head
high
;


but
this
morning
it
be
high
than
usual
.
there
be
an
abstraction
in


his
eye
,
an
elevation
in
his
air
,
which
might
have
warn
an
observant


strange
that
thought
be
pass
in
the
beadle
's
mind
,
too
great
for


utterance
.


Mr.
Bumble
stop
not
to
converse
with
the
small
shopkeeper
and


other
who
speak
to
he
,
deferentially
,
as
he
pass
along
.
he
merely


return
their
salutation
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
,
and
relax
not
in


his
dignified
pace
,
until
he
reach
the
farm
where
Mrs.
Mann
tend


the
infant
pauper
with
parochial
care
.

a
seat
,
as
any
common
jackanape
would

slowly

Mrs.

sigh
again
:
evidently
to
the


satisfaction

the
public
character

the
matter
before

quarter

session
at
Clerkinwell
.


and
I
very
much
question
,
'
add
Mr.
Bumble
,
draw
himself
up
,


'
whether
the
Clerkinwell
Sessions
will
not

wrong


box
before

have
do
with

'
oh
!

Mr.

;
'

if
the
Clerkinwell
Sessions
find
that
they


come
off
rather
bad
than
they
expect
,
the
Clerkinwell
Sessions
have


only
themselves
to
thank
.
'


there
be
so
much
determination
and
depth
of
purpose
about
the
menacing


manner
in
which
Mr.
Bumble
deliver
himself
of
these
word
,
that
Mrs.


Mann
appear
quite
awed
by
they
.
at
length
she
say
,


'
you
be
go
by
coach
,
sir
?
I
think
it
be
always
usual
to

they
pauper
in
cart

'


'
that
be
when

Mr.

.
'
they

both
in
a
very
low
state

caustically
;

at

portentous
solemnity

a
few
moment

reflection

commence
his
story

it
would
be
tedious
if

in
the

word
:
occupy
,
as
it


do
,
some
twenty
minute
in
the
telling
;
but
the
sum
and
substance
of


it
be
,
that
Oliver
be
a
foundling
,
bear
of
low
and
vicious
parent

that
he
have
,
from

no
well
quality
than


treachery
,
ingratitude
,

malice
.
that
he
have
terminate
his
brief


career
in
the
place
of
his
birth
,
by
make
a
sanguinary
and
cowardly


attack
on
an
unoffending
lad
,

run
away
in
the
night

time
from

master

upon
the
table

his
arm
again
,
he
then
await
Mr.
Brownlow
's


observation
.


'
I
fear
it
be
all
too
true
,
'
say
the
old
gentleman
sorrowfully
,
after


look
over
the
paper
.

this
be
not
much
for

would
gladly
have

treble
the
money

of
this


information
at
an
early
period
of

might
have


impart
a
very
different
colouring
to
his
little
history

be
too


late
to

it
now

gravely

five

forbore

the
bell
violently

chapter
XVIII


how
OLIVER
pass
his
time
in
the
improve
SOCIETY
of
his
REPUTABLE


friend


about
noon
next
day
,
when
the
Dodger
and
Master
Bates
have
go
out
to


pursue
their
customary
avocation
,
Mr.
Fagin
take
the
opportunity
of


read
Oliver
a
long
lecture
on
the
cry
sin
of
ingratitude
;
of


which
he
clearly
demonstrate
he
have
be
guilty
,
to
no
ordinary


extent
,
in
wilfully
absent
himself
from
the
society
of
his
anxious


friend
;
and
,
still
more
,
in
endeavour
to
escape
from
they
after
so


much
trouble
and
expense
have
be
incur
in
his
recovery
.
Mr.
Fagin


lay
great
stress
on
the
fact
of
his
having
take
Oliver
in
,
and


cherish
he
,
when
,
without
his
timely
aid
,
he
might
have
perish


with
hunger
;
and
he
relate
the
dismal
and
affect
history
of
a
young


lad
whom
,
in
his
philanthropy
,
he
have
succour
under
parallel


circumstance
,
but
who
,
prove
unworthy
of
his
confidence
and
evince


a
desire
to
communicate
with
the
police
,
have
unfortunately
come
to
be


hang
at
the
Old
Bailey
one
morning
.
Mr.
Fagin
do
not
seek
to


conceal
his
share
in
the
catastrophe
,
but
lament
with
tear
in
his


eye
that
the
wrong
-
head
and
treacherous
behaviour
of
the
young


person
in
question
,
have
render
it
necessary
that
he
should
become
the


victim
of
certain
evidence
for
the
crown
:
which
,
if
it
be
not


precisely
true
,
be
indispensably
necessary
for
the
safety
of
he
 
Mr.


fagin
 
and
a
few
select
friend
.
Mr.
Fagin
conclude
by
draw
a


rather
disagreeable
picture
of
the
discomfort
of
hanging
;
and
,
with


great
friendliness
and
politeness
of
manner
,
express
his
anxious


hope
that
he
might
never
be
oblige
to
submit
Oliver
Twist
to
that


unpleasant
operation
.


Little
Oliver
's
blood
run
cold
,
as
he
listen
to
the
Jew
's
word
,
and


imperfectly
comprehend
the
dark
threat
convey
in
they
.
that
it


be
possible
even
for
justice
itself
to
confound
the
innocent
with
the


guilty
when
they
be
in
accidental
companionship
,
he
know
already
;
and


that
deeply
-
lay
plan
for
the
destruction
of
inconveniently
know
or


over
-
communicative
person
,
have
be
really
devise
and
carry
out
by


the
Jew
on
more
occasion
than
one
,
he
think
by
no
mean
unlikely
,


when
he
recollect
the
general
nature
of
the
altercation
between
that


gentleman
and
Mr.
Sikes
:
which
seem
to
bear
reference
to
some


foregone
conspiracy
of
the
kind
.
as
he
glance
timidly
up
,
and
meet
the


Jew
's
search
look
,
he
feel
that
his
pale
face
and
tremble
limb


be
neither
unnoticed
nor
unrelished
by
that
wary
old
gentleman
.


the
Jew
,
smile
hideously
,
pat
Oliver
on
the
head
,
and
say
,
that


if
he
keep
himself
quiet
,
and
apply
himself
to
business
,
he
see
they


would
be
very
good
friend
yet
.
then
,
take
his
hat
,
and
cover


himself
with
an
old
patch
great
-
coat
,
he
go
out
,
and
lock
the


room
-
door
behind
he
.


and
so
Oliver
remain
all
that
day
,
and
for
the
great
part
of
many


subsequent
day
,
see
nobody
,
between
early
morning
and
midnight
,
and


leave
during
the
long
hour
to
commune
with
his
own
thought
.
which
,


never
fail
to
revert
to
his
kind
friend
,
and
the
opinion
they
must


long
ago
have
form
of
he
,
be
sad
indeed
.


after
the
lapse
of
a
week
or
so
,
the
Jew
leave
the
room
-
door
unlocked
;


and
he
be
at
liberty
to
wander
about
the
house
.


it
be
a
very
dirty
place
.
the
room
upstairs
have
great
high
wooden


chimney
-
piece
and
large
door
,
with
panel
wall
and
cornice
to
the


ceiling
;
which
,
although
they
be
black
with
neglect
and
dust
,
be


ornament
in
various
way
.
from
all
of
these
token
Oliver
conclude


that
a
long
time
ago
,
before
the
old
Jew
be
bear
,
it
have
belong
to


well
people
,
and
have
perhaps
be
quite
gay
and
handsome
:
dismal
and


dreary
as
it
look
now
.


spider
have
build
their
webs
in
the
angle
of
the
wall
and
ceiling
;


and
sometimes
,
when
Oliver
walk
softly
into
a
room
,
the
mouse
would


scamper
across
the
floor
,
and
run
back
terrified
to
their
hole
.
with


these
exception
,
there
be
neither
sight
nor
sound
of
any
live


thing
;
and
often
,
when
it
grow
dark
,
and
he
be
tired
of
wander
from


room
to
room
,
he
would
crouch
in
the
corner
of
the
passage
by
the


street
-
door
,
to
be
as
near
live
people
as
he
could
;
and
would
remain


there
,
listen
and
count
the
hour
,
until
the
Jew
or
the
boy


return
.


in
all
the
room
,
the
mouldering
shutter
be
fast
closed
:
the
bar


which
hold
they
be
screw
tight
into
the
wood
;
the
only
light
which


be
admit
,
steal
its
way
through
round
hole
at
the
top
:
which


make
the
room
more
gloomy
,
and
fill
they
with
strange
shadow
.


there
be
a
back
-
garret
window
with
rusty
bar
outside
,
which
have
no


shutter
;
and
out
of
this
,
Oliver
often
gaze
with
a
melancholy
face
for


hour
together
;
but
nothing
be
to
be
descry
from
it
but
a
confused


and
crowd
mass
of
housetop
,
blacken
chimney
,
and
gable
-
end
.


sometimes
,
indeed
,
a
grizzly
head
might
be
see
,
peer
over
the


parapet
-
wall
of
a
distant
house
;
but
it
be
quickly
withdraw
again
;


and
as
the
window
of
Oliver
's
observatory
be
nail
down
,
and
dim


with
the
rain
and
smoke
of
year
,
it
be
as
much
as
he
could
do
to
make


out
the
form
of
the
different
object
beyond
,
without
make
any


attempt
to
be
see
or
hear
,
-
which
he
have
as
much
chance
of
be
,
as


if
he
have
live
inside
the
ball
of
St.
Paul
's
Cathedral
.


one
afternoon
,
the
Dodger
and
Master
Bates
be
engage
out
that


evening
,
the
first
-
name
young
gentleman
take
it
into
his
head
to


evince
some
anxiety
regard
the
decoration
of
his
person
 
to
do
he


justice
,
this
be
by
no
mean
an
habitual
weakness
with
he
;
and
,
with


this
end
and
aim
,
he
condescendingly
command
Oliver
to
assist
he
in


his
toilet
,
straightway
.


Oliver
be
but
too
glad
to
make
himself
useful
;
too
happy
to
have
some


face
,
however
bad
,
to
look
upon
;
too
desirous
to
conciliate
those


about
he
when
he
could
honestly
do
so
;
to
throw
any
objection
in
the


way
of
this
proposal
.
so
he
at
once
express
his
readiness
;
and
,


kneel
on
the
floor
,
while
the
Dodger
sit
upon
the
table
so
that
he


could
take
his
foot
in
his
lap
,
he
apply
himself
to
a
process
which


Mr.
Dawkins
designate
as
'
japan
his
trotter
-
case
.
'
the
phrase
,


render
into
plain
English
,
signifieth
,
clean
his
boot
.


whether
it
be
the
sense
of
freedom
and
independence
which
a
rational


animal
may
be
suppose
to
feel
when
he
sit
on
a
table
in
an
easy


attitude
smoke
a
pipe
,
swinge
one
leg
carelessly
to
and
fro
,
and


have
his
boot
clean
all
the
time
,
without
even
the
past
trouble
of


having
take
they
off
,
or
the
prospective
misery
of
put
they
on
,
to


disturb
his
reflection
;
or
whether
it
be
the
goodness
of
the
tobacco


that
soothe
the
feeling
of
the
Dodger
,
or
the
mildness
of
the
beer


that
mollify
his
thought
;
he
be
evidently
tincture
,
for
the
nonce
,


with
a
spice
of
romance
and
enthusiasm
,
foreign
to
his
general
nature
.


he
look
down
on
Oliver
,
with
a
thoughtful
countenance
,
for
a
brief


space
;
and
then
,
raise
his
head
,
and
heave
a
gentle
sign
,
say
,


half
in
abstraction
,
and
half
to
Master
Bates
:


'
what
a
pity
it
be
he
be
n't
 
a
prig
!
'


'
ah
!
'
say
Master
Charles
Bates
;
'
he
do
n't
 
know
what
be
good
for
he
.
'


the
Dodger
sigh
again
,
and
resume
his
pipe
:
as
do
Charley
Bates
.


they
both
smoke
,
for
some
second
,
in
silence
.


'
I
suppose
you
do
n't
 
even
know
what
a
prig
be
?
'
say
the
Dodger


mournfully
.


'
I
think
I
know
that
,
'
reply
Oliver
,
look
up
.
'
it
be
a
the
-
;


you
be
one
,
be
you
not
?
'
inquire
Oliver
,
check
himself
.


'
I
be
,
'
reply
the
Doger
.
'
I
'd
scorn
to
be
anything

.
'
Mr.


dawkin
give
his
hat
a
ferocious
cock
,
after
deliver
this
sentiment
,


and
look
at
Master
Bates
,
as
if
to
denote
that
he
would
feel
oblige


by
his
say
anything
to
the
contrary
.


'
I

an

pantomimic


representation

numerous
pleasure
incidental
to
the


life
they
lead
,
intersperse
with
a
variety
of
hint
to
Oliver
that
the


good
thing
he
could
do
,
would
be
to
secure
Fagin

favour

more


delay

by
the
mean
which
they
themselves
have
employ
to

it

always
put
this
in

the
level

the
Jew

who

enter
unseen
by


Oliver
.
'
it
all
lie
in
a
nutshell
my
dear
;
in
a
nutshell
,
take
the


Dodger
's
word
for
it
.
ha
!
ha
!
ha
!
he
understand
the
catechism
of
his


trade
.
'


the
old
man
rub
his
hand
gleefully
together
,
as
he
corroborate
the


Dodger
's
reasoning
in
these
term
;
and
chuckle
with
delight
at
his


pupil
's
proficiency
.


the
conversation
proceed
no
far
at
this
time
,
for
the
Jew
have


return
home
accompany
by
Miss
Betsy
,
and
a
gentleman
whom
Oliver


have
never
see
before
,
but
who
be
accost
by
the
Dodger
as
Tom


chitle
;
and
who
,
having
linger
on
the
stair
to
exchange
a
few


gallantry
with
the
lady
,
now
make
his
appearance
.


Mr.
Chitling
be
old
in
year
than
the
Dodger
:
have
perhaps


number
eighteen
winter
;
but
there
be
a
degree
of
deference
in
his


deportment
towards
that
young
gentleman
which
seem
to
indicate
that


he
feel
himself
conscious
of
a
slight
inferiority
in
point
of
genius


and
professional
aquirement
.
he
have
small
twinkle
eye
,
and
a


pock
-
mark
face
;
wear
a
fur
cap
,
a
dark
corduroy
jacket
,
greasy


fustian
trouser
,
and
an
apron
.
his
wardrobe
be
,
in
truth
,
rather
out


of
repair
;
but
he
excuse
himself
to
the
company
by
state
that
his


'
time
'
be
only
out
an
hour
before
;
and
that
,
in
consequence
of
have


wear
the
regimental
for
six
week
past
,
he
have
not
be
able
to
bestow


any
attention
on
his
private
clothe
.
Mr.
Chitling
add
,
with
strong


mark
of
irritation
,
that
the
new
way
of
fumigate
clothe
up
yonder


be
infernal
unconstitutional
,
for
it
burn
hole
in
they
,
and
there


be
no
remedy
against
the
County
.
the
same
remark
he
consider
to


apply
to
the
regulation
mode
of
cut
the
hair
:
which
he
hold
to
be


decidedly
unlawful
.
Mr.
Chitling
wind
up
his
observation
by
state


that
he
have
not
touch
a
drop
of
anything
for
forty
-
two
moral
long


hard
-
work
day
;
and
that
he
'
wish
he
might
be
bust
if
he
warn't


as
dry
as
a
lime
-
basket
.
'


'
where
do
you
think
the
gentleman
have
come
from
,
Oliver
?
'
inquire
the


Jew
,
with
a
grin
,
as
the
other
boy
put
a
bottle
of
spirit
on
the


table
.


'
i
-
I
-
do
n't
 
know
,
sir
,
'
reply
Oliver
.


'
who
be
that
?
'
inquire
Tom
Chitling
,
cast
a
contemptuous
look
at


Oliver
.


'
a
young
friend
of
mine
,
my
dear
,
'

the
Jew
.


'
he
be
in
luck
,
then
,
'
say
the
young
man
,
with
a
meaning
look
at
Fagin
.


'
never
mind
where
I
come
from
,
young
'
un
;
you
'll
find
your
way
there
,


soon
enough
,
I
'll
bet
a
crown
!
'


at
this
sally
,
the
boy
laugh
.
after
some
more
joke
on
the
same


subject
,
they
exchange
a
few
short
whisper
with
Fagin
;
and
withdraw
.


after
some
word
apart
between
the
last
comer
and
Fagin
,
they
draw


their
chair
towards
the
fire
;
and
the
Jew
,
tell
Oliver
to
come
and


sit
by
he
,
lead
the
conversation
to
the
topic
most
calculate
to


interest
his
hearer
.
these
be
,
the
great
advantage
of
the
trade
,


the
proficiency
of
the
Dodger
,
the
amiability
of
Charley
Bates
,
and
the


liberality
of
the
Jew
himself
.
at
length
these
subject
display


sign
of
be
thoroughly
exhausted
;
and
Mr.
Chitling
do
the
same
:

with
strong
thick
sol
,

his
bedside
;

that
his
old
shoe
have
be
remove
.
at
first
,
he
be


pleased
with
the
discovery
:
hope
that
it
might
be
the
forerunner
of


his
release
;
but
such
thought
be
quickly
dispel
,
on
his
sitting


down
to
breakfast
along
with
the
Jew
,
who
tell
he
,
in
a
tone
and


manner
which
increase
his
alarm
,
that
he

to
be
take
to
the


residence
of

very
glad

away
with
a
disappointed
countenance
from


a
close
perusal
of
the
boy
's
face
.
'
wait

much
vex
by
Oliver
's
not

great


curiosity
on
the
subject
;
but
the
truth
be
,
that
,
although
Oliver
feel


very
anxious
,
he
be
too
much
confuse
by
the
earnest
cunning
of


Fagin
's
look
,
and
his
own
speculation
,
to
make
any
further
inquiry


just
then
.
he
have
no
other
opportunity
:
for
the
Jew
remain
very


surly
and
silent
till
night
:
when
he
prepare
to
go
abroad
.


'
you
may
burn
a
candle
,
'

Jew
,
put
one
upon
the
table
.


'
and
here

a
book

to
the
door
:

so
;
and
,
as
he

candlestick
upon
the
table
,


see
that
the
Jew
be
gaze
fixedly
at
he
,
with
lowering
and


contract
brow
,
from
the
dark
end
of
the
room
.


'
take
heed
,
Oliver
!
take
heed
!
'
say
the
old
man
,
shake
his
right


hand
before
he
in
a
warning
manner
.
'
he
be
a
rough
man
,
and
think


nothing
of
blood
when
his
own
be
up
.
whatever
fall
out
,
say
nothing
;


and
do
what
he
bid
you
.
mind
!
'
place
a
strong
emphasis
on
the
last


word
,
he
suffer
his
feature
gradually
to
resolve
themselves
into
a


ghastly
grin
,
and
,
nod
his
head
,
leave
the
room
.


Oliver
lean
his
head
upon
his
hand
when
the
old
man
disappear
,
and


ponder
,
with
a
tremble
heart
,
on
the
word
he
have
just
hear
.
the


more
he
think
of
the
Jew
's
admonition
,
the
more
he
be
at
a
loss
to


divine
its
real
purpose
and
meaning
.


he
could
think
of
no
bad
object
to
be
attain
by
send
he
to
Sikes
,


which
would
not
be
equally
well
answer
by
his
remain
with
Fagin
;


and
after
meditate
for
a
long
time
,
conclude
that
he
have
be


select
to
perform
some
ordinary
menial
office
for
the
housebreaker
,


until
another
boy
,
well
suit
for
his
purpose
could
be
engage
.
he


be
too
well
accustomed
to
suffering
,
and
have
suffer
too
much
where


he
be
,
to
bewail
the
prospect
of
change
very
severely
.
he
remain


lose
in
thought
for
some
minute
;
and
then
,
with
a
heavy
sigh
,
snuff


the
candle
,
and
,
take
up
the
book
which
the
Jew
have
leave
with
he
,


begin
to
read
.


he
turn
over
the
leave
.
carelessly
at
first
;
but
,
light
on
a


passage
which
attract
his
attention
,
he
soon
become
intent
upon
the


volume
.
it
be
a
history
of
the
life
and
trial
of
great
criminal
;


and
the
page
be
soil
and
thumb
with
use
.
here
,
he
read
of


dreadful
crime
that
make
the
blood
run
cold
;
of
secret
murder
that


have
be
commit
by
the
lonely
wayside
;
of
body
hide
from
the
eye


of
man
in
deep
pit
and
well
:
which
would
not
keep
they
down
,
deep
as


they
be
,
but
have
yield
they
up
at
last
,
after
many
year
,
and
so


madden
the
murderer
with
the
sight
,
that
in
their
horror
they
have


confess
their
guilt
,
and
yell
for
the
gibbet
to
end
their
agony
.


here
,
too
,
he
read
of
man
who
,
lie
in
their
bed
at
dead
of
night
,


have
be
tempt
 
so
they
say
 
and
lead
on
,
by
their
own
bad
thought
,


to
such
dreadful
bloodshed
as
it
make
the
flesh
creep
,
and
the
limb


quail
,
to
think
of
.
the
terrible
description
be
so
real
and
vivid
,


that
the
sallow
page
seem
to
turn
red
with
gore
;
and
the
word
upon


they
,
to
be
sound
in
his
ear
,
as
if
they
be
whisper
,
in
hollow


murmur
,
by
the
spirit
of
the
dead
.


in
a
paroxysm
of
fear
,
the
boy
close
the
book
,
and
thrust
it
from
he
.


then
,
fall
upon
his
knee
,
he
pray
Heaven
to
spare
he
from
such


deed
;
and
rather
to
will
that
he
should
die
at
once
,
than
be
reserve


for
crime
,
so
fearful
and
appalling
.
by
degree
,
he
grow
more
calm
,


and
besought
,
in
a
low
and
broken
voice
,
that
he
might

find
to

reflection

pursuance
of
this
request
,
Nancy
quickly
lay
the
cloth
;


disappear
for
a
few
minute
,
she
presently
return
with
a
pot
of


porter
and
a
dish
of
sheep
's
head
:
which
give
occasion
to
several


pleasant
witticism
on
the
part
of
Mr.
Sikes
,
found
upon
the
singular


coincidence
of
'
jemmy
'
be
a
can
name
,
common
to
they
,
and
also
to


an
ingenious
implement
much
use
in
his
profession
.
indeed
,
the
worthy


gentleman
,
stimulate
perhaps
by
the
immediate
prospect
of
be
on


active
service
,
be
in
great
spirit
and
good
humour
;
in
proof
whereof
,


it
may
be
here
remark
,
that
he
humourously
drink
all
the
beer
at
a


draught
,
and
do
not
utter
,
on
a
rough
calculation
,
more
than


four
-
score
oath
during
the
whole
progress
of
the
meal
.


supper
be
end
-
it
may
be
easily
conceive
that
Oliver
have
no
great


appetite
for
it
-
Mr.
Sikes
dispose
of
a
couple
of
glass
of
spirit


and
water
,
and
throw
himself
on

bed
;
order
Nancy
,
with
many


imprecation
in

it
not
impossible
that
Nancy


might
seek
that
opportunity

some
further
advice
;

the

brood
over

fate

his

very
little


morsel
far
from
the
fire

it
be
a
round
table
;
and
as
Mrs.

Mr.

have
be


sit
opposite
each
other
,
with
no
great
space
between
they
,
and


front
the
fire
,
it
will
be
see
that

in
recede
from


the
fire
,

still
keep
at
the
table
,
increase
the
distance


between
himself

Mrs.

;
which
proceed
,
some
prudent
reader


will
doubtless
be
dispose
to
admire
,
and
to
consider
an
act
of
great


heroism
on
Mr.
Bumble
's
part
:
he
be
in
some
sort
tempt
by
time
,


place
,
and
opportunity
,
to
give
utterance
to
certain
soft
nothing
,


which
however
well
they
may
become
the
lip
of
the
light
and


thoughtless
,
do
seem
immeasurably
beneath
the
dignity
of
judge
of
the


land
,
member
of
parliament
,
minister
of
state
,
lord
mayor
,
and
other


great
public
functionary
,
but
more
particularly
beneath
the


stateliness
and
gravity
of
a
beadle
:
who
 
as
be
well
know
 
should
be


the
stern
and
most
inflexible
among
they
all
.


whatever
be
Mr.
Bumble
's
intention
,
however
 
and
no
doubt
they
be


of
the
good
:
it
unfortunately
happen
,
as
have
be
twice
before


remark
,
that
the
table
be
a
round
one
;
consequently
Mr.
Bumble
,


move
his
chair
by
little
and
little
,
soon
begin
to
diminish
the


distance
between
himself
and
the
matron
;
and
,
continue
to
travel


round
the
outer
edge
of
the
circle
,
bring
his
chair
,
in
time
,
close


to
that
in
which
the
matron
be
seat
.


indeed
,
the
two
chair
touch
;
and
when
they
do
so
,
Mr.
Bumble


stop
.


now
,
if
the
matron
have
move
her
chair
to
the
right
,
she
would
have


be
scorch
by
the
fire
;
and
if
to
the
left
,
she
must
have
fall


into
Mr.
Bumble
's
arm
;
so
 
be
a
discreet
matron
,
and
no
doubt


foresee
these
consequence
at
a
glance
 
she
remain
where
she
be
,


and
hand
Mr.
Bumble
another
cup
of
tea

hearted

Mr.

his

look
up
into
the

face
;

'


'

'
exclaim
the
matron
,

a
very
curious
question

single
man
.
what
can
you
want
to
know
for
,
Mr.

'


the
beadle
drink
his
tea
to
the
last
drop
;
finish
a
piece
of
toast
;


whisk
the
crumb
off
his
knee
;
wipe
his
lip
;
and
deliberately


kiss
the
matron
.


'
Mr.
Bumble
!
'
cry
that
discreet
lady
in
a
whisper
;
for
the
fright

so
great
,
that
she

quite

her
voice

'
Mr.
Bumble
make
no
reply
;
but
in
a
slow
and
dignified
manner
,


put
his
arm
round
the
matron
's
waist
.


as
the
lady
have
state
her
intention
of
scream
,
of
course
she
would


have
scream
at
this
additional
boldness
,
but
that
the
exertion
be


render
unnecessary
by
a
hasty
knock
at
the
door
:

be
no

,
than
Mr.

much
agility

with
great
violence
:
while
the
matron


sharply
demand
who
be
there
.


it
be
worthy
of
remark
,
as
a
curious
physical
instance
of
the
efficacy


of
a
sudden
surprise
in
counteract
the
effect
of
extreme
fear
,

at
this

worthy
Mrs.

a
variety
of


invective
against
old
woman
who
could

even
die
without
purposely


annoy
their
better

herself
in
a
thick
shawl

his
curiosity
on
these
point

on
his
cocked

much
gravity

extraordinary
performance

off

the


countenance
of

settle
into
the

look

in
the


affirmative

terrible

she
soon
drop
off
.
she


have

I
ai

WHEREIN
this

to
MR
.
FAGIN
and
COMPANY


while
these
thing
be
pass
in
the
country
workhouse
,
Mr.
Fagin
sit


in
the
old
den
-
the
same
from
which
Oliver
have
be
remove
by
the


girl
-
brood
over
a
dull
,
smoky
fire
.
he
hold
a
pair
of
bellow
upon


his
knee
,
with
which
he
have
apparently
be
endeavour
to
rouse
it


into
more
cheerful
action
;
but
he
have
fall
into
deep
thought
;
and


with
his
arm
fold
on
they
,
and
his
chin
rest
on
his
thumb
,
fix


his
eye
,
abstractedly
,
on
the
rusty
bar
.


at
a
table
behind
he
sit
the
Artful
Dodger
,
Master
Charles
Bates
,
and


Mr.
Chitling
:
all
intent
upon
a
game
of
whist
;
the
Artful
take
dummy


against
Master
Bates
and
Mr.
Chitling
.
the
countenance
of
the


first
-
name
gentleman
,
peculiarly
intelligent
at
all
time
,
acquire


great
additional
interest
from
his
close
observance
of
the
game
,
and


his
attentive
perusal
of
Mr.
Chitling
's
hand
;
upon
which
,
from
time
to


time
,
as
occasion
serve
,
he
bestow
a
variety
of
earnest
glance
:


wisely
regulate
his
own
play
by
the
result
of
his
observation
upon


his
neighbour
's
card
.
it
be
a
cold
night
,
the
Dodger
wear
his
hat
,


as
,
indeed
,
be
often
his
custom
within
door
.
he
also
sustain
a


clay
pipe
between
his
tooth
,
which
he
only
remove
for
a
brief
space


when
he
deem
it
necessary
to
apply
for
refreshment
to
a
quart
pot


upon
the
table
,
which
stand
ready
fill
with
gin
-
and
-
water
for
the


accommodation
of
the
company
.


Master
Bates
be
also
attentive
to
the
play
;
but
be
of
a
more


excitable
nature
than
his
accomplished
friend
,
it
be
observable
that


he
more
frequently
apply
himself
to
the
gin
-
and
-
water
,
and
moreover


indulge
in
many
jest
and
irrelevant
remark
,
all
highly
unbecoming
a


scientific
rubber
.
indeed
,
the
Artful
,
presume
upon
their
close


attachment
,
more
than
once
take
occasion
to
reason
gravely
with
his


companion
upon
these
impropriety
;
all
of
which
remonstrance
,
Master


bate
receive
in
extremely
good
part
;
merely
request
his
friend
to


be
'
blow
,
'
or
to
insert
his
head
in
a
sack
,
or
reply
with
some


other
neatly
-
turn
witticism
of
a
similar
kind
,
the
happy
application


of
which
,
excited
considerable
admiration
in
the
mind
of
Mr.
Chitling
.


it
be
remarkable
that
the
latter
gentleman
and
his
partner
invariably


lose
;
and
that
the
circumstance
,
so
far
from
anger
Master
Bates
,


appear
to
afford
he
the
high
amusement
,
inasmuch
as
he
laugh


most
uproariously
at
the
end
of
every
deal
,
and
protest
that
he
have


never
see
such
a
jolly
game
in
all
his
bear
day
.


'
that
be
two
double
and
the
rub
,
'
say
Mr.
Chitling
,
with
a
very
long


face
,
as
he
draw
half
-
a
-
crown
from
his
waistcoat
-
pocket
.
'
I
never
see


such
a
feller
as
you

you
win
everything

when

either
the
master

the
manner
of
this
remark
,
which
be
make
very


ruefully
,
delight
Charley
Bates
so
much
,
that
his
consequent
shout
of


laughter
rouse
the
Jew
from
his
reverie
,
and
induce
he
to
inquire


what
be
the
matter
.

back

wave
his
hand
to
intimate
that
he


preferred

,

,
as
the
little
man
could
not
very


easily
disengage
himself
from

the
Three

the
Cripples
;

the
sign

man
at
the
bar

straight


upstairs
,
and
open
the
door
of
a
room
,
and
softly
insinuate


himself
into
the
chamber
,
look
anxiously
about
:
shade
his
eye
with


his
hand
,
as
if
in

of
some
particular
person

two

red
,
from

visible
outside
.
the
ceiling

blacken
,
to
prevent


its
colour
from
be
injure
by
the
flaring
of
the
lamp
;
and
the


place
be
so
full
of
dense
tobacco
smoke
,
that
at
first
it
be
scarcely


possible
to
discern
anything
more
.
by
degree
,
however
,
as
some
of
it


clear
away
through
the
open
door
,
an
assemblage
of
head
,
as
confuse


as
the
noise
that
greet
the
ear
,
might
be
make
out
;
and
as
the
eye


grow
more
accustomed
to
the
scene
,
the
spectator
gradually
become
aware


of
the
presence
of
a
numerous
company
,
male
and
female
,
crowd
round
a


long
table
:
at
the
upper
end
of
which
,
sit
a
chairman
with
a
hammer
of


office
in
his
hand
;
while
a
professional
gentleman
with
a
bluish
nose
,


and
his
face
tie
up
for
the
benefit
of
a
toothache
,
preside
at
a


jingle
piano
in
a
remote
corner
.


as
Fagin
step
softly
in
,
the
professional
gentleman
,
run
over


the
key
by
way
of
prelude
,
occasion
a
general
cry
of
order
for
a


song
;
which
having
subside
,
a
young
lady
proceed
to
entertain
the


company
with
a
ballad
in
four
verse
,
between
each
of
which
the


accompanyist
play
the
melody
all
through
,
as
loud
as
he
could
.
when


this
be
over
,
the
chairman
give
a
sentiment
,
after
which
,
the


professional
gentleman
on
the
chairman
's
right
and
leave
volunteer
a


duet
,
and
sing
it
,
with
great
applause
.


it
be
curious
to
observe
some
face
which
stand
out
prominently
from


among
the
group
.
there
be
the
chairman
himself
,
 
the
landlord
of
the


house
,
 
a
coarse
,
rough
,
heavy
build
fellow
,
who
,
while
the
song
be


proceeding
,
roll
his
eye
hither
and
thither
,
and
,
seem
to
give


himself
up
to
joviality
,
have
an
eye
for
everything
that
be
do
,
and


an
ear
for
everything
that
be
say
-
and
sharp
one
,
too
.
near
he


be
the
singer
:
receive
,
with
professional
indifference
,
the


compliment
of
the
company
,
and
apply
themselves
,
in
turn
,
to
a


dozen
proffer
glass
of
spirit
and
water
,
tender
by
their
more


boisterous
admirer
;
whose
countenance
,
expressive
of
almost
every


vice
in
almost
every
grade
,
irresistibly
attract
the
attention
,
by


their
very
repulsiveness
.
cunning
,
ferocity
,
and
drunkeness
in
all
its


stage
,
be
there
,
in
their
strong
aspect
;
and
woman
:
some
with
the


last
linger
tinge
of
their
early
freshness
almost
fade
as
you


look
:
other
with
every
mark
and
stamp
of
their
sex
utterly
beat


out
,
and
present
but
one
loathsome
blank
of
profligacy
and
crime
;


some
mere
girl
,
other
but
young
woman
,
and
none
past
the
prime
of


life
;
form
the
darkest
and
sad
portion
of
this
dreary
picture
.


Fagin
,
trouble
by
no
grave
emotion
,
look
eagerly
from
face
to
face


while
these
proceeding
be
in
progress
;
but
apparently
without

be
in

,
at
length
,

the
girl

his
crafty
face


narrowly

into

speak
not

the

her
foot

himself

covertly

as
many

out
some
half
intelligible

Fagin
put
several
other
question
:
all
with
the
same
drift
of


ascertain
whether
the
girl
have
profit
by
his
unguarded
hint
;
but
,


she
answer
they
so
readily
,
and
be
withal
so
utterly
unmove
by
his


search
look
,
that
his
original
impression
of
she
be
more
than
a


trifle
in
liquor
,
be
confirm
.
Nancy
,
indeed
,
be
not
exempt
from
a


fail
which
be
very
common
among
the
Jew

female
pupil
;

in


which
,
in
their
tenderer
year

they
be
rather
encouraged

check
.
her
disorder
appearance
,
and
a
wholesale
perfume
of
Geneva


which
pervade
the
apartment
,
afford
strong
confirmatory
evidence
of


the
justice
of
the
Jew
's
supposition
;

indulge
in

temporary
display
of
violence

subside
,

into


dullness
,

afterwards
into
a
compound
of
feeling
:
under
the


influence
of
which
she
shed
tear
one
minute
,

in
the
next
give


utterance
to
various
exclamation
of

satisfaction

distinguishable
beyond
a
few
disjointed
word
here

listener

to

defend
himself
against
some
remark
of
the
stranger

considerable
irritation

they
might
have

,

a
quarter
of
an
hour

more
,

Monks
-
by
which


name
the
Jew
have
designate
the
strange
man
several
time
in
the
course


of

his
voice
a
little
,

UNCEREMONIOUSLY

as
it

palest
of
the


party
.


'
so
I
do
,
'
reply
the
man
.
'
it
be
natural
and
proper
to
be
afraid
,


under
such
circumstance
.
I
be
.
'


'
so
be
I
,
'
say
brittle
;
'
only
there
be
no
call
to
tell
a
man
he
be
,
so


bounceably
.
'


these
frank
admission
soften
Mr.
Giles
,
who
at
once
own
that
he


be
afraid
;
upon
which
,
they
all
three
face
about
,
and
run
back
again


with
the
complete
unanimity
,
until
Mr.
Giles
 
who
have
the
short


wind
of
the
party
,
as
be
encumber
with
a
pitchfork
 
most
handsomely


insist
on
stop
,
to
make
an
apology
for
his
hastiness
of
speech
.


'
but
it
be
wonderful
,
'
say
Mr.
Giles
,
when
he
have
explain
,
'
what
a


man
will
do
,
when
his
blood
be
up
.
I
should
have
commit
murder
-
I


know
I
should
-
if
we
have
catch
one
of
they
rascal
.
'


as
the
other
two
be
impressed
with
a
similar
presentiment
;
and
as


their
blood
,
like
his
,
have
all
go
down
again
;
some
speculation
ensue


upon
the
cause
of
this
sudden
change
in
their
temperament
.


'
I
know
what
it
be
,
'
say
Mr.
Giles
;
'
it
be
the
gate
.
'


'
I
should
n't
 
wonder
if
it
be
,
'
exclaim
Brittles
,
catch
at
the


idea
.


'
you
may
depend
upon
it
,
'
say
Giles
,
'
that
that
gate
stop
the
flow


of
the
excitement
.
I
feel
all
mine
suddenly
go
away
,
as
I
be


climb
over
it
.
'


by
a
remarkable
coincidence
,
the
other
two
have
be
visit
with
the


same
unpleasant
sensation
at
that
precise
moment
.
it
be
quite


obvious
,
therefore
,
that
it
be
the
gate
;
especially
as
there
be
no


doubt
regard
the
time
at
which
the
change
have
take
place
,
because


all
three
remember
that
they
have
come
in
sight
of
the
robber
at
the


instant
of
its
occurance
.


this
dialogue
be
hold
between
the
two
man
who
have
surprise
the


burglar
,
and
a
travel
tinker
who
have
be
sleep
in
an
outhouse
,


and
who
have
be
rouse
,
together
with
his
two
mongrel
cur
,
to
join
in


the
pursuit
.
Mr.
Giles
act
in
the
double
capacity
of
butler
and


steward
to
the
old
lady
of
the
mansion
;
Brittles
be
a
lad
of
all
-
work
:


who
,
having
enter
her
service
a
mere
child
,
be
treat
as
a


promise
young
boy
still
,
though
he
be
something
past
thirty
.


encourage
each
other
with
such
converse
as
this
;
but
,
keep
very


close
together
,
notwithstanding
,
and
look
apprehensively
round
,


whenever
a
fresh
gust
rattle
through
the
bough
;
the
three
man
hurry


back
to
a
tree
,
behind
which
they
have
leave
their
lantern
,
lest
its


light
should
inform
the
thief
in
what
direction
to
fire
.
catch
up


the
light
,
they
make
the
good
of
their
way
home
,
at
a
good
round
trot
;


and
long
after
their
dusky
form
have
cease
to
be
discernible
,
the


light
might
have
be
see
twinkle
and
dance
in
the
distance
,
like


some
exhalation
of
the
damp
and
gloomy
atmosphere
through
which
it
be


swiftly
bear
.


the
air
grow
cold
,
as
day
come
slowly
on
;
and
the
mist
roll
along


the
ground
like
a
dense
cloud
of
smoke
.
the
grass
be
wet
;
the


pathway
,
and
low
place
,
be
all
mire
and
water
;
the
damp
breath
of


an
unwholesome
wind
go
languidly
by
,
with
a
hollow
moaning
.
still
,


Oliver
lie
motionless
and
insensible
on
the
spot
where
Sikes
have
leave


he
.


morning
draw
on
apace
.
the
air
become
more
sharp
and
pierce
,
as
its


first
dull
hue
-
the
death
of
night
,
rather
than
the
birth
of


day
-
glimmer
faintly
in
the
sky
.
the
object
which
have
look
dim


and
terrible
in
the
darkness
,
grow
more
and
more
define
,
and
gradually


resolve
into
their
familiar
shape
.
the
rain
come
down
,
thick
and


fast
,
and
patter
noisily
among
the
leafless
bush
.
but
,
Oliver
feel


it
not
,
as
it
beat
against
he
;
for
he
still
lie
stretch
,
helpless


and
unconscious
,
on
his
bed
of
clay
.


at
length
,
a
low
cry
of
pain
break
the
stillness
that
prevail
;
and


utter
it
,
the
boy
awake
.
his
left
arm
,
rudely
bandaged
in
a
shawl
,


hang
heavy
and
useless
at
his
side
;
the
bandage
be
saturate
with


blood
.
he
be
so
weak
,
that
he
could
scarcely
raise
himself
into
a


sit
posture
;
when
he
have
do
so
,
he
look
feebly
round
for
help
,


and
groan
with
pain
.
tremble
in
every
joint
,
from
cold
and


exhaustion
,
he
make
an
effort
to
stand
upright
;
but
,
shudder
from


head
to
foot
,
fall
prostrate
on
the
ground
.


after
a
short
return
of
the
stupor
in
which
he
have
be
so
long


plunge
,
Oliver
:
urge
by
a
creep
sickness
at
his
heart
,
which


seem
to
warn
he
that
if
he
lie
there
,
he
must
surely
die
:
get
upon


his
foot
,
and
essay
to
walk
.
his
head
be
dizzy
,
and
he
stagger
to


and
fro
like
a
drunken
man
.
but
he
keep
up
,
nevertheless
,
and
,
with


his
head
droop
languidly
on
his
breast
,
went
stumble
onward
,
he


know
not
whither
.


and
now
,
host
of
bewildering
and
confused
idea
come
crowd
on
his


mind
.
he
seem
to
be
still
walk
between
Sikes
and
Crackit
,
who


be
angrily
dispute
-
for
the
very
word
they
say
,
sound
in
his


ear
;
and
when
he
catch
his
own
attention
,
as
it
be
,
by
make
some


violent
effort
to
save
himself
from
fall
,
he
find
that
he
be


talk
to
they
.
then
,
he
be
alone
with
Sikes
,
plod
on
as
on
the


previous
day
;
and
as
shadowy
people
pass
they
,
he
feel
the
robber
's


grasp
upon
his
wrist
.
suddenly
,
he
start
back
at
the
report
of


firearm
;
there
rise
into
the
air
,
loud
cry
and
shout
;
light


gleam
before
his
eye
;
all
be
noise
and
tumult
,
as
some
unseen
hand


bear
he
hurriedly
away
.
through
all
these
rapid
vision
,
there
run
an


undefined
,
uneasy
consciousness
of
pain
,
which
weary
and
torment


he
incessantly
.


thus
he
stagger
on
,
creep
,
almost
mechanically
,
between
the
bar


of
gate
,
or
through
hedge
-
gap
as
they
come
in
his
way
,
until
he


reach
a
road
.
here
the
rain
begin
to
fall
so
heavily
,
that
it
rouse


he
.


he
look
about
,
and
see
that
at
no
great
distance
there
be
a
house
,


which
perhaps
he
could
reach
.
pity
his
condition
,
they
might
have


compassion
on
he
;
and
if
they
do
not
,
it
would
be
well
,
he
think
,


to
die
near
human
being
,
than
in
the
lonely
open
field
.
he
summon


up
all
his
strength
for
one
last
trial
,
and
bend
his
faltering
step


towards
it
.


as
he
draw
nearer
to
this
house
,
a
feeling
come
over
he
that
he
have


see
it
before
.
he
remember
nothing
of
its
detail
;
but
the
shape


and
aspect
of
the
building
seem
familiar
to
he
.


that
garden
wall
!
on
the
grass
inside
,
he
have
fall
on
his
knee
last


night
,
and
pray
the
two
man
's
mercy
.
it
be
the
very
house
they
have


attempt
to
rob
.


Oliver
feel
such
fear
come
over
he
when
he
recognise
the
place
,
that
,


for
the
instant
,
he
forget
the
agony
of
his
wound
,
and
think
only
of


flight
.
flight
!
he
could
scarcely
stand
:
and
if
he
be
in
full


possession
of
all
the
good
power
of
his
slight
and
youthful
frame
,


whither
could
he
fly
?
he
push
against
the
garden
-
gate
;
it
be


unlocked
,
and
swing
open
on
its
hinge
.
he
totter
across
the
lawn
;


climb
the
step
;
knock
faintly
at
the
door
;
and
,
his
whole
strength


fail
he
,
sink
down
against
one
of
the
pillar
of
the
little
portico
.


it
happen
that
about
this
time
,
Mr.
Giles
,
Brittles
,
and
the
tinker
,


be
recruit
themselves
,
after
the
fatigue
and
terror
of
the


night
,
with
tea
and
sundrie
,
in
the
kitchen
.
not
that
it
be
Mr.


Giles
's
habit
to
admit
to
too
great
familiarity
the
humble
servant
:


towards
whom
it
be
rather
his
wo
nt
to
deport
himself
with
a
lofty


affability
,
which
,
while
it
gratify
,
could
not
fail
to
remind
they
of


his
superior
position
in
society
.
but
,
death
,
fire
,
and
burglary
,


make
all
man
equal
;
so
Mr.
Giles
sit
with
his
leg
stretch
out


before
the
kitchen
fender
,
lean
his
left
arm
on
the
table
,
while
,


with
his
right
,
he
illustrate
a
circumstantial
and
minute
account
of


the
robbery
,
to
which
his
bearer
 
but
especially
the
cook
and


housemaid
,
who
be
of
the
party

with
breathless
interest
.


'
it
be
about
half
-
past
two
,
'
say
Mr.
Giles
,
'
or
I
would
n't
 
swear
that


it
might
n't
 
have
be
a
little
near
three
,
when
I
wake
up
,
and
,


turn
round
in
my
bed
,
as
it
might
be
so
,
 
here
Mr.
Giles
turn


round
in
his
chair
,
and
pull
the
corner
of
the
table

cloth
over
he


to
imitate
bed

clothe
,
 
I
fancy
I
heerd
a
noise
.
'


at
this
point
of
the
narrative
the
cook
turn
pale
,
and
ask
the


housemaid
to
shut
the
door
:
who

Mr.
Giles

RELATES
what
OLIVER
's
new
visitor
thought
of
HIM


with
many
loquacious
assurance
that
they
would
be
agreeably
surprise


in
the
aspect
of
the
criminal
,
the
doctor
draw
the
young
lady
's
arm


through
one
of
his
;
and
offer
his
disengaged
hand
to
Mrs.

,


lead
they
,
with
much
ceremony
and
stateliness
,
upstairs
.


'
now
,
'

the
doctor
,
in
a
whisper
,
as
he
softly
turn
the
handle
of


a
bedroom
-
door
,
'

ferocious


notwithstande

before

look
into
the
room
.
motion
they
to


advance
,
he
close
the
door
when
they
have
enter
;
and
gently
draw
back


the
curtain
of
the
bed
.
upon
it
,
in
lieu
of
the
dogged
,
black
-
visage


ruffian
they
have
expect
to
behold
,
there
lie
a
mere
child
:
wear
with


pain
and
exhaustion
,
and
sink
into
a
deep
sleep
.
his
wound
arm
,


bind
and
splinter
up
,
be
cross
upon
his
breast
;
his
head
recline


upon
the
other
arm
,
which
be
half
hide
by
his
long
hair
,
as
it


stream
over
the
pillow
.


the
honest
gentleman
hold
the
curtain
in
his
hand
,

look
on
,
for
a


minute
or
so
,
in
silence
.
whilst
he
be
watch
the
patient
thus
,
the


young
lady
glide
softly
past

herself
in

chair
by
the


bedside

Oliver
's
hair
from
his
face
.
as

stoop
over

,
her
tear
fall
upon
his
forehead
.


the
boy
stir
,
and
smile
in
his
sleep
,
as
though
these
mark
of
pity


and
compassion
have
awaken
some
pleasant
dream
of
a
love
and
affection


he
have
never
know
.
thus
,
a
strain
of
gentle
music
,
or
the
rippling
of


water
in
a
silent
place
,
or
the
odour
of
a
flower
,
or
the
mention
of
a


familiar
word
,
will
sometimes
call
up
sudden
dim
remembrance
of
scene


that
never
be
,
in
this
life
;
which
vanish
like
a
breath
;
which
some


brief
memory
of
a
happy
existence
,
long
go
by
,
would
seem
to
have


awakened
;
which
no
voluntary
exertion
of
the
mind
can
ever
recall

several

I

full
and
unlimited
commission
to

and
that

a
faithful


fellow

an
old
servant

I

you
can
make
it
up
to
he
in
a


thousand
way
,
and
reward
he
for
be
such
a
good
shot
besides
.
you


do
n't
 
object
to
that

'
unless
there
be
some
other
way

Mrs.


Maylie
.


'
there
be
no
other

take
my
word
for
it
.

'
then
my

you
with
full

her

pray
do
n't
 
be
hard
upon
the
poor
fellow

be


indispensably
necessary

you
seem
to

the

everybody

hard

yourself

Miss

I
only
hope
,
for


the
sake
of
the
rise
male
sex
generally
,
that
you
may
be
find
in
as


vulnerable

soft
-
hearted
a
mood
by
the
first
eligible
young
fellow


who
appeal
to
your
compassion
;
and
I
wish
I
be
a
young
fellow
,
that


I
might
avail
myself
,
on
the
spot
,
of
such
a
favourable
opportunity
for


do
so
,
as
the
present
.
'


'
you
be
as
great
a
boy
as
poor
Brittles
himself
,
'
return
Rose
,


blush
.


'
well
,
'
say
the
doctor
,
laugh
heartily
,
'
that
be
no
very
difficult


matter
.
but
to
return
to
this
boy
.
the
great
point
of
our
agreement


be
yet
to
come
.
he
will
wake
in
an
hour
or
so
,
I
dare
say
;
and


although
I
have
tell
that
thick
-
head
constable
-
fellow
downstairs
that


he
musn't
 
be
move
or
speak
to
,
on
peril
of
his
life
,
I
think
we
may


converse
with
he
without
danger
.
now
I
make
this
stipulation
-
that
I


shall
examine
he
in
your
presence
,
and
that
,
if
,
from
what
he
say
,
we


judge
,
and
I
can
show
to
the
satisfaction
of
your
cool
reason
,
that
he


be
a
real
and
thorough
bad
one
 
which
be
more
than
possible
,
he
shall


be
leave
to
his
fate
,
without
any
farther
interference
on
my
part
,
at


all
event
.
'


'
oh
no
,
aunt
!
'
entreat
Rose
.


'
oh
yes
,
aunt
!
'
say
the
doctor
.
'
be
be
a
bargain
?
'


'
he
can
not
be
harden
in
vice
,
'
say
Rose
;
'
it
be
impossible
.
'


'
very
good
,
'
retort
the
doctor
;
'
then
so
much
the
more
reason
for


accede
to
my
proposition
.
'


finally
the
treaty
be
enter
into
;
and
the
party
thereunto
sit
down


to
wait
,
with
some
impatience
,
until
Oliver
should
awake
.


the
patience
of
the
two
lady
be
destine
to
undergo
a
long
trial


than
Mr.
Losberne
have
lead
they
to
expect
;
for
hour
after
hour
pass


on
,
and
still
Oliver
slumber
heavily
.
it
be
evening
,
indeed
,
before


the
kind
-
hearted
doctor
bring
they
the
intelligence
,
that
he
be
at


length
sufficiently
restore
to
be
speak
to
.
the
boy
be
very
ill
,
he


say
,
and
weak
from
the
loss
of
blood
;
but
his
mind
be
so
troubled


with
anxiety
to
disclose
something
,
that
he
deem
it
well
to
give


he
the
opportunity
,
than
to
insist
upon
his
remain
quiet
until
next


morning
:
which
he
should
otherwise
have
do
.


the
conference
be
a
long
one
.
Oliver
tell
they
all
his
simple


history
,
and
be
often
compel
to
stop
,
by
pain
and
want
of
strength
.


it
be
a
solemn
thing
,
to
hear
,
in
the
darken
room
,
the
feeble
voice


of
the
sick
child
recount
a
weary
catalogue
of
evil
and
calamity


which
hard
man
have
bring
upon
he
.
oh
!
if
when
we
oppress
and
grind


our
fellow
-
creature
,
we
bestow
but
one
think
on
the
dark
evidence


of
human
error
,
which
,
like
dense
and
heavy
cloud
,
be
rise
,
slowly


it
be
true
,
but
not
less
surely
,
to
Heaven
,
to
pour
their


after
-
vengeance
on
our
head
;
if
we
hear
but
one
instant
,
in


imagination
,
the
deep
testimony
of
dead
man
's
voice
,
which
no
power


can
stifle
,
and
no
pride
shut
out
;
where
would
be
the
injury
and


injustice
,
the
suffering
,
misery
,
cruelty
,
and
wrong
,
that
each
day
's


life
bring
with
it
!


Oliver
's
pillow
be
smooth
by
gentle
hand
that
night
;
and
loveliness


and
virtue
watch
he
as
he
sleep
.
he
feel
calm
and
happy
,
and
could


have

without
a
murmur

momentous
interview
be
no

,
and
Oliver
compose
to


rest
again
,

doctor

his
eye
,

find
nobody

to
he

that


he

perhaps

the
proceeding
with
well

nothing

of
the
frightened
servant


choose
to
take
it
into
his

that
he
have
something
to
do
with
this


attempt

at
the
two


lady

I
know
his
whole
history

we
can
talk
about
that


presently

the
place

I
suppose

Mr.

have
well
inspect
the


premise
first
,

the
servant
afterwards

be
the
usual


way

light

,


go
into
the
little
room
at
the
end

the
passage

out
at


the
window
;

afterwards
go
round
by
way
of
the
lawn
,

look
in


at
the
window
;
and
after
that
,
have
a
candle
hand
out
to
inspect
the


shutter
with
;

after
that
,
a
lantern
to
trace
the
footstep
with
;

,
a
pitchfork
to
poke
the
bush
with

do
,

the
breathless
interest
of
all

,
they
come
in
again
;
and
Mr.


gile
and
Brittles
be
put
through
a
melodramatic
representation
of


their
share
in
the
previous
night
's
adventure
:
which
they
perform


some
six
time
over
:
contradict
each
other
,
in
not
more
than
one


important
respect
,
the
first
time
,
and
in
not
more
than
a
dozen
the


last
.
this
consummation
be
arrive
at
,
Blathers
and
Duff
clear


the
room
,
and
hold
a
long
council
together
,
compare
with
which
,
for


secrecy
and
solemnity
,
a
consultation
of
great
doctor
on
the
knotty


point
in
medicine
,
would
be
mere
child
's
play
.


meanwhile
,
the
doctor
walk
up
and
down
the
next
room
in
a
very
uneasy


state
;
and
Mrs.
Maylie

Rose
look
on
,
with
anxious
face
.


'
upon
my
word
,
'
he

,
make
a
halt
,
after
a
great
number
of
very


rapid
turn
,
'
I
hardly
know
what
to
do
.
'


'
surely
,
'

Rose
,
'
the
poor
child
's
story
,
faithfully
repeat
to


these
man
,
will
be
sufficient
to
exonerate
he
.
'


'
I
doubt
it
,
my
dear
young
lady
,
'
say
the
doctor
,
shake
his
head
.


'
I
do
n't
 
think
it
would
exonerate
he
,
either
with
they
,

with
legal


functionary
of
a
high
grade
.
what
be
he
,
after
all
,
they
would


say
?
a
runaway
.
judge
by
mere
worldly
consideration
and


probability
,
his
story
be
a
very
doubtful
one
.
'


'
you
believe
it
,
surely
?
'
interrupt
Rose
.


'
I
believe
it
,
strange
as
it
be
;
and
perhaps
I
may
be
an
old
fool
for


do
so
,
'
rejoin
the
doctor
;
'
but
I
do
n't
 
think
it
be
exactly
the


tale
for
a
practical
police
-
officer
,
nevertheless
.
'


'
why
not
?
'
demand
Rose
.


'
because
,
my
pretty
cross
-
examiner
,
'
reply
the
doctor
:
'
because
,


view
with
their
eye
,
there
be
many
ugly
point
about
it
;
he
can


only
prove
the
part
that
look
ill
,
and
none
of
those
that
look
well
.


confound
the
fellow
,
they
will
have
the
why
and
the
wherefore
,
and


will
take
nothing
for
grant
.
on
his
own
showing
,
you
see
,
he
have


be
the
companion
of
thief
for
some
time
past
;
he
have
be
carry


to
a
police

on
a

have
be
take
away
,
forcibly
,
from
that
gentleman
's
house
,
to
a
place


which
he
can
not
describe

point
out
,

of
the
situation
of
which
he


have
not
the
remote
idea

bring
down

violent
fancy

he
,
whether
he
will

no

be
put
through
a
window
to
rob
a
house
;

then
,
just
at
the
very


moment
when
he
be
go
to
alarm
the
inmate
,

so
do
the
very
thing


that

all
to
right

more
than

,
the
one

first
present


itself
to

'


having
give
vent
to
this

the
doctor
put
his


hand
into
his
pocket
,

walk
up

down
the
room
with
even

more
I
think
of
it

the

I
see
that

man
in

I
be
certain
it

even
if
they
can
do
nothing
to
he
in
the
end
,
still
the


drag
it
forward
,
and
give
publicity
to
all
the
doubt
that
will


be
cast
upon
it
,
must
interfere

,
with
your
benevolent
plan


of
rescue
he
from
misery

Mr.

the
patient

pulse
during
this
short


dialogue
;
but
he
now
rise
from
the
chair
by
the
bedside
,
and
remark
,


that
if
the
officer
have
any
doubt
upon
the
subject
,
they
would


perhaps
like
to
step
into
the
next
room
,
and
have
brittle
before
they
.


act
upon
this
suggestion
,
they
adjourn
to
a
neighbouring


apartment
,
where
Mr.
Brittles
,
be
call
in
,
involve
himself
and


his
respected
superior
in
such
a
wonderful
maze
of
fresh
contradiction


and
impossibility
,
as
tend
to
throw
no
particular
light
on


anything
,
but
the
fact
of
his
own
strong
mystification
;
except
,
indeed
,


his
declaration
that
he
should
n't
 
know
the
real
boy
,
if
he
be
put


before
he
that
instant
;
that
he
have
only
take
Oliver
to
be
he
,


because
Mr.

have
say
he

;
and
that
Mr.
Giles
have
,
five
minute


previously
,
admit
in
the
kitchen
,
that
he
begin
to
be
very
much


afraid
he
have
be
a
little
too
hasty
.


among
other
ingenious
surmise
,
the
question
be
then
raise
,
whether


Mr.
Giles
have
really
hit
anybody
;
and
upon
examination
of
the
fellow


pistol
to
that
which
he
have
fire
,
it
turn
out
to
have
no
more


destructive
loading
than
gunpowder
and
brown
paper
:
a
discovery
which


make
a
considerable
impression
on
everybody
but
the
doctor
,
who
have


draw
the
ball
about
ten
minute
before
.
upon
no
one
,
however
,
do
it


make
a
great
impression
than
on
Mr.
Giles
himself
;
who
,
after


labour
,
for
some
hour
,
under
the
fear
of
having
mortally
wound
a


fellow
-
creature
,
eagerly
catch
at
this
new
idea
,
and
favour
it
to


the
utmost
.
finally
,
the
officer
,
without
trouble
themselves
very


much
about
Oliver
,
leave
the
Chertsey
constable
in
the
house
,
and
take


up
their
rest
for
that
night
in

with
the
next
morning
,
there
come

suspicious
circumstance
;
and
to
Kingston
Messrs.
Blathers
and
Duff


journey
accordingly
.
the
suspicious
circumstance
,
however
,
resolve


themselves
,
on
investigation
,
into
the
one
fact
,
that
they
have
be


discover
sleep
under
a
haystack
;
which
,
although
a
great
crime
,
be


only
punishable
by
imprisonment
,
and
be
,
in
the
merciful
eye
of
the


english
law
,
and
its
comprehensive
love
of
all
the
King
's
subject
,


hold
to
be
no
satisfactory
proof
,
in
the
absence
of
all
other
evidence
,


that
the
sleeper
,
or
sleeper
,
have
commit
burglary

with


violence
,
and
have
therefore
render
themselves
liable
to
the


punishment
of
death
;
Messrs.

come
back
again
,
as
wise


as
they
go
.


in
short
,

some
more
examination
,
and
a
great
deal
more


conversation

neighbouring
magistrate

of

with
divided
opinion
on
the


subject
of
their
expedition
:
the
latter
gentleman
on
a
mature


consideration
of
all
the
circumstance

incline
to
the
belief
that


the
burglarious
attempt
have
originate
with
the
Family
Pet
;
and
the


former

disposed
to
concede
the
full
merit
of
it
to
the


great
Mr.
Conkey

into
the
carriage
,

Oliver
for
an
instant


with
a
glance
so
sharp

fierce

at
the

time
so
furious
and


vindictive
,
that
,
wake
or
sleep
,
he
could
not
forget
it
for
month


afterwards

he
continue
to
utter
the
most
fearful
imprecation
,
until


the
driver
have
resume
his
seat
;
and
when
they
be
once
more
on
their


way
,
they
could
see
he
some
distance
behind
:
beat
his
foot
upon
the


ground
,
and
tear
his
hair
,
in
transport
of
real
or
pretended
rage
.


'
I
be
an
ass

the
doctor
,

a
long
silence

you
know


that
before

Oliver

another
time
.

'
an
ass

the
doctor
again
,

a
further
silence
of
some


minute
.

be
the
right
place

right
fellow

be
there
,
what
could
I
have
do
,
single

if
I
have
have


assistance
,
I
see
no
good
that
I
should
have
do
,
except
lead
to
my


own
exposure
,

an
unavoidable
statement
of
the
manner
in
which
I


have
hush
up
this
business
.
that
would
have

now

fact

that
the
excellent
doctor
have
never
act
upon


anything
but
impulse
all
through
his
life

no
bad
compliment

the
nature
of

grief

in


the

of
his
happiness

he
have
please
himself
,
many
time


during
his
illness
,
with
thinking
of
all
that
Mr.
Brownlow

Mrs.


Bedwin
would
say
to
he
:
and
what

cruel
separation

hope


of
eventually
clear
himself
with

,
and
explain
how
he


have
be
force
away

buoy
he
up
,
and
sustain
he
,
under
many


of
his
recent
trial
;

now
,
the
idea
that
they
should
have
go
so


far
,
and
carry
with
they
the
belief
that
he
be
an
impostor
and
a


robber
-
a
belief
which
might
remain
uncontradicted
to
his
die


day
-
be
almost
more
than
he
could
bear
.


the
circumstance

no
alteration
,

,
in
the
behaviour
of

benefactor

wear
dweller
in
close


and
noisy
place
,

carry
their
own
freshness
,
deep
into

heart

have
live
in

,

up

come
almost
to
love
each
brick


and
stone
that
form
the
narrow
boundary
of
their
daily
walk
;
even


they
,
with
the
hand
of
death
upon
they
,
have
be
know
to
yearn
at

for
one
short
glimpse
of
Nature

face
;
and
,
carry
far
from
the


scene
of
their
old
pain
and
pleasure
,

seem
to
pass
at
once


into
a
new
state
of
being
.
crawl
forth
,
from
day
to
day
,
to
some


green
sunny
spot
,
they
have
have
such
memory
waken
up
within
they
by


the
sight
of
the
sky
,
and
hill
and
plain
,
and
glistening
water
,
that
a


foretaste
of
heaven
itself
have
soothe
their
quick
decline
,
and
they


have
sink
into
their
tomb
,
as
peacefully
as
the
sun
whose
set
they


watch
from
their
lonely
chamber
window
but
a
few
hour
before
,
fade


from
their
dim
and
feeble
sight
!
the
memory
which
peaceful
country


scene
call
up
,
be
not
of
this
world
,
nor
of
its
thought
and
hope
.


their
gentle
influence
may
teach
we
how
to
weave
fresh
garland
for
the


grave
of
those
we
love
:
may
purify
our
thought
,
and
bear
down


before
it
old
enmity
and
hatred
;
but
beneath
all
this
,
there
linger
,


in
the
least
reflective
mind
,
a
vague
and
half
-
form
consciousness
of


having
hold
such
feeling
long
before
,
in
some
remote
and
distant
time
,


which
call
up
solemn
thought
of
distant
time
to
come
,
and
bend
down


pride
and
worldliness
beneath
it
.


it
be
a
lovely
spot
to
which
they
repair
.
Oliver
,
whose
day
have


be
spend
among
squalid
crowd
,
and
in
the
midst
of
noise
and


brawling
,
seem
to
enter
on
a
new
existence
there
.
the
rose
and


honeysuckle
clung
to
the
cottage
wall
;
the
ivy
creep
round
the
trunk


of
the
tree
;
and
the
garden
-
flower
perfume
the
air
with
delicious


odour
.
hard
by
,
be
a
little
churchyard
;
not
crowd
with
tall


unsightly
gravestone
,
but
full
of
humble
mound
,
cover
with
fresh


turf
and
moss
:
beneath
which
,
the
old
people
of
the
village
lie
at


rest
.
Oliver
often
wander
here
;
and
,
thinking
of
the
wretched
grave


in
which
his
mother
lie
,
would
sometimes
sit
he
down
and
sob
unseen
;


but
,
when
he
raise
his
eye
to
the
deep
sky
overhead
,
he
would
cease


to
think
of
she
as
lie
in
the
ground
,
and
would
weep
for
she
,
sadly
,


but
without
pain
.


it
be
a
happy
time
.
the
day
be
peaceful
and
serene
;
the
night


bring
with
they
neither
fear
nor
care
;
no
languish
in
a
wretched


prison
,
or
associate
with
wretched
man
;
nothing
but
pleasant
and


happy
thought
.
every
morning
he
go
to
a
white
-
head
old
gentleman
,


who
live
near
the
little
church
:
who
teach
he
to
read
well
,
and
to


write
:
and
who
speak
so
kindly
,
and
take
such
pain
,
that
Oliver
could


never
try
enough
to
please
he
.
then
,
he
would
walk
with
Mrs.
Maylie


and
Rose
,
and
hear
they
talk
of
book
;
or
perhaps
sit
near
they
,
in


some
shady
place
,
and
listen
whilst
the
young
lady
read
:
which
he
could


have
do
,
until
it
grow
too
dark
to
see
the
letter
.
then
,
he
have
his


own
lesson
for
the
next
day
to
prepare
;
and
at
this
,
he
would
work


hard
,
in
a
little
room
which
look
into
the
garden
,
till
evening
come


slowly
on
,
when
the
lady
would
walk
out
again
,
and
he
with
they
:


listen
with
such
pleasure
to
all
they
say
:
and
so
happy
if
they


want
a
flower
that
he
could
climb
to
reach
,
or
have
forget
anything


he
could
run
to
fetch
:
that
he
could
never
be
quick
enough
about
it
.


when
it
become
quite
dark
,
and
they
return
home
,
the
young
lady
would


sit
down
to
the
piano
,
and
play
some
pleasant
air
,
or
sing
,
in
a
low


and
gentle
voice
,
some
old
song
which
it
please
her
aunt
to
hear
.


there
would
be
no
candle
light
at
such
time
as
these
;
and
Oliver


would
sit
by
one
of
the
window
,
listen
to
the
sweet
music
,
in
a


perfect
rapture
.


and
when
Sunday
come
,
how
differently
the
day
be
spend
,
from
any
way


in
which
he
have
ever
spend
it
yet
!
and
how
happily
too
;
like
all
the


other
day
in
that
most
happy
time
!
there
be
the
little
church
,
in


the
morning
,
with
the
green
leave
flutter
at
the
window
:
the


bird
singe
without
:
and
the
sweet
-
smell
air
steal
in
at
the


low
porch
,
and
fill
the
homely
building
with
its
fragrance
.
the
poor


people
be
so
neat
and
clean
,
and
knelt
so
reverently
in
prayer
,
that


it
seem
a
pleasure
,
not
a
tedious
duty
,
their
assemble
there


together
;
and
though
the
singing
might
be
rude
,
it
be
real
,
and


sound
more
musical
 
to
Oliver
's
ear
at
least
 
than
any
he
have
ever


hear
in
church
before
.
then
,
there
be
the
walk

performance
of
which
duty

feel
more
proud
and


pleased
,
than
if
he
have
be
the
clergyman
himself
.


in

uneven


pave
of
the
market

place
,
be
out
of
the
town
,
and
gallop
along


the
turnpike
-
road
,
in
a
couple
of
minute
.


as
it
be
something
to
feel
certain
that
assistance

somewhat
light
heart

,
who
be
at


that
moment

'
I

the
man
,
in
a
horrible
passion
;
between
his


clenched
tooth
;
'
if
I
have
only
have
the
courage
to
say
the
word
,
I
might


have
be
free
of
you
in
a
night
.
curse
on
your
head
,
and
black
death


on
your
heart
,

?
'


the
man
shake
his
fist
,
as
he
utter
these
word
incoherently
.
he


advanced
towards
Oliver
,
as
if
with
the
intention
of
aim
a
blow
at


he
,
but
fall
violently
on
the
ground
:
writhing
and
foaming
,
in
a
fit
.


Oliver
gaze
,
for
a
moment
,
at
the
struggle
of
the
madman
 
for
such
he


suppose
he
to
be
;
and
then
dart
into
the
house
for
help
.
have


see
he
safely
carry
into
the
hotel
,
he
turn
his
face
homeward
,


run
as
fast
as
he
could
,
to
make
up
for
lost
time
:
and
recall


with
a
great
deal
of
astonishment
and
some
fear
,
the
extraordinary


behaviour
of
the
person
from
whom
he
have
just
part
.


the
circumstance
do
not
dwell
in
his
recollection
long
,
however
:
for


when
he
reach
the
cottage
,
there
be
enough
to
occupy
his
mind
,
and


to
drive
all
consideration
of
self
completely
from
his
memory
.


Rose
Maylie
have
rapidly
grow
bad
;
before
mid
-
night
she
be


delirious
.
a
medical
practitioner
,
who
reside
on
the
spot
,
be
in


constant
attendance
upon
she
;
and
after
first
see
the
patient
,
he


have
take
Mrs.
Maylie
aside
,
and
pronounce
her
disorder
to
be
one
of
a


most
alarming
nature
.
'
in
fact
,
'
he
say
,
'
it
would
be
little
short
of


a
miracle
,
if
she
recover
.
'


how
often
do
Oliver
start
from
his
bed
that
night
,
and
steal
out
,


with
noiseless
footstep
,
to
the
staircase
,
listen
for
the
slight


sound
from
the
sick
chamber
!
how
often
do
a
tremble
shake
his
frame
,


and
cold
drop
of
terror
start
upon
his
brow
,
when
a
sudden
trampling


of
foot
cause
he
to
fear
that
something
too
dreadful
to
think
of
,
have


even
then
occur
!
and
what
have
be
the
fervency
of
all
the
prayer


he
have
ever
mutter
,
compare
with
those
he
pour
forth
,
now
,
in
the


agony
and
passion
of
his
supplication
for
the
life
and
health
of
the


gentle
creature
,
who
be
totter
on
the
deep
grave
's
verge
!


oh
!
the
suspense
,
the
fearful
,
acute
suspense
,
of
stand
idly
by


while
the
life
of
one
we
dearly
love
,
be
tremble
in
the
balance
!
oh
!


the
rack
thought
that
crowd
upon
the
mind
,
and
make
the
heart
beat


violently
,
and
the
breath
come
thick
,
by
the
force
of
the
image
they


conjure
up
before
it
;
the
desperate
anxiety
to
be
do
something
to


relieve
the
pain
,
or
lessen
the
danger
,
which
we
have
no
power
to


alleviate
;
the
sinking
of
soul
and
spirit
,
which
the
sad
remembrance
of


our
helplessness
produce
;
what
torture
can
equal
these
;
what


reflection
or
endeavour
can
,
in
the
full
tide
and
fever
of
the
time
,


allay
they
!


morning
come
;
and
the
little
cottage
be
lonely
and
still
.
People
speak


in
whisper
;
anxious
face
appear
at
the
gate
,
from
time
to
time
;


woman
and
child
go
away
in
tear
.
all
the
livelong
day
,
and
for


hour
after
it
have
grow
dark
,
Oliver
pace
softly
up
and
down
the


garden
,
raise
his
eye
every
instant
to
the
sick
chamber
,
and


shudder
to
see
the
darken
window
,
look
as
if
death
lie


stretch
inside
.
late
that
night
,
Mr.
Losberne
arrive
.
'
it
be


hard
,
'
say
the
good
doctor
,
turn
away
as
he
speak
;
'
so
young
;
so


much
beloved
;
but
there
be
very
little
hope
.
'


another
morning
.
the
sun
shine
brightly
;
as
brightly
as
if
it
look


upon
no
misery
or
care
;
and
,
with
every
leaf
and
flower
in
full
bloom


about
she
;
with
life
,
and
health
,
and
sound
and
sight
of
joy
,


surround
she
on
every
side
:
the
fair
young
creature
lie
,
waste


fast
.
Oliver
creep
away
to
the
old
churchyard
,
and
sit
down
on
one


of
the
green
mound
,
weep
and
pray
for
she
,
in
silence
.


there
be
such
peace
and
beauty
in
the
scene
;
so
much
of
brightness
and


mirth
in
the
sunny
landscape
;
such
blithesome
music
in
the
song
of
the


summer
bird
;
such
freedom
in
the
rapid
flight
of
the
rook
,
career


overhead
;
so
much
of
life
and
joyousness
in
all
;
that
,
when
the
boy


raise
his
ache
eye
,
and
look
about
,
the
thought
instinctively


occur
to
he
,
that
this
be
not
a
time
for
death
;
that
Rose
could


surely
never
die
when
humble
thing
be
all
so
glad
and
gay
;
that


grave
be
for
cold
and
cheerless
winter
:
not
for
sunlight
and


fragrance
.
he
almost
think
that
shroud
be
for
the
old
and


shrunken
;
and
that
they
never
wrap
the
young
and
graceful
form
in


their
ghastly
fold
.


a
knell
from
the
church
bell
break
harshly
on
these
youthful
thought
.


another
!
again
!
it
be
toll
for
the
funeral
service
.
a
group
of


humble
mourner
enter
the
gate
:
wear
white
favour
;
for
the
corpse


be
young
.
they
stand
uncover
by
a
grave
;
and
there
be
a
mother
-
a


mother
once
-
among
the
weeping
train
.
but
the
sun
shine
brightly
,
and


the
bird
sing
on
.


Oliver
turn
homeward
,
think
on
the
many
kindness
he
have
receive


from
the
young
lady
,
and
wish
that
the
time
could
come
again
,
that


he
might
never
cease
show
she
how
grateful
and
attach
he
be
.
he


have
no
cause
for
self
-
reproach
on
the
score
of
neglect
,
or
want
of


think
,
for
he
have
be
devote
to
her
service
;
and
yet
a
hundred


little
occasion
rise
up
before
he
,
on
which
he
fancy
he
might
have


be
more
zealous
,
and
more
earnest
,
and
wish
he
have
be
.
we
need


be
careful
how
we
deal
with
those
about
we
,
when
every
death
carry
to


some
small
circle
of
survivor
,
thought
of
so
much
omit
,
and
so


little
do
-
of
so
many
thing
forget
,
and
so
many
more
which
might


have
be
repair
!
there
be
no
remorse
so
deep
as
that
which
be


unavaile
;
if
we
would
be
spare
its
torture
,
let
we
remember
this
,


in
time
.


when
he
reach
home
Mrs.
Maylie
be
sit
in
the
little
parlour
.


Oliver
's
heart
sink
at
sight
of
she
;
for
she
have
never
leave
the
bedside


of
her
niece
;
and
he
tremble
to
think
what
change
could
have
drive


she
away
.
he
learn
that
she
have
fall
into
a
deep
sleep
,
from
which


she
would
waken
,
either
to
recovery
and
life
,
or
to
bid
they
farewell
,


and
die
.


they
sit
,
listen
,
and
afraid
to
speak
,
for
hour
.
the
untasted
meal


be
remove
,
with
look
which
show
that
their
thought
be


elsewhere
,
they
watch
the
sun
as
he
sink
lower
and
low
,
and
,
at


length
,
cast
over
sky
and
earth
those
brilliant
hue
which
herald
his


departure
.
their
quick
ear
catch
the
sound
of
an
approach


footstep
.
they
both
involuntarily
darted
to
the
door
,
as

too
much
happiness
to

Oliver
feel
stunned
and


stupefy
by
the
unexpected
intelligence
;
he
could
not
weep
,
or
speak
,


or
rest
.
he
have
scarcely
the
power
of
understand
anything
that
have

,
until
,
after
a
long
ramble
in
the
quiet
evening
air
,
a
burst
of


tear
come
to
his
relief
,
and
he

strong

pure
love

Mrs.

I
know
that
the
devotion

require
no
ordinary
return

one
that
shall
be
deep

last
.

,
that
a
change


behaviour
in
one

difficult

performance

have
to
encounter
so
many


struggle
in

some
,

gratify
,

only
the
more


fleeting
.
above

the
lady

fix
her
eye

,
in
exact
proportion

cast
in
his
tooth

the

day


repent

form
in
early
life

may
have
the


pain

so

the
young
man

impatiently
,

be
a
selfish


brute

unworthy

agony

Harry

not
proof
against
the


worthy
gentleman
's
good
humour
,
which
display
itself
in
a
great


variety
of
sally
and
professional
recollection
,
and
an
abundance
of


small
joke
,
which
strike
Oliver
as
be
the
droll
thing
he
have


ever
hear
,

to
laugh
proportionately
;
to
the
evident


satisfaction
of
the
doctor
,

laugh
immoderately
at
himself

make
Harry
laugh
almost
as
heartily
,
by
the
very
force
of
sympathy
.


so
,
they
be
as
pleasant
a
party
as
,
under
the
circumstance
,
they


could
well
have
be
;
and
it
be
late
before
they
retire
,
with
light


and
thankful
heart
,
to
take
that
rest
of
which
,
after
the
doubt
and


suspense
they
have
recently
undergo
,
they
stand
much
in
need
.


Oliver
rise
next
morning
,
in
well
heart
,
and
go
about
his
usual


occupation
,
with
more
hope
and
pleasure
than
he
have
know
for
many


day
.
the
bird
be
once
more
hang
out
,
to
sing
,
in
their
old
place
;


and
the
sweetest
wild
flower
that
could
be
find
,
be
once
more


gather
to
gladden
Rose
with
their
beauty
.
the
melancholy
which
have


seem
to
the
sad
eye
of
the
anxious
boy
to
hang
,
for
day
past
,
over


every
object
,
beautiful
as
all
be
,
be
dispel
by
magic
.
the
dew


seem
to
sparkle
more
brightly
on
the
green
leave
;
the
air
to
rustle


among
they
with
a
sweet
music
;
and
the
sky
itself
to
look
more
blue


and
bright
.
such
be
the
influence
which
the
condition
of
our
own


thought
,
exercise
,
even
over
the
appearance
of
external
object
.
man


who
look
on
nature
,
and
their
fellow
-
man
,
and
cry
that
all
be
dark
and


gloomy
,
be
in
the
right
;
but
the
sombre
colour
be
reflection
from


their
own
jaundice
eye
and
heart
.
the
real
hue
be
delicate
,
and


need
a
clear
vision
.


it
be
worthy
of
remark
,
and
Oliver
do
not
fail
to
note
it
at
the
time
,


that
his
morning
expedition
be
no
long
make
alone
.
Harry
Maylie
,


after
the
very
first
morning
when
he
meet
Oliver
come
laden
home
,
be


seize
with
such
a
passion
for
flower
,
and
display
such
a
taste
in


their
arrangement
,
as
leave
his
young
companion
far
behind
.
if
Oliver


be
behindhand
in
these
respect
,
he
know
where
the
good
be
to
be


find
;
and
morning
after
morning
they
scour
the
country
together
,
and


bring
home
the
fairest
that
blossom
.
the
window
of
the
young


lady
's
chamber
be
open
now
;
for
she
love
to
feel
the
rich
summer


air
stream
in
,
and
revive
she
with
its
freshness
;
but
there
always


stand
in
water
,
just
inside
the
lattice
,
one
particular
little
bunch
,


which
be
make
up
with
great
care
,
every
morning
.
Oliver
could
not


help
notice
that
the
withered
flower
be
never
throw
away
,


although
the
little
vase
be
regularly
replenish
;
nor
,
could
he
help


observe
,
that
whenever
the
doctor
come
into
the
garden
,
he
invariably


cast
his
eye
up
to
that
particular
corner
,
and
nod
his
head
most


expressively
,
as
he
set
forth
on
his
morning
's
walk
.
pende
these


observation
,
the
day
be
fly
by
;
and
Rose
be
rapidly
recover
.


nor
do
Oliver
's
time
hang
heavy
on
his
hand
,
although
the
young
lady


have
not
yet
leave
her
chamber
,
and
there
be
no
evening
walk
,
save
now


and
then
,
for
a
short
distance
,
with
Mrs.
Maylie
.
he
apply
himself
,


with
redoubled
assiduity
,
to
the
instruction
of
the
white
-
head
old


gentleman
,
and
labour
so
hard
that
his
quick
progress
surprise
even


himself
.
it
be
while
he
be
engage
in
this
pursuit
,
that
he
be


greatly
startled
and
distress
by
a
most
unexpected
occurrence
.


the
little
room
in
which
he
be
accustomed
to
sit
,
when
busy
at
his


book
,
be
on
the
ground
-
floor
,
at
the
back
of
the
house
.
it
be
quite


a
cottage
-
room
,
with
a
lattice
-
window
:
around
which
be
cluster
of


jessamine
and
honeysuckle
,
that
creep
over
the
casement
,
and
fill
the


place
with
their
delicious
perfume
.
it
look
into
a
garden
,
whence
a


wicket
-
gate
open
into
a
small
paddock
;
all
beyond
,
be
fine


meadow
-
land
and
wood
.
there
be
no
other
dwell
near
,
in
that


direction
;
and
the
prospect
it
command
be
very
extensive
.


one
beautiful
evening
,
when
the
first
shade
of
twilight
be
begin


to
settle
upon
the
earth
,
Oliver
sit
at
this
window
,
intent
upon
his


book
.
he
have
be
pore
over
they
for
some
time
;
and
,
as
the
day
have


be
uncommonly
sultry
,
and
he
have
exert
himself
a
great
deal
,
it
be


no
disparagement
to
the
author
,
whoever
they
may
have
be
,
to
say
,


that
gradually
and
by
slow
degree
,
he
fall
asleep
.


there
be
a
kind
of
sleep
that
steal
upon
we
sometimes
,
which
,
while
it


hold
the
body
prisoner
,
do
not
free
the
mind
from
a
sense
of
thing


about
it
,
and
enable
it
to
ramble
at
its
pleasure
.
so
far
as
an


overpower
heaviness
,
a
prostration
of
strength
,
and
an
utter


inability
to
control
our
thought
or
power
of
motion
,
can
be
call


sleep
,
this
be
it
;
and
yet
,
we
have
a
consciousness
of
all
that
be


go
on
about
we
,
and
,
if
we
dream
at
such
a
time
,
word
which
be


really
speak
,

sound
which
really
exist
at
the
moment
,
accommodate


themselves
with
surprising
readiness
to
our
vision
,
until
reality
and


imagination
become
so
strangely
blend
that
it
be
afterwards
almost


matter
of
impossibility
to
separate
the
two
.
nor
be
this
,
the
most


strike
phenomenon
incidental
to
such
a
state
.
it
be
an
undoubted


fact
,
that
although
our
sense
of
touch
and
sight
be
for
the
time
dead
,


yet
our
sleep
thought
,
and
the
visionary
scene
that
pass
before


we
,
will
be
influence
and
materially
influence
,
by
the
mere
silent


presence
of
some
external
object
;
which
may
not
have
be
near
we
when


we
close
our
eye
:
and
of
whose
vicinity
we
have
have
no
waking


consciousness
.


Oliver
know
,
perfectly
well
,
that
he
be
in
his
own
little
room
;
that


his
book
be
lie
on
the
table
before
he
;
that
the
sweet
air
be


stir
among
the
creep
plant
outside
.
and
yet
he
be
asleep
.


suddenly
,
the
scene
change
;
the
air
become
close
and
confine
;
and
he


think
,
with
a
glow
of
terror
,
that
he
be
in
the
Jew
's
house
again
.


there
sit
the
hideous
old
man
,
in
his
accustomed
corner
,
point
at


he
,
and
whisper
to
another
man
,
with
his
face
avert
,
who
sit


beside
he
.


'
Hush
,
my
dear
!
'
he
think
he
hear
the
Jew
say
;
'
it
be
he
,
sure


enough
.
come
away
.
'


'
he
!
'
the
other
man
seem
to
answer
;
'
could
I
mistake
he
,
think
you
?


if
a
crowd
of
ghost
be
to
put
themselves
into
his
exact
shape
,
and


he
stand
amongst
they
,
there
be
something
that
would
tell
I
how
to


point
he
out
.
if
you
bury
he
fifty
foot
deep
,
and
take
I
across


his
grave
,
I
fancy
I
should
know
,
if
there
be
n't
 
a
mark
above
it
,
that


he
lie
bury
there
?
'


the
man
seem
to
say
this
,
with
such
dreadful
hatred
,
that
Oliver


awake
with
the
fear
,
and
start
up
.


Good
Heaven
!
what
be
that
,
which
send
the
blood
tingle
to
his


heart
,

deprive
he
of
his
voice

of
power
to
move

there
-
at
the
window

so
close

he
could


have
almost
touch

back
:
with
his
eye
peer


into
the
room

his
:
there

an
instant

flash

they
have

their
look

as
firmly
impressed
upon

memory

in

the
UNSATISFACTORY
RESULT
of
OLIVER
'S
adventure
;
and
a


conversation
of
some
importance
between
HARRY
MAYLIE
and
ROSE


when
the
inmate
of
the
house
,
attract
by
Oliver
's
cry
,
hurry
to


the
spot
from
which
they
proceed
,
they
find
he
,
pale
and
agitated
,


point
in
the
direction
of
the
meadow
behind
the
house
,
and
scarcely


able
to
articulate
the
word
,
'
the
Jew
!
the
Jew
!
'


Mr.
Giles
be
at
a
loss
to
comprehend
what
this
outcry
mean
;
but
Harry


Maylie
,
whose
perception
be
something
quick
,
and
who
have
hear


Oliver
's
history
from
his
mother
,
understand
it
at
once
.


'
what
direction
do
he
take
?
'
he
ask
,
catch
up
a
heavy
stick
which


be
stand
in
a
corner
.


'
that
,
'
reply
Oliver
,
point
out
the
course
the
man
have
take
;
'
I


miss
they
in
an
instant
.
'


'
then
,
they
be
in
the
ditch
!
'
say
Harry
.
'
follow
!
and
keep
as
near


I
,
as
you
can
.
'
so
say
,
he
spring
over
the
hedge
,
and
dart
off


with
a
speed
which
render
it
matter
of
exceed
difficulty
for
the


other
to
keep
near
he
.


gile
follow
as
well
as
he
could
;
and
Oliver
follow
too
;
and
in
the


course
of
a
minute
or
two
,
Mr.
Losberne
,
who
have
be
out
walk
,
and


just
then
return
,
tumble
over
the
hedge
after
they
,
and
pick


himself
up
with
more
agility
than
he
could
have
be
suppose
to


possess
,
strike
into
the
same
course
at
no
contemptible
speed
,
shout


all
the
while
,
most
prodigiously
,
to
know
what
be
the
matter
.


on
they
all
go
;
nor
stop
they
once
to
breathe
,
until
the
leader
,


strike
off
into
an
angle
of
the
field
indicate
by
Oliver
,
begin
to


search
,
narrowly
,
the
ditch
and
hedge
adjoining
;
which
afford
time


for
the
remainder
of
the
party
to
come
up
;
and
for
Oliver
to


communicate
to
Mr.
Losberne
the
circumstance
that
have
lead
to
so


vigorous
a
pursuit
.


the
search
be
all
in
vain
.
there
be
not
even
the
trace
of
recent


footstep
,
to
be
see
.
they
stand
now
,
on
the
summit
of
a
little
hill
,


command
the
open
field
in
every
direction
for
three
or
four
mile
.


there
be
the
village
in
the
hollow
on
the
left
;
but
,
in
order
to
gain


that
,
after
pursue
the
track
Oliver
have
point
out
,
the
man
must


have
make
a
circuit
of
open
ground
,
which
it
be
impossible
they
could


have
accomplish
in
so
short
a
time
.
a
thick
wood
skirt
the


meadow
-
land
in
another
direction
;
but
they
could
not
have
gain
that


covert
for
the
same
reason
.


'
it
must
have
be
a
dream
,
Oliver
,
'
say
Harry
Maylie
.


'
oh
no
,
indeed
,
sir
,
'
reply
Oliver
,
shudder
at
the
very


recollection
of
the
old
wretch
's
countenance
;
'
I
see
he
too
plainly


for
that
.
I
see
they
both
,
as
plainly
as
I
see
you
now
.
'


'
who
be
the
other
?
'
inquire
Harry
and
Mr.
Losberne
,
together
.


'
the
very
same
man
I
tell
you
of
,
who
come
so
suddenly
upon
I
at
the


inn
,
'
say
Oliver
.
'
we
have
our
eye
fix
full
upon
each
other
;
and
I


could
swear
to
he
.
'


'
they
take
this
way
?
'
demand
Harry
:
'
be
you
sure
?
'


'
as
I
be
that
the
man
be
at
the
window
,
'
reply
Oliver
,
point


down
,
as
he
speak
,
to
the
hedge
which
divide
the
cottage
-
garden
from


the
meadow
.
'
the
tall
man
leap
over
,
just
there
;
and
the
Jew
,


run
a
few
pace
to
the
right
,
crept
through
that
gap
.
'


the
two
gentleman
watch
Oliver
's
earnest
face
,
as
he
speak
,
and


look
from
he
to
each
other
,
seem
to
feel
satisfied
of
the


accuracy
of
what
he
say
.
still
,
in
no
direction
be
there
any


appearance
of
the
trampling
of
man
in
hurried
flight
.
the
grass
be


long
;
but
it
be
tread
down
nowhere
,
save
where
their
own
foot
have


crush
it
.
the
side
and
brink
of
the
ditch
be
of
damp
clay
;
but


in
no
one
place
could
they
discern
the
print
of
man
's
shoe
,
or
the


slight
mark
which
would
indicate
that
any
foot
have
press
the


ground
for
hour
before
.


'
this
be
strange
!
'
say
Harry
.


'
strange
?
'
echo
the
doctor
.
'
blather
and
Duff
,
themselves
,
could


make
nothing
of
it
.
'


notwithstanding
the
evidently
useless
nature
of
their
search
,
they
do


not
desist
until
the
come
on
of
night
render
its
further


prosecution
hopeless
;
and
even
then
,
they
give
it
up
with
reluctance
.


gile
be
dispatch
to
the
different
ale
-
house
in
the
village
,


furnish
with
the
good
description
Oliver
could
give
of
the
appearance


and
dress
of
the
stranger
.
of
these
,
the
Jew
be
,
at
all
event
,


sufficiently
remarkable
to
be
remember
,
suppose
he
have
be
see


drink
,
or
loitering
about
;
but
gile
return
without
any


intelligence
,
calculate
to
dispel
or
lessen
the
mystery
.


on
the
next
day
,
fresh
search
be
make
,
and
the
inquiry
renew
;
but


with
no
well
success
.
on
the
day
follow
,
Oliver
and
Mr.
Maylie


repair
to
the
market
-
town
,
in
the
hope
of
see
or
hear
something


of
the
man
there
;
but
this
effort
be
equally
fruitless
.
after
a
few


day
,
the
affair
begin
to
be
forget
,
as
most
affair
be
,
when


wonder
,
have
no
fresh
food
to
support
it
,
die
away
of
itself
.


meanwhile
,
Rose
be
rapidly
recover
.
she
have
leave
her
room
:
be


able
to
go
out
;
and
mix
once
more
with
the
family
,
carry
joy
into


the
heart
of
all
.


but
,
although
this
happy
change
have
a
visible
effect
on
the
little


circle
;
and
although
cheerful
voice
and
merry
laughter
be
once
more


hear
in
the
cottage
;
there
be
at
time
,
an
unwonted
restraint
upon


some
there
:
even
upon
Rose
herself
:
which
Oliver
could
not
fail
to


remark
.
Mrs.
Maylie
and
her
son
be
often
closet
together
for
a


long
time
;
and
more
than
once
Rose
appear
with
trace
of
tear
upon


her
face
.
after
Mr.
Losberne
have
fix
a
day
for
his
departure
to


Chertsey
,
these
symptom
increase
;
and
it
become
evident
that


something
be
in
progress
which
affect
the
peace
of
the
young
lady
,


and
of
somebody
else
besides
.


at
length
,
one
morning
,
when
Rose
be
alone
in
the
breakfast
-
parlour
,


Harry
Maylie
enter
;
and
,
with
some
hesitation
,
beg
permission
to


speak
with
she
for
a
few
moment
.


'
a
few
-
a
very
few
-
will
suffice
,
Rose
,
'
say
the
young
man
,
draw


his
chair
towards
she
.
'
what
I
shall
have
to
say
,
have
already


present
itself
to
your
mind
;
the
most
cherish
hope
of
my
heart
be


not
unknown
to
you
,
though
from
my
lip
you
have
not
hear
they
state
.
'


Rose
have
be
very
pale
from
the
moment
of
his
entrance
;
but
that
might


have
be
the
effect
of
her
recent
illness
.
she
merely
bow
;
and


bend
over
some
plant
that
stand
near
,
wait
in
silence
for
he
to


proceed
.


'
i
-
I
-
ought
to
have
leave
here
,
before
,
'
say
Harry
.


'
you
should
,
indeed
,
'
reply
Rose
.
'
forgive
I
for
say
so
,
but
I


wish
you
have
.
'


'
I
be

to
feel
that


you
belong
to

bright
sphere
whither
so
many
of

flight
;

these
consolation

with
the

;

himself
before

fortunate

utterance

brief
word

,

a
help

comfort
to
you

every
reason

very
happy
,
now
;

then
,
Harry
,
I

I
should
have
be
happy

tear


with
they
,
as
old
hope

when
they
come
back
withered
;

she
.

weakness

her
hand

may
be
much
soon

to
you
again
on


this
subject

the
last
time
.

I
to
alter
my
right
determination
,

Rose
,
with
a


melancholy
smile
;

it
will
be
useless

XXXVII


in
which
the
READER
may
perceive
a
contrast
,
not
uncommon
in


matrimonial
case


Mr.
Bumble
sit
in
the
workhouse
parlour
,
with
his
eye
moodily
fix
on


the
cheerless
grate
,
whence
,
as
it
be
summer
time
,
no
bright
gleam


proceed
,
than
the
reflection
of
certain
sickly
ray
of
the
sun
,
which


be
send
back
from
its
cold
and
shine
surface

paper

cage


dangle
from
the
ceiling
,
to
which
he
occasionally
raise
his
eye
in


gloomy
thought
;

,
as
the
heedless
insect
hover
round
the
gaudy


net

work
,
Mr.
Bumble
would
heave
a
deep
sigh
,
while
a
more
gloomy


shadow
overspread
his
countenance
.
Mr.
Bumble
be
meditate
;
it
might


be
that
the
insect
bring
to
mind
,
some
painful
passage
in
his
own


past
life
.


nor
be
Mr.
Bumble
's
gloom
the
only
thing
calculate
to
awaken
a


please
melancholy
in
the
bosom
of
a
spectator
.
there
be
not
want


other
appearance

those

connect
with
his

announce
that
a
great
change
have
take
place
in
the
position

his
affair

the
laced
coat

not
the
breech
.
the
coat
be
wide
-
skirt
;


and
in
that
respect
like
the
coat

,
oh
how
different
!
the
mighty


cock
hat

modest
round
one

no


long

there
be
some
promotion
in
life

,
independent
of
the
more


substantial
reward

offer
,

more
question

motion
towards

so
very
violent
,
that

'


at
this
instant
,
Mrs.

step
hastily
forward
to
replace
the


carpet
,
which
have
be
kick
up
in
the
scuffle
.
Mr.

immediately
dart
out
of
the
room
,
without
bestow
another
thought


on
his
unfinished
sentence
:
leave
the
late
Mrs.
Corney
in
full


possession
of
the
field
.


Mr.

be
fairly
take
by
surprise
,
and
fairly
beat
.
he
have
a


decide
propensity
for
bully
:
derive
no
inconsiderable
pleasure


from
the
exercise
of
petty
cruelty
;
and
,
consequently
,
be
 
it
be


needless
to
say
 
a
coward
.
this
be
by
no
means
a
disparagement
to
his


character
;
for
many
official
personage
,
who
be
hold
in
high
respect


and

the
victim
of
similar
infirmity
.
the
remark
be


make
,
indeed
,

in
his
favour

otherwise
,

with
a
view
of


impress
the
reader
with
a
just
sense
of
his
qualification
for


office

,
the
measure
of
his
degradation
be
not
yet
full
.
after
make
a


tour
of
the
house
,

think
,
for
the
first
time
,
that

poor

law


really
be
too
hard

man

leave
they
chargeable
to
the
parish

ought
,
in
justice
to
be

with
no
punishment
at
all
,

rather
reward
as
meritorious


individual
who
have
suffer
much
;
Mr.

look
from

a
large


cloak
.
he
have
the
air
of
a
stranger
;
and
seem
,
by
a
certain


haggardness
in
his
look
,
as
well
as
by
the
dusty
soil
on
his
dress
,
to


have
travel
some
distance
.
he

quite
dignity
enough
for
two
;
suppose
even
that
the


stranger

be
more
familiar
:
so
he
drink
his
gin
-
and
-
water
in


silence
,
and
read
the
paper

great
show
of
pomp
and
circumstance
.


it
so
happen
,
however
:

will
happen
very

such
circumstance
:

now

,
a
powerful
inducement
,

he
could
not
resist
,
to
steal
a


look
at
the
stranger
:
and
that
whenever
he
do
so
,
he
withdraw
his

in
some
confusion
,
to
find

that
moment

a
look
at

at
their
NOCTURNAL
INTERVIEW


it
be
a
dull
,
close
,
overcast
summer
evening
.
the
cloud
,
which
have


be
threaten
all
day
,
spread
out
in
a
dense
and
sluggish
mass
of


vapour
,
already
yield
large
drop
of
rain
,
and
seem
to
presage
a


violent
thunder
-
storm
,
when
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Bumble
,
turn
out
of
the


main
street
of
the
town
,
direct
their
course
towards
a
scatter


little
colony
of
ruinous
house
,
distant
from
it
some
mile
and
a
-
half
,


or
thereabout
,
and
erect
on
a
low
unwholesome
swamp
,
border
upon


the
river
.


they
be
both
wrap
in
old
and
shabby
outer
garment
,
which
might
,


perhaps
,
serve
the
double
purpose
of
protect
their
person
from
the


rain
,
and
shelter
they
from
observation
.
the
husband
carry
a


lantern
,
from
which
,
however
,
no
light
yet
shine
;
and
trudge
on
,
a
few


pace
in
front
,
as
though
-
the
way
be
dirty
-
to
give
his
wife
the


benefit
of
treading
in
his
heavy
footprint
.
they
go
on
,
in
profound


silence
;
every
now
and
then
,
Mr.
Bumble
relax
his
pace
,
and
turn


his
head
as
if
to
make
sure
that
his
helpmate
be
follow
;
then
,


discover
that
she
be
close
at
his
heel
,
he
mend
his
rate
of


walk
,
and
proceed
,
at
a
considerable
increase
of
speed
,
towards


their
place
of
destination
.


this
be
far
from
be
a
place
of
doubtful
character
;
for
it
have
long


be
know
as
the
residence
of
none
but
low
ruffian
,
who
,
under


various
pretence
of
live
by
their
labour
,
subsist
chiefly
on


plunder
and
crime
.
it
be
a
collection
of
mere
hovel
:
some
,
hastily


build
with
loose
brick
:
other
,
of
old
worm
-
eat
ship
-
timber
:
jumble


together
without
any
attempt
at
order
or
arrangement
,
and
plant
,
for


the
most
part
,
within
a
few
foot
of
the
river
's
bank
.
a
few
leaky


boat
draw
up
on
the
mud
,
and
make
fast
to
the
dwarf
wall
which


skirt
it
:
and
here
and
there
an
oar
or
coil
of
rope
:
appear
,
at


first
,
to
indicate
that
the
inhabitant
of
these
miserable
cottage


pursue
some
avocation
on
the
river
;
but
a
glance
at
the
shattered
and


useless
condition
of
the
article
thus
display
,
would
have
lead
a


passer
-
by
,
without
much
difficulty
,
to
the
conjecture
that
they
be


dispose
there
,
rather
for
the
preservation
of
appearance
,
than
with


any
view
to
their
be
actually
employ
.


in
the
heart
of
this
cluster
of
hut
;
and
skirt
the
river
,
which
its


upper
story
overhung
;
stand
a
large
building
,
formerly
use
as
a


manufactory
of
some
kind
.
it
have
,
in
its
day
,
probably
furnish


employment
to
the
inhabitant
of
the
surround
tenement
.
but
it
have


long
since
go
to
ruin
.
the
rat
,
the
worm
,
and
the
action
of
the


damp
,
have
weaken
and
rot
the
pile
on
which
it
stand
;
and
a


considerable
portion
of
the
building
have
already
sink
down
into
the


water
;
while
the
remainder
,
totter
and
bend
over
the
dark
stream
,


seem
to
wait
a
favourable
opportunity
of

its
old
companion
,


and
involve
itself
in
the
same
fate
.


it
be
before
this
ruinous
building
that
the
worthy
couple
pause
,
as


the
first
peal
of
distant
thunder
reverberate
in
the
air
,
and
the
rain


commence
pour
violently
down
.


'
the
place

be
somewhere
here

scrap


of
paper

on
the

'


Mr.
Bumble
,
who
have
eye
the
building
with
very
rueful
look
,
be


apparently
about
to
express
some
doubt
relative
to
the
advisability
of


proceed
any
far
with
the
enterprise
just
then
,
when

Mr.

,
who
be
ashamed
or
afraid
to
lag
behind

follow
:
obviously
very
ill
at
ease
and
with
scarcely
any
of
that


remarkable
dignity
which
be
usually
his
chief
characteristic
.


'
what
the
devil

there
,
in
the
wet
?
'

monk
,
turn
round
,
and
address

,
after

the


door
behind

the

'


with
this
agreeable
speech
,
Monks
turn
short
upon
the
matron

bend
his
gaze
upon

when
a
bright
flash
of


lightning
stream
down
the
aperture
,

a
peal
of
thunder
follow

make
a
melancholy
feint
of

fierce
determination

,
from
its
very


suppression
,
seem
only
the
more
furious
.

it

a
lie
!
I
'll
not

more

I
'll
tear
the
life
out

I
'll
know
what
it

she
do
n't
 
utter
another

the
woman

all
appearance


unmove
 
as
Mr.

be
very
far
from

by
the
strange
man
's


violence

clutch
my

one
hand

closed

I
see
that

be
dead

so
remove
the


hand
by
force
,
I
find
it
clasp
a
scrap

dirty
paper

contain
-
'
interpose
Monks
,
stretch
forward
.


'
nothing

the

'
in
good
time
I
'll
tell
you

the
woman
.

I
judge
that
she
have


keep
the
trinket
,
for
some
time
,
in
the
hope
of
turn
it
to
well


account
;

then
have
pawn
it
;

have
save
or
scrape
together


money
to
pay
the
pawnbroker
's
interest
year
by
year
,
and
prevent
its


run
out
;
so
that
if
anything
come
of
it
,
it
could
still
be


redeem
.
nothing
have
come
of
it
;
and
,
as
I
tell
you
,
she
die
with


the
scrap
of
paper
,
all
worn
and
tattere
,
in
her
hand
.
the
time
be


out
in
two
day
;
I
think
something
might
one
day
come
of
it
too
;

so
redeem
the
pledge
.

'
where
be
it
now

Monks
quickly

there

the
woman
.

,
as
if
glad
to
be
relieve
of
it
,


she
hastily
throw
upon
the
table
a
small
kid
bag
scarcely
large
enough


for
a
french
watch
,

pounce
upon

tremble

the
woman
.

there
be
a
blank
left
for
the
surname
;
and
then
follow
the
date
;


which
be
within
a
year
before
the
child
be
bear
.
I
find
out
that
.

'

this
be
all

Monks
,

a
close

eager
scrutiny

the


content

the
little
packet

'
all
,

the
woman
.


Mr.
Bumble
draw
a
long
breath
,
as
if
he
be
glad
to
find
that
the


story
be
over
,

no
mention
make
of
take
the
five

and
-
twenty


pound
back
again
;
and
now
he
take
courage
to
wipe
the
perspiration


which
have
be
trickle
over
his
nose
,
unchecked
,
during
the
whole
of


the
previous
dialogue

'
I
know
nothing

what
I
can
guess
at

his


wife
address
Monks
,
after
a
short
silence
;
'

I
want
to
know


nothing
;
for
it
be
safe
not
.

I
may
ask
you
two
question
,
may
I

'
you
may
ask
,

Monks
,
with
some
show
of
surprise
;
'
but
whether
I


answer
or
not
be
another
question
.
'


'
-
which
make
three
,
'
observe
Mr.
Bumble
,
essay
a
stroke
of


facetiousness
.


'

that
what
you
expect
to
get
from
I

the
matron
.


'
it
be
,
'

Monks
.
'
the
other
question
?
'


'
what
do
you
propose
to
do
with
it

can
it
be
use
against
I

'
never

against
I
either
.
see
here
!
but
do
n't


move
a
step
forward
,
or
your
life
be
not
worth
a
bulrush
.
'


with
these
word
,
he
suddenly
wheel
the
table
aside
,

pull
an


iron
ring
in
the
boarding
,
throw
back
a
large
trap

door

open

at
Mr.

the
lantern
into
the
gulf

I
could
have
let
you
down
,
quietly
enough
,
when
you

over
it
,

that
have
be
my
game

thus
encourage
,
the

near
to
the
brink
;

even
Mr.

himself
,

by
curiousity

venture
to
do

nap

forth
an
inquiry
what
time
of
night
it
be
.


the
room
in
which
Mr.
Sikes
propound
this
question
,

not
one
of


those
he
have
tenant
,
previous
to
the
Chertsey
expedition
,
although
it

in
the

quarter
of
the
town

situate
at
no
great


distance
from
his
former
lodging

it

not
,
in
appearance
,
so


desirable
a
habitation

his
old
quarter

a
mean

furnished
apartment

very
limited
size

only
by
one


small
window

abut
on
a
close
and
dirty


lane

be
there

other
indication
of
the
good
gentleman
's


having
go
down
in
the
world
of
late
:
for
a
great
scarcity
of


furniture
,
and
total
absence
of
comfort
,
together
with
the


disappearance
of
all
such
small
moveable
as
spare
clothe
and
linen
,


bespoke
a
state
of
extreme
poverty
;
while
the
meagre
and
attenuate


condition
of
Mr.
Sikes
himself

have
fully
confirm
these


symptom

the
cadaverous
hue
of
illness

the
addition
of
a
soil

prick
his
ear

the
amount

hand

they
part
without
more
conversation

a


'
good
-
night
.
'


when
the
girl
get
into
the
open
street
,
she
sit
down
upon
a
doorstep
;


and
seem
,
for
a
few
moment
,
wholly
bewildered
and
unable
to
pursue


her
way
.
suddenly
she
arise
;
and
hurry
on
,
in
a
direction
quite


opposite
to
that
in
which
Sikes
be
await
she
return
,
quicken


her
pace
,
until
it
gradually
resolve
into
a
violent
run
.
after


completely
exhausting
herself
,
she
stop
to
take
breath
:
and
,
as
if


suddenly
recollect
herself
,
and
deplore
her
inability
to
do


something
she
be
bent
upon
,
wring
her
hand
,
and
burst
into
tear
.


it
might
be
that
her
tear
relieve
she
,
or
that
she
feel
the
full


hopelessness
of
her
condition
;
but
she
turn
back
;
and
hurry
with


nearly
as
great
rapidity
in
the
contrary
direction
;
partly
to
recover


lose
time
,
and
partly
to
keep
pace
with
the
violent
current
of
her
own


thought
:
soon
reach
the
dwelling
where
she
have
leave
the


housebreaker
.


if
she
betray
any
agitation
,
when
she
present
herself
to
Mr.
Sikes
,


he
do
not
observe
it
;
for
merely
inquire
if
she
have
bring
the


money
,
and
receive
a
reply
in
the
affirmative
,
he
utter
a
growl
of


satisfaction
,
and
replace
his
head
upon
the
pillow
,
resume
the


slumber
which
her
arrival
have
interrupt
.


it
be
fortunate
for
she
that
the
possession
of
money
occasion
he
so


much
employment
next
day
in
the
way
of
eat
and
drink
;
and
withal


have
so
beneficial
an
effect
in
smooth
down
the
asperity
of
his


temper
;
that
he
have
neither
time
nor
inclination
to
be
very
critical


upon
her
behaviour
and
deportment
.
that
she
have
all
the
abstracted
and


nervous
manner
of
one
who
be
on
the
eve
of
some
bold
and
hazardous


step
,
which
it
have
require
no
common
struggle
to
resolve
upon
,
would


have
be
obvious
to
the
lynx
-
eyed
Fagin
,
who
would
most
probably
have


take
the
alarm
at
once
;
but
Mr.
Sikes
lack
the
nicety
of


discrimination
,
and
be
trouble
with
no
more
subtle
misgiving
than


those
which
resolve
themselves
into
a
dogged
roughness
of
behaviour


towards
everybody
;
and
be
,
furthermore
,
in
an
unusually
amiable


condition
,
as
have
be
already
observe
;
see
nothing
unusual
in
she


demeanor
,
and
indeed
,
trouble
himself
so
little
about
she
,
that
,
have


her
agitation
be
far
more
perceptible
than
it
be
,
it
would
have
be


very
unlikely
to
have
awaken
his
suspicion
.


as
that
day
close
in
,
the
girl
's
excitement
increase
;

,
when
night


come
on
,
and
she
sit
by
,
watch
until
the
housebreaker
should
drink


himself
asleep
,
there
be
an
unusual
paleness
in
her
cheek
,
and
a
fire


in
her
eye
,
that
even
Sikes
observe
with
astonishment
.


Mr.
Sikes

weak
from
the
fever

in

hot
water


with
his
gin
to

it
less
inflammatory

have
push
his
glass


towards
Nancy
to
be
replenish
for
the
third

fourth
time

these
symptom
first

so

her
hand
upon
her
eye

'


the
tone
of
force
gaiety
in
which
the
last
word
be
speak
,
seem


to
produce
a
deep
impression

rigid
look

most


noisome
of

something
of

original
nature

in
she
still
;

when

light


step
approach
the
door
opposite
to
that
by
which
she
have
enter
,


and
think
of
the
wide
contrast
which
the
small
room
would
in
another


moment
contain
,
she
feel
burden
with
the
sense
of
her
own
deep
shame
,


and
shrink
as

she
could
scarcely
bear
the
presence

miserable
companion

fall

associate

the
scouring

within
the
shadow

the
gallow

this
degraded
be

too
proud
to
betray
a
feeble
gleam
of
the


womanly
feeling
which
she
think
a
weakness
,
but
which
alone
connect


she
with
that
humanity
,

waste

it
the
other
way

what
a
game
it

haul
he
up
for
some
capital


felony

the


opportunity

from
it

a
claim
on
I

her
hand
,


'
if
you
could
take
my
life
at
once

I
have
feel
more
grief

think


of
what
I
be
,
to
-
night
,
than
I
ever
do
before
,
and
it
would
be


something
not

the
hell

I
have

thus
speak
,
and
sob
aloud
,
the
unhappy
creature

away
;


while
Rose
Maylie
,
overpower
by
this
extraordinary
interview
,
which


have
more
the
semblance
of
a
rapid
dream
than
an
actual
occurrence
,
sink


into
a
chair
,
and
endeavour
to
collect
her
wandering
thought
.


chapter
xli


contain
fresh
discovery
,
and
show
that
suprise
,
like


MISFORTUNES
,
seldom
come
alone


her
situation
be
,
indeed
,
one
of
no
common
trial
and
difficulty
.
while


she
feel
the
most
eager
and
burn
desire
to
penetrate
the
mystery
in


which
Oliver
's
history
be
envelop
,
she
could
not
but
hold
sacred
the


confidence
which
the
miserable
woman
with
whom
she
have
just
converse
,


have
repose
in
she
,
as
a
young
and
guileless
girl
.
her
word
and


manner
have
touch
Rose
Maylie
's
heart
;
and
,
mingle
with
her
love
for


her
young
charge
,
and
scarcely
less
intense
in
its
truth
and
fervour
,


be
her
fond
wish
to
win
the
outcast
back
to
repentance
and
hope
.


they
purpose
remain
in
London
only
three
day
,
prior
to
depart


for
some
week
to
a
distant
part
of
the
coast
.
it
be
now
midnight
of


the
first
day
.
what
course
of
action
could
she
determine
upon
,
which


could
be
adopt
in
eight
-
and
-
forty
hour
?
or
how
could
she
postpone


the
journey
without
exciting
suspicion
?


Mr.
Losberne
be
with
they
,
and
would
be
for
the
next
two
day
;
but


Rose
be
too
well
acquaint
with
the
excellent
gentleman
's


impetuosity
,
and
foresee
too
clearly
the
wrath
with
which
,
in
the
first


explosion
of
his
indignation
,
he
would
regard
the
instrument
of


Oliver
's
recapture
,
to
trust
he
with
the
secret
,
when
she


representation
in
the
girl
's
behalf
could
be
second
by
no


experienced
person
.
these
be
all
reason
for
the
great
caution


and
most
circumspect
behaviour
in
communicate
it
to
Mrs.
Maylie
,


whose
first
impulse
would
infallibly
be
to
hold
a
conference
with
the


worthy
doctor
on
the
subject
.
as
to
resort
to
any
legal
adviser
,


even
if
she
have
know
how
to
do
so
,
it
be
scarcely
to
be
think
of
,


for
the
same
reason
.
once
the
thought
occur
to
she
of
seek


assistance
from
Harry
;
but
this
awaken
the
recollection
of
their
last


parting
,
and
it
seem
unworthy
of
she
to
call
he
back
,
when
-
the


tear
rise
to
her
eye
as
she
pursue
this
train
of
reflection
-
he


might
have
by
this
time
learn
to
forget
she
,
and
to
be
happier
away
.


disturb
by
these
different
reflection
;
incline
now
to
one
course


and
then
to
another
,
and
again
recoil
from
all
,
as
each
successive


consideration
present
itself
to
her
mind
;
Rose
pass
a
sleepless
and


anxious
night
.
after
more
communing
with
herself
next
day
,
she
arrive


at
the
desperate
conclusion
of
consult
Harry
.


'
if
it
be
painful
to
he
,
'
she
think
,
'
to
come
back
here
,
how
painful


it
will
be
to
I
!
but
perhaps
he
will
not
come
;
he
may
write
,
or
he


may
come
himself
,
and
studiously
abstain
from
meet
I
-
he
do
when


he
go
away
.
I
hardly
think
he
would
;
but
it
be
well
for
we


both
.
'
and
here
Rose
drop
the
pen
,
and
turn
away
,
as
though
the


very
paper
which
be
to
be
her
messenger
should
not
see
she
weep
.


she
have
take
up
the
same
pen
,
and
lay
it
down
again
fifty
time
,
and


have
consider
and
reconsider
the
first
line
of
her
letter
without


write
the
first
word
,
when
Oliver
,
who
have
be
walk
in
the


street
,
with
Mr.
Giles
for
a
body
-
guard
,
enter
the
room
in
such


breathless
haste
and
violent
agitation
,
as
seem
to
betoken
some
new


cause
of
alarm
.


'
what
make
you
look
so
flurried
?
'
ask
Rose
,
advance
to
meet
he
.


'
I
hardly
know
how
;
I
feel
as
if
I
should
be
choke
,
'
reply
the
boy
.


'
oh
dear
!
to
think
that
I
should
see
he
at
last
,
and
you
should
be


able
to
know
that
I
have
tell
you
the
truth
!
'


'
I
never
think
you
have
tell
we
anything
but
the
truth
,
'

Rose
,


soothe
he
.
'
but
what
be
this
?
-
of
whom
do
you
speak
?
'


'
I
have
see
the
gentleman
,
'
reply
Oliver
,
scarcely
able
to


articulate
,
'
the
gentleman
who
be
so
good
to
I
-
Mr.
Brownlow
,
that
we

so
often

about

where

'
ask
Rose
.


'
get
out
of
a
coach
,
'
reply
Oliver
,
shed
tear
of
delight
,


'
and
go
into
a
house
.
I
do
n't
 
speak
to
he
-
I
could
n't
 
speak
to


he
,
for
he
do
n't
 
see
I
,
and
I
tremble
so
,
that
I
be
not
able
to
go


up
to
he
.
but
Giles
ask
,
for
I
,
whether
he
live
there
,
and
they


say
he
do

look
here

Oliver
,

a
scrap
of

'


with
her
attention
not
a
little
distract
by
these
and
a
great
many


other
incoherent
exclamation
of
joy

part
,

violence
on
the
side
of
Mr.
Brownlow
,
who
be


himself
of
an
irascible
temperament
,
and
party
by
such
argument
and


representation
as
seem
well
calculate
to
dissuade
he
from
his


hotbraine
purpose
.


'
then
what
the
devil
be
to
be
do
?
'
say
the
impetuous
doctor
,
when


they
have
rejoin
the
two
lady
.
'
be
we
to
pass
a
vote
of
thank
to


all
these
vagabond
,
male
and
female
,
and
beg
they
to
accept
a
hundred


pound
,
or
so
,
apiece
,
as
a
trifling
mark
of
our
esteem
,
and
some


slight
acknowledgment
of
their
kindness
to
Oliver
?
'


'
not
exactly
that
,
'
rejoin
Mr.
Brownlow
,
laugh
;
'
but
we
must


proceed
gently
and
with
great
care
.
'


'
gentleness
and
care
,
'
exclaim
the
doctor
.
'
I
'd
send
they
one
and


all
to
-
'


'
never
mind
where
,
'
interpose
Mr.
Brownlow
.
'
but
reflect
whether


send
they
anywhere
be
likely
to
attain
the
object
we
have
in
view
.
'


'
what
object
?
'
ask
the
doctor
.


'
simply
,
the
discovery
of
Oliver
's
parentage
,
and
regain
for
he
the


inheritance
of
which
,
if
this
story
be
true
,
he
have
be
fraudulently


deprive
.
'


'
ah
!
'
say
Mr.
Losberne
,
cool
himself
with
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
;


'
I
almost
forget
that
.
'


'
you
see
,
'
pursue
Mr.
Brownlow
;
'
place
this
poor
girl
entirely
out


of
the
question
,
and
suppose
it
be
possible
to
bring
these


scoundrel
to
justice
without
compromise
her
safety
,
what
good
should


we
bring
about
?
'


'
hang
a
few
of
they
at
least
,
in
all
probability
,
'
suggest
the


doctor
,
'
and
transport
the
rest
.
'


'
very
good
,
'
reply
Mr.
Brownlow
,
smile
;
'
but
no
doubt
they
will


bring
that
about
for
themselves
in
the
fulness
of
time
,
and
if
we
step


in
to
forestall
they
,
it
seem
to
I
that
we
shall
be
perform
a
very


quixotic
act
,
in
direct
opposition
to
our
own
interest
-
or
at
least
to


Oliver
's
,
which
be
the
same
thing
.
'


'
how
?
'
inquire
the
doctor
.


'
thus
.
it
be
quite
clear
that
we
shall
have
extreme
difficulty
in


get
to
the
bottom
of
this
mystery
,
unless
we
can
bring
this
man
,


monk
,
upon
his
knee
.
that
can
only
be
do
by
stratagem
,
and
by


catch
he
when
he
be
not
surround
by
these
people
.
for
,
suppose


he
be
apprehend
,
we
have
no
proof
against
he
.
he
be
not
even
 
so


far
as
we
know
,
or
as
the
fact
appear
to
we
 
concern
with
the
gang


in
any
of
their
robbery
.
if
he
be
not
discharge
,
it
be
very


unlikely
that
he
could
receive
any
further
punishment
than
be


commit
to
prison
as
a
rogue
and
vagabond
;
and
of
course
ever


afterwards
his
mouth
would
be
so
obstinately
close
that
he
might
as


well
,
for
our
purpose
,
be
deaf
,
dumb
,
blind
,
and
an
idiot
.
'


'
then
,
'
say
the
doctor
impetuously
,
'
I
put
it
to
you
again
,
whether


you
think
it
reasonable
that
this
promise
to
the
girl
should
be


consider
binding
;
a
promise
make
with
the
good
and
kind


intention
,
but
really
-
'


'
do
not
discuss
the
point
,
my
dear
young
lady
,
pray
,
'
say
Mr.


Brownlow
,
interrupt
Rose
as
she
be
about
to
speak
.
'
the
promise


shall
be
keep
.
I
do
n't
 
think
it
will
,
in
the
slight
degree
,


interfere
with
our
proceeding
.
but
,
before
we
can
resolve
upon
any


precise
course
of
action
,
it
will
be
necessary
to
see
the
girl
;
to


ascertain
from
she
whether
she
will
point
out
this
Monks
,
on
the


understanding
that
he
be
to
be
deal
with
by
we
,
and
not
by
the
law
;


or
,
if
she
will
not
,
or
can
not
do
that
,
to
procure
from
her
such
an


account
of
his
haunt
and
description
of
his
person
,
as
will
enable
we


to
identify
he
.
she
can
not
be

until
next
Sunday
night
;
this
be


Tuesday
.
I
would
suggest
that
in
the
meantime
,
we
remain
perfectly


quiet
,
and
keep
these
matter
secret
even
from
Oliver
himself
.
'


although
Mr.
Losberne
receive
with
many
wry
face
a
proposal
involve


a
delay
of
five
whole
day
,
he
be
fain
to
admit
that
no
well
course


occur
to
he
just
then
;
and
as
both
Rose
and
Mrs.

very


strongly
with
Mr.
Brownlow
,
that
gentleman
's
proposition

unanimously

'
I
should
like
,
'
he
say
,
'
to
call
in
the
aid
of
my
friend
Grimwig
.
he


be
a
strange
creature
,
but
a
shrewd
one
,
and
might
prove
of
material


assistance
to
we
;
I
should
say
that
he
be
breed
a
lawyer
,
and
quit


the
bar
in
disgust
because
he
have
only
one
brief
and
a
motion
of


course
,
in
twenty
year
,
though
whether
that
be
recommendation
or
not
,


you
must
determine
for
yourself
.
'


'
I
have
no
objection

calling

your
friend

I
may

it
to

may

be

old

with
an


expressive
glance
at

blush
deeply
,

she
do
not

any
audible
objection

DECIDED
MARKS

GENIUS

BECOMES
a
public
character
in
the
METROPOLIS


upon
the
night

towards
London
,


by
the
Great
North
Road
,
two
person
,
upon
whom
it
be
expedient
that


this
history
should
bestow
some
attention
.


they
be
a
man
and
woman
;
or
perhaps
they
would
be
well
describe
as


a
male
and
female

the
former

one
of
those
long

limbed
,


knock

kneed
,
shambling
,
bony
people
,
to
whom
it
be
difficult
to
assign


any
precise
age
,
-
look
as
they
do
,
when
they
be
yet
boy
,
like


undergrown
man
,
and
when
they
be
almost
man
,
like
overgrown
boy
.
the


woman

young
,
but
of
a
robust
and
hardy
make
,
as
she
need
have
be


to
bear
the
weight
of
the
heavy
bundle
which
be
strapped
to
she
back
.


her
companion

not
encumber
with
much
luggage
,

there
merely


dangle
from
a
stick
which
he
carry
over
his
shoulder
,
a
small
parcel


wrap
in
a
common
handkerchief
,
and
apparently
light
enough
.
this


circumstance

add
to
the
length
of
his
leg
,
which
be
of
unusual


extent

he
with
much
ease
to

his
companion

he
occasionally
turn
with
an


impatient
jerk
of
the
head
:
as
if
reproach
her
tardiness
,

urge
she
to
great
exertion

thus
,
they
have
toil
along
the
dusty
road

take
little
heed
of
any


object

when
they
step
aside

a
wide


passage
for
the

Mr.

.


whether
Noah

comprehensive
,
would
have
accede

to
these
glow
term
,
have
he


be
a
perfectly
free
agent

very
doubtful
;

as
he
recollect


that
,
in
the
event
of
his
refusal
,
it
be
in
the
power
of
his

give
he
up
to
justice
immediately

more
unlikely


thing
have
come
to

,
he
gradually
relent
,

he
think


that
would
suit
he
.

Noah

she
will
be
able

something
very
light

Noah

'
what
do
you
think
would


suit
I
now

something
not

for
the
strength
,

not
very


dangerous
,
you
know

the
sort
of
thing
!

turn
my
hand
to
it


sometimes
,

Mr.

by


itself

it


necessary
to

this
position
,

we

a

number

,

so

I

the

you

to

think
,
'

Fagin
,
shrug
his
shoulder
,
and
stretch
out


his
hand
;
'
only
consider
.
you
've
 
do
what
be
a
very
pretty
thing
,
and


what
I
love
you
for
do
;

what
at
the

time
would
put
the


cravat
round
your
throat
,
that
be
so
very
easily
tie

so
very


difficult

unloose

in
plain
English
,
the
halter
!
'


Mr.
Bolter
put
his
hand
to
his
neckerchief
,
as
if
he
feel
it


inconveniently
tight
;
and
murmur
an
assent
,
qualified
in
tone

not


in
substance
.


'
the
gallow
,
'

Fagin
,

dear
,

ugly


finger

out
a
very
short
and
sharp
turning

many
a
bold
fellow
's
career
on
the
broad
highway

to

in


the
easy
road

it
at
a
distance

object

one
with


you
.

'
of
course
it
be
,
'
reply
Mr.
Bolter
.
'
what
do
yer
talk
about
such


thing
for
?
'


'
only
to
show
you
my
meaning
clearly
,
'
say
the
Jew
,
raise
his


eyebrow
.
'
to
be
able
to
do
that
,
you
depend
upon
I
.
to
keep
my


little
business
all
snug
,
I
depend
upon
you
.
the
first
be
your
number


one
,
the
second
my
number
one
.
the
more
you
value
your
number
one
,
the


more
careful
you
must
be
of
mine
;
so
we
come
at
last
to
what
I
tell
you


at
first
-
that
a
regard
for
number
one
hold
we
all
together
,
and
must


do
so
,
unless
we
would
all
go
to
piece
in
company
.
'


'
that
be
true
,
'
rejoin
Mr.

,
thoughtfully
.
'
oh
!
yer
a
cunning


old
codger
!
'


Mr.
Fagin
see
,
with
delight
,
that
this
tribute
to
his
power
be
no


mere
compliment
,
but
that
he
have
really
impress
his
recruit
with
a


sense
of
his
wily
genius
,
which
it
be
most
important
that
he
should


entertain
in
the
outset
of
their
acquaintance
.
to
strengthen
an


impression
so
desirable
and
useful
,
he
follow
up
the
blow
by


acquaint
he
,
in
some
detail
,
with
the
magnitude
and
extent
of
his


operation
;
blend
truth
and
fiction
together
,
as
well
serve
his


purpose
;
and
bring
both
to
bear
,
with
so
much
art
,
that
Mr.
Bolter
's


respect
visibly
increase
,
and
became
temper
,
at
the
same
time
,
with


a
degree
of
wholesome
fear
,
which
it
be
highly
desirable
to
awaken
.


'
it
be
this
mutual
trust
we
have
in
each
other
that
console
I
under


heavy
loss
,

Mr.
Bolter
.

no
,
no

Fagin
,
'
not
so
bad
as
that
.
not
quite
so
bad

Mr.

very
.
he
be
charge
with
attempt
to
pick


a
pocket

they
find
a
silver
snuff

box
on
he
,

his
own
,
my
dear
,


his
own
,
for
he
take
snuff
himself

be
very
fond
of
it
.
they


remand
he
till
to

day
,
for
they
think
they
know
the
owner
.
ah
!
he


be
worth
fifty
box
,
and
I
'd
give
the
price
of
as
many
to
have

back

you

n't
 
yer

so
?
'

Mr.


Bolter
.


'
I
be
doubtful
about
it
,
'
reply
Fagin
,
with
a
sigh
.
'
if
they
do
n't


get
any
fresh
evidence
,
it
'll
only
be
a
summary
conviction
,
and
we


shall
have
he
back
again
after
six
week
or
so
;
but
,
if
they
do
,
it
be


a
case
of
lagging
.
they
know
what
a
clever
lad
he
be
;
he
'll
be
a


lifer
.
they
'll
make
the
artful
nothing
less
than
a
lifer
.
'


'
what
do
you
mean
by
lag
and
a
lifer
?
'
demand
Mr.
Bolter
.
'
what
be


the
good
of
talk
in
that
way
to
I
;
why
do

yer
speak
so
as
I
can


understand
yer

'


Fagin
be
about
to

these
mysterious
expression
into
the


vulgar
tongue
;

,
be

,
Mr.

into
a
look

comical
woe

it

all
up

dispose

consider
the

Dodger

in
the
light
of
a
victim
,

look
upon
he
as
the
chief
actor
in
a
scene
of
most
uncommon

exquisite
humour

quite
impatient

the

of
the
time


when
his

have
so
favourable
an

much
disgust

Mr.

wrong
shop
.
'


Master
Bates
laugh
so
vehemently
at
this
magnificent
threat
,
that
it


be
some
time
before
Fagin
could
interpose
,
and
represent
to
Mr.
Bolter


that
he
incur
no
possible
danger
in
visit
the
police
-
office
;


that
,
inasmuch
as
no
account
of
the
little
affair

which
he
have


engage
,
nor
any
description
of
his
person
,
have
yet
be
forward
to


the
metropolis
,
it
be
very
probable
that
he
be
not
even
suspect
of


having
resort
to
it
for
shelter
;
and
that
,
if
he
be
properly


disguise
,
it
would
be
as
safe
a
spot
for
he
to
visit
as
any
in


London
,
inasmuch
as
it
would
be
,
of
all
place
,
the
very
last
,
to
which


he
could
be
suppose
likely
to
resort
of
his
own
free
will
.


persuade
,
in
part
,
by
these
representation

overbear
in
a
much


great
degree
by
his
fear
of
Fagin
,
Mr.
Bolter
at
length
consent
,


with
a
very
bad
grace
,

undertake
the
expedition

direction

immediately

carter
's
whip
.
thus
equip
,


he
be
to
saunter
into
the
office
,

some
country
fellow
from
Covent


Garden
market
might
be
suppose
to
do
for
the
gratification
of

Mr.

no

chapter
XLIV


the
time
arrive
for
NANCY
to
redeem
her
pledge
to
ROSE
MAYLIE
.
she


fails
.


Adept
as
she
be
,
in
all
the
art
of
cunning
and
dissimulation
,
the


girl
Nancy
could
not
wholly
conceal
the
effect
which
the
knowledge
of


the
step
she
have
take
,
work
upon
her
mind
.
she
remember
that


both
the
crafty
Jew
and
the
brutal
Sikes
have
confide
to
her
scheme
,


which
have
be
hide
from
all
other
:
in
the
full
confidence
that
she


be
trustworthy
and
beyond
the
reach
of
their
suspicion
.
Vile
as
those


scheme
be
,
desperate
as
be
their
originator
,
and
bitter
as
be


her
feeling
towards
Fagin
,
who
have
lead
she
,
step
by
step
,
deep
and


deeply
down
into
an
abyss
of
crime
and
misery
,
whence
be
no
escape
;


still
,
there
be
time
when
,
even
towards
he
,
she
feel
some


relent
,
lest
her
disclosure
should
bring
he
within
the
iron
grasp


he
have
so
long
elude
,
and
he
should
fall
at
last
-
richly
as
he
merit


such
a
fate
-
by
her
hand
.


but
,
these
be
the
mere
wandering
of
a
mind
unable
wholly
to
detach


itself
from
old
companion
and
association
,
though
enable
to
fix


itself
steadily
on
one
object
,
and
resolve
not
to
be
turn
aside
by


any
consideration
.
her
fear
for
Sikes
would
have
be
more
powerful


inducement
to
recoil
while
there
be
yet
time
;
but
she
have
stipulate


that
her
secret
should
be
rigidly
keep
,
she
have
drop
no
clue
which


could
lead
to
his
discovery
,
she
have
refuse
,
even
for
his
sake
,
a


refuge
from
all
the
guilt
and
wretchedness
that
encompass
she
-
and


what
more
could
she
do
!
she
be
resolve
.


though
all
her
mental
struggle
terminate
in
this
conclusion
,
they


force
themselves
upon
she
,
again
and
again
,
and
leave
their
trace
too
.


she
grow
pale
and
thin
,
even
within
a
few
day
.
at
time
,
she
take
no


heed
of
what
be
pass
before
she
,
or
no
part
in
conversation
where


once
,
she
would
have
be
the
loud
.
at
other
time
,
she
laugh


without
merriment
,
and
be
noisy
without
a
moment
afterwards
-
she
sit


silent
and
dejected
,
brood
with
her
head
upon
her
hand
,
while
the


very
effort
by
which
she
rouse
herself
,
tell
,
more
forcibly
than
even


these
indication
,
that
she
be
ill
at
ease
,
and
that
her
thought
be


occupy
with
matter
very
different
and
distant
from
those
in
the


course
of
discussion
by
her
companion
.


it
be
Sunday

bell
of

near

the


hour

Jew

they
pause
to
listen
.
the


girl
look
up
from
the
low
seat
on
which
she
crouch
,

listen

Eleven
.


'
an
hour

side
of

Sikes

raise
the

out

to
his
seat

she
;

back

to
lay
his
hand
on
hers
,
but
say


good
-
night
again
,
in
a
steady
voice
,
and
,
answer
his
parting
look


with
a
nod
of
intelligence
,
close
the
door
between
they
.


Fagin
walk
towards
his
home
,
intent
upon
the
thought
that
be


work
within
his
brain
.
he
have
conceive
the
idea
-
not
from
what
have


just
pass
though
that
have
tend
to
confirm
he
,
but
slowly
and
by


degree
-
that
Nancy
,
weary
of
the
housebreaker
's
brutality
,
have


conceive
an
attachment
for
some
new
friend
.
her
altered
manner
,
she


repeat
absence
from
home
alone
,
her
comparative
indifference
to
the


interest
of
the
gang
for
which
she
have
once
be
so
zealous
,
and
,


add
to
these
,
her
desperate
impatience
to
leave
home
that
night
at
a


particular
hour
,
all
favour
the
supposition
,
and
render
it
,
to
he


at
least
,
almost
matter
of
certainty
.
the
object
of
this
new
liking


be
not
among
his
myrmidon
.
he
would
be
a
valuable
acquisition
with


such
an
assistant
as
Nancy
,
and
must
 
thus
Fagin
argue
 
be
secure


without
delay
.


there
be
another
,
and
a
dark
object
,
to
be
gain
.
sike
know
too


much
,
and
his
ruffian
taunt
have
not
gall
Fagin
the
less
,
because
the


wound
be
hide
.
the
girl
must
know
,
well
,
that
if
she
shake
he


off
,
she
could
never
be
safe
from
his
fury
,
and
that
it
would
be
surely


wreak
-
to
the
maiming
of
limb
,
or
perhaps
the
loss
of
life
-
on
the


object
of
her
more
recent
fancy
.


'
with
a
little
persuasion
,
'
think
Fagin
,
'
what
more
likely
than
that


she
would
consent
to
poison
he
?
woman
have
do
such
thing
,
and


bad
,
to
secure
the
same
object
before
now
.
there
would
be
the


dangerous
villain
:
the
man
I
hate
:
go
;
another
secure
in
his


place
;
and
my
influence
over
the
girl
,
with
a
knowledge
of
this
crime


to
back
it
,
unlimited
.
'


these
thing
pass
through
the
mind
of
Fagin
,
during
the
short
time
he


sit
alone
,
in
the
housebreaker
's
room
;
and
with
they
uppermost
in
his


thought
,
he
have
take
the
opportunity
afterwards
afford
he
,
of


sound
the
girl
in
the
broken
hint
he
throw
out
at
parting
.
there


be
no
expression
of
surprise
,
no
assumption
of
an
inability
to


understand
his
meaning
.
the
girl
clearly
comprehend
it
.
her
glance


at
parting
show
that
.


but
perhaps
she
would
recoil
from
a
plot
to
take
the
life
of
Sikes
,
and


that
be
one
of
the
chief
end
to
be
attain
.
'
how
,
'
think
Fagin
,
as


he
creep
homeward
,
'
can
I
increase
my
influence
with
she
?
what
new


power
can
I
acquire
?
'


such
brain
be
fertile
in
expedient
.
if
,
without
extract
a


confession
from
herself
,
he
lay
a
watch
,
discover
the
object
of
she


alter
regard
,
and
threaten
to
reveal
the
whole
history
to
Sikes
 
of


whom
she
stand
in
no
common
fear
 
unless
she
enter
into
his
design
,


could
he
not
secure
her
compliance
?


'
I
can
,
'
say
Fagin
,
almost
aloud
.
'
she
durst
not
refuse
I
then
.
not


for
her
life
,
not
for
her
life
!
I
have
it
all
.
the
mean
be
ready
,


and
shall
be
set
to
work
.
I
shall
have
you
yet

cast
back
a
dark
look
,

a
threatening
motion
of
the
hand
,
towards


the
spot
where
he
have
leave
the
bolder
villain
;
and
go
on
his
way
:


busy
his
bony
hand
in
the
fold
of
his
tattered
garment
,
which
he


wrench
tightly
in
his
grasp
,
as
though
there
be
a
hated
enemy


crush
with
every
motion
of
his
finger

a
steady

on
London
Bridge
.
one
,
which
advance
with
a
swift
and
rapid


step
,
be
that
of
a
woman
who
look
eagerly
about
she
as
though
in


quest
of
some
expect
object
;
the

that
of
a
man
,
who


slunk
along
in
the
deep
shadow
he
could
find
,
and
,
at
some
distance
,


accommodate
his
pace
to
hers
:
stop
when
she
stop
:
and
as
she


move
again
,
creep
stealthily
on
:
but
never
allow
himself
,
in


the
ardour
of
his
pursuit
,
to
gain
upon
her
footstep
.
thus
,
they


cross
the
bridge
,
from
the
Middlesex
to
the
Surrey
shore
,
when
the


woman
,
apparently
disappoint
in
her
anxious
scrutiny
of
the


foot

not

off
his
guard
by
it
;

,
shrink
into


one
of
the
recess
which
surmount
the
pier
of
the
bridge
,
and
lean


over
the
parapet
the
well
to
conceal
his
figure
,
he
suffer
she
to


pass
on
the
opposite
pavement
.
when
she
be
about
the
same
distance
in


advance
as
she
have
be
before
,
he
slip
quietly
down
,
and

of
the
bridge

without

without
noticing
,
either
the
woman
,
or
the
man
who
keep
she
in
view
.


their
appearance
be
not
calculate
to
attract
the
importunate
regard


of
such
of
London
's
destitute
population
,
as
chance
to
take
their
way


over
the
bridge
that
night
in
search
of
some
cold
arch
or
doorless


hovel
wherein
to
lay
their
head
;
they
stand
there
in
silence

any
one
who

red
glare
of
the
fire

burn
upon
the
small
craft
moor
off
the
different
wharf
,

dark
and

indistinct

murky
building

the
bank

heavy
and
dull


from
the
dense
mass
of
roof
and
gable
,
and
frown
sternly
upon
water


too
black
to
reflect
even
their
lumber

the
tower
of

thickly
scatter
spire
of

restless
turn
to
and

Midnight

midnight
be
upon
they


all
.


the
hour
have
not
strike
two

,
when
a
young
lady

accompany
by


a
grey

haired
gentleman
,
alight
from
a
hackney
-
carriage
within
a


short
distance
of
the
bridge
,
and
,
having
dismiss
the
vehicle
,
walk


straight
towards
it
.
they
have
scarcely
set
foot
upon
its
pavement
,


when
the
girl
start
,
and
immediately
make
towards
they
.


they
walk
onward
,
look
about
they
with
the
air
of
person
who


entertain
some
very
slight
expectation
which
have
little
chance
of


be
realise
,
when
they
be
suddenly
join
by
this
new
associate
.


they
halt
with
an
exclamation
of
surprise
,
but
suppress
it


immediately
;
for
a
man
in
the
garment
of
a
countryman
come
close


up
-
brush
against
they
,
indeed
-
at
that
precise
moment
.


'
not
here
,
'
say
Nancy
hurriedly
,
'
I
be
afraid
to
speak
to
you
here
.


come
away
-
out
of
the
public
road
-
down
the
step
yonder
!
'


as
she
utter
these
word
,
and
indicate
,
with
her
hand
,
the
direction


in
which
she
wish
they
to
proceed
,
the
countryman
look
round
,
and


roughly
ask
what
they
take
up
the
whole
pavement
for
,
pass
on
.


the
step
to
which
the
girl
have
point
,
be
those
which
,
on
the


Surrey
bank
,
and
on
the
same
side
of
the
bridge
as
Saint
Saviour
's


church
,
form
a
landing
-
stair
from
the
river
.
to
this
spot
,
the
man


bear
the
appearance
of
a
countryman
,
hasten
unobserved
;
and
after


a
moment
's
survey
of
the
place
,
he
begin
to
descend
.


these
stair
be
a
part
of
the
bridge
;
they
consist
of
three
flight
.


just
below
the
end
of
the
second
,
go
down
,
the
stone
wall
on
the


leave
terminate
in
an
ornamental
pilaster
face
towards
the
Thames
.


at
this
point
the
low
step
widen
:
so
that
a
person
turn
that


angle
of
the
wall
,
be
necessarily
unseen
by
any
other
on
the
stair


who
chance
to
be
above
he
,
if
only
a
step
.
the
countryman
look


hastily
round
,
when
he
reach
this
point
;
and
as
there
seem
no


well
place
of
concealment
,
and
,
the
tide
be
out
,
there
be
plenty


of
room
,
he
slip
aside
,
with
his
back
to
the
pilaster
,
and
there


wait
:
pretty
certain
that
they
would
come
no
low
,
and
that
even
if


he
could
not
hear
what
be
say
,
he
could
follow
they
again
,
with


safety
.


so
tardily
steal
the
time
in
this
lonely
place
,
and
so
eager
be
the


spy
to
penetrate
the
motive
of
an
interview
so
different
from
what
he


have
be
lead
to
expect
,
that
he
more
than
once
give
the
matter
up
for


lose
,
and
persuade
himself
,
either
that
they
have
stop
far
above
,
or


have
resort
to
some
entirely
different
spot
to
hold
their
mysterious


conversation
.
he
be
on
the
point
of
emerge
from
his
hiding
-
place
,


and
regain
the
road
above
,
when
he
hear
the
sound
of
footstep
,
and


directly
afterwards
of
voice
almost
close
at
his
ear
.


he
draw
himself
straight
upright
against
the
wall
,
and
,
scarcely


breathing
,
listen
attentively
.


'
this
be
far
enough
,
'
say
a
voice
,
which
be
evidently
that
of
the


gentleman
.
'
I
will
not
suffer
the
young
lady
to
go
any
far

many


people
would
have
distrust
you
too
much
to

come
even
so
far
,

willing
to
humour
you

purpose


can
you
have

we
to
this
strange
place

let
I


speak
to
you
,
above
there
,
where
it

light
,

there

something

dark
and
dismal
hole

'
I
tell
you

in
a
voice
so
low

often
difficult
for
the


listener
to
discover
even
the
purport
of
what
she

from
the
manner

on

most
in
the


habit

to

for
a
few
moment
,
for


the
purpose
of
recall
his

more
forcibly
to

on
the

FATAL
CONSEQUENCES


it

nearly
two

before
day
-

that
time
which

the
autumn


of
the
year
,
may
be
truly
call
the
dead
of
night
;

silent

to
slumber
,

riot
have
stagger
home
to
dream
;
it
be
at
this
still


and
silent
hour
,
that
Fagin
sat
watch
in
his
old
lair
,
with
face
so


distorted
and
pale
,
and
eye
so
red
and
blood
-
shot
,
that
he
look
less


like
a
man
,
than
like
some
hideous
phantom
,
moist
from
the
grave
,
and


worried
by
an
evil
spirit

crouch
over
a
cold
hearth
,

in
an
old
torn
coverlet

his
face
turn
towards

side

hot
grease
fall
down
in
clot

sincerity

morning


air
,
that
be
the
foul
and
most
cruel
.


the
sun
-
the
bright
sun
,
that
bring
back
,
not
light
alone
,
but
new


life
,
and
hope
,
and
freshness
to
man
-
burst
upon
the
crowded
city
in


clear
and
radiant
glory
.
through
costly
-
coloured
glass
and


paper
-
mend
window
,
through
cathedral
dome
and
rotten
crevice
,
it
shed


its
equal
ray
.
it
light
up
the
room
where
the
murder
woman
lie
.


it
do
.
he
try
to
shut
it
out
,
but
it
would
stream
in
.
if
the
sight


have
be
a
ghastly
one
in
the
dull
morning
,
what
be
it
,
now
,
in
all


that
brilliant
light
!


he
have
not
move
;
he
have
be
afraid
to
stir
.
there
have
be
a
moan


and
motion
of
the
hand
;
and
,
with
terror
add
to
rage
,
he
have
strike


and
strike
again
.
once
he
throw
a
rug
over
it
;
but
it
be
bad
to


fancy
the
eye
,
and
imagine
they
move
towards
he
,
than
to
see
they


glare
upward
,
as
if
watch
the
reflection
of
the
pool
of
gore
that


quiver
and
dance
in
the
sunlight
on
the
ceiling
.
he
have
pluck
it


off
again
.
and
there
be
the
body
-
mere
flesh
and
blood
,
no
more
-
but


such
flesh
,
and
so
much
blood
!


he
strike
a
light
,
kindle
a
fire
,
and
thrust
the
club
into
it
.
there


be
hair
upon
the
end
,
which
blaze
and
shrink
into
a
light
cinder
,


and
,
catch
by
the
air
,
whirl
up
the
chimney
.
even
that
frighten


he
,
sturdy
as
he
be
;
but
he
hold
the
weapon
till
it
break
,
and
then


pile
it
on
the
coal
to
burn
away
,
and
smoulder
into
ashe
.
he
wash


himself
,
and
rub
his
clothe
;
there
be
spot
that
would
not
be


remove
,
but
he
cut
the
piece
out
,
and
burn
they
.
how
those
stain


be
disperse
about
the
room
!
the
very
foot
of
the
dog
be
bloody
.


all
this
time
he
have
,
never
once
,
turn
his
back
upon
the
corpse
;
no
,


not
for
a
moment
.
such
preparation
complete
,
he
move
,
backward
,


towards
the
door
:
drag
the
dog
with
he
,
lest
he
should
soil
his


foot
anew
and
carry
out
new
evidence
of
the
crime
into
the
street
.
he


shut
the
door
softly
,
lock
it
,
take
the
key
,
and
leave
the
house
.


he
cross
over
,
and
glance
up
at
the
window
,
to
be
sure
that
nothing


be
visible
from
the
outside
.
there
be
the
curtain
still
draw
,
which


she
would
have
open
to
admit
the
light
she
never
see
again
.
it
lie


nearly
under
there
.
he
know
that
.
God
,
how
the
sun
pour
down
upon


the
very
spot
!


the
glance
be
instantaneous
.
it
be
a
relief
to
have
get
free
of
the


room
.
he
whistle
on
the
dog
,
and
walk
rapidly
away
.


he
go
through
Islington
;
stride
up
the
hill
at
Highgate
on
which


stand
the
stone
in
honour
of
Whittington
;
turn
down
to
Highgate


Hill
,
unsteady
of
purpose
,
and
uncertain
where
to
go
;
strike
off
to
the


right
again
,
almost
as
soon
as
he
begin
to
descend
it
;
and
take
the


foot
-
path
across
the
field
,
skirt
Caen
Wood
,
and
so
come
on


Hampstead
Heath
.
traverse
the
hollow
by
the
Vale
of
Heath
,
he


mount
the
opposite
bank
,
and
cross
the
road
which
join
the


village
of
Hampstead
and
Highgate
,
make
along
the
remain
portion
of


the
heath
to
the
field
at
North
End
,
in
one
of
which
he
lay
himself


down
under
a
hedge
,
and
sleep
.


soon
he
be
up
again
,
and
away
,
-
not
far
into
the
country
,
but
back


towards
London
by
the
high
-
road
-
then
back
again
-
then
over
another


part
of
the
same
ground
as
he
already
traverse
-
then
wander
up
and


down
in
field
,
and
lie
on
ditch
'
brink
to
rest
,
and
start
up


to
make
for
some
other
spot
,
and
do
the
same
,
and
ramble
on
again
.


where
could
he
go
,
that
be
near
and
not
too
public
,
to
get
some
meat


and
drink
?
Hendon
.
that
be
a
good
place
,
not
far
off
,
and
out
of


most
people
's
way
.
Thither
he
direct
his
step
,
-
run
sometimes
,


and
sometimes
,
with
a
strange
perversity
,
loitering
at
a
snail
's
pace
,


or
stop
altogether
and
idly
break
the
hedge
with
a
stick
.
but


when
he
get
there
,
all
the
people
he
meet
-
the
very
child
at
the


door
-
seem
to
view
he
with
suspicion
.
back
he
turn
again
,


without
the
courage
to
purchase
bit
or
drop
,
though
he
have
taste
no


food
for
many
hour
;
and
once
more
he
linger
on
the
Heath
,
uncertain


where
to
go
.


he
wander
over
mile
and
mile
of
ground
,
and
still
come
back
to
the


old
place
.
morning
and
noon
have
pass
,
and
the
day
be
on
the
wane
,


and
still
he
ramble
to
and
fro
,
and
up
and
down
,
and
round
and
round
,


and
still
linger
about
the
same
spot
.
at
last
he
get
away
,
and


shape
his
course
for
Hatfield
.


it
be
nine
o'clock
at
night
,
when
the
man
,
quite
tired
out
,
and
the


dog
,
limping
and
lame
from
the
unaccustomed
exercise
,
turn
down
the


hill
by
the
church
of
the
quiet
village
,
and
plod
along
the
little


street
,
creep
into
a
small
public
-
house
,
whose
scanty
light
have
guide


they
to
the
spot
.
there
be

fire
in
the

they
make
room
for
the
stranger
,
but
he
sit
down
in
the
furth


corner
,
and
eat
and
drank
alone
,
or
rather
with
his
dog
:
to
whom
he


cast
a
morsel
of
food
from
time
to
time
.

'


the
horn
sound
a
few
cheerful
note
,
and
the
coach
be
go
.


Sikes
remained
stand
in
the
street
,
apparently
unmove
by
what
he


have
just
hear
,
and
agitate
by
no
strong
feeling
than
a
doubt
where


to
go
.
at
length
he
go
back
again
,
and
take
the
road
which
lead


from
Hatfield
to
St.
Albans
.


he
go
on
doggedly
;
but
as
he
leave
the
town
behind
he
,
and
plunge


into
the
solitude
and
darkness
of
the
road
,
he
feel
a
dread
and
awe


creep
upon
he
which
shake
he
to
the
core
.
every
object
before
he
,


substance
or
shadow
,
still
or
move
,
take
the
semblance
of
some


fearful
thing
;
but
these
fear
be
nothing
compare
to
the
sense
that


haunt
he
of
that
morning
's
ghastly
figure
follow
at
his
heel
.


he
could
trace
its
shadow
in
the
gloom
,
supply
the
small
item
of
the


outline
,
and
note
how
stiff
and
solemn
it
seem
to
stalk
along
.
he


could
hear
its
garment
rustle
in
the
leave
,
and
every
breath
of


wind
come
laden
with
that
last
low
cry
.
if
he
stop
it
do
the
same
.


if
he
run
,
it
follow
-
not
run
too
:
that
would
have
be
a


relief
:
but
like
a
corpse
endow
with
the
mere
machinery
of
life
,
and


borne
on
one
slow
melancholy
wind
that
never
rise
or
fall
.


at
time
,
he
turn
,
with
desperate
determination
,
resolve
to
beat


this
phantom
off
,
though
it
should
look
he
dead
;
but
the
hair
rise
on


his
head
,
and
his
blood
stand
still
,
for
it
have
turn
with
he
and
be


behind
he
then
.
he
have
keep
it
before
he
that
morning
,
but
it
be


behind
now
-
always
.
he
lean
his
back
against
a
bank
,
and
feel
that


it
stand
above
he
,
visibly
out
against
the
cold
night
-
sky
.
he
throw


himself
upon
the
road
-
on
his
back
upon
the
road
.
at
his
head
it


stand
,
silent
,
erect
,
and
still
-
a
live
grave
-
stone
,
with
its
epitaph


in
blood
.


let
no
man
talk
of
murderer
escape
justice
,
and
hint
that
providence


must
sleep
.
there
be
twenty
score
of
violent
death
in
one
long


minute
of
that
agony
of
fear
.


there
be
a
shed
in
a
field
he
pass
,
that
offer
shelter
for
the


night
.
before
the
door
,
be
three
tall
poplar
tree
,
which
make
it


very
dark
within
;
and
the
wind
moan
through
they
with
a
dismal
wail
.


he
could
not
walk
on
,
till
daylight
come
again
;
and
here
he
stretch


himself
close
to
the
wall
-
to
undergo
new
torture
.


for
now
,
a
vision
come
before
he
,
as
constant
and
more
terrible
than


that
from
which
he
have
escape
.
those
widely
stare
eye
,
so


lustreless
and
so
glassy
,
that
he
have
well
borne
to
see
they
than


think
upon
they
,
appear
in
the
midst
of
the
darkness
:
light
in


themselves
,
but
give
light
to
nothing
.
there
be
but
two
,
but
they


be
everywhere
.
if
he
shut
out
the
sight
,
there
come
the
room
with


every
well
-
know
object
-
some
,
indeed
,
that
he
would
have
forget
,
if


he
have
go
over
its
content
from
memory
-
each
in
its
accustomed


place
.
the
body
be
in
its
place
,
and
its
eye
be
as
he
see
they


when
he
steal
away
.
he
get
up
,
and
rush
into
the
field
without
.
the


figure
be
behind
he
.
he
re
-
enter
the
shed
,
and
shrink
down
once


more
.
the
eye
be
there
,
before
he
have
lay
himself
along
.


and
here
he
remain
in
such
terror
as
none
but
he
can
know
,
tremble


in
every
limb
,
and
the
cold
sweat
start
from
every
pore
,
when


suddenly
there
arise
upon
the
night
-
wind
the
noise
of
distant
shouting
,


and
the
roar
of
voice
mingle
in
alarm
and
wonder
.
any
sound
of
man


in
that
lonely
place
,
even
though
it
convey
a
real
cause
of
alarm
,


be
something
to
he
.
he
regain
his
strength
and
energy
at
the


prospect
of
personal
danger
;
and
spring
to
his
foot
,
rush
into
the


open
air
.


the
broad
sky
seem
on
fire
.
rise
into
the
air
with
shower
of


spark
,
and
roll
one
above
the
other
,
be
sheet
of
flame
,
light


the
atmosphere
for
mile
round
,
and
drive
cloud
of
smoke
in
the


direction
where
he
stand
.
the
shout
grow
louder
as
new
voice
swell


the
roar
,
and
he
could
hear
the
cry
of
Fire
!
mingle
with
the
ring


of
an
alarm
-
bell
,
the
fall
of
heavy
body
,
and
the
crackling
of
flame


as
they
twine
round
some
new
obstacle
,
and
shoot
aloft
as
though


refresh
by
food
.
the
noise
increase
as
he
look
.
there
be


people
there
-
man
and
woman
-
light
,
bustle
.
it
be
like
new
life
to


he
.
he
dart
onward
-
straight
,
headlong
-
dash
through
brier
and


brake
,
and
leap
gate
and
fence
as
madly
as
his
dog
,
who
career


with
loud
and
sound
bark
before
he
.


he
come
upon
the
spot
.
there
be
half
-
dress

to
and


fro
,
some
endeavour
to
drag
the
frightened
horse
from
the
stable
,


other
drive
the
cattle
from
the
yard
and
out

house
,
and
other


come
laden
from
the
burn
pile
,
amidst
a
shower
of
fall
spark
,


and
the
tumbling
down
of
red
-
hot
beam
.
the
aperture
,
where
door
and


window
stand
an
hour
ago
,
disclose
a
mass
of
rage
fire
;
wall


rock
and
crumble
into
the
burning
well
;
the
molten
lead
and
iron


pour
down
,
white
hot
,
upon
the
ground
.
woman
and
child
shriek
,


and
man
encourage
each
other
with
noisy
shout
and
cheer
.
the


clanking
of
the
engine
-
pump
,
and
the
spirting
and
hissing
of
the
water


as
it
fall
upon
the
blaze
wood
,
add
to
the
tremendous
roar
.
he


shout
,
too
,
till
he
be
hoarse
;
and
fly
from
memory
and
himself
,


plunge
into
the
thickest
of
the
throng
.
hither
and
thither
he
dive


that
night
:
now
work
at
the
pump
,
and
now
hurry
through
the


smoke
and
flame
,
but
never
cease
to
engage
himself
wherever
noise
and


man
be
thick
.
up
and
down
the
ladder
,
upon
the
roof
of


building
,
over
floor
that
quake
and
tremble
with
his
weight
,
under


the
lee
of
fall
brick
and
stone
,
in
every
part
of
that
great
fire


be
he
;
but
he
bear
a
charmed
life
,
and
have
neither
scratch
nor
bruise
,


nor
weariness
nor
think
,
till
morning
dawn
again
,
and
only
smoke


and
blackened
ruin
remain
.


this
mad
excitement
over
,
there
return
,
with
ten
-
fold
force
,
the


dreadful
consciousness
of
his
crime
.
he
look
suspiciously
about
he
,


for
the
man
be
converse
in
group
,
and
he
fear
to
be
the
subject


of
their
talk
.
the
dog
obey
the
significant
beck
of
his
finger
,
and


they
draw
off
,
stealthily
,
together
.
he
pass
near
an
engine
where


some
man
be
seat
,
and
they
call
to
he
to
share
in
their


refreshment
.
he
take
some
bread
and
meat
;
and
as
he
drink
a
draught
of


beer
,
hear
the
fireman
,
who
be
from
London
,
talk
about
the


murder
.
'
he
have
go
to
Birmingham
,
they
say
,
'
say
one
:
'
but
they
'll


have
he
yet
,
for
the
scout
be
out
,
and
by
to
-
morrow
night
there
'll


be
a
cry
all
through
the
country
.
'


he
hurry
off
,
and
walk
till
he
almost
drop
upon
the
ground
;
then


lie
down
in
a
lane
,
and
have
a
long
,
but
broken
and
uneasy
sleep
.
he


wander
on
again
,
irresolute
and
undecided
,
and
oppress
with
the


fear
of
another
solitary
night
.


suddenly
,
he
take
the
desperate
resolution
to
go
back
to
London
.


'
there
be
somebody
to
speak
to
there
,
at
all
event
,
'
he
think
.
'
a
good


hiding
-
place
,
too
.
they
'll
never
expect
to
nab
I
there
,
after
this


country
scent
.
why
ca
n't
 
I
lie
by
for
a
week
or
so
,
and
,
force
blunt


from
Fagin
,
get
abroad
to
France
?
Damme
,
I
'll
risk
it
.
'


he
act
upon
this
impulse
without
delay
,
and
choose
the
least


frequent
road
begin
his
journey
back
,
resolve
to
lie
conceal


within
a
short
distance
of
the
metropolis
,
and
,
enter
it
at
dusk
by


a
circuitous
route
,
to
proceed
straight
to
that
part
of
it

at

Monks
hold
his

'
I
never

interrupt
MOnks
in
a
tone
intend
to
appear


incredulous
,

savour
more
of
disagreeable
surprise
.


'
he
come
to
I
,
and
leave
with
I
,
among
some
other
thing
,
a
picture
-
a


portrait
paint
by
himself
-
a
likeness
of
this
poor
girl
-
which
he
do


not
wish
to
leave
behind
,

be
wear
by
anxiety

remorse
almost
to
a
shadow
;

in
a
wild
,

way
,
of
ruin

dishonour

by
himself

confide
to

his

you
a
portion
of


his
recent
acquisition
,
to
fly

I

too
well
he
would


not
fly
alone

never

it
more

with

Toby

be
to
the

ken
of

find
they
fill
with
stranger
come
on
here

where
he

be
many
a
time

ca
n't


have
make
away
with
himself

ud
want
to
lead
we
away
to
where
he


do
it

no
.
I
think
he
be
get
out
of
the
country
,
and
leave
the
dog


behind
.
he
must
have
give
he
the
slip
somehow
,
or
he
would
n't
 
be
so


easy
.
'


this
solution
,
appear
the
most
probable
one
,
be
adopt
as
the


right
;
the
dog
,
creep
under
a
chair
,
coil
himself
up
to
sleep
,


without
more
notice
from
anybody
.


it
be
now
dark
,
the
shutter
be
close

the
terrible
event
of
the
last
two
day
have


make
a
deep
impression
on
all
three
,
increase
by
the
danger
and


uncertainty
of
their
own
position
.
they
draw
their
chair
close


together
,
start
at
every
sound
.
they
speak
little
,
and
that
in


whisper
,
and
be
as
silent
and
awe
-
stricken
as
if
the
remain
of
the


murder
woman
lie
in
the
next
room
.


they
have
sit
thus
,
some
time
,
when
suddenly
be

hurried


knock

'
Young

no

enough
.

such
a
tremble

that
the

upon
a

stand
in

over

two

old
,
when

,
at
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
in
a


travel

carriage
rolling
fast
towards
his
native
town
.

and
Mrs.
Bedwin
,
and

a
post

by
one
other
person


whose
name
have
not
be
mention
.


they
have
not
talk
much
upon
the
way
;
for
Oliver
be
in
a
flutter
of


agitation
and
uncertainty
which
deprive
he
of
the
power
of
collect


his
thought
,
and
almost
of
speech
,
and
appear
to
have
scarcely
less


effect
on
his
companion
,
who
share
it
,
in
at
least
an
equal
degree
.


he
and
the
two
lady
have
be
very
carefully
make
acquaint
by
Mr.


Brownlow
with
the
nature
of
the
admission
which
have
be
force
from


monk
;
and
although
they
know
that
the
object
of
their
present
journey


be
to
complete
the
work
which
have
be
so
well
begin
,
still
the
whole


matter
be
envelop
in
enough
of
doubt
and
mystery
to
leave
they
in


endurance
of
the
most
intense
suspense
.


the
same
kind
friend
have
,
with
Mr.
Losberne
's
assistance
,
cautiously


stop
all
channel
of
communication
through
which
they
could
receive


intelligence
of
the
dreadful
occurrence
that
so
recently
take
place
.


'
it
be
quite
true
,
'
he
say
,
'
that
they
must
know
they
before
long
,


but
it
might
be
at
a
well
time
than
the
present
,
and
it
could
not
be


at
a
bad
.
'
so
,
they
travel
on
in
silence
:
each
busy
with


reflection
on
the
object
which
have
bring
they
together
:
and
no
one


disposed
to
give
utterance
to
the
thought
which
crowd
upon
all
.


but
if
Oliver
,
under
these
influence
,
have
remain
silent
while
they


journey
towards
his
birth
-
place
by
a
road
he
have
never
see
,
how
the


whole
current
of
his
recollection
run
back
to
old
time
,
and
what
a


crowd
of
emotion
be
waken
up
in
his
breast
,
when
they
turn
into


that
which
he
have
traverse
on
foot
:
a
poor
houseless
,
wander
boy
,


without
a
friend
to
help
he
,
or
a
roof
to
shelter
his
head
.


'

as

the
town

at
length
drive
through
its
narrow


street
,

his

of
influence

FAGIN
's
last
night
ALIVE


the
court
be
pave
,
from
floor
to
roof
,
with
human
face
.
inquisitive


and
eager
eye
peer
from
every
inch
of
space
.
from
the
rail
before


the
dock
,
away
into
the
sharp
angle
of
the
small
corner
in
the


gallery
,
all
look
be
fix
upon
one
man
-
Fagin
.
before
he
and


behind
:
above
,
below
,
on
the
right
and
on
the
left
:
he
seem
to


stand
surround
by
a
firmament
,
all
bright
with
gleam
eye
.


he
stand
there
,
in
all
this
glare
of
live
light
,
with
one
hand


rest
on
the
wooden
slab
before
he
,
the
other
hold
to
his
ear
,
and


his
head
thrust
forward
to
enable
he
to
catch
with
great


distinctness
every
word
that
fall
from
the
preside
judge
,
who
be


deliver
his
charge
to
the
jury
.
at
time
,
he
turn
his
eye


sharply
upon
they
to
observe
the
effect
of
the
slight
featherweight


in
his
favour
;
and
when
the
point
against
he
be
state
with


terrible
distinctness
,
look
towards
his
counsel
,
in
mute
appeal
that


he
would
,
even
then
,
urge
something
in
his
behalf
.
beyond
these


manifestation
of
anxiety
,
he
stir
not
hand
or
foot
.
he
have


scarcely
move
since
the
trial
begin
;
and
now
that
the
judge
cease
to


speak
,
he
still
remain
in
the
same
strained
attitude
of
close


attention
,
with
his
gaze
bent
on
he
,
as
though
he
listen
still
.


a
slight
bustle
in
the
court
,
recall
he
to
himself
.
look
round
,


he
see
that
the
juryman
have
turn
together
,
to
consider
their
verdict
.


as
his
eye
wander
to
the
gallery
,
he
could
see
the
people
rise


above
each
other
to
see
his
face
:
some
hastily
apply
their
glass


to
their
eye
:
and
other
whisper
their
neighbour
with
look


expressive
of
abhorrence
.
a
few
there
be
,
who
seem
unmindful
of


he
,
and
look
only
to
the
jury
,
in
impatient
wonder
how
they
could


delay
.
but
in
no
one
face
-
not
even
among
the
woman
,
of
whom
there


be
many
there
-
could
he
read
the
faint
sympathy
with
himself
,
or


any
feeling
but
one
of
all
-
absorb
interest
that
he
should
be


condemn
.


as
he
see
all
this
in
one
bewildered
glance
,
the
deathlike
stillness


come
again
,
and
look
back
he
see
that
the
juryman
have
turn
towards


the
judge
.
Hush
!


they
only
seek
permission
to
retire
.


he
look
,
wistfully
,
into
their
face
,
one
by
one
when
they
pass


out
,
as
though
to
see
which
way
the
great
number
leant
;
but
that
be


fruitless
.
the
jailer
touch
he
on
the
shoulder
.
he
follow


mechanically
to
the
end
of
the
dock
,
and
sit
down
on
a
chair
.
the
man


point
it
out
,
or
he
would
not
have
see
it
.


he
look
up
into
the
gallery
again
.
some
of
the
people
be
eat
,


and
some
fan
themselves
with
handkerchief
;
for
the
crowded
place


be
very
hot
.
there
be
one
young
man
sketch
his
face
in
a
little


note
-
book
.
he
wonder
whether
it
be
like
,
and
look
on
when
the


artist
break
his
pencil
-
point
,
and
make
another
with
his
knife
,
as
any


idle
spectator
might
have
do
.


in
the
same
way
,
when
he
turn
his
eye
towards
the
judge
,
his
mind


begin
to
busy
itself
with
the
fashion
of
his
dress
,
and
what
it
cost
,


and
how
he
put
it
on
.
there
be
an
old
fat
gentleman
on
the
bench
,


too
,
who
have
go
out
,
some
half
an
hour
before
,
and
now
come
back
.
he


wonder
within
himself
whether
this
man
have
be
to
get
his
dinner
,


what
he
have
have
,
and
where
he
have
have
it
;
and
pursue
this
train
of


careless
thought
until
some
new
object
catch
his
eye
and
rouse


another
.


not
that
,
all
this
time
,
his
mind
be
,
for
an
instant
,
free
from
one


oppressive
overwhelming
sense
of
the
grave
that
open
at
his
foot
;
it


be
ever
present
to
he
,
but
in
a
vague
and
general
way
,
and
he
could


not
fix
his
thought
upon
it
.
thus
,
even
while
he
tremble
,
and
turn


burn
hot
at
the
idea
of
speedy
death
,
he
fall
to
count
the
iron


spike
before
he
,
and
wonder
how
the
head
of
one
have
be
break


off
,
and
whether
they
would
mend
it
,
or
leave
it
as
it
be
.
then
,
he


think
of
all
the
horror
of
the
gallow
and
the
scaffold
-
and
stop


to
watch
a
man
sprinkle
the
floor
to
cool
it
-
and
then
go
on
to


think
again
.


at
length
there
be
a
cry
of
silence
,
and
a
breathless
look
from
all


towards
the
door
.
the
jury
return
,
and
pass
he
close
.
he
could


glean
nothing
from
their
face
;
they
might
as
well
have
be
of
stone
.


perfect
stillness
ensue
-
not
a
rustle
-
not
a
breath
-
Guilty
.


the
building
ring
with
a
tremendous
shout
,
and
another
,
and
another
,


and
then
it
echo
loud
groan
,
that
gather
strength
as
they
swell


out
,
like
angry
thunder
.
it
be
a
peal
of
joy
from
the
populace


outside
,
greet
the
news
that
he
would
die
on
Monday
.


the
noise
subside
,
and
he
be
ask
if
he
have
anything
to
say
why


sentence
of
death
should
not
be
pass
upon
he
.
he
have
resume
his


listen
attitude
,
and
look
intently
at
his
questioner
while
the


demand
be
make
;
but
it
be
twice
repeat
before
he
seem
to
hear
it
,


and
then
he
only
mutter
that
he
be
an
old
man
-
an
old
man
-
and
so
,


drop
into
a
whisper
,
be
silent
again
.


the
judge
assume
the
black
cap
,
and
the
prisoner
still
stand
with
the


same
air
and
gesture
.
a
woman
in
the
gallery
,
utter
some


exclamation
,
call
forth
by
this
dread
solemnity
;
he
look
hastily
up


as
if
angry
at
the
interruption
,
and
bend
forward
yet
more
attentively
.


the
address
be
solemn
and
impressive
;
the
sentence
fearful
to
hear
.


but
he
stand
,
like
a
marble
figure
,
without
the
motion
of
a
nerve
.
his


haggard
face
be
still
thrust
forward
,
his
under
-
jaw
hang
down
,
and


his
eye
stare
out
before
he
,
when
the
jailer
put
his
hand
upon
his


arm
,
and
beckon
he
away
.
he
gaze
stupidly
about
he
for
an


instant
,
and
obey
.


they
lead
he
through
a
paved
room
under
the
court
,
where
some
prisoner


be
wait
till
their
turn
come
,
and
other
be
talk
to
their


friend
,
who
crowd
round
a
grate
which
look
into
the
open
yard
.


there
be
nobody
there
to
speak
to
he
;
but
,
as
he
pass
,
the


prisoner
fall
back
to
render
he
more
visible
to
the
people
who
be


cling
to
the
bar
:
and
they
assail
he
with
opprobrious
name
,


and
screech
and
hiss
.
he
shake
his
fist
,
and
would
have
spat
upon


they
;
but
his
conductor
hurry
he
on
,
through
a
gloomy
passage


light
by
a
few
dim
lamp
,
into
the
interior
of
the
prison
.


here
,
he
be
search
,
that
he
might
not
have
about
he
the
mean
of


anticipate
the
law
;
this
ceremony
perform
,
they
lead
he
to
one
of


the
condemn
cell
,
and
leave
he
there
-
alone
.


he
sit
down
on
a
stone
bench
opposite
the
door
,
which
serve
for
seat


and
bedstead
;
and
cast
his
blood
-
shot
eye
upon
the
ground
,
try
to


collect
his
thought
.
after
awhile
,
he
begin
to
remember
a
few


disjoint
fragment
of
what
the
judge
have
say
:
though
it
have
seem


to
he
,
at
the
time
,
that
he
could
not
hear
a
word
.
these
gradually


fall
into
their
proper
place
,
and
by
degree
suggest
more
:
so
that


in
a
little
time
he
have
the
whole
,
almost
as
it
be
deliver
.
to
be


hang
by
the
neck
,
till
he
be
dead
-
that
be
the
end
.
to
be
hang


by
the
neck
till
he
be
dead
.


as
it
come
on
very
dark
,
he
begin
to
think
of
all
the
man
he
have
know


who
have
die
upon
the
scaffold
;
some
of
they
through
his
mean
.
they


rise
up
,
in
such
quick
succession
,
that
he
could
hardly
count
they
.
he


have
see
some
of
they
die
,
-
and
have
joke
too
,
because
they
die
with


prayer
upon
their
lip
.
with
what
a
rattle
noise
the
drop
go


down
;
and
how
suddenly
they
change
,
from
strong
and
vigorous
man
to


dangle
heap
of
clothe
!


some
of
they
might
have
inhabit
that
very
cell
-
sit
upon
that
very


spot
.
it
be
very
dark
;
why
do
n't
 
they
bring
a
light
?
the
cell
have


be
build
for
many
year
.
score
of
man
must
have
pass
their
last


hour
there
.
it
be
like
sit
in
a
vault
strew
with
dead


body
-
the
cap
,
the
noose
,
the
pinion
arm
,
the
face
that
he
know
,


even
beneath
that
hideous
veil
.
-
light
,
light
!


at
length
,
when
his
hand
be
raw
with
beat
against
the
heavy
door


and
wall
,
two
man
appear
:
one
bear
a
candle
,
which
he
thrust


into
an
iron
candlestick
fix
against
the
wall
:
the
other
drag
in


a
mattress
on
which
to
pass
the
night
;
for
the
prisoner
be
to
be
leave


alone
no
more
.


then
come
the
night
-
dark
,
dismal
,
silent
night
.
other
watcher
be


glad
to
hear
this
church
-
clock
strike
,
for
they
tell
of
life
and
come


day
.
to
he
they
bring
despair
.
the
boom
of
every
iron
bell
come


laden
with
the
one
,
deep
,
hollow
sound
-
death
.
what
avail
the
noise


and
bustle
of
cheerful
morning
,
which
penetrate
even
there
,
to
he
?


it
be
another
form
of
knell
,
with
mockery
add
to
the
warning
.


the
day
pass
off
.
day
?
there
be
no
day
;
it
be
go
as
soon
as


come
-
and
night
come
on
again
;
night
so
long
,
and
yet
so
short
;
long
in


its
dreadful
silence
,
and
short
in
its
fleeting
hour
.
at
one
time
he


rave
and
blasphemed
;
and
at
another
howled
and
tear
his
hair
.


venerable
man
of
his
own
persuasion
have
come
to
pray
beside
he
,
but
he


have
drive
they
away
with
curse
.
they
renew
their
charitable


effort
,
and
he
beat
they
off
.


Saturday
night
.
he
have
only
one
night
more
to
live
.
and
as
he
think


of
this
,
the
day
break
-
Sunday
.


it
be
not
until
the
night
of
this
last
awful
day
,
that
a
wither


sense
of
his
helpless
,
desperate
state
come
in
its
full
intensity
upon


his
blighted
soul
;
not
that
he
have
ever
hold
any
defined
or
positive


hope
of
mercy
,
but
that
he
have
never
be
able
to
consider
more
than


the
dim
probability
of
die
so
soon
.
he
have
speak
little
to
either
of


the
two
man
,
who
relieve
each
other
in
their
attendance
upon
he
;
and


they
,
for
their
part
,
make
no
effort
to
rouse
his
attention
.
he
have


sit
there
,
awake
,
but
dream
.
now
,
he
start
up
,
every
minute
,
and


with
gasp
mouth
and
burn
skin
,
hurry
to
and
fro
,
in
such
a


paroxysm
of
fear
and
wrath
that
even
they
-
use
to
such


sight
-
recoil
from
he
with
horror
.
he
grow
so
terrible
,
at
last
,


in
all
the
torture
of
his
evil
conscience
,
that
one
man
could
not
bear


to
sit
there
,
eye
he
alone
;
and
so
the
two
keep
watch
together
.


he
cower
down
upon
his
stone
bed
,
and
thought
of
the
past
.
he
have


be
wound
with
some
missile
from
the
crowd
on
the
day
of
his


capture
,
and
his
head
be
bandage
with
a
linen
cloth
.
his
red
hair


hang
down
upon
his
bloodless
face
;
his
beard
be
tear
,
and
twist
into


knot
;
his
eye
shine
with
a
terrible
light
;
his
unwashed
flesh


crackle
with
the
fever
that
burn
he
up
.
eight
-
nine
-
then
.
if
it


be
not
a
trick
to
frighten
he
,
and
those
be
the
real
hour
tread


on
each
other
's
heel
,
where
would
he
be
,
when
they
come
round
again
!


Eleven
!
another
strike
,
before
the
voice
of
the
previous
hour
have


cease
to
vibrate
.
at
eight
,
he
would
be
the
only
mourner
in
his
own


funeral
train
;
at
eleven
-


those
dreadful
wall
of
Newgate
,
which
have
hide
so
much
misery
and


such
unspeakable
anguish
,
not
only
from
the
eye
,
but
,
too
often
,
and


too
long
,
from
the
thought
,
of
man
,
never
hold
so
dread
a
spectacle
as


that
.
the
few
who
linger
as
they
pass
,
and
wonder
what
the
man


be
do
who
be
to
be
hang
to
-
morrow
,
would
have
sleep
but
ill
that


night
,
if
they
could
have
see
he
.


from
early
in
the
evening
until
nearly
midnight
,
little
group
of
two


and
three
present
themselves
at
the
lodge
-
gate
,
and
inquire
,
with


anxious
face
,
whether
any
reprieve
have
be
receive
.
these
be


answer
in
the
negative
,
communicate
the
welcome
intelligence
to


cluster
in
the
street
,
who
point
out
to
one
another
the
door
from


which
he
must
come
out
,
and
show
where
the
scaffold
would
be
build
,


and
,
walk
with
unwilling
step
away
,
turn
back
to
conjure
up
the


scene
.
by
degree
they
fall
off
,
one
by
one
;
and
,
for
an
hour
,
in
the


dead
of
night
,
the
street
be
leave
to
solitude
and
darkness
.


the
space
before
the
prison
be
clear
,
and
a
few
strong
barrier
,


paint
black
,
have
be
already
throw
across
the
road
to
break
the


pressure
of
the
expect
crowd
,
when
Mr.
Brownlow
and
Oliver
appear


at
the
wicket
,
and
present
an
order
of
admission
to
the
prisoner
,


sign
by
one
of
the
sheriff
.

have


see
he
in
the
full
career
of
his
success
and
villainy
,
I
think
it
as


well
-
even
at
the
cost
of
some
pain
and
fear
-
that

now

few
word
have

inaudible

the
man
touch
his
hat
;
and
glance
at
Oliver
with
some
curiousity
,

that
by
which
they
have
enter

with
the


noise

ascend
a

of
narrow

train
of


reflection
whether
an
honest
life
be
not
,
after
all
,
the
good
.


arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
it
certainly
be
,
he
turn
his
back


upon
the
scene
of
the
past
,
resolve
to
amend
it
in
some
new
sphere
of


action

struggle
hard
,

suffer
much
,
for
some
time
;

,


have
a
contented
disposition
,
and
a
good
purpose
,
succeed
in
the


end
;
and
,
from
be
a
farmer
's
drudge
,
and
a
carrier
's
lad
,
he
be
now


the
merry
young
grazier
in
all
northamptonshire
.


and
now
,
the
hand
that
trace
these
word
,
falter
,
as
it
approach


the
conclusion
of
its
task
;
and
would
weave
,
for
a
little
long
space
,


the
thread
of
these
adventure
.


I
would
fain
linger
yet
with
a
few
of
those
among
whom
I
have
so
long


move
,
and
share
their
happiness
by
endeavour
to
depict
it
.
I
would


show
Rose
Maylie
in
all
the
bloom
and
grace
of
early
womanhood
,


shed
on
her
secluded
path
in
life
soft
and
gentle
light
,
that
fall


on
all
who
trod
it
with
she
,
and
shine
into
their
heart
.
I
would


paint
she
the
life
and
joy
of
the
fire
-
side
circle
and
the
lively


summer
group
;
I
would
follow
she
through
the
sultry
field
at
noon
,
and


hear
the
low
tone
of
her
sweet
voice
in
the
moonlit
evening
walk
;
I


would
watch
she
in
all
her
goodness
and
charity
abroad
,
and
the
smile


untire
discharge
of
domestic
duty
at
home
;
I
would
paint
she
and


her
dead
sister
's
child
happy
in
their
love
for
one
another
,
and


pass
whole
hour
together
in
picture
the
friend
whom
they
have
so


sadly
lose
;
I
would
summon
before
I
,
once
again
,
those
joyous
little


face
that
cluster
round
her
knee
,
and
listen
to
their
merry
prattle
;


I
would
recall
the
tone
of
that
clear
laugh
,
and
conjure
up
the


sympathise
tear
that
glisten
in
the
soft
blue
eye
.
these
,
and
a


thousand
look
and
smile
,
and
turn
of
thought
and
speech
-
I
would


fain
recall
they
every
one
.


how
Mr.
Brownlow
go
on
,
from
day
to
day
,
fill
the
mind
of
his


adopt
child
with
store
of
knowledge
,
and
becoming
attach
to
he
,


more
and
more
,
as
his
nature
develop
itself
,
and
show
the
thrive


seed
of
all
he
wish
he
to
become
-
how
he
trace
in
he
new
trait


of
his
early
friend
,
that
awaken
in
his
own
bosom
old
remembrance
,


melancholy
and
yet
sweet
and
soothe
-
how
the
two
orphan
,
try
by


adversity
,
remember
its
lesson
in
mercy
to
other
,
and
mutual
love
,


and
fervent
thank
to
he
who
have
protect
and
preserve
they
-
these


be
all
matter
which
need
not
to
be
tell
.
I
have
say
that
they
be


truly
happy
;
and
without
strong
affection
and
humanity
of
heart
,
and


gratitude
to
that
be
whose
code
be
Mercy
,
and
whose
great
attribute


be
benevolence
to
all
thing
that
breathe
,
happiness
can
never
be


attain
.


within
the
altar
of
the
old
village
church
there
stand
a
white
marble


tablet
,
which
bear
as
yet
but
one
word
:
'
AGNES
.
'
there
be
no
coffin


in
that
tomb
;
and
may
it
be
many
,
many
year
,
before
another
name
be


place
above
it
!
but
,
if
the
spirit
of
the
Dead
ever
come
back
to


earth
,
to
visit
spot
hallow
by
the
love
-
the
love
beyond
the


grave
-
of
those
whom
they
know
in
life
,
I
believe
that
the
shade
of


agne
sometimes
hover
round
that
solemn
nook
.
I
believe
it
none
the


less
because
that
nook
be
in
a
Church
,
and
she
be
weak
and
err
.
