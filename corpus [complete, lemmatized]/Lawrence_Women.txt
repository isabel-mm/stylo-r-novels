there
be
a
blank
pause

"
yes

in
a
narrow
voice

ask
coldly
.

on
Ursula

Gudrun
look
at
Ursula
with
a
masklike
,
expressionless
face
.
Ursula


knit
her
brow
.




"
perhaps

at
her
sister
,
almost
hostile
.




"
exactly
,
"
she
say
,
to
close
the
conversation
.




the
two

on
in
silence
,
Ursula

always
that
strange


brightness
of
an
essential
flame
that
be
catch
,
mesh
,
contravene
.


she

a
good
deal
by
herself

to
herself
,
work
,
pass
on
from


day
to
day
,
and
always
think
,
try
to
lay
hold
on
life
,
to
grasp


it
in
her
own
understanding
.
her
active
living
be
suspend
,
but


underneath
,
in
the
darkness
,
something
be
come
to
pass
.
if
only
she


could
break
through
the
last
integument

seem
to
try
and
put
she


hand
out
,
like
an
infant
in
the
womb
,
and
she
could
not

not
yet
.


still
she
have
a
strange
prescience
,
an
intimation
of
something
yet
to


come
.




she
lay
down
her
work
and
look
at
her
sister
.
she
think
Gudrun
so


_
charming

,
so
infinitely
charming
,
in
her
softness
and
her
fine
,


exquisite
richness
of
texture
and
delicacy
of
line
.
there
be
a
certain


playfulness
about
she
too
,
such
a
piquancy
or
ironic
suggestion
,
such


an
untouched
reserve

Ursula
admire
she
with
all
her
soul
.




"
why

from
under

finely

"

.
"




and
she
look
with
a
long
,
slow
look
of
knowledge
at
Ursula
.




"
I

"
cry
Ursula
,

Gudrun
,
somewhat
superbly
.

slow
mocking
smile

she
ask
.




Gudrun
pause
for
some
moment
,
coldly
,
before
answer
.
then
,
in
a


cold
truthful
voice
,
she
say
:




"
I
find
myself
completely
out
of

"




"

"




Gudrun
look
at
Ursula
,
almost
with
resentment
,
as
if
bring
to
bay
.




"
I
have
n’t

she
say
coldly
.




"
yes

"
waver
Ursula
;
and
the
conversation
be
really
at
an
end
.
the


sister
find
themselves
confront
by
a
void
,
a
terrifying
chasm
,
as


if
they
have
look
over
the
edge
.




they
work
on
in
silence
for
some
time
,
Gudrun
’s
cheek
be
flush


with
repressed
emotion
.
she
resent
its
having
be
call
into
being
.




"
shall
we
go
out
and
look
at
that
wedding
?
"
she
ask
at
length
,
in
a


voice
that
be
too
casual
.




"
yes
!
"
cry
Ursula
,
too
eagerly
,
throw
aside
her
sewing
and
leap


up
,
as
if
to
escape
something
,
thus
betray
the
tension
of
the


situation
and
cause
a
friction
of
dislike
to
go
over
Gudrun

straight
towards
the


gate

woman
make
way
for

barely
sufficient

over
the
girl

violent
and
murderous
.

would
have

round

branch
off


up

Ursula
look


at
she
,
and
think
how
amazingly
beautiful
she
be
,
flush
with


discomfiture
.
but
she
cause
a
constraint
over
Ursula
’s
nature
,
a


certain
weariness
.
Ursula
wish
to
be
alone
,
free
from

tightness
,


the
enclosure
of
Gudrun

"




for
the
moment
,
the
sunshine
fall
brightly
into
the
churchyard
,
there


be
a
vague
scent
of
sap
and
of
spring
,
perhaps
of
violet
from
off
the


grave
.
some
white
daisy
be
out

bright
as

punctually

eleven
o’clock
,

carriage

to
arrive
.
there
be


a
stir
in
the
crowd
at
the
gate

concentration

Gudrun
watch
they
closely
,
with
objective
curiosity
.
she
see
each
one


as
a
complete
figure
,
like
a
character
in
a
book
,
or
a
subject
in
a


picture
,
or
a
marionette
in
a
theatre
,
a
finished
creation

to
recognise
their
various
characteristic
,
to
place
they
in
their
true


light
,
give
they
their
own

they
for
ever
as
they


pass
before
she
along
the
path
to
the
church

she
know
they
,
they


be
finish
,
seal
and
stamp
and
finish
with
,
for
she
.
there
be


none
that
have
anything
unknown
,
unresolved
,
until
the
Criches


themselves
begin
to
appear
.
then
her
interest
be
pique
.
here
be


something
not
quite
so
preconcluded
.




there

the
mother
,
Mrs
Crich
,
with
her
eld
son
Gerald

a


queer
unkempt
figure
,
in
spite
of
the
attempt
that
have
obviously
be


make
to
bring
she
into
line
for
the
day
.
her
face
be
pale
,
yellowish
,


with
a
clear
,
transparent
skin
,
she
lean
forward
rather
,
her
feature


be
strongly
mark
,
handsome
,
with
a
tense
,
unseeing
,
predative
look

colourless
hair

untidy

to
her
sac
coat


of
dark
blue
silk
,
from
under
her
blue
silk
hat
.
she
look
like
a


woman
with
a
monomania
,
furtive
almost
,
but
heavily
proud
.




her
son
be
of
a
fair
,

rather
above

make
,
and
almost
exaggeratedly
well

dress
.
but
about
he
also


be
the
strange
,
guard
look
,
the
unconscious
glisten
,
as
if

she
.
in
his
clear
northern
flesh
and
his
fair
hair
be
a
glisten
like


sunshine
refract
through
crystal
of
ice
.
and
he
look
so
new
,


unbroached
,
pure
as
an
arctic
thing
.
perhaps
he
be
thirty
year
old
,


perhaps
more
.
his
gleaming
beauty
,
maleness
,
like
a
young
,


good
-
humoured
,
smile
wolf
,
do
not
blind
she
to
the
significant
,


sinister
stillness
in
his
bearing
,
the
lurk
danger
of
his
unsubdue


temper
.
"
his
totem
be
the
wolf
,
"
she
repeat
to
herself
.
"
his
mother


be
an
old
,
unbroken
wolf
.
"
and
then
she
experience
a
keen
paroxyism
,
a


transport
,
as
if
she
have
make
some
incredible
discovery
,
know
to


nobody
else
on
earth
.
a
strange
transport
take
possession
of
she
,
all


her
vein
be
in
a
paroxysm
of
violent
sensation
.
"
good
God
!
"
she


exclaim
to
herself
,
"
what
be
this
?
"
and
then
,
a
moment
after
,
she
be


say
assuredly
,
"
I
shall
know
more
of
that
man
.
"
she
be
torture


with
desire
to
see
he
again
,
a
nostalgia
,
a
necessity
to
see
he


again
,
to
make
sure
it
be
not
all
a
mistake
,
that
she
be
not
delude


herself
,
that
she
really
feel
this
strange
and
overwhelming
sensation


on
his
account
,
this
knowledge
of
he
in
her
essence

powerful


apprehension
of
he

out
for

in
some
way

there
really
some
pale
gold
,
arctic
light
that
envelop
only
we
two

"


she
ask
herself
.
and
she
could
not
believe
it
,
she
remain
in
a


muse
,
scarcely
conscious
of
what

on
around
.




the
bridesmaid
be
here
,
and
yet
the
bridegroom
have
not

Ursula


wonder
if
something
be
amiss
,
and
if
the
wedding
would
yet
all
go


wrong
.
she
feel
troubled
,
as
if
it

upon
she
.
the
chief


bridesmaid

tall
,
slow
,
reluctant
woman
with
a
weight
of
fair
hair


and
a
pale
,
long
face
.
this
be
Hermione
Roddice
,
a
friend
of
the


criche
.
now
she
come
along
,
with
her
head
hold
up
,
balance
an


enormous
flat
hat
of
pale
yellow
velvet
,
on
which
be
streak
of


ostrich
feather
,
natural
and
grey
.
she
drift
forward
as
if
scarcely


conscious
,
her
long
blanched
face
lift
up
,
not
to
see
the
world
.
she


be
rich
.
she
wear
a
dress
of
silky
,
frail
velvet
,
of
pale
yellow


colour
,
and

hat
,
her
hair
be
heavy
,
she
drift
along
with
a
peculiar
fixity
of


the
hip
,
a
strange
unwilling
motion
.
she
be
impressive
,
in
her
lovely


pale
-
yellow
and
brownish
-
rise
,
yet
macabre
,
something
repulsive
.
People


be
silent
when
she
pass
,
impressed
,
rouse
,
want
to
jeer

for
some
reason

pale
face
,
that
she
carry
lift


up
,
somewhat
in
the
Rossetti
fashion
,
seem
almost
drug
,
as
if
a


strange
mass
of
thought
coil
in
the
darkness
within
she

over
a
chasm
,

,
in
spite
of
all
she


vanity
and
security
,
any
common
maid
-
servant
of
positive
,
robust


temper
could
fling
she
down
this
bottomless
pit
of
insufficiency
,
by


the
slight
movement
of
jeer
or
contempt
.

she
could
never

up
the
terrible
gap

Birkin
be
as
thin
as
Mr

ill

looking
.
his
figure

narrow

with
a
slight
trail

consciousness

although
he

dress
correctly


for
his
part

there
be
an
innate
incongruity

cause
a
slight


ridiculousness
in
his
appearance
.
his
nature
be
clever
and
separate
,


he
do
not
fit
at
all
in
the
conventional

he
affect
to
be
quite
ordinary
,
perfectly

it
so
well

the
tone
of
his

himself
quickly

ask
musingly

expressionless
indecision

up

again
Hermione
pause
,
as
if
to
allow
this
statement
to
cool

then
she

with
strange
assumption

authority

"
yes

even
so

the
patriotic
appeal
an
appeal

"

sharp
flame

muted
voice

she
seem
to
flow
back
,
almost
like
liquid
,
from
his
approach
,
to
sink


helplessly
away
from

her
inchoate

passive
substance

tingle
with
the


subtle

biting
sensation

must
go
away
from

there
must

somewhat
,

mute
and
lifeless
still

a
torment
to
she
when
anybody
speak
to


she
.
her
face

at
night
they
come
back
to
the
flat
very
late
again
,
again
flush
with


drink
.
again
the
man
-
servant
—
who
invariably
disappear
between
the


hour
of
ten
and
twelve
at
night
—
come
in
silently
and
inscrutably
with


tea
,
bend
in
a
slow
,
strange
,
leopard
-
like
fashion
to
put
the
tray


softly
on
the
table
.
his
face
be
immutable
,
aristocratic
-
look
,


tinge
slightly
with
grey
under
the
skin
;
he
be
young
and


good
-
look
.
but
Birkin
feel
a
slight
sickness
,
look
at
he
,
and


feel
the
slight
greyness
as
an
ash
or
a
corruption
,
in
the


aristocratic
inscrutability
of
expression
a
nauseating
,
bestial


stupidity
.




again
they
talk
cordially
and
rousedly
together
.
but
already
a


certain
friability
be
come
over
the
party
,
Birkin
be
mad
with


irritation
,
Halliday
be
turn
in
an
insane
hatred
against
Gerald
,


the
Pussum
be
become
hard
and
cold
,
like
a
flint
knife
,
and
Halliday


be
lay
himself
out
to
she
.
and
her
intention
,
ultimately
,
be
to


capture
Halliday
,
to
have
complete
power
over
he
.




in
the
morning
they
all
stalk
and
lounge
about
again
.
but
Gerald


could
feel
a
strange
hostility
to
himself
,
in
the
air
.
it
rouse
his


obstinacy
,
and
he
stand
up
against
it
.
he
hang
on
for
two
more
day
.


the
result
be
a
nasty
and
insane
scene
with
Halliday
on
the
fourth


evening
.
Halliday
turn
with
absurd
animosity
upon
Gerald
,
in
the


café
.
there
be
a
row
.
Gerald
be
on
the
point
of
knock
-
in


Halliday
’s
face
;
when
he
be
fill
with
sudden
disgust
and


indifference
,
and
he
go
away
,
leave
Halliday
in
a
foolish
state
of


gloat
triumph
,
the
Pussum
hard
and
establish
,
and
Maxim
standing


clear
.
Birkin
be
absent
,
he
have
go
out
of
town
again
.




Gerald
be
pique
because
he
have
leave
without
give
the
Pussum
money
.


it
be
true
,
she
do
not
care
whether
he
give
her
money
or
not
,
and
he


know
it
.
but
she
would
have
be
glad
of
ten
pound
,
and
he
would
have


be
_
very
_
glad
to
give
they
to
she
.
now
he
feel
in
a
false
position
.


he
go
away
chew
his
lip
to
get
at
the
end
of
his
short
clip


moustache
.
he
know
the
Pussum
be
merely
glad
to
be
rid
of
he
.
she
have


get
she
Halliday
whom
she
want
.
she
want
he
completely
in
she


power
.
then
she
would
marry
he
.
she
want
to
marry
he
.
she
have
set


her
will
on
marry
Halliday
.
she
never
want
to
hear
of
Gerald


again
;
unless
,
perhaps
,
she
be
in
difficulty
;
because
after
all
,


Gerald
be
what
she
call
a
man
,
and
these
other
,
Halliday
,


Libidnikov
,
Birkin
,
the
whole
Bohemian
set
,
they
be
only
half
man
.


but
it
be
half
man
she
could
deal
with
.
she
feel
sure
of
herself
with


they
.
the
real
man
,
like
Gerald
,
put
she
in
her
place
too
much
.




still
,
she
respect
Gerald
,
she
really
respect
he
.
she
have
manage


to
get
his
address
,
so
that
she
could
appeal
to
he
in
time
of


distress
.
she
know
he
want
to
give
her
money
.
she
would
perhaps
write


to
he
on
that
inevitable
rainy
day

thank
you
.
"




even
Alexander
be
rather
authoritative
where
Hermione
be
cool
.
he


take
his
tone
from
she
,
inevitably
.
Birkin
sit
down
and
look
at
the


table
.
he
be
so
used
to
this
house
,
to
this
room
,
to
this
atmosphere
,


through
year
of
intimacy
,
and
now
he
feel
in
complete
opposition
to
it


all
,
it
have
nothing
to
do
with

how
well
he
know
Hermione

there
,
erect
and
silent
and
somewhat
bemused
,
and
yet
so
potent
,
so


powerful
!
he
know
she
statically
,
so
finally
,
that
it
be
almost
like
a


madness
.
it
be
difficult
to
believe
one
be
not
mad
,
that
one
be
not


a
figure
in
the
hall
of
king
in
some
egyptian
tomb
,
where
the
dead
all


sit
immemorial

how
utterly

Joshua
Mattheson

who
be
talk
in
his
harsh
,

endlessly
,


endlessly
,
always
with
a
strong
mentality
work
,
always
interesting
,


and
yet
always
know
,
everything
he
say
know
beforehand
,
however


novel
it
be
,
and
clever

,
the


little
italian
Countess
take
notice
of
everybody

only
play
she


little
game
,
objective
and
cold
,

a
weasel
watch
everything
,
and


extract
her
own
amusement
,
never
give
herself
in

then
Miss

heavy
and
rather
subservient
,
treat
with
cool
,


almost
amused

therefore
slight

it

bind
to


strive
to
come
up
to
her
criterion

fulfil
her
idea
of
a
man

a


human

after

finish
their

.
there
have
be
some
discussion
,


on
the
whole
quite
intellectual
and
artificial
,
about
a
new
state
,
a


new
world
of
man

suppose
this
old
social
state

be
_
break
and


destroy
,
then
,
out
of
the
chaos
,
what
then
?




the
great
social
idea
,
say
Sir
Joshua
,
be
the
_
social
_
equality
of


man
.
no
,
say
Gerald
,
the
idea
be
,
that
every
man
be
fit
for
his
own


little
bit
of
a
task
—
let
he
do
that
,
and
then

principle

up
by
the
crushed
pain

once
more

straight
down
on
the
head

a
flask
that


be
smash
to
atom
,
he
seem
to
himself
that
he
be
all
fragment
,


smash
to
bit
.
yet
his
movement
be
perfectly
coherent
and
clear
,


his
soul
be
entire
and
unsurprised
.




"
no

n’t
,
Hermione
,
"
he
say
in
a
low
voice
.
"
I
do
n’t
let
you

"




he
see
her
stand
tall
and
livid
and
attentive
,
the
stone
clench


tense
in
her
hand
.




"
stand
away
and
let
I
go
,
"
he
say
,
draw
near
to
she
.




as
if
press
back
by
some
hand
,
she
stand
away
,
watch
he
all
the


time
without
change
,
like
a
neutralise
angel
confront
he
.




"
it
be
not
good
,
"
he
say
,
when
he
have
go
past
she
.
"
it
be
n’t
I
who


will
die
.
you
hear
?
"




he
keep
his
face
to
she
as
he
go
out
,
lest
she
should
strike
again
.


while
he
be
on
his
guard
,
she
dare
not
move
.
and
he
be
on
his
guard
,


she
be
powerless
.
so
he
have
go
,
and
leave
she
standing
.




she
remain
perfectly
rigid
,
stand
as
she
be
for
a
long
time
.
then


she
stagger
to
the
couch
and
lie
down
,
and
go
heavily
to
sleep
.


when
she
awake
,
she
remember
what
she
have
do
,
but
it
seem
to
she
,


she
have
only
hit
he
,
as
any
woman
might
do
,
because

torture
she
.


she
be
perfectly
right
.
she
know
that
,
spiritually
,
she
be
right
.
in


her
own
infallible
purity
,
she
have
do
what
must
be
do
.
she
be


right
,
she
be
pure
.
a
drugged
,
almost
sinister
religious
expression


become
permanent
on
her
face
.




Birkin
,
barely
conscious
,
and
yet
perfectly
direct
in
his
motion
,
go


out
of
the
house
and
straight
across
the
park
,
to
the
open
country
,
to


the
hill
.
the
brilliant
day
have
become
overcast
,
spot
of
rain
be


fall
.
he
wander
on
to
a
wild
valley
-
side
,
where
be
thicket
of


hazel
,
many
flower
,
tuft
of
heather
,
and
little
clump
of
young


fir
-
tree
,
bud
with
soft
paw
.
it
be
rather
wet
everywhere
,
there


be
a
stream
run
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
valley
,
which
be


gloomy
,
or
seem
gloomy
.
he
be
aware
that
he
could
not
regain
his


consciousness
,
that
he
be
move
in
a
sort
of
darkness
.




yet
he
want
something
.
he
be
happy
in
the
wet
hillside
,
that
be


overgrown
and
obscure
with
bush
and
flower
.
he
want
to
touch
they


all
,
to
saturate
himself
with
the
touch
of
they
all
.
he
take
off
his


clothe
,
and
sit
down
naked
among
the
primrose
,
move
his
foot
softly


among
the
primrose
,
his
leg
,
his
knee
,
his
arm
right
up
to
the


arm
-
pit
,
lie
down
and
let
they
touch
his
belly
,
his
breast
.
it


be
such
a
fine
,
cool
,
subtle
touch
all
over
he
,
he
seem
to
saturate


himself
with
their
contact
.




but
they
be
too
soft
.
he
go
through
the
long
grass
to
a
clump
of


young
fir
-
tree
,
that
be
no
high
than
a
man
.
the
soft
sharp
bough


beat
upon
he
,
as
he
move
in
keen
pang
against
they
,
throw
little


cold
shower
of
drop
on
his
belly
,
and
beat
his
loin
with
their


cluster
of
soft
-
sharp
needle
.
there
be
a
thistle
which
prick
he


vividly
,
but
not
too
much
,
because
all
his
movement
be
too


discriminate
and
soft
.
to
lie
down
and
roll
in
the
sticky
,
cool
young


hyacinth
,
to
lie
on
one
’s
belly
and
cover
one
’s
back
with
handful
of


fine
wet
grass
,
soft
as
a
breath
,
soft
and
more
delicate
and
more


beautiful
than
the
touch
of
any
woman
;
and
then
to
ste
one
’s
thigh


against
the
live
dark
bristle
of
the
fir
-
bough
;
and
then
to
feel


the
light
whip
of
the
hazel
on
one
’s
shoulder
,
stinging
,
and
then
to


clasp
the
silvery
birch
-
trunk
against
one
’s
breast
,
its
smoothness
,
its


hardness
,
its
vital
knot
and
ridge
—
this
be
good
,
this
be
all
very


good
,
very
satisfying
.
nothing
else
would
do
,
nothing
else
would


satisfy
,
except
this
coolness
and
subtlety
of
vegetation
travel


into
one
’s
blood
.
how
fortunate
he
be
,
that
there
be
this
lovely
,


subtle
,
responsive
vegetation
,
wait
for
he
,
as
he
wait
for
it
;


how
fulfil
he
be
,
how
happy
!




as
he
dry
himself
a
little
with
his
handkerchief
,
he
think
about


Hermione
and
the
blow
.
he
could
feel
a
pain
on
the
side
of
his
head
.


but
after
all
,
what
do
it
matter
?
what
do
Hermione
matter
,
what
do


people
matter
altogether
?
there
be
this
perfect
cool
loneliness
,
so


lovely
and
fresh
and
unexplored
.
really
,
what
a
mistake
he
have
make
,


think
he
want
people
,
think
he
want
a
woman
.
he
do
not
want


a
woman
—
not
in
the
least
.
the
leave
and
the
primrose
and
the
tree
,


they
be
really
lovely
and
cool
and
desirable
,
they
really
come
into


the
blood
and
be
add
on
to
he
.
he
be
enrichene
now
immeasurably
,


and
so
glad
.




it
be
quite
right
of
Hermione
to
want
to
kill
he
.
what
have
he
to
do


with
she
?
why
should
he
pretend
to
have
anything
to
do
with
human


being
at
all
?
here
be
his
world
,
he
want
nobody
and
nothing
but
the


lovely
,
subtle
,
responsive
vegetation
,
and
himself
,
his
own
living


self
.




it
be
necessary
to
go
back
into
the
world
.
that
be
true
.
but
that
do


not
matter
,
so
one
know
where
one
belong
.
he
know
now
where
he


belong
.
this
be
his
place
,
his
marriage
place
.
the
world
be


extraneous
.




he
climb
out
of
the
valley
,
wonder
if
he
be
mad
.
but
if
so
,
he


prefer
his
own
madness
,
to
the
regular
sanity
.
he
rejoice
in
his


own
madness
,
he
be
free
.
he
do
not
want
that
old
sanity
of
the
world
,


which
be
become
so
repulsive
.
he
rejoice
in
the
new
-
find
world
of


his
madness
.
it
be
so
fresh
and
delicate
and
so
satisfying
.




as
for
the
certain
grief
he
feel
at
the
same
time
,
in
his
soul
,
that


be
only
the
remain
of
an
old
ethic
,
that
bid
a
human
being
adhere
to


humanity
.
but
he
be
weary
of
the
old
ethic
,
of
the
human
being
,
and
of


humanity
.
he
love
now
the
soft
,
delicate
vegetation
,
that
be
so
cool


and
perfect
.
he
would
overlook
the
old
grief
,
he
would
put
away
the
old


ethic
,
he
would
be
free
in
his
new
state
.




he
be
aware
of
the
pain
in
his
head
become
more
and
more
difficult


every
minute
.
he
be
walk
now
along
the
road
to
the
near
station
.


it
be
rain
and
he
have
no
hat
.
but
then
plenty
of
crank
go
out


nowadays
without
hat
,
in
the
rain
.




he
wonder
again
how
much
of
his
heaviness
of
heart
,
a
certain


depression
,
be
due
to
fear
,
fear
lest
anybody
should
have
see
he


naked
lying
against
the
vegetation
.
what
a
dread
he
have
of
mankind
,
of


other
people
!
it
amount
almost
to
horror
,
to
a
sort
of
dream


terror
—
his
horror
of
be
observe
by
some
other
people
.
if
he
be
on


an
island
,
like
Alexander
Selkirk
,
with
only
the
creature
and
the


tree
,
he
would
be
free
and
glad
,
there
would
be
none
of
this


heaviness
,
this
misgiving
.
he
could
love
the
vegetation
and
be
quite


happy
and
unquestioned
,
by
himself
.




he
have
well
send
a
note
to
hermione
:
she
might
trouble
about
he
,
and


he
do
not
want
the
onus
of
this
.
so
at
the
station
,
he
write
say
:






I
will
go
on
to
town
—
I
do
n’t
want
to
come
back
to
Breadalby
for
the


present
.
but
it
be
quite
all
right
—
I
do
n’t
want
you
to
mind
have


biff
I
,
in
the
least
.
tell
the
other
it
be
just
one
of
my
mood
.


you
be
quite
right
,
to
biff
I
—
because
I
know
you
want
to
.
so


there
’
the
end
of
it
.






in
the
train
,
however
,
he
feel
ill
.
every
motion
be
insufferable
pain
,


and
he
be
sick
.
he
drag
himself
from
the
station
into
a
cab
,


feel
his
way
step
by
step
,
like
a
blind
man
,
and
hold
up
only
by
a


dim
will
.




for
a
week
or
two
he
be
ill
,
but
he
do
not
let
Hermione
know
,
and
she


think
he
be
sulk
;
there
be
a
complete
estrangement
between
they
.


she
become
rapt
,
abstract
in
her
conviction
of
exclusive


righteousness
.
she
live
in
and
by
her
own
self

,
conviction
of

whilst

,
that
have
dwelling


on
one
side
,

dusty
young

in

young

after
Gudrun

Ursula
objectively
,
as
if
he


wish
to
calculate
what
there
might
be

between
the
house

the
heavy
gold
glamour
of
approach
sunset
lie
over
all


the
colliery
district
,

the
ugliness

with
beauty

like
a


narcotic

the
sense

they
be
pass
between
block
of
miner
’
dwelling
.
in
the
back


yard
of
several
dwelling
,
a
miner
could
be
see
wash
himself
in


the
open
on
this
hot
evening
,
naked
down
to
the
loin
,
his
great


trouser
of
moleskin
slip
almost
away

miner
already
clean
be


sit
on
their
heel
,
with
their
back
near
the
wall
,
talk
and


silent
in
pure
physical
well
-
being
,
tired
,
and
take
physical
rest
.


their
voice
sound
out
with
strong
intonation
,
and
the
broad
dialect


be
curiously
caress
to
the
blood
.
it
seem
to
envelop
Gudrun
in
a


labourer
’s
caress
,
there
be
in
the
whole
atmosphere
a
resonance
of


physical
man
,
a
glamorous
thickness
of
labour
and
maleness
,
surcharge


in
the
air
.
but
it
be
universal
in
the
district
,
and
therefore


unnoticed
by
the
inhabitant
.




to
Gudrun
,
however
,
it
be
potent
and
half
-
repulsive
.
she
could
never


tell
why
Beldover
be
so
utterly
different
from
London
and
the
south
,


why
one
’s
whole
feeling
be
different
,
why
one
seem
to
live
in


another
sphere
.
now
she
realise
that
this
be
the
world
of
powerful
,


underworld
man
who
spend
most
of
their
time
in
the
darkness
.
in
their


voice
she
could
hear
the
voluptuous
resonance
of
darkness
,
the
strong
,


dangerous
underworld
,
mindless
,
inhuman
.
they
sound
also
like
strange


machine
,
heavy
,
oiled
.
the
voluptuousness
be
like
that
of
machinery
,


cold
and
iron
.




it
be
the
same
every
evening
when
she
come
home
,
she
seem
to
move


through
a
wave
of
disruptive
force
,
that
be
give
off
from
the


presence
of
thousand
of
vigorous
,
underworld
,
half
-
automatise


collier
,
and
which
go
to
the
brain
and
the
heart
,
awake
a
fatal


desire
,
and
a
fatal
callousness
.




there
come
over
she
a
nostalgia
for
the
place
.
she
hate
it
,
she
know


how
utterly
cut
off
it
be
,
how
hideous
and
how
sickeningly
mindless
.


sometimes
she
beat
her
wing
like
a
new
Daphne
,
turn
not
into
a
tree


but
a
machine
.
and
yet
,
she
be
overcome
by
the
nostalgia
.
she


struggle
to
get
more
and
more
into
accord
with
the
atmosphere
of
the


place
,
she
crave
to
get
her
satisfaction
of
it
.




she
feel
herself
draw
out
at
evening
into
the
main
street
of
the
town
,


that
be
uncreated
and
ugly
,
and
yet
surcharge
with
this
same
potent


atmosphere
of
intense
,
dark
callousness
.
there
be
always
miner


about
.
they
move
with
their
strange
,
distorted
dignity
,
a
certain


beauty
,
and
unnatural
stillness
in
their
bearing
,
a
look
of
abstraction


and
half
resignation
in
their
pale
,
often
gaunt
face
.
they
belong
to


another
world
,
they
have
a
strange
glamour
,
their
voice
be
full
of
an


intolerable
deep
resonance
,
like
a
machine
’s
burring
,
a
music
more


madden
than
the
siren
’s
long
ago
.




she
find
herself
,
with
the
rest
of
the
common
woman
,

out
on

,

endless
mining
and
political


wrangle
,
vibrate
in

discordant
machinery
.
and
it
be


their
voice
which
affect
Gudrun
almost
to
swoon
.
they
arouse
a


strange
,
nostalgic
ache
of
desire
,
something
almost
demoniacal
,
never


to
be
fulfil
.




like
any
other
common
girl
of
the
district
,
Gudrun
stroll
up
and


down
,
up
and
down
the
length
of
the
brilliant
two
-
hundred
pace
of
the


pavement
nearest
the
market
-
place
.
she
know
it
be
a
vulgar
thing
to


do
;
her
father
and
mother
could
not
bear
it
;
but
the
nostalgia
come


over
she
,
she
must
be
among
the
people
.
sometimes
she
sit
among
the


lout
in
the
cinema
:
rakish
-
look
,
unattractive
lout
they
be
.
yet


she
must
be
among
they
.




and
,
like
any
other
common
lass
,
she
find
her
'
boy
.
'
it
be
an


electrician
,
one
of
the
electrician
introduce
accord
to
Gerald
’s


new
scheme
.
he
be
an
earnest
,
clever
man
,
a
scientist
with
a
passion


for
sociology
.
he
live
alone
in
a
cottage
,
in
lodging
,
in
Willey


Green
.
he
be
a
gentleman
,
and
sufficiently
well
-
to
-
do
.
his
landlady


spread
the
report
about
he
;
he
_
would
_
have
a
large
wooden
tub
in
his


bedroom
,
and
every
time
he
come
in
from
work
,
he
_
would
_
have
pail
and


pail
of
water
bring
up
,
to
bathe
in
,
then
he
put
on
clean
shirt
and


under
-
clothing
_
every
_
day
,
and
clean
silk
sock
;
fastidious
and


exact
he
be
in
these
respect
,
but
in
every
other
way
,
most


ordinary
and
unassuming
.




Gudrun
know
all
these
thing
.
the
Brangwen
’s
house
be
one
to
which
the


gossip
come
naturally
and
inevitably
.
Palmer
be
in
the
first
place
a


friend
of
Ursula
’s
.
but
in
his
pale
,
elegant
,
serious
face
there
show


the
same
nostalgia
that
Gudrun
feel
.
he
too
must
walk
up
and
down
the


street
on
Friday
evening
.
so
he
walk
with
Gudrun
,
and
a
friendship


be
strike
up
between
they
.
but
he
be
not
in
love
with
Gudrun
;
he


_
really
_
want
Ursula
,
but
for
some
strange
reason
,
nothing
could


happen
between
she
and
he
.
he
like
to
have
Gudrun
about
,
as
a


fellow
-
mind
—
but
that
be
all
.
and
she
have
no
real
feeling
for
he
.
he


be
a
scientist
,
he
have
to
have
a
woman
to
back
he
.
but
he
be
really


impersonal
,
he
have
the
fineness
of
an
elegant
piece
of
machinery
.
he


be
too
cold
,
too
destructive
to
care
really
for
woman
,
too
great
an


egoist
.
he
be
polarise
by
the
man
.
individually
he
detest
and


despise
they
.
in
the
mass
they
fascinate
he
,
as
machinery
fascinate


he
.
they
be
a
new
sort
of
machinery
to
he
—
but
incalculable
,


incalculable
.

luridly
with
an
effusion

imperceptibly

blue
and
the
rose

of
Ursula

softly

to
cheek
as
Birkin

and
iridescent
,
evanescent
gleam


chase
in
the
wake

aware
,

back
against
the
faint
crystal
of
the


lantern

she
could
see
his
face
,
although
it

pure
shadow

a
piece
of
twilight
.
and
her
breast
be
keen
with
passion


for
he
,
he
be
so
beautiful
in
his
male
stillness
and
mystery
.
it
be


a
certain
pure
effluence
of
maleness
,
like
an
aroma
from
his
softly
,


firmly
mould
contour
,
a
certain
rich
perfection
of
his
presence
,


that
touch

with
an
ecstasy
,
a
thrill
of
pure
intoxication

for
the

do
not

to


know
the
furth
,
satisfy
substance
of
his
living
body

he
be


purely
intangible
,
yet
so
near
.
her
hand
lie
on
the
paddle
like


slumber
,
she
only
want
to
see
he
,

a
crystal
shadow
,
to
feel
his


essential
presence

"

to
the
faint
near
sound
,
the
dropping
of
water
-
drop


from
the
oar
-
blade
,
the
slight
drumming
of
the
lantern
behind
he
,
as


they
rub
against
one
another
,
the
occasional
rustling
of
Gudrun
’s


full
skirt
,
an
alien
land
noise
.
his
mind
be
almost
submerge
,
he
be


almost
transfuse
,
lapse
out
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
,
into
the


thing
about
he
.
for
he
always
keep
such
a
keen
attentiveness
,


concentrated
and
unyielde
in
himself
.
now
he
have
let
go
,


imperceptibly
he
be
melt
into
oneness
with
the
whole
.
it
be
like


pure
,
perfect
sleep
,
his
first
great
sleep
of
life
.
he
have
be
so


insistent
,
so
guarded
,
all
his
life
.
but
here
be
sleep
,
and
peace
,
and


perfect
lapsing
out

"

that


very
quiet
,
toneless
voice
of
sheer
intimacy
.




"
the
light

he

.




so
they
drift
almost
motionless
,
in
silence
.
he
want
silence
,
pure


and
whole
.

for
some
word
,
for
some
assurance
.




"

his
manner
.

singing
.
then
as
if

suddenly
there

a
great


shout
,
a
confusion
of

horrid


noise
of

SUNDAY
evening

the
life

blood
seem
to
ebb
away
from
Ursula
,

within
the
emptiness
a
heavy
despair
gather
.
her
passion
seem
to


bleed
to
death
,
and
there
be
nothing
.
she
sat
suspend
in
a
state
of


complete
nullity
,
hard
to
bear
than
death
.




"
unless
something
happen
,
"
she
say
to
herself
,
in
the
perfect


lucidity
of
final
suffering
,
"
I
shall
die
.
I
be
at
the
end
of
my
line


of
life
.
"




she
sat
crush
and
obliterate
in
a
darkness
that
be
the
border
of


death
.
she
realise
how
all
her
life
she
have
be
draw
near
and


near
to
this
brink
,
where
there
be
no
beyond
,
from
which
one
have
to


leap
like
Sappho
into
the
unknown
.
the
knowledge
of
the
imminence
of


death
be
like
a
drug
.
darkly
,
without
think
at
all
,
she
know
that


she
be
near
to
death
.
she
have
travel
all
her
life
along
the
line
of


fulfilment
,
and
it
be
nearly
conclude
.
she
know
all
she
have
to
know
,


she
have
experience
all
she
have
to
experience
,
she
be
fulfil
in
a


kind
of
bitter
ripeness
,
there
remain
only
to
fall
from
the
tree
into


death
.
and
one
must
fulfil
one
’s
development
to
the
end
,
must
carry
the


adventure
to
its
conclusion
.
and
the
next
step
be
over
the
border
into


death
.
so
it
be
then
!
there
be
a
certain
peace
in
the
knowledge
.




after
all
,
when
one
be
fulfil
,
one
be
happy
in
fall
into


death
,
as
a
bitter
fruit
plunge
in
its
ripeness
downward
.
death
be
a


great
consummation
,
a
consummating
experience
.
it
be
a
development
from


life
.
that
we
know
,
while
we
be
yet
live
.
what
then
need
we
think


for
far
?
one
can
never
see
beyond
the
consummation
.
it
be
enough


that
death
be
a
great
and
conclusive
experience
.
why
should
we
ask
what


come
after
the
experience
,
when
the
experience
be
still
unknown
to
we
?


let
we
die
,
since
the
great
experience
be
the
one
that
follow
now
upon


all
the
rest
,
death
,
which
be
the
next
great
crisis
in
front
of
which


we
have
arrive
.
if
we
wait
,
if
we
baulk
the
issue
,
we
do
but
hang


about
the
gate
in
undignified
uneasiness
.
there
it
be
,
in
front
of
we
,


as
in
front
of
Sappho
,
the
illimitable
space
.
Thereinto
go
the


journey

have
we
not
the
courage
to
go
on
with
our
journey

must
we
cry


'
I
dare
n’t

on
ahead
we
will
go
,
into
death
,
and
whatever
death
may


mean
.
if
a
man
can
see
the
next
step
to
be
take
,
why
should
he
fear


the
next
but
one
?
why
ask
about
the
next
but
one
?
of
the
next
step
we


be
certain
.
it
be
the
step
into
death
.




"
I
shall
die
—
I
shall
quickly
die
,
"
say
Ursula
to
herself
,
clear
as
if


in
a
trance
,
clear
,
calm
,
and
certain
beyond
human
certainty
.
but


somewhere
behind
,
in
the
twilight
,
there
be
a
bitter
weeping
and
a


hopelessness
.
that
must
not
be
attend
to
.
one
must
go
where
the


unfaltere
spirit
go
,
there
must
be
no
baulk
the
issue
,
because


of
fear
.
no
baulk
the
issue
,
no
listening
to
the
less
voice
.
if


the
deep
desire
be
now
,
to
go
on
into
the
unknown
of
death
,
shall


one
forfeit
the
deep
truth
for
one
more
shallow
?




"
then
let
it
end
,
"
she
say
to
herself
.
it
be
a
decision
.
it
be
not
a


question
of
take
one
’s
life
—
she
would
_
never
_
kill
herself
,
that
be


repulsive
and
violent
.
it
be
a
question
of
_
know
_
the
nextcstep
.


and
the
next
step
lead
into
the
space
of
death
.
do
it?—or
be
there
—
?




her
thought
drift
into
unconsciousness
,
she
sit
as
if
asleep
beside


the
fire
.
and
then
the
thought
come
back
.
the
space
of
death
!
could
she


give
herself
to
it
?
ah
yes
—
it
be
a
sleep
.
she
have
have
enough
.
so
long


she
have
hold
out
;
and
resist
.
now
be
the
time
to
relinquish
,
not
to


resist
any
more
.




in
a
kind
of
spiritual
trance
,
she
yield
,
she
give
way
,
and
all
be


dark
.
she
could
feel
,
within
the
darkness
,
the
terrible
assertion
of


her
body
,
the
unutterable
anguish
of
dissolution
,
the
only
anguish
that


be
too
much
,
the
far
-
off
,
awful
nausea
of
dissolution
set
in
within
the


body
.




"
do
the
body
correspond
so
immediately
with
the
spirit
?
"
she
ask


herself
.
and
she
know
,
with
the
clarity
of
ultimate
knowledge
,
that
the


body
be
only
one
of
the
manifestation
of
the
spirit
,
the
transmutation


of
the
integral
spirit
be
the
transmutation
of
the
physical
body
as


well
.
unless
I
set
my
will
,
unless
I
absolve
myself
from
the
rhythm
of


life
,
fix
myself
and
remain
static
,
cut
off
from
live
,
absolve


within
my
own
will
.
but
well
die
than
live
mechanically
a
life
that


be
a
repetition
of
repetition
.
to
die
be
to
move
on
with
the


invisible
.
to
die
be
also
a
joy
,
a
joy
of
submit
to
that
which
be


great
than
the
know
,
namely
,
the
pure
unknown
.
that
be
a
joy
.
but
to


live
mechanised
and
cut
off
within
the
motion
of
the
will
,
to
live
as


an
entity
absolve
from
the
unknown
,
that
be
shameful
and
ignominious
.


there
be
no
ignominy
in
death
.
there
be
complete
ignominy
in
an


unreplenished
,
mechanised
life
.
life
indeed
may
be
ignominious
,


shameful
to
the
soul
.
but
death
be
never
a
shame
.
death
itself
,
like


the
illimitable
space
,
be
beyond
our
sullying
.




tomorrow
be
Monday
.
Monday
,
the
beginning
of
another
school
-
week
!


another
shameful
,
barren
school
-
week
,
mere
routine
and
mechanical


activity
.
be
not
the
adventure
of
death
infinitely
preferable
?
be
not


death
infinitely
more
lovely
and
noble
than
such
a
life
?
a
life
of


barren
routine
,
without
inner
meaning
,
without
any
real
significance
.


how
sordid
life
be
,
how
it
be
a
terrible
shame
to
the
soul
,
to
live


now
!
how
much
clean
and
more
dignified
to
be
dead
!
one
could
not
bear


any
more
of
this
shame
of
sordid
routine
and
mechanical
nullity
.
one


might
come
to
fruit
in
death
.
she
have
have
enough
.
for
where
be
life
to


be
find
?
no
flower
grow
upon
busy
machinery
,
there
be
no
sky
to
a


routine
,
there
be
no
space
to
a
rotary
motion
.
and
all
life
be
a


rotary
motion
,
mechanised
,
cut
off
from
reality
.
there
be
nothing
to


look
for
from
life
—
it
be
the
same
in
all
country
and
all
people
.


the
only
window
be
death
.
one
could
look
out
on
to
the
great
dark
sky


of
death
with
elation
,
as
one
have
look
out
of
the
classroom
window
as


a
child
,
and
see
perfect
freedom
in
the
outside
.
now
one
be
not
a


child
,
and
one
know
that
the
soul
be
a
prisoner
within
this
sordid


vast
edifice
of
life
,
and
there
be
no
escape
,
save
in
death
.




but
what
a
joy
!
what
a
gladness
to
think
that
whatever
humanity
do
,
it


could
not
seize
hold
of
the
kingdom
of
death
,
to
nullify
that
.
the
sea


they
turn
into
a
murderous
alley
and
a
soiled
road
of
commerce
,


dispute
like
the
dirty
land
of
a
city
every
inch
of
it
.
the
air
they


claim
too
,
share
it
up
,
parcel
it
out
to
certain
owner
,
they


trespass
in
the
air
to
fight
for
it
.
everything
be
go
,
wall
in
,


with
spike
on
top
of
the
wall
,
and
one
must
ignominiously
creep


between
the
spiky
wall
through
a
labyrinth
of
life
.




but
the
great
,
dark
,
illimitable
kingdom
of
death
,
there
humanity
be


put
to
scorn
.
so
much
they
could
do
upon
earth
,
the
multifarious
little


god
that
they
be
.
but
the
kingdom
of
death
put
they
all
to
scorn
,


they
dwindle
into
their
true
vulgar
silliness
in
face
of
it
.




how
beautiful
,
how
grand
and
perfect
death
be
,
how
good
to
look


forward
to
.
there
one
would
wash
off
all
the
lie
and
ignominy
and
dirt


that
have
be
put
upon
one
here
,
a
perfect
bath
of
cleanness
and
glad


refreshment
,
and
go
unknown
,
unquestioned
,
unabased
.
after
all
,
one
be


rich
,
if
only
in
the
promise
of
perfect
death
.
it
be
a
gladness
above


all
,
that
this
remain
to
look
forward
to
,
the
pure
inhuman
otherness


of
death
.




whatever
life
might
be
,
it
could
not
take
away
death
,
the
inhuman


transcendent
death
.
oh
,
let
we
ask
no
question
of
it
,
what
it
be
or
be


not
.
to
know
be
human
,
and
in
death
we
do
not
know
,
we
be
not
human
.


and
the
joy
of
this
compensate
for
all
the
bitterness
of
knowledge
and


the
sordidness
of
our
humanity
.
in
death
we
shall
not
be
human
,
and
we


shall
not
know
.
the
promise
of
this
be
our
heritage
,
we
look
forward


like
heir
to
their
majority
.

the
level

appetite

beyond
this

a
further


conjunction

man

being

two
pure
being
,


each
constitute
the
freedom

the

each
other

force

not
under
the
compulsion
of
any
need
for


unification
,
or
torture
by
unsatisfied
desire
.
desire
and
aspiration


should
find
their
object
without
all
this
torture
,
as
now
,
in
a
world


of
plenty
of
water
,
simple
thirst

inconsiderable
,
satisfied
almost


unconsciously

and
he
want
to
be
with
Ursula
as
free
as
with
himself
,


single
and
clear
and
cool
,

balanced
,
polarise
with
she

the


merge
,
the
clutching
,
the
mingling
of
love
be
become
madly
abhorrent


to
he
.




but
it
seem
to
he
,
woman
be
always
so
horrible
and
clutching
,
she


have
such
a
lust
for
possession
,
a
greed
of
self
-
importance
in
love
.
she


want
to
have
,
to
own
,
to
control
,
to
be
dominant
.
everything
must
be


refer
back
to
she
,
to
Woman
,
the
Great
Mother
of
everything
,
out
of


whom
proceed
everything
and
to
whom
everything
must
finally
be


render
up
.




it
fill
he
with
almost
insane
fury
,
this
calm
assumption
of
the


Magna
Mater
,
that
all
be
her
,
because
she
have
bear
it

again
,
soul
and
body
,

,

,
and
all
.


he
have
a
horror
of
the
Magna

detestable
.




she
be
on
a
very
high
horse
again
,

woman
,
the
Great
Mother
.
do
he


not
know
it
in
Hermione
.
Hermione
,
the
humble
,
the
subservient
,
what


be
she
all
the
while
but
the
Mater
Dolorosa
,
in
her
subservience
,


claim
with
horrible
,
insidious
arrogance
and
female
tyranny
,
her
own


again
,

back
the
man

have

by
she
very


suffering
and
humility
she
bind
her
son
with
chain
,
she
hold
he
she


everlasting
prisoner
.




and
Ursula
,
Ursula
be
the
same
—
or
the
inverse
.
she
too
be
the
awful
,


arrogant
queen
of
life
,
as
if
she
be
a
queen
bee
on
whom
all
the
rest


depend
.
he
see
the
yellow
flare
in
her
eye
,
he
know
the
unthinkable


overweene
assumption
of
primacy
in
she
.
she
be
unconscious
of
it


herself
.
she
be
only
too
ready
to
knock
her
head
on
the
ground
before


a
man
.
but
this
be
only
when
she
be
so
certain
of
her
man
,
that
she


could
worship
he
as
a
woman
worship
her
own
infant
,
with
a
worship
of


perfect
possession
.




it
be
intolerable
,
this
possession
at
the
hand
of
woman
.
always
a
man


must
be
consider
as
the
break
off
fragment
of
a
woman
,
and
the
sex


be
the
still
ache
scar
of
the
laceration
.
man
must
be
add
on
to
a


woman
,
before
he
have
any
real
place
or
wholeness
.




and
why
?
why
should
we
consider
ourselves
,
man
and
woman
,
as
break


fragment
of
one
whole
?
it
be
not
true
.
we
be
not
broken
fragment
of


one
whole
.
rather
we
be
the
single
away
into
purity
and
clear
being
,


of
thing
that
be
mixed
.
rather
the
sex
be
that
which
remain
in
we


of
the
mixed
,
the
unresolved
.
and
passion
be
the
further
separating
of


this
mixture
,
that
which
be
manly
be
take
into
the
being
of
the


man
,
that
which
be
womanly
pass
to
the
woman
,
till
the
two
be
clear


and
whole
as
angel
,
the
admixture
of
sex
in
the
high
sense


surpass
,
leave
two
single
being
constellate
together
like
two


star
.




in
the
old
age
,
before
sex
be
,
we
be
mixed
,
each
one
a
mixture
.
the


process
of
single
into
individuality
result
into
the
great


polarisation
of
sex
.
the
womanly
draw
to
one
side
,
the
manly
to
the


other
.
but
the
separation
be
imperfect
even
they
.
and
so
our


world
-
cycle
pass
.
there
be
now
to
come
the
new
day
,
when
we
be


being
each
of
we
,
fulfil
in
difference
.
the
man
be
pure
man
,
the


woman
pure
woman
,
they
be
perfectly
polarise
.
but
there
be
no
long


any
of
the
horrible
merging
,
mingle
self
-
abnegation
of
love
.
there
be


only
the
pure
duality
of
polarisation
,
each
one
free
from
any


contamination
of
the
other
.
in
each
,
the
individual
be
primal
,
sex
be


subordinate
,
but
perfectly
polarise
.
each
have
a
single
,
separate


be
,
with
its
own
law
.
the
man
have
his
pure
freedom
,
the
woman
hers
.


each
acknowledge
the
perfection
of
the
polarise
sex
-
circuit
.
each


admit
the
different
nature
in
the
other
.




so
Birkin
meditate
whilst
he
be
ill
.
he
like
sometimes
to
be
ill


enough
to
take
to
his
bed
.
for
then
he
get
well
very
quickly
,
and


thing
come
to
he
clear
and
sure
.




whilst
he
be
lay
up
,
Gerald
come
to
see
he
.
the
two
man
have
a
deep
,


uneasy
feeling
for
each
other
.
Gerald
’s
eye
be
quick
and
restless
,


his
whole
manner
tense
and
impatient
,
he
seem
string
up
to
some


activity
.
accord
to
conventionality
,
he
wear
black
clothe
,
he


look
formal
,
handsome
and
_
comme

.
his
hair
be
fair
almost


to
whiteness
,
sharp
like
splinter
of
light
,
his
face
be
keen
and


ruddy
,
his
body
seem
full
of
northern
energy
.
Gerald
really
love


Birkin
,
though
he
never
quite
believe
in
he
.
Birkin
be
too


unreal;—clever
,
whimsical
,
wonderful
,
but
not
practical
enough
.
Gerald


feel
that
his
own
understanding
be
much
sounder
and
safe
.
Birkin
be


delightful
,
a
wonderful
spirit
,
but
after
all
,
not

be
take


seriously
,
not

"

he
ask
kindly

physical
strength

"

never

all
his

it
even
stimulate

it
gradually
absorb
his

gradually
it
draw

potentiality

it
bleed

into
the
dark
,
it

draw


he
away

the
darkness

in
this
twilight
of
his

little


remain
visible

the
business
,
his
work

that
be
go


entirely
.
his
public
interest
have
disappear
as
if
they

never

even
his
family

become
extraneous

only


remember

some
slight
non

essential
part
of
himself
,
that
such
and


such
be
his
child
.
but
it
be
historical
fact
,
not
vital
to
he

have
to
make
an

indeed

like
the
darkness

like
the
pain
within


he

by
some
strange
association
,
the
darkness
that
contain
the
pain


and
the
darkness
that
contain
his
wife
be
identical
.
all
his


thought
and
understanding
become
blur
and
fuse
,
and
now
his
wife


and
the
consume
pain
be
the
same
dark
secret
power
against
he
,


that
he
never
face
.
he
never
drive
the
dread
out
of
its
lair
within


he

only
know
that
there

dark
place

something
inhabit


this
darkness
which

from
time
to
time

rent
he

he
dare


not
penetrate
and
drive
the
beast
into
the
open
.
he
have
rather
ignore


its
existence
.
only
,
in
his
vague
way
,
the
dread
be
his
wife
,
the


destroyer
,

it
be
the
pain
,
the
destruction
,
a
darkness
which
be


one
and
both

he
very
rarely
see
his
wife

she
keep
her
room
.
only
occasionally
she


come
forth
,
with
her
head
stretch
forward
,
and
in
her
low
,
possess


voice
,
she
ask
he
how
he
be

he
answer
she
,
in
the
habit
of


more
than
thirty
year

this
safeguard

without


know
what

such
a
strong
temper
.
"
with
unbroken
will
,
he


have
stand
by
this
position
with
regard
to
she
,
he
have
substitute
pity


for
all
his
hostility
,
pity
have
be
his
shield

his
safeguard

infallible
weapon

still
,

his
consciousness
,

be
sorry


for
she
,
her
nature

so
violent

so
impatient

now
his
pity
,
with
his

thin
,

the
dread
almost


amount
to
horror

but
before
the
armour
of


his

really
break
,
he
would
die
,
as
an
insect
when
its
shell

his
final
resource
.
other

live
on
,

know


the
live
death
,
the
ensue
process
of
hopeless
chaos
.
he
would
not
.


he
deny
death
its
victory
.




he
have
be
so
constant
to
his
light
,
so
constant
to
charity
,

to


his
love
for
his

perhaps
he
have
love
his

towards
theirs

force

she
.
she
have
lose
all
that
,


she
be
quite
by
herself
.
only
Gerald
,
the
gleaming
,
have
some
existence


for
she
.
but
of
late
year
,
since
he
have
become
head
of
the
business
,


he
too
be
forget
.
whereas
the
father
,
now
he
be
die
,
turn
for


compassion
to
Gerald
.
there
have
always
be
opposition
between
the
two


of
they
.
Gerald
have
fear
and
despise
his
father
,
and
to
a
great


extent
have
avoid
he
all
through
boyhood
and
young
manhood
.
and
the


father
have
feel
very
often
a
real
dislike
of
his
eld
son
,
which
,


never
want
to
give
way
to
,
he
have
refuse
to
acknowledge
.
he
have


ignore
Gerald
as
much
as
possible
,
leave
he
alone
.




since
,
however
,
Gerald
have
come
home
and
assume
responsibility
in
the


firm
,
and
have
prove
such
a
wonderful
director
,
the
father
,
tired
and


weary
of
all
outside
concern
,
have
put
all
his
trust
of
these
thing
in


his
son
,
implicitly
,
leave
everything
to
he
,
and
assume
a
rather


touching
dependence
on
the
young
enemy
.
this
immediately
rouse
a


poignant
pity
and
allegiance
in
Gerald
’s
heart
,
always
shadow
by


contempt
and
by
unadmitted
enmity
.
for
Gerald
be
in
reaction
against


charity
;
and
yet
he
be
dominate
by
it
,
it
assume
supremacy
in
the


inner
life
,
and
he
could
not
confute
it
.
so
he
be
partly
subject
to


that
which
his
father
stand
for
,
but
he
be
in
reaction
against
it
.
now


he
could
not
save
himself
.
a
certain
pity
and
grief
and
tenderness
for


his
father
overcome
he
,
in
spite
of
the
deep
,
more
sullen
hostility
.




the
father
win
shelter
from
Gerald
through
compassion
.
but
for
love
he


have
winifre
.
she
be
his
young
child
,
she
be
the
only
one
of
his


child
whom
he
have
ever
closely
love
.
and
she
he
love
with
all
the


great
,
overweene
,
shelter
love
of
a
die
man
.
he
want
to


shelter
she
infinitely
,
infinitely
,
to
wrap
she
in
warmth
and
love
and


shelter
,
perfectly
.
if
he
could
save
she
she
should
never
know
one


pain
,
one
grief
,
one
hurt
.
he
have
be
so
right
all
his
life
,
so


constant
in
his
kindness
and
his
goodness
.
and
this
be
his
last


passionate
righteousness
,
his
love
for
the
child
Winifred
.
some
thing


trouble
he
yet
.
the
world
have
pass
away
from
he
,
as
his
strength


ebb
.
there
be
no
more
poor
and
injure
and
humble
to
protect
and


succour
.
these
be
all
lose
to
he
.
there
be
no
more
son
and


daughter
to
trouble
he
,
and
to
weigh
on
he
as
an
unnatural


responsibility
.
these
too
have
fade
out
of
reality
.
all
these
thing


have
fall
out
of
his
hand
,
and
leave
he
free
.




there
remain
the
covert
fear
and
horror
of
his
wife
,
as
she
sit


mindless
and
strange
in
her
room
,
or
as
she
come
forth
with
slow
,


prowl
step
,
her
head
bend
forward
.
but
this
he
put
away
.
even
his


life
-
long
righteousness
,
however
,
would
not
quite
deliver
he
from
the


inner
horror
.
still
,
he
could
keep
it
sufficiently
at
bay
.
it
would


never
break
forth
openly
.
death
would
come
first
.




then
there
be
winifred
!
if
only
he
could
be
sure
about
she
,
if
only
he


could
be
sure
.
since
the
death
of
Diana
,
and
the
development
of
his


illness
,
his
craving
for
surety
with
regard
to
Winifred
amount
almost


to
obsession
.
it
be
as
if
,
even
die
,
he
must
have
some
anxiety
,
some


responsibility
of
love
,
of
Charity
,
upon
his
heart
.




she
be
an
odd
,
sensitive
,
inflammable
child
,
have
her
father
’s
dark


hair
and
quiet
bearing
,
but
be
quite
detached
,
momentaneous
.
she
be


like
a
changeling
indeed
,
as
if
her
feeling
do
not
matter
to
she
,


really
.
she
often
seem
to
be
talk
and
play
like
the
gay
and


most
childish
of
child
,
she
be
full
of
the
warm
,
most
delightful


affection
for
a
few
thing
—
for
her
father
,
and
for
her
animal
in


particular
.
but
if
she
hear
that
her
beloved
kitten
Leo
have
be
run


over
by
the
motor
-
car
she
put
her
head
on
one
side
,
and
reply
,
with
a


faint
contraction
like
resentment
on
her
face
:
"
have
he
?
"
then
she
take


no
more
notice
.
she
only
dislike
the
servant
who
would
force
bad
news


on
she
,
and
want
she
to
be
sorry
.
she
wish
not
to
know
,
and
that


seem
her
chief
motive
.
she
avoid
her
mother
,
and
most
of
the


member
of
her
family
.
she
_
love
_
her
daddy
,
because
he
want
she


always
to
be
happy
,
and
because
he
seem
to
become
young
again
,
and


irresponsible
in
her
presence
.
she
like
Gerald
,
because
he
be
so


self
-
contain
.
she
love
people
who
would
make
life
a
game
for
she
.


she
have
an
amazing
instinctive
critical
faculty
,
and
be
a
pure


anarchist
,
a
pure
aristocrat
at
once
.
for
she
accept
her
equal


wherever
she
find
they
,
and
she
ignore
with
blithe
indifference
she


inferior
,
whether
they
be
her
brother
and
sister
,
or
whether
they


be
wealthy
guest
of
the
house
,
or
whether
they
be
the
common


people
or
the
servant
.
she
be
quite
single
and
by
herself
,
derive


from
nobody
.
it
be
as
if
she
be
cut
off
from
all
purpose
or


continuity
,
and
exist
simply
moment
by
moment
.




the
father
,
as
by
some
strange
final
illusion
,
feel
as
if
all
his
fate


depend
on
his
ensuring
to
winifred
her
happiness
.
she
who
could
never


suffer
,
because
she
never
form
vital
connection
,
she
who
could
lose


the
dear
thing
of
her
life
and
be
just
the
same
the
next
day
,
the


whole
memory
drop
out
,
as
if
deliberately
,
she
whose
will
be
so


strangely
and
easily
free
,
anarchistic
,
almost
nihilistic
,
who
like
a


soulless
bird
flit
on
its
own
will
,
without
attachment
or


responsibility
beyond
the
moment
,
who
in
she
every
motion
snap
the


thread
of
serious
relationship
with
blithe
,
free
hand
,
really


nihilistic
,
because
never
trouble
,
she
must
be
the
object
of
she


father
’s
final
passionate
solicitude
.




when
Mr
Crich
hear
that
Gudrun
Brangwen
might
come
to
help
Winifred


with
her
drawing
and
modelling
he
see
a
road
to
salvation
for
his


child
.
he
believe
that
Winifred
have
talent
,
he
have
see
Gudrun
,
he


know
that
she
be
an
exceptional
person
.
he
could
give
Winifred
into


her
hand
as
into
the
hand
of
a
right
being
.
here
be
a
direction
and


a
positive
force
to
be
lend
to
his
child
,
he
need
not
leave
she


directionless
and
defenceless
.
if
he
could
but
graft
the
girl
on
to


some
tree
of
utterance
before
he
die
,
he
would
have
fulfil
his


responsibility
.
and
here
it
could
be
do
.
he
do
not
hesitate
to


appeal
to
Gudrun
.




meanwhile
,
as
the
father
drift
more
and
more
out
of
life
,
Gerald


experience
more
and
more
a
sense
of
exposure
.
his
father
after
all
have


stand
for
the
live
world
to
he
.
whilst
his
father
live
Gerald
be


not
responsible
for
the
world
.
but
now
his
father
be
pass
away
,


Gerald
find
himself
leave
expose
and
unready
before
the
storm
of


live
,
like
the
mutinous
first
mate
of
a
ship
that
have
lose
his


captain
,
and
who
see
only
a
terrible
chaos
in
front
of
he
.
he
do
not


inherit
an
establish
order
and
a
live
idea
.
the
whole
unifying
idea


of
mankind
seem
to
be
die
with
his
father
,
the
centralise
force


that
have
hold
the
whole
together
seem
to
collapse
with
his
father
,


the
part
be
ready
to
go
asunder
in
terrible
disintegration
.
Gerald


be
as
if
leave
on
board
of
a
ship
that
be
go
asunder
beneath
his


foot
,
he
be
in
charge
of
a
vessel
whose
timber
be
all
come
apart
.




he
know
that
all
his
life
he
have
be
wrench
at
the
frame
of
life
to


break
it
apart
.
and
now
,
with
something
of
the
terror
of
a
destructive


child
,
he
see
himself
on
the
point
of
inherit
his
own
destruction
.


and
during
the
last
month
,
under
the
influence
of
death
,
and
of


Birkin
’s
talk
,
and
of
Gudrun
’s
penetrate
being
,
he
have
lose
entirely


that
mechanical
certainty
that
have
be
his
triumph
.
sometimes
spasm


of
hatred
come
over
he
,
against
Birkin
and
Gudrun
and
that
whole
set
.


he
want
to
go
back
to
the
dull
conservatism
,
to
the
most
stupid
of


conventional
people
.
he
want
to
revert
to
the
strict
Toryism
.
but


the
desire
do
not
last
long
enough
to
carry
he
into
action
.




during
his
childhood
and
his
boyhood
he
have
want
a
sort
of
savagedom
.


the
day
of
Homer
be
his
ideal
,
when
a
man
be
chief
of
an
army
of


hero
,
or
spend
his
year
in
wonderful
odyssey
.
he
hate
remorselessly


the
circumstance
of
his
own
life
,
so
much
that
he
never
really
see


Beldover
and
the
colliery
valley
.
he
turn
his
face
entirely
away
from


the
blacken
mining
region
that
stretch
away
on
the
right
hand
of


Shortlands
,
he
turn
entirely
to
the
country
and
the
wood
beyond


Willey
Water
.
it
be
true
that
the
panting
and
rattling
of
the
coal


mine
could
always
be
hear
at
Shortlands
.
but
from
his
early


childhood
,
Gerald
have
pay
no
heed
to
this
.
he
have
ignore
the
whole
of


the
industrial
sea
which
surge
in
coal
-
blacken
tide
against
the


ground
of
the
house
.
the
world
be
really
a
wilderness
where
one


hunt
and
swam
and
ride
.
he
rebel
against
all
authority
.
life
be
a


condition
of
savage
freedom
.




then
he
have
be
send
away
to
school
,
which
be
so
much
death
to
he
.


he
refuse
to
go
to
Oxford
,
choose
a
german
university
.
he
have
spend


a
certain
time
at
Bonn
,
at
Berlin
,
and
at
Frankfurt
.
there
,
a
curiosity


have
be
arouse
in
his
mind
.
he
want
to
see
and
to
know
,
in
a


curious
objective
fashion
,
as
if
it
be
an
amusement
to
he
.
then
he


must
try
war
.
then
he
must
travel
into
the
savage
region
that
have
so


attract
he
.




the
result
be
,
he
find
humanity
very
much
alike
everywhere
,
and
to
a


mind
like
his
,
curious
and
cold
,
the
savage
be
dull
,
less
exciting


than
the
European
.
so
he
take
hold
of
all
kind
of
sociological
idea
,


and
idea
of
reform
.
but
they
never
go
more
than
skin
-
deep
,
they
be


never
more
than
a
mental
amusement
.
their
interest
lie
chiefly
in
the


reaction
against
the
positive
order
,
the
destructive
reaction
.




he
discover
at
last
a
real
adventure
in
the
coal
-
mine
.
his
father


ask
he
to
help
in
the
firm
.
Gerald
have
be
educate
in
the
science


of
mining
,
and
it
have
never
interest
he
.
now
,
suddenly
,
with
a
sort


of
exultation
,
he
lay
hold
of
the
world
.




there
be
impressed
photographically
on
his
consciousness
the
great


industry
.
suddenly
,
it
be
real
,
he
be
part
of
it
.
down
the
valley
run


the
colliery
railway
,
link
mine
with
mine
.
down
the
railway
run
the


train
,
short
train
of
heavily
laden
truck
,
long
train
of
empty


wagon
,
each
one
bearing
in
big
white
letter
the
initial
:




"
C.
B.
&
Co.
"




these
white
letter
on
all
the
wagon
he
have
see
since
his
first


childhood
,
and
it
be
as
if
he
have
never
see
they
,
they
be
so


familiar
,
and
so
ignore
.
now
at
last
he
see
his
own
name
write
on


the
wall
.
now
he
have
a
vision
of
power
.




so
many
wagon
,
bear
his
initial
,
run
all
over
the
country
.
he


see
they
as
he
enter
London
in
the
train
,
he
see
they
at
Dover
.
so


far
his
power
ramify
.
he
look
at
Beldover
,
at
Selby
,
at
Whatmore
,


at
Lethley
Bank
,
the
great
colliery
village
which
depend
entirely
on


his
mine
.
they
be
hideous
and
sordid
,
during
his
childhood
they
have


be
sore
in
his
consciousness
.
and
now
he
see
they
with
pride
.
four


raw
new
town
,
and
many
ugly
industrial
hamlet
be
crowd
under
his


dependence
.
he
see
the
stream
of
miner
flow
along
the
causeway


from
the
mine
at
the
end
of
the
afternoon
,
thousand
of
blacken
,


slightly
distort
human
being
with
red
mouth
,
all
move
subjugate


to
his
will
.
he
push
slowly
in
his
motor
-
car
through
the
little


market
-
top
on
Friday
night
in
Beldover
,
through
a
solid
mass
of
human


being
that
be
make
their
purchase
and
do
their
weekly


spending
.
they
be
all
subordinate
to
he
.
they
be
ugly
and
uncouth
,


but
they
be
his
instrument
.
he
be
the
God
of
the
machine
.
they
make


way
for
his
motor
-
car
automatically
,
slowly
.




he
do
not
care
whether
they
make
way
with
alacrity
,
or
grudgingly
.
he


do
not
care
what
they
think
of
he
.
his
vision
have
suddenly


crystallise
.
suddenly
he
have
conceive
the
pure
instrumentality
of


mankind
.
there
have
be
so
much
humanitarianism
,
so
much
talk
of


suffering
and
feeling
.
it
be
ridiculous
.
the
suffering
and
feeling


of
individual
do
not
matter
in
the
least
.
they
be
mere
condition
,


like
the
weather
.
what
matter
be
the
pure
instrumentality
of
the


individual
.
as
a
man
as
of
a
knife
:
do
it
cut
well
?
nothing
else


matter
.




everything
in
the
world
have
its
function
,
and
be
good
or
not
good
in
so


far
as
it
fulfil
this
function
more
or
less
perfectly
.
be
a
miner
a


good
miner
?
then
he
be
complete
.
be
a
manager
a
good
manager
?
that


be
enough
.
Gerald
himself
,
who
be
responsible
for
all
this
industry
,


be
he
a
good
director
?
if
he
be
,
he
have
fulfil
his
life
.
the
rest


be
by
-
play
.




the
mine
be
there
,
they
be
old
.
they
be
give
out
,
it
do
not


pay
to
work
the
seam
.
there
be
talk
of
close
down
two
of
they
.
it


be
at
this
point
that
Gerald
arrive
on
the
scene
.




he
look
around
.
there
lie
the
mine
.
they
be
old
,
obsolete
.
they


be
like
old
lion
,
no
more
good
.
he
look
again
.
Pah
!
the
mine
be


nothing
but
the
clumsy
effort
of
impure
mind
.
there
they
lie
,


abortion
of
a
half
-
train
mind
.
let
the
idea
of
they
be
sweep
away
.


he
clear
his
brain
of
they
,
and
think
only
of
the
coal
in
the
under


earth
.
how
much
be
there
?




there
be
plenty
of
coal
.
the
old
working
could
not
get
at
it
,
that


be
all
.
then
break
the
neck
of
the
old
working
.
the
coal
lie
there
in


its
seam
,
even
though
the
seam
be
thin
.
there
it
lie
,
inert
matter
,


as
it
have
always
lain
,
since
the
beginning
of
time
,
subject
to
the
will


of
man
.
the
will
of
man
be
the
determine
factor
.
Man
be
the
archgod


of
earth
.
his
mind
be
obedient
to
serve
his
will
.
Man
’s
will
be
the


absolute
,
the
only
absolute
.




and
it
be
his
will
to
subjugate
matter
to
his
own
end
.
the


subjugation
itself
be
the
point
,
the
fight
be
the
be
-
all
,
the
fruit


of
victory
be
mere
result
.
it
be
not
for
the
sake
of
money
that


Gerald
take
over
the
mine
.
he
do
not
care
about
money
,
fundamentally
.


he
be
neither
ostentatious
nor
luxurious
,
neither
do
he
care
about


social
position
,
not
finally
.
what
he
want
be
the
pure
fulfilment
of


his
own
will
in
the
struggle
with
the
natural
condition
.
his
will
be


now
,
to
take
the
coal
out
of
the
earth
,
profitably
.
the
profit
be


merely
the
condition
of
victory
,
but
the
victory
itself
lie
in
the
feat


achieve
.
he
vibrate
with
z
before
the
challenge
.
every
day
he
be


in
the
mine
,
examine
,
testing
,
he
consult
expert
,
he
gradually


gather
the
whole
situation
into
his
mind
,
as
a
general
grasp
the


plan
of
his
campaign
.




then
there
be
need
for
a
complete
break
.
the
mine
be
run
on
an
old


system
,
an
obsolete
idea
.
the
initial
idea
have
be
,
to
obtain
as
much


money
from
the
earth
as
would
make
the
owner
comfortably
rich
,
would


allow
the
workman
sufficient
wage
and
good
condition
,
and
would


increase
the
wealth
of
the
country
altogether
.
Gerald
’s
father
,


follow
in
the
second
generation
,
have
a
sufficient
fortune
,
have


think
only
of
the
man
.
the
mine
,
for
he
,
be
primarily
great


field
to
produce
bread
and
plenty
for
all
the
hundred
of
human
being


gather
about
they
.
he
have
live
and
strive
with
his
fellow
owner
to


benefit
the
man
every
time
.
and
the
man
have
be
benefit
in
their


fashion
.
there
be
few
poor
,
and
few
needy
.
all
be
plenty
,
because


the
mine
be
good
and
easy
to
work
.
and
the
miner
,
in
those
day
,


find
themselves
rich
than
they
might
have
expect
,
feel
glad
and


triumphant
.
they
think
themselves
well
-
off
,
they
congratulate


themselves
on
their
good
-
fortune
,
they
remember
how
their
father
have


starve
and
suffer
,
and
they
feel
that
well
time
have
come
.
they


be
grateful
to
those
other
,
the
pioneer
,
the
new
owner
,
who
have


open
out
the
pit
,
and
let
forth
this
stream
of
plenty
.




but
man
be
never
satisfied
,
and
so
the
miner
,
from
gratitude
to
their


owner
,
pass
on
to
murmur
.
their
sufficiency
decrease
with


knowledge
,
they
want
more
.
why
should
the
master
be
so


out
-
of
-
all
-
proportion
rich
?




there
be
a
crisis
when
Gerald
be
a
boy
,
when
the
Masters
’
Federation


close
down
the
mine
because
the
man
would
not
accept
a
reduction
.


this
lock
-
out
have
force
home
the
new
condition
to
Thomas
Crich
.


belong
to
the
Federation
,
he
have
be
compel
by
his
honour
to


close
the
pit
against
his
man
.
he
,
the
father
,
the
Patriarch
,
be


force
to
deny
the
mean
of
life
to
his
son
,
his
people
.
he
,
the
rich


man
who
would
hardly
enter
heaven
because
of
his
possession
,
must
now


turn
upon
the
poor
,
upon
those
who
be
near
Christ
than
himself
,


those
who
be
humble
and
despise
and
close
to
perfection
,
those
who


be
manly
and
noble
in
their
labour
,
and
must
say
to
they
:
"
ye
shall


neither
labour
nor
eat
bread
.
"




it
be
this
recognition
of
the
state
of
war
which
really
break
his


heart
.
he
want
his
industry
to
be
run
on
love
.
oh
,
he
want
love
to


be
the
direct
power
even
of
the
mine
.
and
now
,
from
under
the
cloak


of
love
,
the
sword
be
cynically
draw
,
the
sword
of
mechanical


necessity
.




this
really
break
his
heart
.
he
must
have
the
illusion
and
now
the


illusion
be
destroy
.
the
man
be
not
against
_
he
_
,
but
they
be


against
the
master
.
it
be
war
,
and
willy
nilly
he
find
himself
on


the
wrong
side
,
in
his
own
conscience
.
seethe
masse
of
miner
meet


daily
,
carry
away
by
a
new
religious
impulse
.
the
idea
fly
through


they
:
"
all
man
be
equal
on
earth
,
"
and
they
would
carry
the
idea
to


its
material
fulfilment
.
after
all
,
be
it
not
the
teaching
of
Christ
?


and
what
be
an
idea
,
if
not
the
germ
of
action
in
the
material
world
.


"
all
man
be
equal
in
spirit
,
they
be
all
son
of
God
.
whence
then


this
obvious
_
disquality
_
?
"
it
be
a
religious
creed
push
to
its


material
conclusion
.
Thomas
Crich
at
least
have
no
answer
.
he
could
but


admit
,
accord
to
his
sincere
tenet
,
that
the
disquality
be
wrong
.


but
he
could
not
give
up
his
good
,
which
be
the
stuff
of
disquality
.


so
the
man
would
fight
for
their
right
.
the
last
impulse
of
the
last


religious
passion
leave
on
earth
,
the
passion
for
equality
,
inspire


they
.




seethe
mob
of
man
march
about
,
their
face
light
up
as
for
holy


war
,
with
a
smoke
of
cupidity
.
how
disentangle
the
passion
for
equality


from
the
passion
of
cupidity
,
when
begin
the
fight
for
equality
of


possession
?
but
the
God
be
the
machine
.
each
man
claim
equality
in


the
Godhead
of
the
great
productive
machine
.
every
man
equally
be
part


of
this
Godhead
.
but
somehow
,
somewhere
,
Thomas
Crich
know
this
be


false
.
when
the
machine
be
the
Godhead
,
and
production
or
work
be


worship
,
then
the
most
mechanical
mind
be
pure
and
high
,
the


representative
of
God
on
earth
.
and
the
rest
be
subordinate
,
each


accord
to
his
degree
.




riot
break
out
,
Whatmore
pit
-
head
be
in
flame
.
this
be
the
pit


furth
in
the
country
,
near
the
wood
.
soldier
come
.
from
the


window
of

on
that
fatal
day
,
could
be

the
flare
of


fire
in
the
sky
not

full
of

then
there
be

Gerald

who
be
a
boy
,
be
fill
with
the
wild
excitement
and


delight
.
he
long
to

but
he
be


not

out
of
the
lodge

.
at
the

Gerald
stand
near
they
in
delight
,
whilst
gang
of


derisive
miner
stroll
up
and
down
the
lane
,
call
and
jeer
:




"

and
all
this
while
Thomas
Crich
be
break
his
heart
,
and
give
away


hundred
of
pound
in
charity
.
everywhere
there
be
free
food
,
a


surfeit
of
free
food
.
anybody
could
have
bread
for
ask
,
and
a
loaf


cost
only
three
-
ha’pence
.
every
day
there
be
a
free
tea
somewhere
,
the


child
have
never
have
so
many
treat
in
their
life
.
on
Friday


afternoon
great
basketful
of
bun
and
cake
be
take
into
the


school
,
and
great
pitcher
of
milk
,
the
schoolchildren
have
what
they


want
.
they
be
sick
with
eat
too
much
cake
and
milk
.




and
then
it
come
to
an
end
,
and
the
man
go
back
to
work
.
but
it
be


never
the
same
as
before
.
there
be
a
new
situation
create
,
a
new
idea


reign
.
even
in
the
machine
,
there
should
be
equality
.
no
part
should


be
subordinate
to
any
other
part
:
all
should
be
equal
.
the
instinct
for


chaos
have
enter
.
mystic
equality
lie
in
abstraction
,
not
in
have


or
in
do
,
which
be
process
.
in
function
and
process
,
one
man
,
one


part
,
must
of
necessity
be
subordinate
to
another
.
it
be
a
condition
of


be
.
but
the
desire
for
chaos
have
rise
,
and
the
idea
of
mechanical


equality
be
the
weapon
of
disruption
which
should
execute
the
will
of


man
,
the
will
for
chaos
.




Gerald
be
a
boy
at
the
time
of
the
strike
,
but
he
long
to
be
a
man
,


to
fight
the
collier
.
the
father
however
be
trap
between
two


half
-
truth
,
and
break
.
he
want
to
be
a
pure
Christian
,
one
and


equal
with
all
man
.
he
even
want
to
give
away
all
he
have
,
to
the


poor
.
yet
he
be
a
great
promoter
of
industry
,
and
he
know
perfectly


that
he
must
keep
his
good
and
keep
his
authority
.
this
be
as
divine


a
necessity
in
he
,
as
the
need
to
give
away
all
he
possess
—
more


divine
,
even
,
since
this
be
the
necessity
he
act
upon
.
yet
because


he
do
_
not
_
act
on
the
other
ideal
,
it
dominate
he
,
he
be
die
of


chagrin
because
he
must
forfeit
it
.
he
want
to
be
a
father
of
love


kindness
and
sacrificial
benevolence
.
the
collier
shout
to
he
about


his
thousand
a
year
.
they
would
not
be
deceive
.




when
Gerald
grow
up
in
the
way
of
the
world
,
he
shift
the
position
.


he
do
not
care
about
the
equality
.
the
whole
christian
attitude
of


love
and
self
-
sacrifice
be
old
hat
.
he
know
that
position
and


authority
be
the
right
thing
in
the
world
,
and
it
be
useless
to
ca
nt


about
it
.
they
be
the
right
thing
,
for
the
simple
reason
that
they


be
functionally
necessary
.
they
be
not
the
be
-
all
and
the
end
-
all
.


it
be
like
be
part
of
a
machine
.
he
himself
happen
to
be
a


control
,
central
part
,
the
masse
of
man
be
the
part
variously


control
.
this
be
merely
as
it
happen
.
as
well
get
excited
because


a
central
hub
drive
a
hundred
outer
wheel
or
because
the
whole


universe
wheel
round
the
sun
.
after
all
,
it
would
be
mere
silliness
to


say
that
the
moon
and
the
earth
and
Saturn
and
Jupiter
and
Venus
have


just
as
much
right
to
be
the
centre
of
the
universe
,
each
of
they


separately
,
as
the
sun
.
such
an
assertion
be
make
merely
in
the
desire


of
chaos
.




without
bother
to
_
think
_
to
a
conclusion
,
Gerald
jump
to
a


conclusion
.
he
abandon
the
whole
democratic
-
equality
problem
as
a


problem
of
silliness
.
what
matter
be
the
great
social
productive


machine
.
let
that
work
perfectly
,
let
it
produce
a
sufficiency
of


everything
,
let
every
man
be
give
a
rational
portion
,
great
or
less


accord
to
his
functional
degree
or
magnitude
,
and
then
,
provision


make
,
let
the
devil
supervene
,
let
every
man
look
after
his
own


amusement
and
appetite
,
so
long
as
he
interfere
with
nobody
.




so
Gerald
set
himself
to
work
,
to
put
the
great
industry
in
order
.
in


his
travel
,
and
in
his
accompany
reading
,
he
have
come
to
the


conclusion
that
the
essential
secret
of
life
be
harmony
.
he
do
not


define
to
himself
at
all
clearly
what
harmony
be
.
the
word
please


he
,
he
feel
he
have
come
to
his
own
conclusion
.
and
he
proceed
to


put
his
philosophy
into
practice
by
force
order
into
the
establish


world
,
translate
the
mystic
word
harmony
into
the
practical
word


organisation
.




immediately
he
_
see
_
the
firm
,
he
realise
what
he
could
do
.
he
have
a


fight
to
fight
with
Matter
,
with
the
earth
and
the
coal
it
enclose
.


this
be
the
sole
idea
,
to
turn
upon
the
inanimate
matter
of
the


underground
,
and
reduce
it
to
his
will
.
and
for
this
fight
with
matter
,


one
must
have
perfect
instrument
in
perfect
organisation
,
a
mechanism


so
subtle
and
harmonious
in
its
working
that
it
represent
the
single


mind
of
man
,
and
by
its
relentless
repetition
of
give
movement
,
will


accomplish
a
purpose
irresistibly
,
inhumanly
.
it
be
this
inhuman


principle
in
the
mechanism
he
want
to
construct
that
inspire
Gerald


with
an
almost
religious
exaltation
.
he
,
the
man
,
could
interpose
a


perfect
,
changeless
,
godlike
medium
between
himself
and
the
matter
he


have
to
subjugate
.
there
be
two
opposite
,
his
will
and
the
resistant


matter
of
the
earth
.
and
between
these
he
could
establish
the
very


expression
of
his
will
,
the
incarnation
of
his
power
,
a
great
and


perfect
machine
,
a
system
,
an
activity
of
pure
order
,
pure
mechanical


repetition
,
repetition
_
ad
infinitum
_
,
hence
eternal
and
infinite
.
he


find
his
eternal
and
his
infinite
in
the
pure
machine
-
principle
of


perfect
co
-
ordination
into
one
pure
,
complex
,
infinitely
repeat


motion
,
like
the
spinning
of
a
wheel
;
but
a
productive
spinning
,
as
the


revolve
of
the
universe
may
be
call
a
productive
spinning
,
a


productive
repetition
through
eternity
,
to
infinity
.
and
this
be
the


God
-
motion
,
this
productive
repetition
_
ad
infinitum
_
.
and
Gerald
be


the
God
of
the
machine
,
_
Deus
ex
Machina
_
.
and
the
whole
productive


will
of
man
be
the
Godhead
.




he
have
his
life
-
work
now
,
to
extend
over
the
earth
a
great
and
perfect


system
in
which
the
will
of
man
run
smooth
and
unthwarted
,
timeless
,
a


godhead
in
process
.
he
have
to
begin
with
the
mine
.
the
term
be


give
:
first
the
resistant
matter
of
the
underground
;
then
the


instrument
of
its
subjugation
,
instrument
human
and
metallic
;
and


finally
his
own
pure
will
,
his
own
mind
.
it
would
need
a
marvellous


adjustment
of
myriad
instrument
,
human
,
animal
,
metallic
,
kinetic
,


dynamic
,
a
marvellous
casting
of
myriad
tiny
whole
into
one
great


perfect
entirety
.
and
then
,
in
this
case
there
be
perfection
attain
,


the
will
of
the
high
be
perfectly
fulfil
,
the
will
of
mankind


be
perfectly
enact
;
for
be
not
mankind
mystically


contra
-
distinguished
against
inanimate
Matter
,
be
not
the
history
of


mankind
just
the
history
of
the
conquest
of
the
one
by
the
other
?




the
miner
be
overreach
.
while
they
be
still
in
the
toil
of


divine
equality
of
man
,
Gerald
have
pass
on
,
grant
essentially
their


case
,
and
proceed
in
his
quality
of
human
being
to
fulfil
the
will
of


mankind
as
a
whole
.
he
merely
represent
the
miner
in
a
high
sense


when
he
perceive
that
the
only
way
to
fulfil
perfectly
the
will
of
man


be
to
establish
the
perfect
,
inhuman
machine
.
but
he
represent
they


very
essentially
,
they
be
far
behind
,
out
of
date
,
squabble
for


their
material
equality
.
the
desire
have
already
transmute
into
this


new
and
great
desire
,
for
a
perfect
intervening
mechanism
between
man


and
Matter
,
the
desire
to
translate
the
Godhead
into
pure
mechanism
.




as
soon
as
Gerald
enter
the
firm
,
the
convulsion
of
death
run
through


the
old
system
.
he
have
all
his
life
be
torture
by
a
furious
and


destructive
demon
,
which
possess
he
sometimes
like
an
insanity
.
this


temper
now
enter
like
a
virus
into
the
firm
,
and
there
be
cruel


eruption
.
terrible
and
inhuman
be
his
examination
into
every


detail
;
there
be
no
privacy
he
would
spare
,
no
old
sentiment
but
he


would
turn
it
over
.
the
old
grey
manager
,
the
old
grey
clerk
,
the


doddering
old
pensioner
,
he
look
at
they
,
and
remove
they
as
so


much
lumber
.
the
whole
concern
seem
like
a
hospital
of
invalid


employee
.
he
have
no
emotional
qualm
.
he
arrange
what
pension
be


necessary
,
he
look
for
efficient
substitute
,
and
when
these
be


find
,
he
substitute
they
for
the
old
hand
.




"
I
’ve
a
pitiful
letter
here
from
Letherington
,
"
his
father
would
say
,


in
a
tone
of
deprecation
and
appeal
.
"
do
n’t
you
think
the
poor
fellow


might
keep
on
a
little
long
.
I
always
fancy
he
do
very
well
.
"




"
I
’ve
get
a
man
in
his
place
now
,
father
.
he
’ll
be
happy
out
of
it
,


believe
I
.
you
think
his
allowance
be
plenty
,
do
n’t
you
?
"




"
it
be
not
the
allowance
that
he
want
,
poor
man
.
he
feel
it
very


much
,
that
he
be
superannuated

twenty
more

.
"




"
not
of
this
kind
of
work
I
want
.
he
do
n’t
understand
.
"




the
father
sigh
.
he
want
not
to
know
any
more
.
he
believe
the
pit


would
have
to
be
overhaul
if
they
be
to
go
on
work
.
and
after


all
,
it
would
be
bad
in
the
long
run
for
everybody
,
if
they
must


close
down
.
so
he
could
make
no
answer
to
the
appeal
of
his
old
and


trusty
servant
,
he
could
only
repeat
"
Gerald
say
.
"




so
the
father
draw
more
and
more
out
of
the
light
.
the
whole
frame
of


the
real
life
be
break
for
he
.
he
have
be
right
accord
to
his


light
.
and
his
light
have
be
those
of
the
great
religion
.
yet
they


seem
to
have
become
obsolete
,
to
be
supersede
in
the
world
.
he
could


not
understand
.
he
only
withdraw
with
his
light
into
an
inner
room
,


into
the
silence
.
the
beautiful
candle
of
belief
,
that
would
not
do
to


light
the
world
any
more
,
they
would
still
burn
sweetly
and


sufficiently
in
the
inner
room
of
his
soul
,
and
in
the
silence
of
his


retirement
.




Gerald
rush
into
the
reform
of
the
firm
,
begin
with
the
office
.


it
be
needful
to
economise
severely
,
to
make
possible
the
great


alteration
he
must
introduce
.




"
what
be
these
widow
’
coal
?
"
he
ask
.




"
we
have
always
allow
all
widow
of
man
who
work
for
the
firm
a


load
of
coal
every
three
month
.
"




"
they
must
pay
cost
price
henceforward
.
the
firm
be
not
a
charity


institution
,
as
everybody
seem
to
think
.
"




widow
,
these
stock
figure
of
sentimental
humanitarianism
,
he
feel
a


dislike
at
the
thought
of
they
.
they
be
almost
repulsive
.
why
be


they
not
immolate
on
the
pyre
of
the
husband
,
like
the
sati
in
India
?


at
any
rate
,
let
they
pay
the
cost
of
their
coal
.




in
a
thousand
way
he
cut
down
the
expenditure
,
in
way
so
fine
as
to


be
hardly
noticeable
to
the
man
.
the
miner
must
pay
for
the
cartage
of


their
coal
,
heavy
cartage
too
;
they
must
pay
for
their
tool
,
for
the


sharpen
,
for
the
care
of
lamp
,
for
the
many
trifling
thing
that


make
the
bill
of
charge
against
every
man
mount
up
to
a
shilling
or
so


in
the
week
.
it
be
not
grasp
very
definitely
by
the
miner
,
though


they
be
sore
enough
.
but
it
save
hundred
of
pound
every
week
for


the
firm
.




gradually
Gerald
get
hold
of
everything
.
and
then
begin
the
great


reform
.
expert
engineer
be
introduce
in
every
department
.
an


enormous
electric
plant
be
instal
,
both
for
lighting
and
for


haulage
underground
,
and
for
power
.
the
electricity
be
carry
into


every
mine
.
new
machinery
be
bring
from
America
,
such
as
the
miner


have
never
see
before
,
great
iron
man
,
as
the
cutting
machine
be


call
,
and
unusual
appliance
.
the
working
of
the
pit
be
thoroughly


change
,
all
the
control
be
take
out
of
the
hand
of
the
miner
,
the


butty
system
be
abolish
.
everything
be
run
on
the
most
accurate
and


delicate
scientific
method
,
educate
and
expert
man
be
in
control


everywhere
,
the
miner
be
reduce
to
mere
mechanical
instrument
.


they
have
to
work
hard
,
much
hard
than
before
,
the
work
be
terrible


and
heart
-
breaking
in
its
mechanicalness
.




but
they
submit
to
it
all
.
the
joy
go
out
of
their
life
,
the
hope


seem
to
perish
as
they
become
more
and
more
mechanised
.
and
yet
they


accept
the
new
condition
.
they
even
get
a
further
satisfaction
out


of
they
.
at
first
they
hate
Gerald
Crich
,
they
swear
to
do
something


to
he
,
to
murder
he
.
but
as
time
go
on
,
they
accept
everything


with
some
fatal
satisfaction
.
Gerald
be
their
high
priest
,
he


represent
the
religion
they
really
feel
.
his
father
be
forget


already
.
there
be
a
new
world
,
a
new
order
,
strict
,
terrible
,
inhuman
,


but
satisfy
in
its
very
destructiveness
.
the
man
be
satisfied
to


belong
to
the
great
and
wonderful
machine
,
even
whilst
it
destroy


they
.
it
be
what
they
want
.
it
be
the
high
that
man
have


produce
,
the
most
wonderful
and
superhuman
.
they
be
exalt
by


belong
to
this
great
and
superhuman
system
which
be
beyond
feel


or
reason
,
something
really
godlike
.
their
heart
die
within
they
,
but


their
soul
be
satisfied
.
it
be
what
they
want
.
otherwise
Gerald


could
never
have
do
what
he
do
.
he
be
just
ahead
of
they
in
give


they
what
they
want
,
this
participation
in
a
great
and
perfect
system


that
subject
life
to
pure
mathematical
principle
.
this
be
a
sort
of


freedom
,
the
sort
they
really
want
.
it
be
the
first
great
step
in


undo
,
the
first
great
phase
of
chaos
,
the
substitution
of
the


mechanical
principle
for
the
organic
,
the
destruction
of
the
organic


purpose
,
the
organic
unity
,
and
the
subordination
of
every
organic
unit


to
the
great
mechanical
purpose
.
it
be
pure
organic
disintegration
and


pure
mechanical
organisation
.
this
be
the
first
and
fine
state
of


chaos
.




Gerald
be
satisfied
.
he
know
the
collier
say
they
hate
he
.
but
he


have
long
cease
to
hate
they
.
when
they
stream
past
he
at
evening
,


their
heavy
boot
slur
on
the
pavement
wearily
,
their
shoulder


slightly
distort
,
they
take
no
notice
of
he
,
they
give
he
no


greet
whatever
,
they
pass
in
a
grey
-
black
stream
of
unemotional


acceptance
.
they
be
not
important
to
he
,
save
as
instrument
,
nor
he


to
they
,
save
as
a
supreme
instrument
of
control
.
as
miner
they
have


their
being
,
he
have
his
being
as
director
.
he
admire
their
quality
.


but
as
man
,
personality
,
they
be
just
accident
,
sporadic
little


unimportant
phenomenon
.
and
tacitly
,
the
man
agree
to
this
.
for
Gerald


agree
to
it
in
himself
.




he
have
succeed
.
he
have
convert
the
industry
into
a
new
and
terrible


purity
.
there
be
a
great
output
of
coal
than
ever
,
the
wonderful
and


delicate
system
run
almost
perfectly
.
he
have
a
set
of
really
clever


engineer
,
both
mining
and
electrical
,
and
they
do
not
cost
much
.
a


highly
educate
man
cost
very
little
more
than
a
workman
.
his
manager
,


who
be
all
rare
man
,
be
no
more
expensive
than
the
old
bungling


fool
of
his
father
’s
day
,
who
be
merely
collier
promote
.
his


chief
manager
,
who
have
twelve
hundred
a
year
,
save
the
firm
at
least


five
thousand
.
the
whole
system
be
now
so
perfect
that
Gerald
be


hardly
necessary
any
more
.




it
be
so
perfect
that
sometimes
a
strange
fear
come
over
he
,
and
he


do
not
know
what
to
do
.
he
go
on
for
some
year
in
a
sort
of
trance


of
activity
.
what
he
be
do
seem
supreme
,
he
be
almost
like
a


divinity
.
he
be
a
pure
and
exalted
activity
.




but
now
he
have
succeed
—
he
have
finally
succeed
.
and
once
or
twice


lately
,
when
he
be
alone
in
the
evening
and
have
nothing
to
do
,
he
have


suddenly
stand
up
in
terror
,
not
know
what
he
be
.
and
he
go
to


the
mirror
and
look
long
and
closely
at
his
own
face
,
at
his
own


eye
,
seek
for
something
.
he
be
afraid
,
in
mortal
dry
fear
,
but
he


know
not
what
of
.
he
look
at
his
own
face
.
there
it
be
,
shapely
and


healthy
and
the
same
as
ever
,
yet
somehow
,
it
be
not
real
,
it
be
a


mask
.
he
dare
not
touch
it
,
for
fear
it
should
prove
to
be
only
a


composition
mask
.
his
eye
be
blue
and
keen
as
ever
,
and
as
firm
in


their
socket
.
yet
he
be
not
sure
that
they
be
not
blue
false


bubble
that
would
burst
in
a
moment
and
leave
clear
annihilation
.
he


could
see
the
darkness
in
they
,
as
if
they
be
only
bubble
of


darkness
.
he
be
afraid
that
one
day
he
would
break
down
and
be
a


purely
meaningless
babble
lapping
round
a
darkness
.




but
his
will
yet
hold
good
,
he
be
able
to
go
away
and
read
,
and
think


about
thing
.
he
like
to
read
book
about
the
primitive
man
,
book
of


anthropology
,
and
also
work
of
speculative
philosophy
.
his
mind
be


very
active
.
but
it
be
like
a
bubble
float
in
the
darkness
.
at
any


moment
it
might
burst
and
leave
he
in
chaos
.
he
would
not
die
.
he
know


that
.
he
would
go
on
living
,
but
the
meaning
would
have
collapse
out


of
he
,
his
divine
reason
would
be
go
.
in
a
strangely
indifferent
,


sterile
way
,
he
be
frightened
.
but
he
could
not
react
even
to
the


fear
.
it
be
as
if
his
centre
of
feeling
be
dry
up
.
he
remain


calm
,
calculative
and
healthy
,
and
quite
freely
deliberate
,
even
whilst


he
feel
,
with
faint
,
small
but
final
sterile
horror
,
that
his
mystic


reason
be
break
,
give
way
now
,
at
this
crisis
.




and
it
be
a
strain
.
he
know
there
be
no
equilibrium
.
he
would
have
to


go
in
some
direction
,
shortly
,
to
find
relief
.
only
Birkin
keep
the


fear
definitely
off
he
,
save
he
his
quick
sufficiency
in
life
,
by


the
odd
mobility
and
changeableness
which
seem
to
contain
the


quintessence
of
faith
.
but
then
Gerald
must
always
come
away
from


Birkin
,
as
from
a
Church
service
,
back
to
the
outside
real
world
of


work
and
life
.
there
it
be
,
it
do
not
alter
,
and
word
be


futility
.
he
have
to
keep
himself
in
reckon
with
the
world
of
work


and
material
life
.
and
it
become
more
and
more
difficult
,
such
a


strange
pressure
be
upon
he
,
as
if
the
very
middle
of
he
be
a


vacuum
,
and
outside
be
an
awful
tension
.




he
have
find
his
most
satisfactory
relief
in
woman
.
after
a
debauch


with
some
desperate
woman
,
he
go
on
quite
easy
and
forgetful
.
the


devil
of
it
be
,
it
be
so
hard
to
keep
up
his
interest
in
woman


nowadays
.
he
do
n’t
care
about
they
any
more
.
a
Pussum
be
all
right
in


her
way
,
but
she
be
an
exceptional
case
,
and
even
she
matter


extremely
little
.
no
,
woman
,
in
that
sense
,
be
useless
to
he
any


more
.
he
feel
that
his
_
mind
_
need
acute
stimulation
,
before
he
could


be

it
.
there
be
a
glimmer
of
nightly
rabbit
across
the
ground
.
the


night
be
as
clear
as
crystal
,
and
very
still
.
she
could
hear
a
distant


cough
of
a
sheep
.




so
she
swerve
down
to
the
steep
,
tree
-
hide
bank
above
the
pond
,


where
the
alder
twist
their
root
.
she
be
glad
to
pass
into
the


shade
out
of
the
moon
.
there
she
stand
,
at
the
top
of
the
fall
-
away


bank
,
her
hand
on
the
rough
trunk
of
a
tree
,
look
at
the
water
,
that


be
perfect
in
its
stillness
,
float
the
moon
upon
it
.
but
for
some


reason
she
dislike
it
.
it
do
not
give
she
anything
.
she
listen
for


the
hoarse
rustle
of
the
sluice
.
and
she
wish
for
something
else
out


of
the
night
,
she
want
another
night
,
not
this
moon
-
brilliant


hardness
.
she
could
feel
her
soul
cry
out
in
she
,
lament


desolately
.




she
see
a
shadow
move
by
the
water
.
it
would
be
Birkin
.
he
have
come


back
then
,
unaware
.
she
accept
it
without
remark
,
nothing
matter


to
she
.
she
sit
down
among
the
root
of
the
alder
tree
,
dim
and
veil
,


hear
the
sound
of
the
sluice
like
dew
distil
audibly
into
the


night

the
island

dark

dark

to
the
pure
darkness

.


she
wish
it
be
perfectly
dark
,
perfectly
,
and
noiseless
and
without


motion

out

it

so
ridiculous

he
stand
stare
at
the
water

then
he
stoop
and
pick
up
a
stone
,


which
he

sharply
at
the
pond

Ursula

aware
of
the
bright
moon

and
swaying
,

distort
,

her
eye

out

shadow

moment

on
the

then
again
there

a
burst

a
burst

brilliant
light

explode


on
the
water

fly
asunder
in
flake

and
dangerous

rapidly
,

white
bird
,
the
fire
all
break
rise
across
the


pond

in

confusion

battle
with
the

dark


wave

force
their
way

the
furth
wave
of
light

flee
out

to

clamour
against
the
shore
for
escape

the


wave
of
darkness
come
in
heavily
,

under
towards
the
centre

at
the
centre
,
the
heart
of
all
,
be
still
a
vivid
,
incandescent


quivering
of
a
white
moon
not
quite
destroy
,
a
white
body
of
fire


writhe
and

get
strong
,

re

itself

the


inviolable
moon

and
the
ray
be
hasten
in
in
thin
line
of
light
,


to
return
to
the
strengthen
moon

that
shake
upon
the
water

triumphant
reassumption

Birkin

and

,
motionless
,

the
pond

almost
calm
,


the
moon
be
almost
serene

satisfied
of
so
much
,
he
look
for


more
stone
.
she
feel
his
invisible
tenacity
.

in
a
moment
again
,


the
break
light
scatter
in
explosion
over
her
face
,
dazzle
she
;


and
then
,
almost
immediately
,
come
the
second
shot
.
the
moon
leap
up


white
and
burst
through
the
air
.
dart
of
bright
light
shot
asunder
,


darkness
sweep
over
the
centre
.
there
be
no
moon
,
only
a
battlefield


of
break
light
and
shadow
,
run
close
together
.
shadow
,
dark
and


heavy
,
strike
again
and
again
across
the
place
where
the
heart
of
the


moon
have
be
,
obliterate
it
altogether
.
the
white
fragment
pulse


up
and
down
,
and
could
not
find
where
to
go
,
apart
and
brilliant
on
the


water
like
the
petal
of
a
rose
that
a
wind
have
blow
far
and
wide
.




yet
again
,
they
be
flicker
their
way
to
the
centre
,
find
the


path
blindly
,
enviously
.
and
again
,
all
be
still
,
as
Birkin
and
Ursula


watch
.
the
water
be
loud
on
the
shore
.
he
see
the
moon
regathere


itself
insidiously
,
see
the
heart
of
the
rose
intertwine
vigorously


and
blindly
,
call
back
the
scatter
fragment
,
win
home
the


fragment
,
in
a
pulse
and
in
effort
of
return
.




and
he
be
not
satisfied
.
like
a
madness
,
he
must
go
on
.
he
get
large


stone
,
and
throw
they
,
one
after
the
other
,
at
the
white
-
burn


centre
of
the
moon
,
till
there
be
nothing
but
a
rocking
of
hollow


noise
,
and
a
pond
surge
up
,
no
moon
any
more
,
only
a
few
broken
flake


tangle
and
glitter
broadcast
in
the
darkness
,
without
aim
or


meaning
,
a
darken
confusion
,
like
a
black
and
white
kaleidoscope


toss
at
random
.
the
hollow
night
be
rock
and
crash
with
noise
,


and
from
the
sluice
come
sharp
,
regular
flash
of
sound
.
flake
of


light
appear
here
and
there
,
glitter
torment
among
the
shadow
,


far
off
,
in
strange
place
;
among
the
dripping
shadow
of
the
willow
on


the
island
.
Birkin
stand
and
listen
and
be
satisfied
.




Ursula
be
daze
,
her
mind
be
all
go
.
she
feel
she
have
fall
to
the


ground
and
be
spill
out
,
like
water
on
the
earth
.
Motionless
and


spend
she
remain
in
the
gloom
.
though
even
now
she
be
aware
,


unseeing
,
that
in
the
darkness
be
a
little
tumult
of
ebb
flake
of


light
,
a
cluster
dance
secretly
in
a
round
,
twining
and
come


steadily
together
.
they
be
gather
a
heart
again
,
they
be
come


once
more
into
being
.
gradually
the
fragment
catch
together


re
-
united
,
heaving
,
rocking
,
dance
,
fall
back
as
in
panic
,
but


work
their
way
home
again
persistently
,
make
semblance
of
flee


away
when
they
have
advance
,
but
always
flicker
near
,
a
little


close
to
the
mark
,
the
cluster
grow
mysteriously
large
and


bright
,
as
gleam
after
gleam
fall
in
with
the
whole
,
until
a
ragged


rise
,
a
distorted
,
fray
moon
be
shake
upon
the
water
again
,


re
-
asserted
,
renew
,
try
to
recover
from
its
convulsion
,
to
get


over
the
disfigurement
and
the
agitation
,
to
be
whole
and
compose
,
at


peace
.




Birkin
linger
vaguely
by
the
water
.
Ursula
be
afraid
that
he
would


stone
the
moon
again
.
she
slip
from
her
seat
and
go
down

on
the
one
hand
,
he
know
he
do
not


want
a
further
sensual
experience
—
something
deep
,
dark
,
than


ordinary
life
could
give
.
he
remember
the
african
fetish
he
have


see
at
Halliday
’s
so
often
.
there
come
back
to
he
one
,
a
statuette


about
two
foot
high
,
a
tall
,
slim
,
elegant
figure
from
West
Africa
,
in


dark
wood
,
glossy
and
suave
.
it
be
a
woman
,
with
hair
dress
high
,


like
a
melon
-
shape
dome
.
he
remember
she
vividly
:
she
be
one
of
his


soul
’s
intimate
.
her
body
be
long
and
elegant
,
her
face
be
crush


tiny
like
a
beetle
’s
,
she
have
row
of
round
heavy
collar
,
like
a


column
of
quoit
,
on
her
neck
.
he
remember
she
:
her
astonishing


cultured
elegance
,
her
diminish
,
beetle
face
,
the
astounding
long


elegant
body
,
on
short
,
ugly
leg
,
with
such
protuberant
buttock
,
so


weighty
and
unexpected
below
her
slim
long
loin
.
she
know
what
he


himself
do
not
know
.
she
have
thousand
of
year
of
purely
sensual
,


purely
unspiritual
knowledge
behind
she
.
it
must
have
be
thousand
of


year
since
her
race
have
die
,
mystically
:
that
is
,
since
the
relation


between
the
sense
and
the
outspoken
mind
have
break
,
leave
the


experience
all
in
one
sort
,
mystically
sensual
.
thousand
of
year
ago
,


that
which
be
imminent
in
himself
must
have
take
place
in
these


african
:
the
goodness
,
the
holiness
,
the
desire
for
creation
and


productive
happiness
must
have
lapse
,
leave
the
single
impulse
for


knowledge
in
one
sort
,
mindless
progressive
knowledge
through
the


sense
,
knowledge
arrest
and
end
in
the
sense
,
mystic
knowledge


in
disintegration
and
dissolution
,
knowledge
such
as
the
beetle
have
,


which
live
purely
within
the
world
of
corruption
and
cold
dissolution
.


this
be
why
her
face
look
like
a
beetle
’s
:
this
be
why
the


Egyptians
worship
the
ball
-
roll
scarab
:
because
of
the
principle


of
knowledge
in
dissolution
and
corruption
.




there
be
a
long
way
we
can
travel
,
after
the
death
-
break
:
after
that


point
when
the
soul
in
intense
suffering
break
,
break
away
from
its


organic
hold
like
a
leaf
that
fall
.
we
fall
from
the
connection
with


life
and
hope
,
we
lapse
from
pure
integral
being
,
from
creation
and


liberty
,
and
we
fall
into
the
long
,
long
african
process
of
purely


sensual
understanding
,
knowledge
in
the
mystery
of
dissolution
.




he
realise
now
that
this
be
a
long
process
—
thousand
of
year
it


take
,
after
the
death
of
the
creative
spirit
.
he
realise
that
there


be
great
mystery
to
be
unseal
,
sensual
,
mindless
,
dreadful


mystery
,
far
beyond
the
phallic
cult
.
how
far
,
in
their
inverted


culture
,
have
these
West
Africans
go
beyond
phallic
knowledge
?
very
,


very
far
.
Birkin
recall
again
the
female
figure
:
the
elongate
,
long
,


long
body
,
the
curious
unexpected
heavy
buttock
,
the
long
,
imprison


neck
,
the
face
with
tiny
feature
like
a
beetle
’s
.
this
be
far
beyond


any
phallic
knowledge
,
sensual
subtle
reality
far
beyond
the
scope
of


phallic
investigation
.




there
remain
this
way
,
this
awful
african
process
,
to
be
fulfil
.


it
would
be
do
differently
by
the
white
race
.
the
white
race
,


have
the
arctic
north
behind
they
,
the
vast
abstraction
of
ice
and


snow
,
would
fulfil
a
mystery
of
ice
-
destructive
knowledge
,


snow
-
abstract
annihilation
.
whereas
the
West
Africans
,
control
by


the
burn
death
-
abstraction
of
the
Sahara
,
have
be
fulfil
in


sun
-
destruction
,
the
putrescent
mystery
of
sun
-
ray
.




be
this
then
all
that
remain
?
be
there
leave
now
nothing
but
to


break
off
from
the
happy
creative
being
,
be
the
time
up
?
be
our
day
of


creative
life
finish
?
do
there
remain
to
we
only
the
strange
,
awful


afterwards
of
the
knowledge
in
dissolution
,
the
african
knowledge
,
but


different
in
we
,
who
be
blond
and
blue
-
eyed
from
the
north
?




Birkin
think
of
Gerald
.
he
be
one
of
these
strange
white
wonderful


demon
from
the
north
,
fulfil
in
the
destructive
frost
mystery
.
and


be
he
fate
to
pass
away
in
this
knowledge
,
this
one
process
of


frost
-
knowledge
,
death
by
perfect
cold
?
be
he
a
messenger
,
an
oman
of


the
universal
dissolution
into
whiteness
and
snow
?




Birkin
be
frightened
.
he
be
tired
too
,
when
he
have
reach
this


length
of
speculation
.
suddenly
his
strange
,
strained
attention
give


way
,
he
could
not
attend
to
these
mystery
any
more
.
there
be
another


way
,
the
way
of
freedom
.
there
be
the
paradisal
entry
into
pure
,


single
being
,
the
individual
soul
take
precedence
over
love
and


desire
for
union
,
strong
than
any
pang
of
emotion
,
a
lovely
state
of


free
proud
singleness
,
which
accept
the
obligation
of
the
permanent


connection
with
other
,
and
with
the
other
,
submit
to
the
yoke
and


leash
of
love
,
but
never
forfeit
its
own
proud
individual
singleness
,


even
while
it
love
and
yield
.




there
be
the
other
way
,
the
remain
way
.
and
he
must
run
to
follow


it
.
he
think
of
Ursula
,
how
sensitive
and
delicate
she
really
be
,


her
skin
so
over
-
fine
,
as
if
one
skin
be
want
.
she
be
really
so


marvellously
gentle
and
sensitive
.
why
do
he
ever
forget
it
?
he
must


go
to
she
at
once
.
he
must
ask
she
to
marry
he
.
they
must
marry
at


once
,
and
so
make
a
definite
pledge
,
enter
into
a
definite
communion
.


he
must
set
out
at
once
and
ask
she
,
this
moment
.
there
be
no
moment


to
spare
.




he
drift
on
swiftly
to
Beldover
,
half
-
unconscious
of
his
own


movement
.
he
see
the
town
on
the
slope
of
the
hill
,
not
straggle
,
but


as
if
wall
-
in
with
the
straight
,
final
street
of
miner
’
dwelling
,


make
a
great
square
,
and
it
look
like
Jerusalem
to
his
fancy
.
the


world
be
all
strange
and
transcendent
.




rosalind
open
the
door
to
he
.
she
start
slightly
,
as
a
young
girl


will
,
and
say
:




"
oh
,
I
’ll
tell
father
.
"




with
which
she
disappear
,
leave
Birkin
in
the
hall
,
look
at
some


reproduction
from
Picasso
,
lately
introduce
by
Gudrun
.
he
be


admire
the
almost
wizard
,
sensuous
apprehension
of
the
earth
,
when


will
Brangwen
appear
,
roll
down
his
shirt
sleeve
.




"
well
,
"
say
Brangwen
,
"
I
’ll
get
a
coat
.
"
and
he
too
disappear
for
a


moment
.
then
he
return
,
and
open
the
door
of
the
drawing
-
room
,


say
:




"
you
must
excuse
I
,
I
be
just
do
a
bit
of
work
in
the

.
come


inside
,
will
you
.
"




Birkin
enter
and
sit
down
.
he
look
at
the
bright
,
reddish
face
of


the
other
man
,
at
the
narrow
brow
and
the
very
bright
eye
,
and
at
the


rather
sensual
lip
that
unrolled
wide
and
expansive
under
the
black


cropped
moustache
.
how
curious
it
be
that
this
be
a
human
being
!
what


Brangwen
think
himself
to
be
,
how
meaningless
it
be
,
confront
with


the
reality
of
he
.
Birkin
could
see
only
a
strange
,
inexplicable
,


almost
patternless
collection
of
passion
and
desire
and
suppression


and
tradition
and
mechanical
idea
,
all
cast
unfused
and
disunite


into
this
slender
,
bright
-
face
man
of
nearly
fifty
,
who
be
as


unresolved
now
as
he
be
at
twenty
,
and
as
uncreated
.
how
could
he
be


the
parent
of
Ursula
,
when
he
be
not
create
himself
.
he
be
not
a


parent
.
a
slip
of
live
flesh

through
he

the
spirit

spirit
have
not
come
from
any


ancestor

have
come
out

the

"

Brangwen
,
after
wait


a
moment
.
there
be
no
connection
between
the
two

.




"
no

Birkin
.
"

bright

invulnerable

quite
free

her
self

possession

her
father

not

her
blithe


obliviousness

it

send

radiant
with


all
thing
,

her
possession
of
perfect
hostility

she
would
go
on
now
for
day
like
this
,
in
this
bright
frank
state
of


seemingly
pure
spontaneity
,
so
essentially
oblivious
of
the
existence


of
anything
but
herself
,
but
so
ready
and
facile
in
her
interest
.
ah
it


be
a
bitter
thing
for
a
man
to
be
near
she
,
and
her
father
curse
his


fatherhood
.
but
he
must
learn
not
to
see
she
,
not
to
know
.




she
be
perfectly
stable
in
resistance
when
she
be
in
this
state
:
so


bright
and
radiant
and
attractive
in
her
pure
opposition
,
so
very
pure
,


and
yet
mistrust
by
everybody
,
dislike
on
every
hand
.
it
be
she


voice
,
curiously
clear
and
repellent
,
that
give
she
away
.
only
Gudrun


be
in
accord
with
she
.
it
be
at
these
time
that
the
intimacy
between


the
two
sister
be
most
complete
,
as
if
their
intelligence
be
one
.


they
feel
a
strong
,
bright
bond
of
understanding
between
they
,


surpass
everything
else
.
and
during
all
these
day
of
blind
bright


abstraction
and
intimacy
of
his
two
daughter
,
the
father
seem
to


breathe
an
air
of
death
,
as
if
he
be
destroy
in
his
very
being
.
he


be
irritable
to
madness
,
he
could
not
rest
,
his
daughter
seem
to
be


destroy
he
.
but
he
be
inarticulate
and
helpless
against
they
.
he


be
force
to
breathe
the
air
of
his
own
death
.
he
curse
they
in
his


soul
,
and
only
want
,
that
they
should
be
remove
from
he
.




they
continue
radiant
in
their
easy
female
transcendancy
,
beautiful
to


look
at
.
they
exchange
confidence
,
they
be
intimate
in
their


revelation
to
the
last
degree
,
give
each
other
at
last
every
secret
.


they
withhold
nothing
,
they
tell
everything
,
till
they
be
over
the


border
of
evil
.
and
they
arm
each
other
with
knowledge
,
they


extract
the
subtle
flavour
from
the
apple
of
knowledge
.
it
be


curious
how
their
knowledge
be
complementary
,
that
of
each
to
that
of


the
other
.




Ursula
see
her
man
as
son
,
pity
their
yearning
and
admire
their


courage
,

wonder
over
they
as
a
mother
wonder
over
her
child
,


with
a
certain
delight
in
their
novelty

to
Gudrun

the


opposite
camp

for
day
,
Ursula
see
the
persistent
,


obtrusive
bird
as
stout
,
short
politician
lift
up
their
voice


from
the
platform
,
little
man
who
must
make
themselves
hear
at
any


cost
.




but
even
from
this
there
come
the
revulsion
.
some
yellowhammer


suddenly
shoot
along
the
road
in
front
of
she
.
and
they
look
to
she
so


uncanny
and
inhuman
,
like
flare
yellow
barb
shoot
through
the
air


on
some
weird
,
live
errand
,
that
she
say
to
herself
:
"
after
all
,
it


be
impudence
to
call
they
little
Lloyd
Georges
.
they
be
really
unknown


to
we
,
they
be
the
unknown
force
.
it
be
impudence
to
look
at
they
as


if
they
be
the
same
as
human
being
.
they
be
of
another
world
.
how


stupid
anthropomorphism
be
!
Gudrun
be
really
impudent
,
insolent
,
make


herself
the
measure
of
everything
,
make
everything
come
down
to
human


standard
.
Rupert
be
quite
right
,
human
being
be
boring
,
paint
the


universe
with
their
own
image
.
the
universe
be
non
-
human
,
thank
God
.
"


it
seem
to
her
irreverence
,
destructive
of
all
true
life
,
to
make


little
Lloyd
Georges
of
the
bird
.
it
be
such
a
lie
towards
the


robin
,
and
such
a
defamation
.
yet
she
have
do
it
herself
.
but
under


Gudrun
’s
influence
:
so
she
exonerate
herself
.




so
she
withdraw
away
from
Gudrun
and
from
that
which
she
stand
for
,
she


turn

since
the


fiasco
of
his
proposal

the
question
of

upon
she

know
what
kind

unspeakably
,
in
intimacy
.

his
challenge

GLADIATORIAL




after
the
fiasco
of
the
proposal
,
Birkin
have
hurry
blindly
away
from


Beldover
,
in
a
whirl
of
fury
.
he
feel
he
have
be
a
complete
fool
,
that


the
whole
scene
have
be
a
farce
of
the
first
water
.
but
that
do
not


trouble
he
at
all
.
he
be
deeply
,
mockingly
angry
that
Ursula


persist
always
in
this
old
cry
:
"
why
do
you
want
to
bully
I
?
"
and
in


her
bright
,
insolent
abstraction
.




he
go
straight
to
Shortlands
.
there
he
find
Gerald
stand
with
his


back
to
the
fire
,
in
the
library
,
as
motionless
as
a
man
be
,
who
be


completely
and
emptily
restless
,
utterly
hollow
.
he
have
do
all
the


work
he
want
to
do
—
and
now
there
be
nothing
.
he
could
go
out
in
the


car
,
he
could
run
to
town
.
but
he
do
not
want
to
go
out
in
the
car
,
he


do
not
want
to
run
to
town
,
he
do
not
want
to
call
on
the
Thirlbys
.


he
be
suspend
motionless
,
in
an
agony
of
inertia
,
like
a
machine


that
be
without
power
.




this
be
very
bitter
to
Gerald
,
who
have
never
know
what
boredom
be
,


who
have
go
from
activity
to
activity
,
never
at
a
loss
.
now
,


gradually
,
everything
seem
to
be
stop
in
he
.
he
do
not
want
any


more
to
do
the
thing
that
offer
.
something
dead
within
he
just


refuse
to
respond
to
any
suggestion
.
he
cast
over
in
his
mind
,
what
it


would
be
possible
to
do
,
to
save
himself
from
this
misery
of


nothingness
,
relieve
the
stress
of
this
hollowness
.
and
there
be
only


three
thing
leave
,
that
would
rouse
he
,
make
he
live
.
one
be
to


drink
or
smoke
hashish
,
the
other
be
to
be
soothe
by
Birkin
,
and
the


third
be
woman
.
and
there
be
no
one
for
the
moment
to
drink
with
.
nor


be
there
a
woman
.
and
he
know
Birkin
be
out
.
so
there
be
nothing
to


do
but
to
bear
the
stress
of
his
own
emptiness
.




when
he
see
Birkin
his
face
light
up
in
a
sudden
,
wonderful
smile
.




"
by
God
,
Rupert
,
"
he
say
,

I
’d

to

conclusion

to
take
the
edge
off


one

smile
in

very
astonishing

he
look
at

be
the
pure
gleam
of
relief

so
the
two
man
begin

together

they

dissimilar

tall

narrow
,

bone

very
thin

fine

Gerald

heavy

more
plastic
.
his
bone
be
strong
and
round
,
his


limb
be
rounded
,
all
his
contour
be
beautifully
and
fully


mould
.
he
seem
to
stand
with
a
proper
,
rich
weight
on
the
face
of


the
earth
,
whilst
Birkin
seem
to
have
the
centre
of
gravitation
in


his
own
middle
.
and
Gerald
have
a
rich
,
frictional
kind
of
strength
,


rather
mechanical
,
but
sudden
and
invincible
,
whereas
Birkin
be


abstract
as
to
be
almost
intangible
.
he
impinge
invisibly
upon
the


other
man
,
scarcely
seem
to
touch
he
,
like
a
garment
,
and
then


suddenly
pierce
in
a
tense
fine
grip
that
seem
to
penetrate
into


the
very
quick
of
Gerald
’s
being
.




they
stop
,
they
discuss
method
,
they
practise
grip
and
throw
,


they
become
accustomed
to
each
other
,
to
each
other
’s
rhythm
,
they
get


a
kind
of
mutual
physical
understanding
.
and
then
again
they
have
a
real


struggle
.
they
seem
to
drive
their
white
flesh
deeply
and
deep


against
each
other
,
as
if
they
would
break
into
a
oneness
.
Birkin
have
a


great
subtle
energy
,
that
would
press
upon
the
other
man
with
an


uncanny
force
,
weigh
he
like
a
spell
put
upon
he
.
then
it
would
pass
,


and
Gerald
would
heave
free
,
with
white
,
heaving
,
dazzle
movement
.




so
the
two
man
entwine
and
wrestle
with
each
other
,
work
near


and
nearer
.
both
be
white
and
clear
,
but
Gerald
flush
smart
red


where
he
be
touch
,
and
Birkin
remain
white
and
tense
.
he
seem
to


penetrate
into
Gerald
’s
more
solid
,
more
diffuse
bulk
,
to
interfuse
his


body
through
the
body
of
the
other
,
as
if
to
bring
it
subtly
into


subjection
,
always
seize
with
some
rapid
necromantic
fore
-
knowledge


every
motion
of
the
other
flesh
,
convert
and
counteract
it
,


play
upon
the
limb
and
trunk
of
Gerald
like
some
hard
wind
.
it
be


as
if
Birkin
’s
whole
physical
intelligence
interpenetrate
into


Gerald
’s
body
,
as
if
his
fine
,
sublimated
energy
enter
into
the
flesh


of
the
full
man
,
like
some
potency
,
cast
a
fine
net
,
a
prison
,


through
the
muscle
into
the
very
depth
of
Gerald
’s
physical
being
.




so
they
wrestle
swiftly
,
rapturously
,
intent
and
mindless
at
last
,
two


essential
white
figure
work
into
a
tighter
close
oneness
of


struggle
,
with
a
strange
,
octopus
-
like
knotting
and
flashing
of
limb


in
the
subdue
light
of
the
room
;
a
tense
white
knot
of
flesh
grip


in
silence
between
the
wall
of
old
brown
book
.
now
and
again
come
a


sharp
gasp
of
breath
,
or
a
sound
like
a
sigh
,
then
the
rapid
thudding


of
movement
on
the
thickly
-
carpet
floor
,
then
the
strange
sound
of


flesh
escaping
under
flesh
.
often
,
in
the
white
interlaced
knot
of


violent
living
being
that
sway
silently
,
there
be
no
head
to
be


see
,
only
the
swift
,
tight
limb
,
the
solid
white
back
,
the
physical


junction
of
two
body
clinch
into
oneness
.
then
would
appear
the


gleaming
,
ruffled
head
of
Gerald
,
as
the
struggle
change
,
then
for
a


moment
the
dun
-
colour
,
shadow
-
like
head
of
the
other
man
would
lift


up
from
the
conflict
,
the
eye
wide
and
dreadful
and
sightless
.




at
length
Gerald
lie
back
inert
on
the
carpet
,
his
breast
rise
in


great
slow
panting
,
whilst
Birkin
kneel
over
he
,
almost
unconscious

Birkin
be
much
more
exhausted

he
catch
little
,
short
breath
,
he


could
scarcely
breathe
any
more
.
the
earth
seem
to
tilt
and

,
and


a
complete
darkness
be
come
over
his
mind
.
he
do
not
know
what

.
he
slide
forward
quite
unconscious
,
over
Gerald
,
and
Gerald


do
not
notice
.
then
he
be
half

conscious
again
,
aware
only
of
the


strange
tilting
and
slide

the

endlessly
,
endlessly

he
come
to
consciousness
again
,
hear
an
immense
knock
outside

what
could
be
happen
,
what
be

great
hammer

stroke


resound
through
the

not

and
then
it
come
to
he


that
it
be
his

that

impossible

no

the
beating

sit
up

with
his

very

Gerald
however

dimly

cosy
,
she
spend
a
long
time
with
he
.
Gudrun
be
go
home
,


Winifred
be
alone
in
the
house
:
she
like
well
to
be
with
her
father
.


they
talk
and
prattle
at
random
,
he
always
as
if
he
be
well
,
just


the
same
as
when
he
be
go
about
.
so
that
Winifred
,
with
a
child
’s


subtle
instinct
for
avoid
the
painful
thing
,
behave
as
if
nothing


serious
be
the
matter
.
instinctively
,
she
withhold
her
attention
,
and


be
happy
.
yet
in
her
remoter
soul
,
she
know
as
well
as
the
adult


know
:
perhaps
well
.




her
father
be
quite
well
in
his
make
-
belief
with
she
.
but
when
she


go
away
,
he
relapse
under
the
misery
of
his
dissolution
.
but
still


there
be
these
bright
moment
,
though
as
his
strength
wane
,
his


faculty
for
attention
grow
weak
,
and
the
nurse
have
to
send
Winifred


away
,
to
save
he
from
exhaustion
.




he
never
admit
that
he
be
go
to
die
.
he
know
it
be
so
,
he
know


it
be
the
end
.
yet
even
to
himself
he
do
not
admit
it
.
he
hate
the


fact
,
mortally
.
his
will
be
rigid
.
he
could
not
bear
be
overcome
by


death
.
for
he
,
there
be
no
death
.
and
yet
,
at
time
,
he
feel
a
great


need
to
cry
out
and
to
wail
and
complain
.
he
would
have
like
to
cry


aloud
to
Gerald
,
so
that
his
son
should
be
horrify
out
of
his


composure
.
Gerald
be
instinctively
aware
of
this
,
and
he
recoil
,
to


avoid
any
such
thing
.
this
uncleanness
of
death
repel
he
too
much
.


one
should
die
quickly
,
like
the
Romans
,
one
should
be
master
of
one
’s


fate
in
die
as
in
living
.
he
be
convulse
in
the
clasp
of
this
death


of
his
father
’s
,
as
in
the
coil
of
the
great
serpent
of
Laocoön
.
the


great
serpent
have
get
the
father
,
and
the
son
be
drag
into
the


embrace
of
horrify
death
along
with
he
.
he
resist
always
.
and
in


some
strange
way
,
he
be
a
tower
of
strength
to
his
father
.




the
last
time
the
die
man
ask
to
see
Gudrun
he
be
grey
with
near


death
.
yet
he
must
see
someone
,
he
must
,
in
the
interval
of


consciousness
,
catch
into
connection
with
the
live
world
,
lest
he


should
have
to
accept
his
own
situation
.
fortunately
he
be
most
of
his


time
daze
and
half
go
.
and
he
spend
many
hour
dimly
thinking
of
the


past
,
as
it
be
,
dimly
re
-
live
his
old
experience
.
but
there
be


time
even
to
the
end
when
he
be
capable
of
realise
what
be


happen
to
he
in
the
present
,
the
death
that
be
on
he
.
and
these


be
the
time
when
he
call
in
outside
help
,
no
matter
whose
.
for
to


realise
this
death
that
he
be
die
be
a
death
beyond
death
,
never
to


be
bear
.
it
be
an
admission
never
to
be
make
.




Gudrun
be
shock
by
his
appearance
,
and
by
the
darken
,
almost


disintegrate
eye
,
that
still
be
unconquered
and
firm
.




"
well
,
"
he
say
in
his
weakened
voice
,
"
and
how
be
you
and
Winifred


get
on
?
"




"
oh
,
very
well
indeed
,
"
reply
Gudrun
.




there
be
slight
dead
gap
in
the
conversation
,
as
if
the
idea
call


up
be
only
elusive
straw
float
on
the
dark
chaos
of
the
sick


man
’s
die
.




"
the
studio
answer
all
right

"
he
say
.




"
splendid
.
it
could
n’t
be
more
beautiful
and
perfect
,

say
Gudrun
.




she
wait
for
what
he
would
say
next
.




"
and
you
think
Winifred
have
the
making
of
a
sculptor
?
"




it
be
strange
how
hollow
the
word
be
,
meaningless
.




"
I
’m
sure
she
have

she
will
do
good
thing
one
day
.
"




"
ah

then
her
life

altogether
waste

you
think

"




Gudrun
be
rather
surprised
.




"
sure
it

"
she
exclaim
softly
.




"
that

right
.
"




again
Gudrun
wait
for
what
he
would
say
.




"

find
life
pleasant
,
it
be
good
to
live
,

"
he
ask
,
with


a
pitiful
faint
smile
that
be
almost
too
much
for
Gudrun
.




"
yes
,
"
she
smile
—
she
would
lie
at
random—“i

"

"




again
Gudrun
smile
,
though
her
soul
be
dry
with
repulsion
.
do
one


have
to
die
like
this
—
have
the
life
extract
forcibly
from
one
,


whilst
one
smile
and
make
conversation
to
the
end
?
be
there
no
other


way
?
must
one
go
through
all
the
horror
of
this
victory
over
death
,
the


triumph
of
the
integral
will
,
that

one
must

it
be
the

she
admire
the


self

possession
and
the
control
of
the
die
man
exceedingly
.
but
she


loathe
the
death
itself
.
she
be
glad
the
everyday
world
hold
good
,


and
she
need
not
recognise
anything
beyond

"

"




"
except
that
you

say
Gudrun
.




"
ah
,
well
,
the
fault
of
that
lie
with
yourself

"
he
say
,
and
he
feel


a
little
exultation
,
that
he
have
make
this
speech
.




he
be
still
so
strong
and
live

but
the
nausea
of
death
begin
to


creep
back
on
he
,
in
reaction
.




Gudrun
go
away
,
back
to
Winifred
.
Mademoiselle
have
leave
,
Gudrun

a
good
deal
at
Shortlands
,
and
a
tutor
come
in
to
carry
on


Winifred

but
he
do
not

in
the
house
,

be


connect
with
the
Grammar
School
.




one
day
,
Gudrun
be
to
drive
with
Winifred
and
Gerald
and
Birkin
to


town
,
in
the
car
.
it
be
a
dark
,
showery
day
.
Winifred
and
Gudrun
be


ready
and
wait
at
the
door
.
Winifred
be
very
quiet
,
but
Gudrun
have


not
notice
.
suddenly
the
child
ask
,
in
a
voice
of
unconcern
:




"
do
you
think
my
father

go
to
die
,
Miss
Brangwen

Gudrun
start
.




"
I
do
n’t

"
she
reply
.




"

"




"
nobody
know
for
certain
.
he
_
may
_
die
,
of
course
.
"




the
child
ponder
a
few
moment
,
then
she
ask
:




"
but
do
you
_
think
_
he
will
die
?
"




it
be
put
almost
like
a
question
in
geography
or
science
,
insistent
,


as
if
she
would
force
an
admission
from
the
adult
.
the
watchful
,


slightly
triumphant
child
be
almost
diabolical
.




"
do
I
think
he
will
die
?
"
repeat
Gudrun
.
"
yes
,
I
do
.
"




but
Winifred
’s
large
eye
be
fix
on
she
,
and
the
girl
do
not
move
.




"
he
be
very
ill
,
"
say
Gudrun
.




a
small
smile
come
over
Winifred
’s
face
,
subtle
and
sceptical
.




"
_
I
_
do
n’t
believe
he
will
,
"
the
child
assert
,
mockingly
,
and
she


move
away
into
the
drive
.
Gudrun
watch
the
isolated
figure
,
and
she


heart
stand
still
.
Winifred
be
play
with
a
little
rivulet
of
water
,


absorbedly
as
if
nothing
have
be
say
.




"
I
’ve
make
a
proper
dam

she
say
,
out
of
the
moist
distance
.




Gerald
come
to
the
door
from
out
of
the
hall
behind
.




"
it
be
just
as
well
she
do
n’t
choose
to
believe
it
,
"
he
say
.




Gudrun
look
at
he
.
their
eye
meet
;
and
they
exchange
a
sardonic


understanding
.




"
just
as
well
,
"
say
Gudrun
.




he
look
at
she
again
,
and
a
fire
flicker
up
in
his
eye
.




"
good
to
dance

"


he
say
.




she
be
rather
take
aback
.
but
,
gather
herself
together
,

"
so
I

and
they
both
feel
the
subterranean
desire
to
let
go
,
to
fling
away


everything
,
and
lapse
into
a
sheer
unrestraint
,
brutal
and
licentious
.


a
strange
black
passion
surge
up
pure
in
Gudrun

feel
strong
.

feel
her
hand
so
strong

tear
the
world
asunder

abandonment
of
roman
licence

heart


grow
hot
.

know
she
want
this

something

satisfying
event

would
be

tremble
slightly
from
the
proximity
of
the
man
,
who


stand
just
behind
she
,
suggestive
of
the
same
black
licentiousness
that


rise
in
herself
.
she
want
it
with
he
,
this
unacknowledged
frenzy
.


for
a
moment
the
clear
perception
of
this
preoccupy
she
,
distinct
and


perfect
in
its
final
reality
.
then
she
shut
it
off
completely
,
say
:




"

such
effort
her
final
and
barren
conclusion
of


knowledge
,
be
apt
,
in
the
presence
of
other
woman
,
whom
she
think


simply
female
,
to
wear
the
conclusion
of
her
bitter
assurance
like


jewel
which
confer
on
she
an
unquestionable
distinction
,


establish
she
in
a
high
order
of
life
.
she
be
apt
,
mentally
,
to


condescend
to
woman
such
as
Ursula
,
whom
she
regard
as
purely


emotional
.
Poor
Hermione
,
it
be
her
one
possession
,
this
aching


certainty
of
hers
,
it
be
her
only
justification
.
she
must
be
confident


here
,
for
God
know
,
she
felt
reject
and
deficient
enough
elsewhere
.


in
the
life
of
thought
,
of
the
spirit
,
she
be
one
of
the
elect
.
and


she
want
to
be
universal
.
but
there
be
a
devastating
cynicism
at
the


bottom
of
she
.
she
do
not
believe
in
her
own
universal
—
they
be


sham
.
she
do
not
believe
in
the
inner
life
—
it
be
a
trick
,
not
a


reality
.
she
do
not
believe
in
the
spiritual
world
—
it
be
an


affectation
.
in
the
last
resort
,
she
believe
in
Mammon
,
the
flesh
,
and


the
devil
—
these
at
least
be
not
sham
.
she
be
a
priestess
without


belief
,
without
conviction
,
suckle
in
a
creed
outworn
,
and
condemn


to
the
reiteration
of
mystery
that
be
not
divine
to
she
.
yet
there


be
no
escape
.
she
be
a
leaf
upon
a
die
tree
.
what
help
be
there


then
,
but
to
fight
still
for
the
old
,
withered
truth
,
to
die
for
the


old
,
outworn
belief
,
to
be
a
sacred
and
inviolate
priestess
of


desecrate
mystery
?
the
old
great
truth
_
have
_
be
true
.
and
she
be


a
leaf
of
the
old
great
tree
of
knowledge
that
be
wither
now
.
to


the
old
and
last
truth
then
she
must
be
faithful
even
though
cynicism


and
mockery
take
place
at
the
bottom
of
her
soul
.




"

she
say
to
Ursula
,
in
her
slow
voice
,
that


be
like
an
incantation
.

slowly

perfect
equanimity

the
question

so
calm

mild
,
so
simple
and
bare
and
dispassionate


that
Ursula
be
somewhat
take
aback
,
rather
attracted
.
it

she


almost

delightful
naked
irony

Hermione
watch
she

slow

she
note
this
new
expression


of
vaunt
.
how
she
envy
Ursula
a
certain
unconscious
positivity

even
her
vulgarity

"

she
ask
,

her
easy
sing
song

perfectly
at
her
ease
,

even
rather
happy
in
this
conversation

"

Ursula
flush
a
little
at
the
mild
impertinence
of
this
question
.
and


yet
she
could
not
definitely
take
offence
.
Hermione
seem
so
calmly


and
sanely
candid
.
after
all
,
it
be
rather
great

Gudrun

answer
vaguely
.
he
be
not
very
much


interested
any
more

in
people

people

all


different
,

they
be
all
enclose
nowadays
in
a
definite


limitation
,
he
say
;
there
be
only
about
two
great
idea
,
two
great


stream
of
activity
remain
,
with
various
form
of
reaction


therefrom

the
reaction
be
all
varied
in
various
people
,

they


follow
a
few
great
law
,

intrinsically
there
be
no
difference
.


they
act
and
react
involuntarily

to
a
few
great
law

great
principle

no
long


mystically
interesting

they
be
all
essentially
alike

difference

only
variation
on
a
theme

none

they
transcend


the

Ursula
do
not
agree

people

still
an
adventure

she

—
perhaps


not
as
much
as
she

perhaps
there
be


something
mechanical
,
now
,
in
her
interest
.
perhaps
also
her
interest


be
destructive
,
her
analyse

a
real
tearing

DEATH
and
love




Thomas
Crich
die
slowly
,
terribly
slowly
.
it
seem
impossible
to


everybody
that
the
thread
of
life
could
be
draw
out
so
thin
,
and
yet


not
break
.
the
sick
man
lie
unutterably
weak
and
spend
,
keep
alive
by


morphia
and
by
drink
,
which
he
sip
slowly
.
he
be
only
half


conscious
—
a
thin
strand
of
consciousness
link
the
darkness
of
death


with
the
light
of
day
.
yet
his
will
be
unbroken
,
he
be
integral
,


complete
.
only
he
must
have
perfect
stillness
about
he
.




any
presence
but
that
of
the
nurse
be
a
strain
and
an
effort
to
he


now
.
every
morning
Gerald
go
into
the
room
,
hope
to
find
his
father


pass
away
at
last
.
yet
always
he
see
the
same
transparent
face
,
the


same
dread
dark
hair
on
the
waxen
forehead
,
and
the
awful
,
inchoate


dark
eye
,
which
seem
to
be
decompose
into
formless
darkness
,


have
only
a
tiny
grain
of
vision
within
they
.




and
always
,
as
the
dark
,
inchoate
eye
turn
to
he
,
there
pass


through
Gerald
’s
bowel
a
burn
stroke
of
revolt
,
that
seem
to


resound
through
his
whole
being
,
threaten
to
break
his
mind
with
its


clangour
,
and
make
he
mad
.




every
morning
,
the
son
stand
there
,
erect
and
taut
with
life
,
gleam


in
his
blondness
.
the
gleam
blondness
of
his
strange
,
imminent
being


put
the
father
into
a
fever
of
fretful
irritation
.
he
could
not
bear
to


meet
the
uncanny
,
downward
look
of
Gerald
’s
blue
eye
.
but
it
be
only


for
a
moment
.
each
on
the
brink
of
departure
,
the
father
and
son
look


at
each
other
,
then
parted
.




for
a
long
time
Gerald
preserve
a
perfect
_
sing
-
froid
_
,
he
remain


quite
collected
.
but
at
last
,
fear
undermine
he
.
he
be
afraid
of


some
horrible
collapse
in
himself
.
he
have
to
stay
and
see
this
thing


through
.
some
perverse
will
make
he
watch
his
father
draw
over
the


border
of
life
.
and
yet
,
now
,
every
day
,
the
great
red
-
hot
stroke
of


horrify
fear
through
the
bowel
of
the
son
strike
a
further


inflammation
.
Gerald
go
about
all
day
with
a
tendency
to
cringe
,
as


if
there
be
the
point
of
a
sword
of
Damocles
prick
the
nape
of
his


neck
.




there
be
no
escape
—
he
be
bind
up
with
his
father
,
he
have
to
see
he


through
.
and
the
father
’
will
never
relax
or
yield
to
death
.
it


would
have
to
snap
when
death
at
last
snap
it,—if
it
do
not
persist


after
a
physical
death
.
in
the
same
way
,
the
will
of
the
son
never


yield
.
he
stand
firm
and
immune
,
he
be
outside
this
death
and
this


die
.




it
be
a
trial
by
ordeal
.
could
he
stand
and
see
his
father
slowly


dissolve
and
disappear
in
death
,
without
once
yield
his
will
,


without
once
relent
before
the
omnipotence
of
death
.
like
a
Red


indian
undergo
torture
,
Gerald
would
experience
the
whole
process
of


slow
death
without
wince
or
flinch
.
he
even
triumph
in
it
.
he


somehow
_
want
_
this
death
,
even
force
it
.
it
be
as
if
he
himself


be
deal
the
death
,
even
when
he
most
recoil
in
horror
.
still
,
he


would
deal
it
,
he
would
triumph
through
death
.




but
in
the
stress
of
this
ordeal
,
Gerald
too
lose
his
hold
on
the


outer
,
daily
life
.
that
which
be
much
to
he
,
come
to
mean
nothing
.


work
,
pleasure
—
it
be
all
leave
behind
.
he
go
on
more
or
less


mechanically
with
his
business
,
but
this
activity
be
all
extraneous
.


the
real
activity
be
this
ghastly
wrestling
for
death
in
his
own
soul
.


and
his
own
will
should
triumph
.
come
what
might
,
he
would
not
bow
down


or
submit
or
acknowledge
a
master
.
he
have
no
master
in
death

as
the
fight
go
on
,
and
all
that
he
have
be
and
be
continue
to


be
destroy
,
so
that
life
be
a
hollow
shell
all
round
he
,
roar


and
clatter
like
the
sound
of
the
sea
,
a
noise
in
which
he


participate
externally
,
and
inside
this
hollow
shell
be
all
the


darkness
and
fearful
space
of
death
,
he
know
he
would
have
to
find


reinforcement
,
otherwise
he
would
collapse
inward
upon
the
great
dark


void
which
circle
at
the
centre
of
his
soul

will

outer


life

outer
be
unbroken
and
unchanged

the


pressure
be
too
great
.
he
would
have
to
find
something
to
make
good


the
equilibrium
.
something
must
come
with
he
into
the
hollow
void
of


death
in
his
soul
,
fill
it
up
,
and
so
equalise
the
pressure
within
to


the
pressure
without
.
for
day
by
day
he
feel
more
and
more
like
a


bubble
fill
with
darkness
,
round
which
whirl
the
iridescence
of
his


consciousness
,
and
upon
which
the
pressure
of
the
outer
world
,
the


outer
life
,
roar
vastly
.




in
this
extremity

instinct
lead
he
to
Gudrun
.
he
throw
away


everything
now
—
he
only
want
the
relation
establish
with
she
.
he


would
follow
she
to
the
studio
,
to
be
near
she
,
to
talk
to
she
.
he


would
stand
about
the
room
,
aimlessly
pick
up
the
implement
,
the


lump
of
clay
,

little
figure

have
cast
—

be
whimsical

grotesque

they
resume
their

such
stranger

and
yet
they


be
so
frightfully
,
unthinkably
near
.
it

they

now
they
be
come
to
the
square
arch
where
the
road
pass


under
the
colliery
railway
.
the
arch
,
Gudrun

,
have
wall
of
squared


stone
,
mossy
on
one
side
with
water
that
trickle
down
,
dry
on
the


other
side
.
she
have
stand
under
it
to
hear
the
train
rumble
thunder


over
the
log
overhead
.
and
she
know
that
under
this
dark
and
lonely


bridge
the
young
collier

in
the
darkness
with
their
sweetheart
,


in
rainy
weather
.
and
so
she
want
to
stand
under
the
bridge
with


_
she
_
sweetheart
,
and
be
kiss
under
the
bridge
in
the
invisible


darkness
.
her
step
drag
as
she
draw
near
.




so
,
under
the
bridge
,
they
come
to
a
standstill
,
and
he
lift
she
upon


his
breast
.
his
body
vibrate
taut
and
powerful
as
he
close
upon
she


and
crush
she
,
breathless
and
daze
and
destroy
,
crush
she
upon


his
breast
.
ah
,
it
be
terrible
,
and
perfect
.
under
this
bridge
,
the


collier
press
their
lover
to
their
breast
.
and
now
,
under
the


bridge
,
the
master
of
they
all
press
she
to
himself
!
and
how
much


more
powerful
and
terrible
be
his
embrace
than
theirs
,
how
much
more


concentrated
and
supreme
his
love
be
,
than
theirs
in
the
same
sort
!


she
feel
she
would
swoon
,
die
,
under
the
vibrate
,
inhuman
tension
of


his
arm
and
his
body
—
she
would
pass
away
.
then
the
unthinkable
high


vibration
slacken
and
become
more
undulating
.
he
slacken
and
draw


she
with
he
to
stand
with
his
back
to
the
wall
.




she
be
almost
unconscious
.
so
the
collier
’
lover
would
stand
with


their
back
to
the
wall
,
hold
their
sweetheart
and
kiss
they
as


she
be
be
kiss
.
ah
,
but
would
their
kiss
be
fine
and
powerful


as
the
kiss
of
the
firm
-
mouthed
master
?
even
the
keen
,
short
-
cut


moustache
—
the
collier
would
not
have
that
.




and
the
collier
’
sweetheart
would
,
like
herself
,
hang
their
head


back
limp
over
their
shoulder
,
and
look
out
from
the
dark
archway
,
at


the
close
patch
of
yellow
light
on
the
unseen
hill
in
the
distance
,
or


at
the
vague
form
of
tree
,
and
at
the
building
of
the
colliery


wood
-
yard
,
in
the
other
direction
.




his
arm
be
fast
around
she
,
he
seem
to
be
gather
she
into


himself
,
her
warmth
,
her
softness
,
her
adorable
weight
,
drink
in
the


suffusion
of
her
physical
being
,
avidly
.
he
lift
she
,
and
seem
to


pour
she
into
himself
,
like
wine
into
a
cup
.




"
this
be
worth
everything
,
"
he
say
,
in
a
strange
,
penetrate
voice
.




so
she
relax
,
and
seem
to
melt
,
to
flow
into
he
,
as
if
she
be


some
infinitely
warm
and
precious
suffusion
fill
into
his
vein
,


like
an
intoxicant
.
her
arm
be
round
his
neck
,
he
kiss
she
and


hold
she
perfectly
suspend
,
she
be
all
slack
and
flow
into
he
,


and
he
be
the
firm
,
strong
cup
that
receive
the
wine
of
her
life
.
so


she
lie
cast
upon
he
,
strand
,
lift
up
against
he
,
melting
and


melt
under
his
kiss
,
melt
into
his
limb
and
bone
,
as
if
he


be
soft
iron
becoming
surcharge
with
her
electric
life
.




till
she
seem
to
swoon
,
gradually
her
mind
go
,
and
she
pass
away
,


everything
in
she
be
melt
down
and
fluid
,
and
she
lie
still
,
become


contain
by
he
,
sleep
in
he
as
lightning
sleep
in
a
pure

soft


stone
.
so
she
be

away
and
go
in
he
,
and
he
be
perfect
.




when
she
open
her
eye
again
,
and
see
the
patch
of
light
in
the


distance

harvesting
for
her

ah
,
her

eager
,
greedy
for
knowledge
.
but
for
the
present

enough
,
enough
,


as
much
as
her
soul
could
bear
.
too
much
,
and
she
would
shatter


herself
,
she
would
fill
the
fine
vial
of

deeply
as
it

they
walk
on
towards
the

stage

mere
light
word
.
it
be
good
to
leave

lightly
,

they
hear

shake
hand
with
Gerald

once
meet

keep
saying—“he

in
all
this
.
it
be
the
right
conventional
attitude
,


and
,
as
far
as
the
world
go
,
he
believe
in
the
convention
.
he
take


it
as
a
matter
of
course
.
but
Winifred
hate
everything
,
and
hide
in
the


studio
,
and
cry
her
heart
out
,
and
wish
Gudrun
would
come
.




luckily
everybody
be
go
away
.
the
Criches
never
stay
long
at


home
.
by
dinner
-
time
,
Gerald
be
leave
quite
alone
.
even
Winifred
be


carry
off
to
London
,
for
a
few
day
with
her
sister
Laura
.




but
when
Gerald
be
really
leave
alone
,
he
could
not
bear
it
.
one
day


pass
by
,
and
another
.
and
all
the
time
he
be
like
a
man
hang
in


chain
over
the
edge
of
an
abyss
.
Struggle
as
he
might
,
he
could
not


turn
himself
to
the
solid
earth
,
he
could
not
get
foot
.
he
be


suspend
on
the
edge
of
a
void
,
writhe
.
whatever
he
think
of
,
be


the
abyss
—
whether
it
be
friend
or
stranger
,
or
work
or
play
,
it
all


show
he
only
the
same
bottomless
void
,
in
which
his
heart
swing


perish
.
there
be
no
escape
,
there
be
nothing
to
grasp
hold
of
.
he


must
writhe
on
the
edge
of
the
chasm
,
suspend
in
chain
of
invisible


physical
life
.




at
first
he
be
quiet
,
he
keep
still
,
expect
the
extremity
to
pass


away
,
expect
to
find
himself
release
into
the
world
of
the
living
,


after
this
extremity
of
penance
.
but
it
do
not
pass
,
and
a
crisis


gain
upon
he
.




as
the
evening
of
the
third
day
come
on
,
his
heart
ring
with
fear
.
he


could
not
bear
another
night
.
another
night
be
come
on
,
for
another


night
he
be
to
be
suspend
in
chain
of
physical
life
,
over
the


bottomless
pit
of
nothingness
.
and
he
could
not
bear
it
.
he
could
not


bear
it
.
he
be
frighten
deeply
,
and
coldly
,
frighten
in
his
soul
.


he
do
not
believe
in
his
own
strength
any
more
.
he
could
not
fall
into


this
infinite
void
,
and
rise
again
.
if
he
fall
,
he
would
be
go
for


ever
.
he
must
withdraw
,
he
must
seek
reinforcement
.
he
do
not
believe


in
his
own
single
self
,
any
far
than
this
.




after
dinner
,
face
with
the
ultimate
experience
of
his
own


nothingness
,
he
turn
aside
.
he
pull
on
his
boot
,
put
on
his
coat
,


and
set
out
to
walk
in
the
night
.




it
be
dark
and
misty
.
he
go
through
the
wood
,
stumble
and
feel


his
way
to
the
Mill
.
Birkin
be
away
.
good
—
he
be
half
glad
.
he
turn


up
the
hill
,
and
stumble
blindly
over
the
wild
slope
,
having
lose
the


path
in
the
complete
darkness
.
it
be
boring
.
where
be
he
go
?
no


matter
.
he
stumble
on
till
he
come
to
a
path
again
.
then
he
go
on


through
another
wood
.
his
mind
become
dark
,
he
go
on
automatically
.


without
thought
or
sensation
,
he
stumble
unevenly
on
,
out
into
the


open
again
,
fumble
for
stile
,
lose
the
path
,
and
go
along
the


hedge
of
the
field
till
he
come
to
the
outlet
.




and
at
last
he
come
to
the
high
road
.
it
have
distract
he
to
struggle


blindly
through
the
maze
of
darkness
.
but
now
,
he
must
take
a


direction
.
and
he
do
not
even
know
where
he
be
.
but
he
must
take
a


direction
now
.
nothing
would
be
resolve
by
merely
walk
,
walk


away
.
he
have
to
take
a
direction
.




he
stand
still
on
the
road
,
that
be
high
in
the
utterly
dark
night
,


and
he
do
not
know
where
he
be
.
it
be
a
strange
sensation
,
his
heart


beat
,
and
ring
round
with
the
utterly
unknown
darkness
.
so
he


stand
for
some
time
.




then
he
hear
footstep
,
and
see
a
small
,
swinge
light
.
he


immediately
go
towards
this
.
it
be
a
miner
.




"

where
he
be
.
at
least
,
when
he
come
to
Whatmore
,
he


would
know
.
he
be
glad
to
be
on
a
high
road
.
he
walk
forward
as
in
a


sleep
of
decision
.




that
be
Whatmore

—
?
yes
,
the
King
’s

and
there

.
he
descend
the
steep
hill
almost
run
.
wind
through
the


hollow
,
he
pass
the
Grammar
School
,
and
come
to
Willey
Green
Church
.


the
churchyard
!
he
halt
.




then
in
another
moment
he
have
clamber
up
the
wall
and
be
go
among


the
grave
.
even
in
this
darkness
he
could
see
the
heaped
pallor
of
old


white
flower
at
his
foot
.
this
then
be
the
grave
.
he
stoop
down
.


the
flower
be
cold
and
clammy
.
there
be
a
raw
scent
of


chrysanthemum
and
tube
-
rose
,
deaden
.
he
feel
the
clay
beneath
,
and


shrank
,
it
be
so
horribly
cold
and
sticky
.
he
stand
away
in
revulsion
.




here
be
one
centre
then
,
here
in
the
complete
darkness
beside
the


unseen
,
raw
grave
.
but
there
be
nothing
for
he
here
.
no
,
he
have


nothing
to
stay
here
for
.
he
feel
as
if
some
of
the
clay
be
stick


cold
and
unclean
,
on
his
heart
.
no
,
enough
of
this
.




where
then?—home
?
never
!
it
be
no
use
go
there
.
that
be
less
than


no
use
.
it
could
not
be
do
.
there
be
somewhere
else
to
go
.
where
?




a
dangerous
resolve
form
in
his
heart
,
like
a
fix
idea
.
there
be


Gudrun
—
she
would
be
safe
in
her
home
.
but
he
could
get
at
she
—
he
would


get
at
she
.
he
would
not

,
if
it


cost
he
his
life
.
he
stake
his
all
on
this
throw
.




he
set
off
walk
straight
across
the
field
towards
Beldover
.
it
be


so
dark
,
nobody
could
ever
see
he
.
his
foot
be
wet
and
cold
,
heavy


with
clay
.
but
he
go
on
persistently
,
like
a
wind
,
straight
forward
,


as
if
to
his
fate
.
there
be
great
gap
in
his
consciousness
.
he
be


conscious
that
he
be
at
Winthorpe
hamlet
,
but
quite
unconscious
how
he


have
get
there
.
and
then
,
as
in
a
dream
,
he
be

long
street
of


Beldover
,

its

his
sense

so
finely
,
almost
supernaturally
keen
,
that


he
seem
to
cast
his
own
will
over
the
half

room
.
he
could
hear
she

about
in
the


candlelight
.
she
would
be

her
husband
to

up
.
he
look


along

infinitely
careful
foot

could
smell
the

a


silence
about
himself
,
an
obliviousness
.




he
be
in
the
room

eye
would
disclose
whatever
there

.
and
then
,
very


near
to
his
face
,
to
his
fear
,

tenderness
for
he
,

a
dark
,
under

stirring
of
jealous


hatred
,
that
he
should
lie
so
perfect
and
immune
,
in
an
other

out
in
the


outer
darkness
.




she

in
intense
and
vivid
consciousness
,

exhausting


superconsciousness
.

yet
she
must
continue
in
this
state
of


violent
active
superconsciousness

conscious
of
everything

she


childhood
,
her
girlhood
,
all
the
forget
incident
,
all
the


unrealised

the
fathomless

to
an
end

there

no

must
haul
and
haul
at
the
rope
of


glitter
consciousness
,
pull
it
out
phosphorescent
from
the
endless


depth
of
the
unconsciousness
,

she
be
weary

aching
,
exhausted
,


and
fit
to
break
,

rouse
he
and
send
he
away

when
could
she
disturb
he

and
she


relapse
into
her
activity
of
automatic
consciousness
,

the
time
be

at

of
atrophy

perhaps
it

the
absence

Ursula
go
on
in
an
unreal
suspense
,
the
last
week
before
go
away
.


she
be
not
herself,—she
be
not
anything
.
she
be
something
that
be


go
to
be
—
soon
—
soon
—
very
soon
.
but
as
yet
,
she
be
only
imminent
.




she
go
to
see
her
parent
.
it
be
a
rather
stiff
,
sad
meeting
,
more


like
a
verification
of
separateness
than
a
reunion
.
but
they
be
all


vague
and
indefinite
with
one
another
,
stiffen
in
the
fate
that
move


they
apart
.




she
do
not
really
come
to
until
she
be
on
the
ship
crossing
from


dover
to
Ostend
.
dimly
she
have
come
down
to
London
with
Birkin
,
London


have
be
a
vagueness
,
so
have
the
train
-
journey
to
Dover
.
it
be
all


like
a
sleep
.




and
now
,
at
last
,
as
she
stand
in
the
stern
of
the
ship
,
in
a


pitch
-
dark
,
rather
blowy
night
,
feel
the
motion
of
the
sea
,
and


watch
the
small
,
rather
desolate
little
light
that
twinkle
on
the


shore
of
England
,
as
on
the
shore
of
nowhere
,
watch
they
sink


small
and
small
on
the
profound
and
live
darkness
,
she
feel
she


soul
stir
to
awake
from
its
anæsthetic
sleep
.




"
let
we
go
forward
,
shall
we
?
"
say
Birkin
.
he
want
to
be
at
the
tip


of
their
projection
.
so
they
leave
off
look
at
the
faint
spark
that


glimmer
out
of
nowhere
,
in
the
far
distance
,
call
England
,
and


turn
their
face
to
the
unfathomed
night
in
front
.




they
go
right
to
the
bow
of
the
softly
plunge
vessel
.
in
the


complete
obscurity
,
Birkin
find
a
comparatively
sheltered
nook
,
where


a
great
rope
be
coil
up
.
it
be
quite
near
the
very
point
of
the


ship
,
near
the
black
,
unpierced
space
ahead
.
there
they
sit
down
,


fold
together
,
fold
round
with
the
same
rug
,
creep
in
nearer
and


ever
near
to
one
another
,
till
it
seem
they
have
creep
right
into


each
other
,
and
become
one
substance
.
it
be
very
cold
,
and
the


darkness
be
palpable
.




one
of
the
ship
’s
crew
come
along
the
deck
,
dark
as
the
darkness
,
not


really
visible
.
they
then
make
out
the
faint
pallor
of
his
face
.
he


feel
their
presence
,
and
stop
,
unsure
—
then
bend
forward
.
when
his


face
be
near
they
,
he
see
the
faint
pallor
of
their
face
.
then
he


withdraw
like
a
phantom
.
and
they
watch
he
without
make
any
sound
.




they
seem
to
fall
away
into
the
profound
darkness
.
there
be
no
sky
,


no
earth
,
only
one
unbroken
darkness
,
into
which
,
with
a
soft
,
sleep


motion
,
they
seem
to
fall
like
one
closed
seed
of
life
fall


through
dark
,
fathomless
space
.




they
have
forget
where
they
be
,
forget
all
that
be
and
all
that


have
be
,
conscious
only
in
their
heart
,
and
there
conscious
only
of


this
pure
trajectory
through
the
surpass
darkness
.
the
ship
’s
prow


cleave
on
,
with
a
faint
noise
of
cleavage
,
into
the
complete
night
,


without
know
,
without
see
,
only
surge
on
.




in
Ursula
the
sense
of
the
unrealised
world
ahead
triumph
over


everything
.
in
the
midst
of
this
profound
darkness
,
there
seem
to


glow
on
her
heart
the
effulgence
of
a
paradise
unknown
and
unrealised
.


her
heart
be
full
of
the
most
wonderful
light
,
golden
like
honey
of


darkness
,
sweet
like
the
warmth
of
day
,
a
light
which
be
not
shed
on


the
world
,
only
on
the
unknown
paradise
towards
which
she
be
go
,
a


sweetness
of
habitation
,
a
delight
of
live
quite
unknown
,
but
hers


infallibly
.
in
her
transport
she
lift
her
face
suddenly
to
he
,
and


he
touch
it
with
his
lip
.
so
cold
,
so
fresh
,
so
sea
-
clear
her
face


be
,
it
be
like
kiss
a
flower
that
grow
near
the
surf
.




but
he
do
not
know
the
ecstasy
of
bliss
in
fore
-
knowledge
that
she


know
.
to
he
,
the
wonder
of
this
transit
be
overwhelming
.
he
be


fall
through
a
gulf
of
infinite
darkness
,
like
a
meteorite
plunge


across
the
chasm
between
the
world
.
the
world
be
tear
in
two
,
and
he


be
plunge
like
an
unlit
star
through
the
ineffable
rift
.
what
be


beyond
be
not
yet
for
he
.
he
be
overcome
by
the
trajectory
.




in
a
trance
he
lie
enfold
Ursula
round
about
.
his
face
be
against


her
fine
,
fragile
hair
,
he
breathe
its
fragrance
with
the
sea
and
the


profound
night
.
and
his
soul
be
at
peace
;
yield
,
as
he
fall
into
the


unknown
.
this
be
the
first
time
that
an
utter
and
absolute
peace
have


enter
his
heart
,
now
,
in
this
final
transit
out
of
life
.




when
there
come
some
stir
on
the
deck
,
they
rouse
.
they
stand
up
.
how


stiff
and
cramp
they
be
,
in
the
night
-
time
!
and
yet
the
paradisal


glow
on
her
heart
,
and
the
unutterable
peace
of
darkness
in
his
,
this


be
the
all
-
in
-
all
.




they
stand
up
and
look
ahead
.
low
light
be
see
down
the
darkness
.


this
be
the
world
again
.
it
be
not
the
bliss
of
her
heart
,
nor
the


peace
of
his
.
it
be
the
superficial
unreal
world
of
fact
.
yet
not


quite
the
old
world

for
the
peace
and
the
bliss
in
their
heart
be


endure
.




strange
,
and
desolate
above
all

,
like
disembark
from
the
Styx


into
the
desolated
underworld
,
be
this
landing
at
night
.
there
be
the


raw
,
half
-
light
,
cover
-
in
vastness

a
voice

avert
her
soft

little
from

tear
in

tear
,
tear

face


to

startled
in
her
very
soul
.
they
look
at
he
through
their


tear
in
terror
and
a
little
horror
.
his
light
blue
eye
be
keen
,


small
-
pupille
and
unnatural
in
their
vision
.

with
difficulty
.

unflawed
and
indomitable
.

knee


tighten
to
bronze

hang
above
her
soft
face
,

lip
part


and
whose
eye

in
a
strange
violation
.

grasp
of
his
hand

chin

unutterably
soft
and
silken
.

strong
as

,

metal
,
invincible
and
not

soft
and
inert
,
motionless

the


while

eye
,
in
which
the
tear
have
not
yet
dry
,
be
dilate
as


if
in
a
kind
of
swoon
of
fascination
and
helplessness
.

superhumanly
strong
,

unflawe
,

supernatural


force

.
her
softness
,
she


inert
,
relaxed
weight
lie
against
his
own
surcharge
,
bronze
-
like
limb


in
a
heaviness
of
desirability
that
would
destroy

overweening
power
of

much
for

have
suffer
a
whole
eternity
of
torture
rather
than
forego
one
second


of

Gudrun
,
who
have
be
watch
Gerald
in
the
_
Reunionsaal
_
,
suddenly


think
:




"
he
should
have
all
the
woman
he
can
—
it
be
his
nature
.
it
be
absurd
to


call
he
monogamous
—
he
be
naturally
promiscuous
.
that
be
his
nature
.
"




the
thought
come
to
she
involuntarily
.
it
shock
she
somewhat
.
it
be


as
if
she
have
see
some
new
_
Mene
!
mene
!
_
upon
the
wall
.
yet
it
be


merely
true
.
a
voice
seem
to
have
speak
it
to
she
so
clearly
,
that


for
the
moment
she
believe
in
inspiration
.




"
it
be
really
true
,
"
she
say
to
herself
again
.




she
know
quite
well
she
have
believe
it
all
along
.
she
know
it


implicitly
.
but
she
must
keep
it
dark
—
almost
from
herself
.
she
must


keep
it
completely
secret
.
it
be
knowledge
for
her
alone
,
and
scarcely


even
to
be
admit
to
herself
.




the
deep
resolve
form
in
she
,
to
combat
he
.
one
of
they
must
triumph


over
the
other
.
which
should
it
be
?
her
soul
steel
itself
with


strength
.
almost
she
laugh
within
herself
,
at
her
confidence
.
it
wake


a
certain
keen
,
half
contemptuous
pity
,
tenderness
for
he
:
she
be
so


ruthless
.




everybody
retire
early

be
hollow

strongly
,
a
victorious
sleep

suddenly
,
she

almost


fiercely
awake
.
the
small
timber
room
glow
with
the
dawn
,
that
come


upwards
from
the
low
window
.
she
could
see
down
the
valley
when
she


lift
her
head
:
the
snow
with
a
pinkish
,
half
-
reveal
magic
,
the


fringe
of
pine
-
tree
at

bottom
of
the
slope

and
one
tiny
figure


move
over
the
vaguely
-
illuminate
space
.




she
glance
at
his
watch
;
it
be
seven
o’clock
.
he
be
still
completely


asleep
.
and
she
be
so
hard
awake
,
it
be
almost
frightening
—
a
hard
,


metallic
wakefulness
.
she
lie
look
at
he
.




he
sleep
in
the
subjection
of
his
own
health
and
defeat
.
she
be


overcome
by
a
sincere
regard
for
he
.
till
now
,
she
be
afraid
before


he
.
she
lie
and

about
he
,
what
he
be
,
what
he
represent
in


the
world
.
a
fine
,
independent
will
,
he
have
.
she
think
of
the


revolution
he
have
work
in
the
mine
,
in
so
short
a
time
.
she
know


that
,
if
he
be
confront
with
any
problem
,
any
hard
actual


difficulty
,
he
would
overcome
it
.
if
he
lay
hold
of
any
idea
,
he
would


carry
it
through
.
he
have
the
faculty
of
make
order
out
of
confusion
.


only
let
he
grip
hold
of
a
situation
,

he
would
bring
to
pass
an


inevitable
conclusion

for
a
few
moment

bear
away

wing

Gerald
,
with
his
force
of
will
and
his
power
for
comprehend
the


actual
world
,
should
be
set
to
solve
the
problem
of
the
day
,
the


problem
of
industrialism
in
the
modern
world
.
she
know
he
would
,
in
the


course
of
time
,
effect
the
change
he
desire
,
he
could
re
-
organise
the


industrial
system
.
she
know
he
could
do
it
.
as
an
instrument
,
in
these


thing
,
he
be
marvellous
,
she
have
never
see
any
man
with
his


potentiality
.
he
be
unaware
of
it
,
but
she
know
.




he
only
need
to
be
hitch
on
,
he
need
that
his
hand
should
be
set


to
the
task
,
because
he
be
so
unconscious
.
and
this
she
could
do
.
she


would
marry
he
,
he
would
go
into
Parliament
in
the
Conservative


interest
,
he
would
clear
up
the
great
muddle
of
labour
and
industry
.
he


be
so
superbly
fearless
,
masterful
,
he
know
that
every
problem
could


be
work
out
,
in
life
as
in
geometry
.
and
he
would
care
neither
about


himself
nor
about
anything
but
the
pure
work
out
of
the
problem
.
he


be
very
pure
,
really
.




her
heart
beat
fast
,
she
fly
away
on
wing
of
elation
,
imagine
a


future
.
he
would
be
a
Napoleon
of
peace
,
or
a
Bismarck
—
and
she
the


woman
behind
he
.
she
have
read
Bismarck
’s
letter
,
and
have
be
deeply


move
by
they
.
and
Gerald
would
be
free
,
more
dauntless
than
Bismarck
.




but
even
as
she
lie
in
fictitious
transport
,
bathe
in
the
strange
,


false
sunshine
of
hope
in
life
,
something
seem
to
snap
in
she
,
and
a


terrible
cynicism
begin
to
gain
upon
she
,
blow
in
like
a
wind
.


everything
turn
to
irony
with
she
:
the
last
flavour
of
everything
be


ironical
.
when
she
feel
her
pang
of
undeniable
reality
,
this
be
when


she
know
the
hard
irony
of
hope
and
idea
.




she
lie
and
look
at
he
,
as
he
sleep
.
he
be
sheerly
beautiful
,
he


be
a
perfect
instrument
.
to
her
mind
,
he
be
a
pure
,
inhuman
,
almost


superhuman
instrument
.
his
instrumentality
appeal
so
strongly
to
she
,


she
wish
she
be
God
,
to
use
he
as
a
tool
.




and
at
the
same
instant
,
come
the
ironical
question
:
"
what
for
?
"
she


thought
of
the
collier
’
wife
,
with
their
linoleum
and
their
lace


curtain
and
their
little
girl
in
high
-
laced
boot
.
she
think
of
the


wife
and
daughter
of
the
pit
-
manager
,
their
tennis
-
party
,
and


their
terrible
struggle
to
be
superior
each
to
the
other
,
in
the


social
scale
.
there
be
Shortlands
with
its
meaningless
distinction
,


the
meaningless
crowd
of
the
Criches
.
there
be
London
,
the
House
of


Commons
,
the
extant
social
world
.
my
God
!




young
as
she
be
,
Gudrun
have
touch
the
whole
pulse
of
social
England
.


she
have
no
idea
of
rise
in
the
world
.
she
know
,
with
the
perfect


cynicism
of
cruel
youth
,
that
to
rise
in
the
world
mean
to
have
one


outside
show
instead
of
another
,
the
advance
be
like
have
a
spurious


half
-
crown
instead
of
a
spurious
penny
.
the
whole
coinage
of
valuation


be
spurious
.
yet
of
course
,
her
cynicism
know
well
enough
that
,
in
a


world
where
spurious
coin
be
current
,
a
bad
sovereign
be
well
than


a
bad
farthing
.
but
rich
and
poor
,
she
despise
both
alike
.




already
she
mock
at
herself
for
her
dream
.
they
could
be
fulfil


easily
enough
.
but
she
recognise
too
well
,
in
her
spirit
,
the
mockery


of
her
own
impulse
.
what
do
she
care
,
that
Gerald
have
create
a


richly
-
pay
industry
out
of
an
old
wear
-
out
concern
?
what
do
she


care
?
the
wear
-
out
concern
and
the
rapid
,
splendidly
organise


industry
,
they
be
bad
money
.
yet
of
course
,
she
care
a
great
deal
,


outwardly
—
and
outwardly
be
all
that
matter
,
for
inwardly
be
a
bad


joke
.




everything
be
intrinsically
a
piece
of
irony
to
she
.
she
lean
over


Gerald
and
say
in
her
heart
,
with
compassion
:




"

,
my
dear
,

her
heart
be
break
with
pity
and
grief
for
he
.
and
at
the
same


moment
,
a
grimace
come
over
her
mouth
,
of
mock
irony
at
her
own


unspoken
tirade
.
ah
,
what
a
farce
it
be
!

stocking

she
go
gaily
over
the
white
snow
,


with
Gerald
beside
she
,
in
white
and
grey
,
pull
the
little
toboggan
.


they
grow
small
in
the
distance
of
snow
,
climb
the
steep
slope
.




for
Gudrun
herself
,
she
seem
to
pass
altogether
into
the
whiteness
of


the
snow
,
she
become
a
pure
,
thoughtless
crystal
.
when
she
reach
the


top
of
the
slope
,
in
the
wind
,
she
look
round
,
and
see
peak
beyond


peak
of
rock
and
snow
,
bluish
,
transcendent
in
heaven
.
and
it
seem
to


she
like
a
garden
,
with
the
peak
for
pure
flower
,
and
her
heart


gather
they
.
she
have
no
separate
consciousness
for
Gerald
.




she
hold
on
to
he
as
they
went
sheer
down
over
the
keen
slope
.
she


feel
as
if
her
sense
be
be
whet
on
some
fine
grindstone
,
that


be
keen
as
flame
.
the
snow
sprint
on
either
side
,
like
spark
from
a


blade
that
be
be
sharpen
,
the
whiteness
round
about
run
swifter
,


swifter
,
in
pure
flame
the
white
slope
fly
against
she
,
and
she
fuse


like
one
molten
,
dancing
globule
,
rush
through
a
white
intensity
.


then
there
be
a
great
swerve
at
the
bottom
,
when
they
swing
as
it
be


in
a
fall
to
earth
,
in
the
diminish
motion
.




they
come
to
rest
.
but
when
she
rise
to
her
foot
,
she
could
not
stand
.


she
give
a
strange
cry
,
turn
and
clung
to
he
,
sink
her
face
on


his
breast
,
faint
in
he
.
utter
oblivion
come
over
she
,
as
she
lie


for
a
few
moment
abandon
against
he
.




"
what
be
it
?
"
he
be
say
.
"
be
it
too
much
for
you

"




but
she
hear
nothing
.




when
she
come
to
,
she
stand
up
and
look
round
,
astonished
.
her
face


be
white
,
her
eye
brilliant
and
large
.




"
what
be
it

"
he
repeat
.
"
do
it
upset
you
?
"




she
look
at
he
with
her
brilliant
eye
that
seem
to
have
undergo


some
transfiguration
,
and
she
laugh
,
with
a
terrible
merriment
.




"
no
,
"
she
cry
,
with
triumphant
joy
.
"
it
be
the
complete
moment
of
my


life
.
"




and
she
look
at
he
with
her
dazzling
,
overweene
laughter
,
like
one


possess
.
a
fine
blade
seem
to
enter
his
heart
,
but
he
do
not
care
,


or
take
any
notice
.




but
they
climb
up
the
slope
again
,
and
they
fly
down
through
the


white
flame
again
,
splendidly
,
splendidly
.
Gudrun
be
laugh
and


flash
,
powder
with
snow
-
crystal
,
Gerald
work
perfectly
.
he
feel


he
could
guide
the
toboggan
to
a
hair
-
breadth
,
almost
he
could
make
it


pierce
into
the
air
and
right
into
the
very
heart
of
the
sky
.
it
seem


to
he
the
fly
sledge
be
but
his
strength
spread
out
,
he
have
but
to


move
his
arm
,
the
motion
be
his
own
.
they
explore
the
great
slope
,


to
find
another
slide
.
he
feel
there
must
be
something
well
than
they


have
know
.
and
he
find
what
he
desire
,
a
perfect
long
,
fierce
sweep
,


sheer
past
the
foot
of
a
rock
and
into
the
tree
at
the
base
.
it
be


dangerous
,
he
know
.
but
then
he
know
also
he
would
direct
the
sledge


between
his
finger
.




the
first
day
pass
in
an
ecstasy
of
physical
motion
,
sleigh
,


skiing
,
skate
,
move
in
an
intensity
of
speed
and
white
light
that


surpass
life
itself
,
and
carry
the
soul
of
the
human
being
beyond


into
an
inhuman
abstraction
of
velocity
and
weight
and
eternal
,
frozen


snow
.




Gerald
’s
eye
become
hard
and
strange
,
and
as
he
go
by
on
his
ski
he


be
more
like
some
powerful
,
fateful
sigh
than
a
man
,
his
muscle


elastic
in
a
perfect
,
soar
trajectory
,
his
body
project
in
pure


flight
,
mindless
,
soulless
,
whirl
along
one
perfect
line
of
force
.




luckily
there
come
a
day
of
snow
,
when
they
must
all
stay
indoor
:


otherwise
Birkin
say
,
they
would
all
lose
their
faculty
,
and
begin


to
utter
themselves
in
cry
and
shriek
,
like
some
strange
,
unknown


specie
of
snow
-
creature
.




it
happen
in
the
afternoon
that
Ursula
sit
in
the
_
Reunionsaal
_


talk
to
Loerke
.
the
latter
have
seem
unhappy
lately
.
he
be
lively


and
full
of
mischievous
humour
,
as
usual
.




but
Ursula
have
think
he
be
sulky
about
something
.
his
partner
,
too
,


the
big
,
fair
,
good
-
look
youth
,
be
ill
at
ease
,
go
about
as
if


he
belong
to
nowhere
,
and
be
keep
in
some
sort
of
subjection
,


against
which
he
be
rebel
.




Loerke
have
hardly
talk
to
Gudrun
.
his
associate
,
on
the
other
hand
,


have
pay
she
constantly
a
soft
,
over
-
deferential
attention
.
Gudrun


want
to
talk
to
Loerke
.
he
be
a
sculptor
,
and
she
want
to
hear
his


view
of
his
art
.
and
his
figure
attract
she
.
there
be
the
look
of
a


little
wastrel
about
he
,
that
intrigue
she
,
and
an
old
man
’s
look
,


that
interest
she
,
and
then
,
beside
this
,
an
uncanny
singleness
,
a


quality
of
be
by
himself
,
not
in
contact
with
anybody
else
,
that


mark
out
an
artist
to
she
.
he
be
a
chatterer
,
a
magpie
,
a
maker
of


mischievous
word
-
joke
,
that
be
sometimes
very
clever
,
but
which


often
be
not
.
and
she
could
see
in
his
brown
,
gnome
’s
eye
,
the
black


look
of
inorganic
misery
,
which
lie
behind
all
his
small
buffoonery
.




his
figure
interest
she
—
the
figure
of
a
boy
,
almost
a
street
arab
.
he


make
no
attempt
to
conceal
it
.
he
always
wear
a
simple
loden
suit
,
with


knee
breeche
.
his
leg
be
thin
,
and
he
make
no
attempt
to
disguise


the
fact
:
which
be
of
itself
remarkable
,
in
a
German
.
and
he
never


ingratiate
himself
anywhere
,
not
in
the
slight
,
but
keep
to


himself
,
for
all
his
apparent
playfulness
.




leitner
,
his
companion
,
be
a
great
sportsman
,
very
handsome
with
his


big
limb
and
his
blue
eye
.
Loerke
would
go
toboganne
or
skate
,
in


little
snatch
,
but
he
be
indifferent
.
and
his
fine
,
thin
nostril
,


the
nostril
of
a
pure
-
breed
street
arab
,
would
quiver
with
contempt
at


leitner
’s
splothering
gymnastic
display
.
it
be
evident
that
the
two


man
who
have
travel
and
live
together
,
share
the
same
bedroom
,
have


now
reach
the
stage
of
loathing
.
Leitner
hate
Loerke
with
an


injure
,
writhe
,
impotent
hatred
,
and
Loerke
treat
Leitner
with
a


fine
-
quiver
contempt
and
sarcasm
.
soon
the
two
would
have
to
go


apart
.




already
they
be
rarely
together
.
leitner
run
attach
himself
to


somebody
or
other
,
always
defer
,
Loerke
be
a
good
deal
alone
.
out


of
door
he
wear
a
westphalian
cap
,
a
close
brown
-
velvet
head
with
big


brown
velvet
flap
down
over
his
ear
,
so
that
he
look
like
a


lop
-
eared
rabbit
,
or
a
troll
.
his
face
be
brown
-
red
,
with
a
dry
,


bright
skin
,
that
seem
to
crinkle
with
his
mobile
expression
.
his


eye
be
arrest
—
brown
,
full
,
like
a
rabbit
’s
,
or
like
a
troll
’s
,
or


like
the
eye
of
a
lost
being
,
have
a
strange
,
dumb
,
depraved
look
of


knowledge
,
and
a
quick
spark
of
uncanny
fire
.
whenever
Gudrun
have
try


to
talk
to
he
he
have
shy
away
unresponsive
,
look
at
she
with
his


watchful
dark
eye
,
but
enter
into
no
relation
with
she
.
he
have
make


her
feel
that
her
slow
French
and
her
slow
german
,
be
hateful
to


he
.
as
for
his
own
inadequate
English
,
he
be
much
too
awkward
to
try


it
at
all
.
but
he
understand
a
good
deal
of
what
be
say
,


nevertheless
.
and
Gudrun
,
pique
,
leave
he
alone
.




this
afternoon
,
however
,
she
come
into
the
lounge
as
he
be
talk
to


Ursula
.
his
fine
,
black
hair
somehow
remind
she
of
a
bat
,
thin
as
it


be
on
his
full
,
sensitive
-
look
head
,
and
wear
away
at
the
temple
.


he
sit
hunch
up
,
as
if
his
spirit
be
bat
-
like
.
and
Gudrun
could
see


he
be
make
some
slow
confidence
to
Ursula
,
unwilling
,
a
slow
,


grudging
,
scanty
self
-
revelation
.
she
go
and
sit
by
her
sister
.




he
look
at
she
,
then
look
away
again
,
as
if
he
take
no
notice
of


she
.
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
,

up

privacy
,
at
her
very
life

she
as
an
immature
bud
,


tear
open
,
be
destroy
.




she
might
open
towards
he
,
a
long
while
hence
,
in
her
dream
,
when
she


be
a
pure
spirit
.
but
now
she
be
not
to
be
violate
and
ruin
.
she


close
against
he
fiercely
.




they
climb
together
,
at
evening
,
up
the
high
slope
,
to
see
the


sunset
.
in
the
finely
breathe
,
keen
wind
they
stand
and
watch
the


yellow
sun
sink
in
crimson
and
disappear
.
then
in
the
east
the
peak


and
ridge
glow
with
living
rise
,
incandescent
like
immortal
flower


against
a
brown
-
purple
sky
,
a
miracle
,
whilst
down
below
the
world
be


a
bluish
shadow
,
and
above
,
like
an
annunciation
,
hover
a
rosy


transport
in
mid
-
air
.




to
she
it
be
so
beautiful
,
it
be
a
delirium
,
she
want
to
gather
the


glow
,
eternal
peak
to
her
breast
,
and
die
.
he
see
they
,
see
they


be
beautiful
.
but
there
arise
no
clamour
in
his
breast
,
only
a


bitterness
that
be
visionary
in
itself
.
he
wish
the
peak
be
grey


and
unbeautiful
,
so
that
she
should
not
get
her
support
from
they
.
why


do
she
betray
the
two
of
they
so
terribly
,
in
embrace
the
glow
of


the
evening
?
why
do
she
leave
he
stand
there
,
with
the
ice
-
wind


blow
through
his
heart
,

death
,

gratify
herself
among
the


rosy
snow

so
important
to
you

she
wince
in
violation
and
in
fury
.




"

away
,

cry
,

he
stand
back
a
little
,

leave
she

there

like
,


transport
into
the
mystic
glow
east

round
to

"
but
in
reality
,
he
have
destroy

be


strain
after
a
dead
effect

"
one
day

up
at

"




there
be
a
soft
,
voluptuous
promise

chill

arrogant

she
deny

keep
her
room
rigidly
private
to

he
wait
on

patience

to
his
yearning
for

to
himself
with
real

"
and
he
tremble


delicately
in
every
limb
,
in
anticipation
,
as
he
tremble
in
his
most


violent
access
of
passionate
approach
to
she
,
tremble
with
too
much


desire
.




she
have
a
curious
sort
of
allegiance
with
Loerke
,
all
the
while
,
now
,


something
insidious
and
traitorous
.
Gerald
know
of
it
.
but
in
the


unnatural
state
of
patience
,
and
the
unwillingness
to
harden
himself


against
she
,
in
which
he
find
himself
,
he
take
no
notice
,
although
she


soft
kindliness
to
the
other
man
,
whom
he
hate
as
a
noxious
insect
,


make
he
shiver
again
with
an
access
of
the
strange
shuddering
that


come
over
he
repeatedly
.




he
leave
she
alone
only
when
he
go
skiing
,
a
sport
he
love
,
and
which


she
do
not
practise
.
then
he
seem
to
sweep
out
of
life
,
to
be
a


projectile
into
the
beyond
.
and
often
,
when
he
go
away
,
she
talk
to


the
little
german
sculptor
.
they
have
an
invariable
topic
,
in
their
art
.




they
be
almost
of
the
same
idea
.
he
hate
Mestrovic
,
be
not


satisfied
with
the
Futurists
,
he
like
the
west
african
wooden
figure
,


the
aztec
art
,
Mexican
and
Central
American
.
he
see
the
grotesque
,
and


a
curious
sort
of
mechanical
motion
intoxicate
he
,
a
confusion
in


nature
.
they
have
a
curious
game
with
each
other
,
Gudrun
and
Loerke
,
of


infinite
suggestivity
,
strange
and
leer
,
as
if
they
have
some


esoteric
understanding
of
life
,
that
they
alone
be
initiate
into
the


fearful
central
secret
,
that
the
world
dared
not
know
.
their
whole


correspondence
be
in
a
strange
,
barely
comprehensible
suggestivity
,


they
kindle
themselves
at
the
subtle
lust
of
the
Egyptians
or
the


Mexicans
.
the
whole
game
be
one
of
subtle
inter
-
suggestivity
,
and
they


want
to
keep
it
on
the
plane
of
suggestion
.
from
their
verbal
and


physical
nuance
they
get
the
high
satisfaction
in
the
nerve
,
from


a
queer
interchange
of
half
-
suggest
idea
,
look
,
expression
and


gesture
,
which
be
quite
intolerable
,
though
incomprehensible
,
to


Gerald
.
he
have
no
term
in
which
to
think
of
their
commerce
,
his
term


be
much
too
gross
.




the
suggestion
of
primitive
art
be
their
refuge
,
and
the
inner


mystery
of
sensation
their
object
of
worship
.
art
and
Life
be
to


they
the
reality
and
the
Unreality

of
the
temporal
thing
in
her
life
,
except
in


so
far
as
she
be
an
artist
.
she
think
of
Cleopatra
—
Cleopatra
must


have
be
an
artist
;
she
reap
the
essential
from
a
man
,
she
harvest


the
ultimate
sensation
,

throw
away
the
husk
;

Mary
Stuart

the
great
Rachel

with
her
lover
after
the
theatre

the
exoteric
exponent
of
love

after
all

what

but
fuel


for
the
transport
of
this
subtle
knowledge
,
for
a
female
art
,
the
art


of
pure
,
perfect
knowledge
in
sensuous
understanding
.




one
evening
Gerald
be
argue
with
Loerke
about
Italy
and
Tripoli
.
the


Englishman
be
in
a
strange
,
inflammable
state
,
the
German
be
excited
.


it
be
a
contest
of
word
,
but
it
mean
a
conflict
of
spirit
between


the
two
man
.
and
all
the
while
Gudrun
could
see
in
Gerald
an
arrogant


english
contempt
for
a
foreigner
.
although
Gerald
be
quiver
,
his


eye
flash
,
his
face
flush
,
in
his
argument
there
be
a


brusqueness
,
a
savage
contempt
in
his
manner
,
that
make
Gudrun
’s
blood


flare
up
,
and
make
Loerke
keen
and
mortify

Gerald
come
down

hammer
with
his
assertion
,
anything
the
little
German

contemptible
rubbish

at
last
Loerke
turn
to
Gudrun

raise
his
hand
in
helpless
irony
,
a


shrug
of
ironical
dismissal

Gerald
sit
erect
,
perfectly
still
,
his
face
pale
and
calm
,
like
the


face

a
statue

unaware

up
from
under
his
duck
head
.




Gudrun
be
torture
for
something
to
say
,
to
relieve
the
suspense
.
she


twist
her
face
in
a
smile
,

knowingly

almost
sneering

at
length

over

movement

the
Professor

the
two
begin

conversation
on
Goethe

he
look
curiously


innocent
and
pure
,
really
beautiful
.
sometimes
it
come
upon
he
,
this


look
of
clear
distance
,
and
it
always
fascinate
she
.




she
wait
,
troubled
,
throughout
the
evening
.
she
think
he
would


avoid
she
,
or
give
some
sign
.
but
he
speak
to
she
simply
and


unemotionally
,
as
he
would
to
anyone
else
in
the
room
.
a
certain
peace
,


an
abstraction
possess
his
soul
.




she
go
to
his
room
,
hotly
,
violently
in
love
with
he
.
he
be
so


beautiful
and
inaccessible
.
he
kiss
she
,
he
be
a
lover
to
she
.
and


she
have
extreme
pleasure
of
he
.
but
he
do
not
come
to
,
he
remain


remote
and
candid
,
unconscious
.
she
want
to
speak
to
he
.
but
this


innocent
,
beautiful
state
of
unconsciousness
that
have
come
upon
he


prevent
she
.
she
feel
tormented
and
dark
.




in
the
morning
,
however
,
he
look
at
she
with
a
little
aversion
,
some


horror
and
some
hatred
darken
into
his
eye
.
she
withdraw
on
to
she


old
ground
.
but
still
he
would
not
gather
himself
together
,
against


she
.




Loerke
be
wait
for
she
now
.
the
little
artist
,
isolate
in
his
own


complete
envelope
,
feel
that
here
at
last
be
a
woman
from
whom
he


could
get
something
.
he
be
uneasy
all
the
while
,
wait
to
talk
with


she
,
subtly
contrive
to
be
near
she
.
her
presence
fill
he
with


keenness
and
excitement
,
he
gravitate
cunningly
towards
she
,
as
if
she


have
some
unseen
force
of
attraction
.




he
be
not
in
the
least
doubtful
of
himself
,
as
regard
Gerald
.
Gerald


be
one
of
the
outsider
.
Loerke
only
hate
he
for
be
rich
and


proud
and
of
fine
appearance
.
all
these
thing
,
however
,
rich
,
pride


of
social
standing
,
handsome
physique
,
be
external
.
when
it
come
to


the
relation
with
a
woman
such
as
Gudrun
,
he
,
Loerke
,
have
an
approach


and
a
power
that
Gerald
never
dream
of
.




how
should
Gerald
hope
to
satisfy
a
woman
of
Gudrun
’s
calibre
?
do
he


think
that
pride
or
masterful
will
or
physical
strength
would
help
he
?


Loerke
know
a
secret
beyond
these
thing
.
the
great
power
be
the
one


that
be
subtle
and
adjust
itself
,
not
one
which
blindly
attack
.
and


he
,
Loerke
,
have
understanding
where
Gerald
be
a
calf
.
he
,
Loerke
,


could
penetrate
into
depth
far
out
of
Gerald
’s
knowledge
.
Gerald
be


leave
behind
like
a
postulant
in
the
ante
-
room
of
this
temple
of


mystery
,
this
woman
.
but
he
Loerke
,
could
he
not
penetrate
into
the


inner
darkness
,
find
the
spirit
of
the
woman
in
its
inner
recess
,
and


wrestle
with
it
there
,
the
central
serpent
that
be
coil
at
the
core


of
life
.




what
be
it
,
after
all
,
that
a
woman
want
?
be
it
mere
social
effect
,


fulfilment
of
ambition
in
the
social
world
,
in
the
community
of


mankind
?
be
it
even
a
union
in
love
and
goodness
?
do
she
want


"
goodness
"
?
who
but
a
fool
would
accept
this
of
Gudrun
?
this
be
but


the
street
view
of
she
want
.
cross
the
threshold
,
and
you
find
she


completely
,
completely
cynical
about
the
social
world
and
its


advantage
.
once
inside
the
house
of
her
soul
and
there
be
a
pungent


atmosphere
of
corrosion
,
an
inflamed
darkness
of
sensation
,
and
a


vivid
,
subtle
,
critical
consciousness
,
that
see
the
world
distort
,


horrific
.




what
then
,
what
next
?
be
it
sheer
blind
force
of
passion
that
would


satisfy
she
now
?
not
this
,
but
the
subtle
thrill
of
extreme
sensation


in
reduction
.
it
be
an
unbroken
will
react
against
her
unbroken


will
in
a
myriad
subtle
thrill
of
reduction
,
the
last
subtle


activity
of
analysis
and
break
down
,
carry
out
in
the
darkness


of
she
,
whilst
the
outside
form
,
the
individual
,
be
utterly
unchanged
,


even
sentimental
in
its
pose
.




but
between
two
particular
people
,
any
two
people
on
earth
,
the
range


of
pure
sensational
experience
be
limited
.
the
climax
of
sensual


reaction
,
once
reach
in
any
direction
,
be
reach
finally
,
there
be


no
go
on
.
there
be
only
repetition
possible
,
or
the
go
apart
of


the
two
protagonist
,
or
the
subjugating
of
the
one
will
to
the
other
,


or
death
.




Gerald
have
penetrate
all
the
outer
place
of
Gudrun
’s
soul
.
he
be
to


she
the
most
crucial
instance
of
the
exist
world
,
the
_
ne
plus


ultra
_
of
the
world
of
man
as
it
exist
for
she
.
in
he
she
know
the


world
,
and
have
do
with
it
.
know
he
finally
she
be
the
Alexander


seek
new
world
.
but
there
_
be
_
no
new
world
,
there
be
no
more


_
man
_
,
there
be
only
creature
,
little
,
ultimate
_
creature
_
like


Loerke
.
the
world
be
finish
now
,
for
she
.
there
be
only
the
inner
,


individual
darkness
,
sensation
within
the
ego
,
the
obscene
religious


mystery
of
ultimate
reduction
,
the
mystic
frictional
activity
of


diabolic
reduce
down
,
disintegrate
the
vital
organic
body
of
life
.




all
this
Gudrun
know
in
her
subconsciousness
,
not
in
her
mind
.
she
know


her
next
step
—
she
know
what
she
should
move
on
to
,
when
she
leave


Gerald
.
she
be
afraid
of
Gerald
,
that
he
might
kill
she
.
but
she
do


not
intend
to
be
kill
.
a
fine
thread
still
unite
she
to
he
.
it


should
not
be
_
her
_
death
which
break
it
.
she
have
far
to
go
,
a


far
,
slow
exquisite
experience
to
reap
,
unthinkable
subtlety
of


sensation
to
know
,
before
she
be
finish
.




of
the
last
series
of
subtlety
,
Gerald
be
not
capable
.
he
could
not


touch
the
quick
of
she
.
but
where
his
ruder
blow
could
not
penetrate
,


the
fine
,
insinuate
blade
of
Loerke
’s
insect
-
like
comprehension


could
.
at
least
,
it
be
time
for
she
now
to
pass
over
to
the
other
,
the


creature
,
the
final
craftsman
.
she
know
that
Loerke
,
in
his
innermost


soul
,
be
detach
from
everything
,
for
he
there
be
neither
heaven


nor
earth
nor
hell
.
he
admit
no
allegiance
,
he
give
no
adherence


anywhere
.
he
be
single
and
,
by
abstraction
from
the
rest
,
absolute
in


himself
.




whereas
in
Gerald
’s
soul
there
still
linger
some
attachment
to
the


rest
,
to
the
whole
.
and
this
be
his
limitation
.
he
be
limited
,


_
borné
_
,
subject
to
his
necessity
,
in
the
last
issue
,
for
goodness
,
for


righteousness
,
for
oneness
with
the
ultimate
purpose
.
that
the
ultimate


purpose
might
be
the
perfect
and
subtle
experience
of
the
process
of


death
,
the
will
be
keep
unimpaired
,
that
be
not
allow
in
he
.
and


this
be
his
limitation
.




there
be
a
hover
triumph
in
Loerke
,
since
Gudrun
have
deny
she


marriage
with
Gerald
.
the
artist
seem
to
hover
like
a
creature
on
the


wing
,
wait
to
settle
.
he
do
not
approach
Gudrun
violently
,
he
be


never
ill
-
time
.
but
carry
on
by
a
sure
instinct
in
the
complete


darkness
of
his
soul
,
he
correspond
mystically
with
she
,


imperceptibly
,
but
palpably
.




for
two
day
,
he
talk
to
she
,
continue
the
discussion
of
art
,
of


life
,
in
which
they
both
find
such
pleasure
.
they
praise
the
by
-
go


thing
,
they
take
a
sentimental
,
childish
delight
in
the
achieve


perfection
of
the
past
.
particularly
they
like
the
late
eighteenth


century
,
the
period
of
Goethe
and
of
Shelley
,
and
Mozart
.




they
play
with
the
past
,
and
with
the
great
figure
of
the
past
,
a


sort
of
little
game
of
chess
,
or
marionette
,
all
to
please
themselves
.


they
have
all
the
great
man
for
their
marionette
,
and
they
two
be
the


God
of
the
show
,
work
it
all
.
as
for
the
future
,
that
they
never


mention
except
one
laugh
out
some
mocking
dream
of
the
destruction


of
the
world
by
a
ridiculous
catastrophe
of
man
’s
invention
:
a
man


invent
such
a
perfect
explosive
that
it
blow
the
earth
in
two
,
and


the
two
half
set
off
in
different
direction
through
space
,
to
the


dismay
of
the
inhabitant
:
or
else
the
people
of
the
world
divide
into


two
half
,
and
each
half
decide
_
it
_
be
perfect
and
right
,
the
other


half
be
wrong
and
must
be
destroy
;
so
another
end
of
the
world
.
or


else
,
Loerke
’s
dream
of
fear
,
the
world
go
cold
,
and
snow
fall


everywhere
,
and
only
white
creature
,
polar
-
bear
,
white
fox
,
and
man


like
awful
white
snow
-
bird
,
persist
in
ice
cruelty
.




apart
from
these
story
,
they
never
talk
of
the
future
.
they


delight
most
either
in
mock
imagination
of
destruction
,
or
in


sentimental
,
fine
marionette
-
show
of
the
past
.
it
be
a
sentimental


delight
to
reconstruct
the
world
of
Goethe
at
Weimar
,
or
of
schiller


and
poverty
and
faithful
love
,
or
to
see
again
Jean
Jacques
in
his


quaking
,
or
Voltaire
at
Ferney
,
or
Frederick
the
Great
read
his
own


poetry
.




they
talk
together
for
hour
,
of
literature
and
sculpture
and


painting
,
amuse
themselves
with
Flaxman
and
Blake
and
Fuseli
,
with


tenderness
,
and
with
Feuerbach
and
Böcklin
.
it
would
take
they
a


life
-
time
,
they
feel
to
live
again
,
_
in
petto
_
,
the
life
of
the
great


artist
.
but
they
prefer
to
stay
in
the
eighteenth
and
the


nineteenth
century
.




they
talk
in
a
mixture
of
language
.
the
ground
-
work
be
french
,
in


either
case
.
but
he
end
most
of
his
sentence
in
a
stumble
of
English


and
a
conclusion
of
German
,
she
skilfully
wove
herself
to
her
end
in


whatever
phrase
come
to
she
.
she
take
a
peculiar
delight
in
this


conversation
.
it
be
full
of
odd
,
fantastic
expression
,
of
double


meaning
,
of
evasion
,
of
suggestive
vagueness
.
it
be
a
real
physical


pleasure
to
she
to
make
this
thread
of
conversation
out
of
the


different
-
colour
strand
of
three
language
.




and
all
the
while
they
two
be
hover
,
hesitate
round
the
flame
of


some
invisible
declaration
.
he
want
it
,
but
be
hold
back
by
some


inevitable
reluctance
.
she
want
it
also
,
but
she
want
to
put
it


off
,
to
put
it
off
indefinitely
,
she
still
have
some
pity
for
Gerald
,


some
connection
with
he
.
and

high
that

over

bury

over

valley

dusk
of

pine
tree

one
could
go
that
way
home
;

he
shudder
with
nausea
at
the
thought


of
home;—one
could
travel
on
ski
down
there
,
and
come
to
the
old


imperial
road
,
below
the
pass
.
but
why
come
to
any
road
?
he
revolt
at


the
thought
of
find
himself
in
the
world
again
.
he
must
stay
up


there
in
the
snow
forever
.
he
have
be
happy
by
himself
,
high
up
there


alone
,
travel
swiftly
on
ski
,
take
far
flight
,
and
skim


past
the
dark
rock
vein
with
brilliant
snow
.




but
he
feel
something
icy
gathering
at
his
heart
.
this
strange
mood
of


patience
and
innocence

have
persist
in
he
for
some
day

be
leave
again
a
prey

torture

he
come
down
reluctantly
,
snow
-
burn
,
snow
-
estrange
,
to
the
house


in
the
hollow
,
between
the
knuckle
of
the
mountain
top

he
see
its


light
shine
yellow

he
hold
back
,
wish
he
need
not
go
in

to


confront
those
people

hear
the
turmoil

confusion

other
presence

isolate
as
if

vacuum


round

heart

sheath

pure
ice

the
moment
he

jolt
in

look


rather
lofty

superb

smile
slowly

graciously
to
the
Germans

a
sudden
desire
leapt
in
his
heart
,
to
kill
she
.
he
think
,
what
a


perfect
voluptuous
fulfilment
it
would
be
,
to
kill
she
.
his
mind
be


absent
all
the
evening
,
estrange
by
the
snow
and
his
passion
.
but
he


keep
the
idea
constant
within
he
,
what
a
perfect
voluptuous


consummation
it
would
be
to
strangle
she
,
to
strangle
every
spark
of


life
out
of
she
,
till
she
lie
completely
inert
,
soft
,
relaxed
for
ever
,


a
soft
heap
lie
dead
between
his
hand
,
utterly
dead
.
then
he
would


have
have
she
finally
and
for
ever
;
there
would
be
such
a
perfect


voluptuous
finality
.




Gudrun
be
unaware
of
what
he
be
feel
,
he
seem
so
quiet
and


amiable
,
as
usual
.
his
amiability
even
make
she
feel
brutal
towards


he
.




she
go
into
his
room
when
he
be
partially
undressed
.
she
do
not


notice
the
curious
,
glad
gleam
of
pure
hatred
,
with
which
he
look
at


she
.
she
stand
near
the
door
,
with
her
hand
behind
she
.




"

she
say
,
with
an
insulting


nonchalance

"

I
shall
not

"

he
say
,
"
where
will

go
then
?
"




but
she
ignore
his
question
.
she
have
her
own
logical
statement
to


make
,
and
it
must
be
make
as
she
have
think
it
.




"

ca

continue

she
pause
for
he
to
speak

he
say
nothing

be
only

to
himself

conclusion

he
talk

aloud
he

nothing

her
safeguard

even
physically
she

when
she
have
prove

that

she
could


leave
he
forever

meanwhile
the
fight
between
they
,
terrible
as


she
know
it
to
be
,
be
inconclusive

she
want
to

however
many
terror
she
might
have
,
she
would
be

,


uncowed
by
he

he
could
never
cow
she
,
nor
dominate
she
,
nor
have
any


right
over
she

this
she

once


it
be
prove

she
have
not

,
neither
to

this


be
what
still
bind
she
to
he

she
be
bind
to
he
,
she
could
not

beyond
he
.
she
sit
up
in
bed
,
closely
wrap
up
,
for
many
hour
,


think
endlessly
to
herself
.
it
be
as
if
she
would
never
have
do


weave
the
great
provision

there
he
be
,
before
every


woman

unfurl
his
male
attractiveness
,
display
his
great


desirability

try

make
every
woman
think
how
wonderful
it
would


be
to
have
he
for
a
lover
.
his
very
ignore
of
the
woman

part
of


the
game

be
never
_
unconscious
_
of
they
.
he
should
have
be
a


cockerel
,
so
he
could
strut
before
fifty
female
,
all
his
subject
.

really
,
his
Don
Juan
do
_
not

interest
I
.
I
could
play
Dona
Juanita


a
million
time
well
than
he
play
Juan
.
he
bore
I
,
you
know
.
his


maleness
bore
I
.
nothing
be
so
boring
,

inherently
stupid

stupidly
conceite
.
really
,
the
fathomless
conceit
of
these
man
,
it
be


ridiculous
—
the
little
strutter
.




"
they
be
all
alike
.
look
at
Birkin
.
build
out
of
the
limitation
of


conceit
they
be
,

nothing
else
.
really
,
nothing
but
their


ridiculous
limitation
and
intrinsic
insignificance
could
make
they
so


conceite
.




"
as
for
Loerke
,
there
be
a
thousand
time
more
in
he
than
in
a
Gerald
.


Gerald
be
so
limited
,
there
be
a
dead
end
to
he
.
he
would
grind
on
at


the
old
mill
forever
.

really
,
there
be
no
corn
between
the


millstone
any
more

they
grind
on
and
on
,
when
there
be
nothing
to


grind
—
say
the
same
thing
,
believe
the
same
thing
,
act
the


same
thing
.
oh
,
my
God
,
it
would
wear
out
the
patience
of
a
stone
.




"
I
do
n’t
worship
Loerke
,

at
any
rate
,
he
be
a
free
individual
.
he


be
not
stiff
with
conceit

he
be
not

dutifully
at
the

oh
God
,
when
I

of
Gerald
,

his


work
—
those
office
at
Beldover
,

the
mine

my
heart
sick

_
I
to

there


will
be

ha
—
she
laugh
to
herself
,
so
frightened
that
she
be
try
to


laugh
it
off
—
ha
—
ha
,
how
maddening
it
be
,
to
be
sure
,
to
be
sure
!




then
,
with
a
fleeting
self
-
conscious
motion
,
she
wonder
if
she
would


be
very
much
surprised
,
on
rise
in
the
morning
,
to
realise
that
she


hair
have
turn
white
.
she
have
_
feel
_
it
turn
white
so
often
,
under


the
intolerable
burden
of
her
thought
,
und
her
sensation
.
yet
there


it
remain
,
brown
as
ever
,
and
there
she
be
herself
,
look
a


picture
of
health
.




perhaps
she
be
healthy
.
perhaps
it
be
only
her
unabateable
health


that
leave
she
so
exposed
to
the
truth
.
if
she
be
sickly
she
would


have
her
illusion
,
imagination
.
as
it
be
,
there
be
no
escape
.
she


must
always
see
and
know
and
never
escape
.
she
could
never
escape
.


there
she
be
,
place
before
the
clock
-
face
of
life
.
and
if
she
turn


round
as
in
a
railway
station
,
to
look
at
the
bookstall
,
still
she


could
see
,
with
her
very
spine
,
she
could
see
the
clock
,
always
the


great
white
clock
-
face
.
in
vain
she
flutter
the
leave
of
book
,
or


make
statuette
in
clay
.
she
know
she
be
not
_
really
_
read
.
she
be


not
_
really
_
work
.
she
be
watch
the
finger
twitch
across
the


eternal
,
mechanical
,
monotonous
clock
-
face
of
time
.
she
never
really


live
,
she
only
watch
.
indeed
,
she
be
like
a
little
,
twelve
-
hour


clock
,
vis
-
à
-
vis
with
the
enormous
clock
of
eternity
—
there
she
be
,


like
Dignity
and
Impudence
,
or
Impudence
and
Dignity
.




the
picture
please
she
.
do
n’t
her
face
really
look
like
a
clock


dial
—
rather
roundish
and
often
pale
,
and
impassive
.
she
would
have
get


up
to
look
,
in
the
mirror
,
but
the
thought
of
the
sight
of
her
own


face
,
that
be
like
a
twelve
-
hour
clock
-
dial
,
fill
she
with
such
deep


terror
,
that
she
hasten
to
think
of
something
else
.




oh
,
why
be
n’t
somebody
kind
to
she
?
why
be
n’t
there
somebody
who


would
take
she
in
their
arm
,
and
hold
she
to
their
breast
,
and
give


her
rest
,
pure
,
deep
,
heal
rest
.
oh
,
why
be
n’t
there
somebody
to


take
she
in
their
arm
and
fold
she
safe
and
perfect
,
for
sleep
.
she


want
so
much
this
perfect
enfold
sleep
.
she
lie
always
so


unsheathe
in
sleep
.
she
would
lie
always
unsheathe
in
sleep
,


unrelieved
,
unsaved
.
oh
,
how
could
she
bear
it
,
this
endless
unrelief
,


this
eternal
unrelief
.




Gerald
!
could
he
fold
she
in
his
arm
and
sheathe
she
in
sleep
?
ha
!
he


need
put
to
sleep
himself
—
poor
Gerald
.
that
be
all
he
need
.


what
do
he
do
,
he
make
the
burden
for
she
great
,
the
burden
of
she


sleep
be
the
more
intolerable
,
when
he
be
there
.
he
be
an
add


weariness
upon
her
unripening
night
,
her
unfruitful
slumber
.
perhaps


he
get
some
repose
from
she
.
perhaps
he
do
.
perhaps
this
be
what
he


be
always
dog
she
for
,
like
a
child
that
be
famish
,
cry
for


the
breast
.
perhaps
this
be
the
secret
of
his
passion
,
his
forever


unquenched
desire
for
she
—
that
he
need
she
to
put
he
to
sleep
,
to


give
he
repose
.




what
then
!
be
she
his
mother
?
have
she
ask
for
a
child
,
whom
she
must


nurse
through
the
night
,
for
her
lover
.
she
despise
he
,
she
despise


he
,
she
harden
her
heart
.
an
infant
cry
in
the
night
,
this
Don


Juan
.




Ooh
,
but
how
she
hate
the
infant
cry
in
the
night
.
she
would
murder


it
gladly
.
she
would
stifle
it
and
bury
it
,
as
Hetty
Sorrell
do
.
no


doubt
Hetty
Sorrell
’s
infant
cry
in
the
night
—
no
doubt
Arthur


Donnithorne
’s
infant
would
.
ha
—
the
Arthur
Donnithornes
,
the
Geralds
of


this
world
.
so
manly
by
day
,
yet
all
the
while
,
such
a
crying
of


infant
in
the
night
.
let
they
turn
into
mechanism
,
let
they
.
let
they


become
instrument
,
pure
machine
,
pure
will
,
that
work
like


clock
-
work
,
in
perpetual
repetition
.
let
they
be
this
,
let
they
be


take
up
entirely
in
their
work
,
let
they
be
perfect
part
of
a
great


machine
,
have
a
slumber
of
constant
repetition
.
let
Gerald
manage
his


firm
.
there
he
would
be
satisfied
,
as
satisfied
as
a
wheelbarrow
that


go
backwards
and
forwards
along
a
plank
all
day
—
she
have
see
it
.




the
wheel
-
barrow
—
the
one
humble
wheel
—
the
unit
of
the
firm
.
then
the


cart
,
with
two
wheel
;
then
the
truck
,
with
four
;
then
the


donkey
-
engine
,
with
eight
,
then
the
winding
-
engine
,
with
sixteen
,
and


so
on
,
till
it
come
to
the
miner
,
with
a
thousand
wheel
,
and
then
the


electrician
,
with
three
thousand
,
and
the
underground
manager
,
with


twenty
thousand
,
and
the
general
manager
with
a
hundred
thousand
little


wheel
work
away
to
complete
his
make
-
up
,
and
then
Gerald
,
with
a


million
wheel
and
cog
and
axle
.




Poor
Gerald
,
such
a
lot
of
little
wheel
to
his
make
-
up
!
he
be
more


intricate
than
a
chronometer
-
watch
.
but
oh
heavens
,
what
weariness
!


what
weariness
,
God
above
!
a
chronometer
-
watch
—
a
beetle
—
her
soul


faint
with
utter
ennui
,
from
the
thought
.
so
many
wheel
to
count
and


consider
and
calculate
!
enough
,
enough
—
there
be
an
end
to
man
’s


capacity
for
complication
,
even
.
or
perhaps
there
be
no
end
.




meanwhile
Gerald
sit
in
his
room
,
read
.
when
Gudrun
be
go
,
he
be


leave
stupefied
with
arrest
desire
.
he
sit
on
the
side
of
the
bed
for


an
hour
,
stupefied
,
little
strand
of
consciousness
appear
and


reappear
.
but
he
do
not
move
,
for
a
long
time
he
remain
inert
,


his
head
drop
on
his
breast
.




then
he
look
up
and
realise
that
he
be
go
to
bed
.
he
be
cold
.


soon
he
be
lie
down
in
the
dark
.




but
what
he
could
not
bear
be
the
darkness
.
the
solid
darkness


confront
he
drive
he
mad
.
so
he
rise
,
and
make
a
light
.
he


remain
seated
for
a
while
,
stare
in
front
.
he
do
not
think
of


Gudrun
,
he
do
not
think
of
anything
.




then
suddenly
he
go
downstairs
for
a
book
.
he
have
all
his
life
be


in
terror
of
the
night
that
should
come
,
when
he
could
not
sleep
.
he


know
that
this
would
be
too
much
for
he
,
to
have
to
face
night
of


sleeplessness
and
of
horrified
watch
the
hour
.




so
he
sit
for
hour
in
bed
,
like
a
statue
,
read
.
his
mind
,
hard
and


acute
,
read
on
rapidly
,
his
body
understand
nothing
.
in
a
state
of


rigid
unconsciousness
,
he
read
on
through
the
night
,
till
morning
,


when
,
weary
and
disgust
in
spirit
,
disgust
most
of
all
with


himself
,
he
sleep
for
two
hour
.




then
he
get
up
,
hard
and
full
of
energy
.
Gudrun
scarcely
speak
to
he
,


except
at
coffee
when
she
say
:




"
I
shall
be
leave
tomorrow
.
"




"
we
will
go
together
as
far
as
Innsbruck
,
for
appearance
’s
sake
?
"
he


ask
.




"
perhaps
,
"
she
say
.




she
say
'
perhaps
'
between
the
sip
of
her
coffee
.
and
the
sound
of
she


take
her
breath
in
the
word
,
be
nauseous
to
he
.
he
rise
quickly
to


be
away
from
she
.




he
go
and
make
arrangement
for
the
departure
on
the
morrow
.
then
,


take
some
food
,
he
set
out
for
the
day
on
the
ski
.
perhaps
,
he
say


to
the
Wirt
,
he
would
go
up
to
the
Marienhütte
,
perhaps
to
the
village


below
.




to
Gudrun
this
day
be
full
of
a
promise
like
spring
.
she
feel
an


approach
release
,
a
new
fountain
of
life
rise
up
in
she
.
it
give


her
pleasure
to
dawdle
through
her
packing
,
it
give
her
pleasure
to
dip


into
book
,
to
try
on
her
different
garment
,
to
look
at
herself
in
the


glass
.
she
feel
a
new
lease
of
life
be
come
upon
she
,
and
she
be


happy
like
a
child
,
very
attractive
and
beautiful
to
everybody
,
with


her
soft
,
luxuriant
figure
,
and
her
happiness
.
yet
underneath
be
death


itself
.




in
the
afternoon
she
have
to
go
out
with
Loerke
.
her
tomorrow
be


perfectly
vague
before
she
.
this
be
what
give
her
pleasure
.
she
might


be
go
to
England
with
Gerald
,
she
might
be
go
to
Dresden
with


Loerke
,
she
might
be
go
to
Munich
,
to
a
girl
-
friend
she
have
there
.


anything
might
come
to
pass
on
the
morrow
.
and
today
be
the
white
,


snowy
iridescent
threshold
of
all
possibility
.
all
possibility
—
that
be


the
charm
to
she
,
the
lovely
,
iridescent
,
indefinite
charm,—pure


illusion
.
all
possibility
—
because
death
be
inevitable
,
and
_
nothing
_


be
possible
but
death
.




she
do
not
want
thing
to
materialise
,
to
take
any
definite
shape
.
she


want
,
suddenly
,
at
one
moment
of
the
journey
tomorrow
,
to
be
waft


into
an
utterly
new
course
,
by
some
utterly
unforeseen
event
,
or


motion
.
so
that
,
although
she
want
to
go
out
with
Loerke
for
the
last


time
into
the
snow
,
she
do
not
want
to
be
serious
or
businesslike
.




and
Loerke
be
not
a
serious
figure
.
in
his
brown
velvet
cap
,
that
make


his
head
as
round
as
a
chestnut
,
with
the
brown
-
velvet
flap
loose
and


wild
over
his
ear
,
and
a
wisp
of
elf
-
like
,
thin
black
hair
blow


above
his
full
,
elf
-
like
dark
eye
,
the
shiny
,
transparent
brown
skin


crinkle
up
into
odd
grimace
on
his
small
-
feature
face
,
he
look
an


odd
little
boy
-
man
,
a
bat
.
but
in
his
figure
,
in
the
greeny
loden
suit
,


he
look
_
chétif
_
and
puny
,
still
strangely
different
from
the
rest
.




he
have
take
a
little
toboggan
,
for
the
two
of
they
,
and
they
trudge

Loerke
do
not

up
unhurt
off

have
it
as
an
example
of
the
eternal
triangle
,


the
trinity
of
hate
.
it
would
be
simple
for
they
.




Birkin
go
away
,
his
manner
cold
and
abstracted
.
but
she
know
he
would


do
thing
for
she
,
nevertheless
,
he
would
see
she
through
.
she
smile


slightly
to
herself
,
with
contempt
.
let
he
do
the
work
,
since
he
be


so
extremely
_
good
_
at
look
after
other
people
.




Birkin
go
again
to
Gerald
.
he
have
love
he
.
and
yet
he
feel
chiefly


disgust
at
the
inert
body
lie
there
.
it
be
so
inert
,
so
coldly
dead
,


a
carcase
,
Birkin
’s
bowel
seem
to
turn
to
ice
.
he
have
to
stand
and


look
at
the
frozen
dead
body
that
have
be
Gerald
.




it
be
the
frozen
carcase
of
a
dead
male
.
Birkin
remember
a
rabbit


which
he
have
once
find
freeze
like
a
board
on
the
snow
.
it
have
be


rigid
like
a
dry
board
when
he
pick
it
up
.
and
now
this
be
Gerald
,


stiff
as
a
board
,
curl
up
as
if
for
sleep
,
yet
with
the
horrible


hardness
somehow
evident
.
it
fill
he
with
horror
.
the
room
must
be


make
warm
,
the
body
must
be
thaw
.
the
limb
would
break
like
glass
or


like
wood
if
they
have
to
be
straighten
.




he
reach
and
touch
the
dead
face
.
and
the
sharp
,
heavy
bruise
of


ice
bruise
his
living
bowel
.
he
wonder
if
he
himself
be
freeze


too
,
freeze
from
the
inside
.
in
the
short
blond
moustache
the


life
-
breath
be
freeze
into
a
block
of
ice
,
beneath
the
silent


nostril
.
and
this
be
Gerald
!




again
he
touch
the
sharp
,
almost
glitter
fair
hair
of
the
frozen


body
.
it
be
icy
-
cold
,
hair
icy
-
cold
,
almost
venomous
.
Birkin
’s
heart


begin
to
freeze
.
he
have
love
Gerald
.
now
he
look
at
the
shapely
,


strange
-
coloured
face
,
with
the
small
,
fine
,
pinch
nose
and
the
manly


cheek
,
see
it
freeze
like
an
ice
-
pebble
—
yet
he
have
love
it
.
what
be


one
to
think
or
feel
?
his
brain
be
begin
to
freeze
,
his
blood
be


turn
to
ice
-
water
.
so
cold
,
so
cold
,
a
heavy
,
bruise
cold
press


on
his
arm
from
outside
,
and
a
heavy
cold
congeal
within
he
,
in


his
heart
and
in
his
bowel
.




he
go
over
the
snow
slope
,
to
see
where
the
death
have
be
.
at
last


he
come
to
the
great
shallow
among
the
precipice
and
slope
,
near
the


summit
of
the
pass
.
it
be
a
grey
day
,
the
third
day
of
greyness
and


stillness
.
all
be
white
,
icy
,
pallid
,
save
for
the
scoring
of
black


rock
that
jut
like
root
sometimes
,
and
sometimes
be
in
naked


face
.
in
the
distance
a
slope
sheer
down
from
a
peak
,
with
many


black
rock
-
slide
.




it
be
like
a
shallow
pot
lie
among
the
stone
and
snow
of
the
upper


world
.
in
this
pot
Gerald
have
go
to
sleep
.
at
the
far
end
,
the
guide


have
drive
iron
stake
deep
into
the
snow
-
wall
,
so
that
,
by
mean
of


the
great
rope
attach
,
they
could
haul
themselves
up
the
massive


snow
-
front
,
out
on
to
the
jagged
summit
of
the
pass
,
naked
to
heaven
,


where
the
Marienhütte
hide
among
the
naked
rock
.
round
about
,
spike
,


slash
snow
-
peak
prick
the
heaven
.




Gerald
might
have
find
this
rope
.
he
might
have
haul
himself
up
to


the
crest
.
he
might
have
hear
the
dog
in
the
Marienhütte
,
and
find


shelter
.
he
might
have
go
on
,
down
the
steep
,
steep
fall
of
the


south
-
side
,
down
into
the
dark
valley
with
its
pine
,
on
to
the
great


imperial
road
lead
south
to
Italy
.




he
might
!
and
what
then
?
the
imperial
road
!
the
south
?
Italy
?
what


then
?
be
it
a
way
out
?
it
be
only
a
way
in
again
.
Birkin
stand
high


in
the
painful
air
,
look
at
the
peak
,
and
the
way
south
.
be
it
any


good
go
south
,
to
Italy
?
down
the
old
,
old
imperial
road
?




he
turn
away
.
either
the
heart
would
break
,
or
cease
to
care
.
good


cease
to
care
.
whatever
the
mystery
which
have
bring
forth
man
and
the


universe
,
it
be
a
non
-
human
mystery
,
it
have
its
own
great
end
,
man
be


not
the
criterion
.
good
leave
it
all
to
the
vast
,
creative
,
non
-
human


mystery
.
good
strive
with
oneself
only
,
not
with
the
universe
.




"
God
can
not
do
without
man
.
"
it
be
a
saying
of
some
great
French


religious
teacher
.
but
surely
this
be
false
.
God
can
do
without
man
.


God
could
do
without
the
ichthyosauri
and
the
mastodon
.
these
monster


fail
creatively
to
develop
,
so
God
,
the
creative
mystery
,
dispense


with
they
.
in
the
same
way
the
mystery
could
dispense
with
man
,
should


he
too
fail
creatively
to
change
and
develop
.
the
eternal
creative


mystery
could
dispose
of
man
,
and
replace
he
with
a
finer
create


be
.
just
as
the
horse
have
take
the
place
of
the
mastodon
.




it
be
very
console
to
Birkin
,
to
think
this
.
if
humanity
run
into
a


_
cul
de
sac
_
and
expend
itself
,
the
timeless
creative
mystery
would


bring
forth
some
other
being
,
fine
,
more
wonderful
,
some
new
,
more


lovely
race
,
to
carry
on
the
embodiment
of
creation
.
the
game
be
never


up
.
the
mystery
of
creation
be
fathomless
,
infallible
,
inexhaustible
,


forever
.
race
come
and
go
,
specie
pass
away
,
but
ever
new
specie


arise
,
more
lovely
,
or
equally
lovely
,
always
surpass
wonder
.
the


fountain
-
head
be
incorruptible
and
unsearchable
.
it
have
no
limit
.
it


could
bring
forth
miracle
,
create
utter
new
race
and
new
specie
,
in


its
own
hour
,
new
form
of
consciousness
,
new
form
of
body
,
new
unit


of
be
.
to
be
man
be
as
nothing
compare
to
the
possibility
of
the


creative
mystery
.
to
have
one
’s
pulse
beat
direct
from
the
mystery
,


this
be
perfection
,
unutterable
satisfaction
.
human
or
inhuman


matter
nothing
.
the
perfect
pulse
throbbed
with
indescribable
being
,


miraculous
unborn
specie
.




Birkin
go
home
again
to
Gerald
.
he
go
into
the
room
,
and
sit
down


on
the
bed
.
dead
,
dead
and
cold
!




Imperial
Caesar
dead
,
and
turn
to
clay


would
stop
a
hole
to
keep
the
wind
away
.




there
be
no
response
from
that
which
have
be
Gerald
.
strange
,


congeal
,
icy
substance
—
no
more
.
no
more
!




terribly
weary
,
Birkin
go
away
,
about
the
day
’s
business
.
he
do
it


all
quietly
,
without
bother
.
to
rant
,
to
rave
,
to
be
tragic
,
to
make


situation
—
it
be
all
too
late
.
good
be
quiet
,
and
bear
one
’s
soul
in


patience
and
in
fullness
.




but
when
he
go
in
again
,
at
evening
,
to
look
at
Gerald
between
the


candle
,
because
of
his
heart
’s
hunger
,
suddenly
his
heart
contract
,


his
own
candle
all
but
fall
from
his
hand
,
as
,
with
a
strange


whimper
cry
,
the
tear
break
out
.
he
sit
down
in
a
chair
,
shake
by


a
sudden
access
.
Ursula
who
have
follow
he
,
recoil
aghast
from
he
,


as
he
sit
with
sunken
head
and
body
convulsively
shake
,
make
a


strange
,
horrible
sound
of
tear
.




"
I
do
n’t
want
it
to
be
like
this
—
I
do
n’t
want
it
to
be
like
this
,
"
he


cry
to
himself
.
Ursula
could
but
think
of
the
Kaiser
’s
:
"
_
ich
habe
es


nicht
gewollt
.
_
"
she
look
almost
with
horror
on
Birkin
.




suddenly
he
be
silent
.
but
he
sit
with
his
head
drop
,
to
hide
his


face
.
then
furtively
he
wipe
his
face
with
his
finger
.
then
suddenly


he
lift
his
head
,
and
look
straight
at
Ursula
,
with
dark
,
almost


vengeful
eye
.




"
he
should
have
love
I
,
"
he
say
.
"
I
offer
he
.
"




she
,
afraid
,
white
,
with
mute
lip
answer
:




"
what
difference
would
it
have
make
!
"




"
it
would
!
"
he
say
.
"
it
would
.
"




he
forget
she
,
and
turn
to
look
at
Gerald
.
with
head
oddly
lift
,


like
a
man
who
draw
his
head
back
from
an
insult
,
half
haughtily
,
he


watch
the
cold
,
mute
,
material
face
.
it
have
a
bluish
cast
.
it
send
a


shaft
like
ice
through
the
heart
of
the
live
man
.
cold
,
mute
,


material
!
Birkin
remember
how
once
Gerald
have
clutch
his
hand
,
with


a
warm
,
momentaneous
grip
of
final
love
.
for
one
second
—
then
let
go


again
,
let
go
for
ever
.
if
he
have
keep
true
to
that
clasp
,
death
would


not
have
matter
.
those
who
die
,
and
die
still
can
love
,
still


believe
,
do
not
die
.
they
live
still
in
the
beloved
.
Gerald
might
still


have
be
live
in
the
spirit
with
Birkin
,
even
after
death
.
he
might


have
live
with
his
friend
,
a
further
life
.




but
now
he
be
dead
,
like
clay
,
like
bluish
,
corruptible
ice
.
Birkin


look
at
the
pale
finger
,
the
inert
mass
.
he
remember
a
dead


stallion
he
have
see
:
a
dead
mass
of
maleness
,
repugnant
.
he
remember


also
the
beautiful
face
of
one
whom
he
have
love
,
and
who
have
die


still
have
the
faith
to
yield
to
the
mystery
.
that
dead
face
be


beautiful
,
no
one
could
call
it
cold
,
mute
,
material
.
no
one
could


remember
it
without
gain
faith
in
the
mystery
,
without
the
soul
’s


warm
with
new
,
deep
life
-
trust
.




and
Gerald

leave
the
heart
cold
,
frozen
,
hardly
able
to


beat
.
Gerald

father
have
look
wistful
,
to
break
the
heart
:
but
not


this
last
terrible
look
of
cold
,
mute

and


watch
.




Ursula
stand
aside

the
live
man
stare
at
the
frozen
face
of


the
dead
man
