sit
at
the
foot
of
the
rather
sharp


slope
from

,
and
look
out
,
from
the
attic
window
at
least
,


on
the
slow
climb
of
the
valley
towards
Selby
.




the
house
themselves
be
substantial
and
very
decent
.
one
could
walk


all
round
,
see
little
front
garden
with
auricula
and
saxifrage
in


the
shadow
of
the
bottom
block
,
sweet
-
william
and
pink
in
the
sunny


top
block
;
see
neat
front
window
,
little
porch
,
little
privet


hedge
,
and
dormer
window
for
the
attic

but
that
be
outside
;
that


be
the
view
on
to
the
uninhabited

the

the
dwelling
-
room
,
the

,
be
at
the
back
of
the
house
,
face


inward
between
the
block

look
at
a
scrubby
back
garden
,
and
then


at
the
ash
-
pit
.
and
between
the
row
,
between
the
long
line
of


ash

pit
,
go
the
alley
,
where
the
child
play
and
the
woman


gossip

the
man

so
,
the
actual
condition
of

in
the


bottom
,
that
be
so
well
build
and
that
look
so
nice
,
be
quite


unsavoury
because
people
must
live
in
the
kitchen
,
and
the
kitchen


open
on
to
that
nasty
alley
of
ash

pit

a
kind
of
aristocracy
among
the
other

so
easily
into
comic


grotesque
,
he
be
so
ready

so
pleasant
with
everybody
.
her
own


father

a
rich
fund
of
humour

but
it
be
satiric
.
this
man
’s
be


different
:
soft
,
non
-
intellectual
,
warm
,
a
kind
of
gambolling
.




she
herself
be
opposite
.
she
have
a
curious
,
receptive
mind
which
find


much
pleasure
and
amusement
in
listen
to
other
folk

she
love
idea

be
consider
very


intellectual

what
she
like
most
of
all
be
an
argument
on
religion

philosophy
or
politic
with
some
educate
man
.
this
she
do
not
often


enjoy
.
so
she
always
have
people
tell
she
about
themselves
,
find
she


pleasure
so
.




in
her
person
she
be
rather
small
and
delicate
,
with
a
large
brow
,
and


drop
bunche
of
brown
silk
curl
.

beautiful
hand
of
the
Coppards
.
she


dress
be
always
subdue
.
she
wear
dark
blue
silk
,
with
a
peculiar


silver
chain
of
silver
scallop
.
this
,
and
a
heavy
brooch
of
twisted


gold
,
be
she
only
ornament
.
she
be
still
perfectly
intact
,
deeply


religious
,
and
full
of
beautiful
candour
.




Walter
Morel
seem
melt
away
before
she
.
she
be
to
the
miner
that


thing
of
mystery
and
fascination
,
a
lady
.
when
she
speak
to
he
,
it
be


with
a
southern
pronunciation
and
a
purity
of
English
which
thrill


he
to
hear
.
she
watch
he
.
he
dance
well
,
as
if
it
be
natural
and


joyous
in
he
to
dance
.
his
grandfather
be
a
french
refugee
who
have


marry
an
English
barmaid
—
if
it
have
be
a
marriage
.
Gertrude
Coppard


watch
the
young
miner
as
he
dance
,
a
certain
subtle
exultation
like


glamour
in
his
movement
,
and
his
face
the
flower
of
his
body
,
ruddy
,


with
tumble
black
hair
,
and
laugh
alike
whatever
partner
he
bow


above
.
she
think
he
rather
wonderful
,
never
having
meet
anyone
like


he
.
her
father
be
to
she
the
type
of
all
man
.
and
George
Coppard
,


proud
in
his
bearing
,
handsome
,
and
rather
bitter
;
who
prefer


theology
in
reading
,
and
who
draw
near
in
sympathy
only
to
one
man
,
the


Apostle
Paul
;
who
be
harsh
in
government
,
and
in
familiarity
ironic
;


who
ignore
all
sensuous
pleasure:—he
be
very
different
from
the


miner
.
Gertrude
herself
be
rather
contemptuous
of
dancing
;
she
have
not


the
slight
inclination
towards
that
accomplishment
,
and
have
never


learn
even
a
Roger
de
Coverley
.
she
be
puritan
,
like
her
father
,


high
-
minded
,
and
really
stern
.
therefore
the
dusky
,
golden
softness
of


this
man
’s
sensuous
flame
of
life
,
that
flow
off
his
flesh
like
the


flame
from
a
candle
,
not
baffle
and
grip
into
incandescence
by


thought
and
spirit
as
her
life
be
,
seem
to
she
something
wonderful
,


beyond
she
.




he
come
and
bow
above
she
.
a
warmth
radiate
through
she
as
if
she


have
drunk
wine
.




"
now

this
one

he
say
caressively
.

she
have
tell
he
before
she
could
not
dance
.
she
glance
at
his


humility
and
smile
.
her
smile
be
very
beautiful
.
it
move
the
man
so


that
he
forget
everything

often
do
the
right
thing
by


instinct

sit
beside
she

incline
reverentially
.




"

the
next
Christmas
they

for
three
month
she
be


perfectly
happy
:
for
six
month
she
be
very
happy
.




he
have
sign
the
pledge
,
and
wear
the
blue
ribbon
of
a
tee
-
totaller
:


he
be
nothing
if
not
showy
.
they
live
,
she
think
,
in
his
own
house
.


it
be
small
,
but
convenient
enough
,
and
quite
nicely
furnish
,
with


solid
,
worthy
stuff
that
suit
her
honest
soul
.
the
woman
,
she


neighbour
,
be
rather
foreign
to
she
,
and
Morel
’s
mother
and
sister


be
apt
to
sneer
at
her
ladylike
way
.
but
she
could
perfectly
well


live
by
herself
,
so
long
as
she
have
her
husband
close
.




sometimes
,
when
she
herself
weary
of
love
-
talk
,
she
try
to
open
she


heart
seriously
to
he

he
listen
deferentially
,

without


understanding
.
this
kill
her
effort
at
a
fine
intimacy
,
and
she
have


flash
of
fear
.
sometimes
he
be
restless
of
an
evening
:
it
be
not


enough
for
he
just
to
be
near
she
,
she
realise
.
she
be
glad
when
he


set
himself
to
little
job
.




he
be
a
remarkably
handy
man
—
could
make
or
mend
anything
.
so
she
would


say
:




"
I
do

coal

rake
of

"




she
do
not
mind
the
mess
,
nor
the
hammering
and
noise
.
he
be
busy
and


happy
.




but
in
the
seventh

a
sudden
curiosity

the
newspaper
,
litter
with
curl
,
spread


upon
the
hearthrug
.
at
last
her
husband
gather
it
up
and
put
it
at


the
back
of
the
fire
.
she
go
about
her
work
with
closed
mouth
and


very
quiet
.
Morel
be
subdue
.
he
creep
about
wretchedly
,
and
his
meal


be
a
misery
that
day
.
she
speak
to
he
civilly
,
and
never
allude
to


what
he
have
do
.
but
he
feel
something
final
have
happen
.




afterwards
she
say
she
have
be
silly
,
that
the
boy
’s
hair
would
have


have
to
be
cut
,
soon
or
later
.
in
the
end
,
she
even
bring
herself
to


say
to
her
husband
it
be
just
as
well
he
have
play
barber
when
he


do
.
but
she
know
,
and
Morel
know
,
that
that
act
have
cause
something


momentous
to
take
place
in
her
soul
.
she
remember
the
scene
all
she


life
,
as
one
in
which
she
have
suffer
the
most
intensely
.




this
act
of
masculine
clumsiness
be
the
spear
through
the
side
of
she


love
for
Morel
.
before
,
while
she
have
strive
against
he
bitterly
,
she


have
fret
after
he
,
as
if
he
have
go
astray
from
she
.
now
she


cease
to
fret
for
his
love
:
he
be
an
outsider
to
she
.
this
make
life


much
more
bearable
.




nevertheless
,
she
still
continue
to
strive
with
he
.
she
still
have
she


high
moral
sense
,
inherit
from
generation
of
Puritans
.
it
be
now
a


religious
instinct
,
and
she
be
almost
a
fanatic
with
he
,
because
she


love
he
,
or
have
love
he
.
if
he
sin
,
she
torture
he
.
if
he


drank
,
and
lie
,
be
often
a
poltroon
,
sometimes
a
knave
,
she
wield


the
lash
unmercifully
.




the
pity
be
,
she
be
too
much
his
opposite
.
she
could
not
be
content


with
the
little
he
might
be
;
she
would
have
he
the
much
that
he
ought


to
be
.
so
,
in
seek
to
make
he
noble
than
he
could
be
,
she


destroy
he
.
she
injure
and
hurt
and
scar
herself
,
but
she
lose


none
of
her
worth
.
she
also
have
the
child
.




he
drink
rather
heavily
,
though
not
more
than
many
miner
,
and
always


beer
,
so
that
whilst
his
health
be
affect
,
it
be
never
injure
.
the


week
-
end
be
his
chief
carouse
.
he
sit
in
the
Miners
'
Arms
until


turn
-
out
time
every
Friday
,
every
Saturday
,
and
every
Sunday


evening
.
on
Monday
and
Tuesday
he
have
to
get
up
and
reluctantly
leave


towards
ten
o’clock
.
sometimes
he
stay
at
home
on
Wednesday
and


Thursday
evening
,
or
be
only
out
for
an
hour
.
he
practically
never


have
to
miss
work
owe
to
his
drinking
.




but
although
he
be
very
steady
at
work
,
his
wage
fall
off
.
he
be


blab
-
mouthed
,
a
tongue
-
wagger
.
Authority
be
hateful
to
he
,
therefore


he
could
only
abuse
the
pit
-
manager
.
he
would
say
,
in
the
Palmerston
:




"

"
Morel
be
a
good
mimic
.
he


imitate
the
manager
’s
fat
,
squeaky
voice
,
with
its
attempt
at
good


english
.




"
'

"




so
Morel
would
go
on
to
the
amusement
of
his
boon
companion
.
and
some


of
this
would
be
true
.
the
pit
-
manager
be
not
an
educate
man
.
he
have


be
a
boy
along
with
Morel
,
so
that
,
while
the
two
dislike
each


other
,
they
more
or
less
take
each
other
for
grant
.
but
Alfred


Charlesworth
do
not
forgive
the
butty
these
public
-
house
saying
.


consequently
,
although
Morel
be
a
good
miner
,
sometimes
earn
as


much
as
five
pound
a
week
when
he
marry
,
he
come
gradually
to
have


bad
and
bad
stall
,
where
the
coal
be
thin
,
and
hard
to
get
,
and


unprofitable
.




also
,
in
summer
,
the
pit
be
slack
.
often
,
on
bright
sunny
morning
,


the
man
be
see
troop
home
again
at
ten

eleven
,

twelve
o’clock
.


no
empty
truck
stand
at
the
pit

.
the
woman
on
the
hillside
look


across
as
they
shake
the
hearthrug
against
the
fence
,
and
count
the


wagon
the
engine
be
take
along
the
line
up
the
valley
.
and
the


child
,
as
they
come
from
school
at
dinner
-
time
,
look
down
the


field
and
see
the
wheel
on
the
headstock
stand
,
say
:




"
Minton

my

and
there
be
a
sort
of
shadow
over
all
,
woman
and
child
and
man
,


because
money
will
be
short
at
the

of
the
week
.




Morel
be
suppose
to
give
his

a

,
to
provide


everything

rent
,

,

,

.


occasionally
,

he

thirty

five

these


occasion
by
no

balance
those
when
he
give
she
twenty

five
.
in


winter
,
with
a
decent
stall
,
the
miner
might
earn
fifty
or
fifty
-
five


shilling
a
week
.
then
he
be
happy
.
on
Friday

,
Saturday
,
and


Sunday
,
he
spend
royally
,
get
rid
of
his
sovereign

thereabout
.


and
out
of
so
much
,
he
scarcely
spare
the
child

extra
penny

in
the
bad

more
worrying
,
but
he
be
not
so
often
drunk
,
so
that
Mrs.


Morel
use
to
say
:

Mrs.
Morel
,


sear
with
passion
,
shiver
to
find
herself
out
there
in
a
great


white
light
,
that
fall
cold
on
she
,
and
give
a
shock
to
she
inflame


soul
.
she
stand
for
a
few
moment
helplessly
stare
at
the
glisten


great
rhubarb
leave
near
the
door
.
then
she
get
the
air
into
she


breast
.
she
walk
down
the
garden
path
,
tremble
in
every
limb
,
while


the
child
boil
within
she
.
for
a
while
she
could
not
control
she


consciousness
;
mechanically
she
go
over
the
last
scene
,
then
over
it


again
,
certain
phrase
,
certain
moment
come
each
time
like
a
brand


red
-
hot
down
on
her
soul
;
and
each
time
she
enact
again
the
past


hour
,
each
time
the
brand
come
down
at
the
same
point
,
till
the
mark


be
burn
in
,
and
the
pain
burn
out
,
and
at
last
she
come
to
herself
.


she
must
have
be
half
an
hour
in
this
delirious
condition
.
then
the


presence
of
the
night
come
again
to
she
.
she
glance
round
in
fear
.
she


have
wander
to
the
side
garden
,
where
she
be
walk
up
and
down
the


path
beside
the
currant
bush
under
the
long
wall
.
the
garden
be
a


narrow
strip
,
bound
from
the
road
,
that
cut
transversely
between
the


block
,
by
a
thick
thorn
hedge
.




she
hurry
out
of
the
side
garden
to
the
front
,
where
she
could
stand


as
if
in
an
immense
gulf
of
white
light
,
the
moon
stream
high
in


face
of
she
,
the
moonlight
stand
up
from
the
hill
in
front
,
and


fill
the
valley
where
the
Bottoms
crouch
,
almost
blindingly
.


there
,
panting
and
half
weep
in
reaction
from
the
stress
,
she


murmur
to
herself
over
and
over
again
:
"
the
nuisance
!
the
nuisance
!
"




she
become
aware
of
something
about
she
.
with
an
effort
she
rouse


herself
to
see
what
it
be
that
penetrate
her
consciousness
.
the
tall


white
lily
be
reel
in
the
moonlight
,
and
the
air
be
charge


with
their
perfume
,
as
with
a
presence
.
Mrs.
Morel
gasp
slightly
in


fear
.
she
touch
the
big
,
pallid
flower
on
their
petal
,
then


shiver
.
they
seem
to
be
stretch
in
the
moonlight
.
she
put
she


hand
into
one
white
bin
:
the
gold
scarcely
show
on
her
finger
by


moonlight
.
she
bend
down
to
look
at
the
binful
of
yellow
pollen
;
but
it


only
appear
dusky
.
then
she
drink
a
deep
draught
of
the
scent
.
it


almost
make
she
dizzy
.




Mrs.
Morel
lean
on
the
garden
gate
,
look
out
,
and
she
lose
herself


awhile
.
she
do
not
know
what
she
think
.
except
for
a
slight
feeling


of
sickness
,
and
her
consciousness
in
the
child
,
herself
melt
out


like
scent
into
the
shiny
,
pale
air
.
after
a
time
the
child
,
too
,


melt
with
she
in
the
mixing
-
pot
of
moonlight
,
and
she
rest
with
the


hill
and
lily
and
house
,
all
swum
together
in
a
kind
of
swoon
.




when
she
come
to
herself
she
be
tired
for
sleep
.
languidly
she
look


about
she
;
the
clump
of
white
phlox
seem
like
bush
spread
with


linen
;
a
moth
ricochet
over
they
,
and
right
across
the
garden
.


follow
it
with
her
eye
rouse
she
.
a
few
whiff
of
the
raw
,
strong


scent
of
phlox
invigorate
she
.
she
pass
along
the
path
,
hesitate


at
the
white
rose
-
bush
.
it
smell
sweet
and
simple
.
she
touch
the


white
ruffle
of
the
rose
.
their
fresh
scent
and
cool
,
soft
leave


remind
she
of
the
morning
-
time
and
sunshine
.
she
be
very
fond
of


they
.
but
she
be
tired
,
and
want
to
sleep
.
in
the
mysterious


out
-
of

door
she
feel
forlorn
.




there
be
no
noise
anywhere
.
evidently
the
child
have
not
be


waken
,
or
have
go
to
sleep
again
.
a
train
,

mile
away
,
roar


across
the
valley
.
the
night
be
very
large
,
and
very
strange
,


stretch
its
hoary
distance
infinitely
.
and
out
of
the
silver
-
grey


fog
of
darkness
come
sound
vague
and
hoarse
:
a
corncrake
not
far
off
,


sound
of
a
train
like
a
sigh
,
and
distant
shout
of
man
.




her
quieten
heart
begin
to
beat
quickly
again
,
she
hurry
down


the
side
garden
to
the
back
of
the
house
.
softly
she
lift
the
latch
;


the
door
be
still

,
and
hard
against
she
.
she
rap
gently
,


wait
,
then
rap
again
.
she
must
not
rouse
the
child
,
nor
the


neighbour
.
he
must
be
asleep
,
and
he
would
not
wake
easily
.
her
heart


begin
to
burn
to
be
indoor
.

clung
to
the
door

at
the
window
more
and
more
noisily

would
break
.
still

do
not

up
.




after
vain
effort
,
she
begin
to
shiver
,
partly
from
contact
with
the


stone
,
and
from
exhaustion
.
fearful
always
for
the
unborn
child
,
she


wonder
what
she
could
do
for

and
then
under

the
end


the

,
then
lift
his
face
blindly
.
the
labouring
of


his
heart
hurt
he
into
consciousness
.

rap
imperatively
at
the


window
.

yet


there
be
a
slight
shrinking
,
a
diminishing
in
his
assurance
.


physically
even
,
he
shrink
,
and
his
fine
full
presence
wane
.
he
never

Mrs.
Morel
have
a
visit
every
day
from
the
congregational
clergyman
.
Mr.


Heaton
be
young
,
and
very
poor
.
his
wife
have
die
at
the
birth
of
his


first
baby
,
so
he
remain
alone
in
the
manse
.
he
be
a
Bachelor
of


art
of
Cambridge
,
very
shy
,
and
no
preacher
.
Mrs.
Morel
be
fond
of


he
,
and
he
depend
on
she
.
for
hour
he
talk
to
she
,
when
she
be


well
.
he
become
the
god
-
parent
of
the
child
.




occasionally
the
minister
stay
to
tea
with
Mrs.

.
then
she
lay


the
cloth
early
,
get
out
her
good
cup
,
with
a
little
green
rim
,
and


hope
Morel
would
not
come
too
soon
;
indeed
,
if
he
stay
for
a
pint
,


she
would
not
mind
this
day
.
she
have
always
two
dinner

because
she
believe

their
chief
meal
at
midday
,


whereas
Morel
need
his
at
five
o’clock
.
so
Mr.

would
hold
the


baby
,
whilst
Mrs.

beat
up
a
batter
-
pudding

peel

potato
,
and
he
,
watch
she
all
the
time
,
would
discuss
his
next


sermon
.
his
idea
be
quaint
and
fantastic
.
she
bring
he


judiciously
to
earth
.
it
be
a
discussion
of
the
wedding
at
Cana
.




"
when
he
change
the
water
into
wine
at
Cana
,
"
he
say
,
"
that
be
a


symbol
that
the
ordinary
life
,
even
the
blood
,
of
the
married
husband


and
wife
,
which
have
before
be
uninspired
,
like
water
,
became
fill


with
the

,

spiritual
constitution
of
a

herself
:

down
the
garden
with
the

contain
a
half

crown
,
two

what
she
have
in

your

stew
,
"
he
vow
.
but


they
be
not
to
be
tempt
.




this
time
,
however
,
neither
pill
nor
vitriol
nor
all
his
herb
would


shift
the
"
nasty
peen
in
his
head
"
.
he
be
sicken
for
an
attack
of


an
inflammation
of
the
brain
.
he
have
never
be
well
since
his
sleep


on
the
ground
when
he
go
with
Jerry
to
Nottingham
.
since
then
he
have


drunk
and
storm
.
now
he
fall
seriously
ill
,
and
Mrs.
Morel
have
he
to


nurse
.
he
be
one
of
the
bad
patient
imaginable
.
but
,
in
spite
of


all
,
and
put
aside
the
fact
that
he
be
breadwinner
,
she
never


quite
want
he
to
die
.
still
there
be
one
part
of
she
want
he
for


herself
.




the
neighbour
be
very
good
to
she
:
occasionally
some
have
the


child
in
to
meal
,
occasionally
some
would
do
the
downstairs
work


for
she
,
one
would
mind
the
baby
for
a
day
.
but
it
be
a
great
drag
,


nevertheless
.
it
be
not
every
day
the
neighbour
help
.
then
she
have


nursing
of
baby
and
husband
,
cleaning
and
cooking
,
everything
to
do
.


she
be
quite
worn
out
,
but
she
do
what
be
want
of
she
.




and
the
money
be
just
sufficient
.
she
have
seventeen
shilling
a
week


from
club
,
and
every
Friday
Barker
and
the
other
butty
put
by
a


portion
of
the
stall
’s
profit
for
Morel
’s
wife
.
and
the
neighbour


make
broth
,
and
give
egg
,
and
such
invalid
’
trifle
.
if
they
have
not


help
she
so
generously
in
those
time
,
Mrs.
Morel
would
never
have


pull
through
,
without
incur
debt
that
would
have
drag
she


down
.




the
week
pass
.
Morel
,
almost
against
hope
,
grow
well
.
he
have
a


fine
constitution
,
so
that
,
once
on
the
mend
,
he
go
straight
forward


to
recovery
.
soon
he
be
potter
about
downstairs
.
during
his
illness


his
wife
have
spoil
he
a
little
.
now
he
want
she
to
continue
.
he


often
put
his
band
to
his
head
,
pull
down
the
corner
of
his
mouth
,


and
sham
pain
he
do
not
feel
.
but
there
be
no
deceive
she
.
at


first
she
merely
smile
to
herself
.
then
she
scold
he
sharply
.




"
goodness
,
man
,
do
n’t
be
so
lachrymose
.
"




that
wound
he
slightly
,
but
still
he
continue
to
feign
sickness
.




"
I
would
n’t
be
such
a
mardy
baby
,
"
say
the
wife
shortly
.




then
he
be
indignant
,
and
curse
under
his
breath
,
like
a
boy
.
he
be


force
to
resume
a
normal
tone
,
and
to
cease
to
whine
.




nevertheless
,
there
be
a
state
of
peace
in
the
house
for
some
time
.


Mrs.
Morel
be
more
tolerant
of
he
,
and
he
,
depend
on
she
almost


like
a
child
,
be
rather
happy
.
neither
know
that
she
be
more
tolerant


because
she
love
he
less
.
up
till
this
time
,
in
spite
of
all
,
he
have


be
her
husband
and
her
man
.
she
have
feel
that
,
more
or
less
,
what
he


do
to
himself
he
do
to
she
.
her
living
depend
on
he
.
there
be


many
,
many
stage
in
the
ebbing
of
her
love
for
he
,
but
it
be
always


ebb
.




now
,
with
the
birth
of
this
third
baby
,
her
self
no
long
set
towards


he
,
helplessly
,
but
be
like
a
tide
that
scarcely
rise
,
stand
off


from
he
.
after
this
she
scarcely
desire
he
.
and
,
stand
more
aloof


from
he
,
not
feel
he
so
much
part
of
herself
,
but
merely
part
of


her
circumstance
,
she
do
not
mind
so
much
what
he
do
,
could
leave


he
alone
.




there
be
the
halt
,
the
wistfulness
about
the
ensue
year
,
which
be


like
autumn
in
a
man
’s
life
.
his
wife
be
cast
he
off
,
half


regretfully
,
but
relentlessly
;
cast
he
off
and
turn
now
for
love


and
life
to
the
child
.
henceforward
he
be
more
or
less
a
husk
.
and


he
himself
acquiesce
,
as
so
many
man
do
,
yield
their
place
to
their


child
.




during
his
recuperation
,
when
it
be
really
over
between
they
,
both


make
an
effort
to
come
back
somewhat
to
the
old
relationship
of
the


first
month
of
their
marriage
.
he
sit
at
home
and
,
when
the
child


be
in
bed
,
and
she
be
sew
—
she
do
all
her
sewing
by
hand
,
make


all
shirt
and
child
’s
clothing
—
he
would
read
to
she
from
the


newspaper
,
slowly
pronounce
and
deliver
the
word
like
a
man


pitch
quoit
.
often
she
hurry
he
on
,
give
he
a
phrase
in


anticipation
.
and
then
he
take
her
word
humbly
.




the
silence
between
they
be
peculiar
.
there
would
be
the
swift
,


slight
"
cluck
"
of
her
needle
,
the
sharp
"
pop
"
of
his
lip
as
he
let
out


the
smoke
,
the
warmth
,
the
sizzle
on
the
bar
as
he
spit
in
the
fire
.


then
her
thought
turn
to
William
.
already
he
be
get
a
big
boy
.


already
he
be
top
of
the
class
,
and
the
master
say
he
be
the


smart
lad
in
the
school
.
she
see
he
a
man
,
young
,
full
of
vigour
,


make
the
world
glow
again
for
she
.




and
Morel
sit
there
,
quite
alone
,
and
have
nothing
to
think


about
,
would
be
feel
vaguely
uncomfortable
.
his
soul
would
reach
out


in
its
blind
way
to
she
and
find
she
go
.
he
feel
a
sort
of
emptiness
,


almost
like
a
vacuum
in
his
soul
.
he
be
unsettled
and
restless
.
soon


he
could
not
live
in
that
atmosphere
,
and
he
affect
his
wife
.
both


feel
an
oppression
on
their
breathing
when
they
be
leave
together
for


some
time
.
then
he
go
to
bed
and
she
settle
down
to
enjoy
herself


alone
,
working
,
thinking
,
living
.




meanwhile
another
infant
be
come
,
fruit
of
this
little
peace
and


tenderness
between
the
separate
parent
.
Paul
be
seventeen
month


old
when
the
new
baby
be
bear
.
he
be
then
a
plump
,
pale
child
,
quiet
,


with
heavy
blue
eye
,
and
still
the
peculiar
slight
knitting
of
the


brow
.
the
last
child
be
also
a
boy
,
fair
and
bonny
.
Mrs.
Morel
be


sorry
when
she
know
she
be
with
child
,
both
for
economic
reason
and


because
she
do
not
love
her
husband
;
but
not
for
the
sake
of
the


infant
.




they
call
the
baby
Arthur
.
he
be
very
pretty
,
with
a
mop
of
gold


curl
,
and
he
love
his
father
from
the
first
.
Mrs.
Morel
be
glad
this


child
love
the
father
.
hear
the
miner
’s
footstep
,
the
baby
would


put
up
his
arm
and
crow
.
and
if
Morel
be
in
a
good
temper
,
he
call


back
immediately
,
in
his
hearty
,
mellow
voice
:




"
what
then
,
my
beauty
?
I
sh’ll
come
to
thee
in
a
minute
.
"




and
as
soon
as
he
have
take
off
his
pit
-
coat
,
Mrs.
Morel
would
put
an


apron
round
the
child
,
and
give
he
to
his
father
.




"
what
a
sight
the
lad
look
!
"
she
would
exclaim
sometimes
,
take
back


the
baby
,
that
be
smut
on
the
face
from
his
father
’s
kiss
and


play
.
then
Morel
laugh
joyfully
.




"
he
’
a
little
colly
,
bless
his
bit
o
'
mutton
!
"
he
exclaim
.




and
these
be
the
happy
moment
of
her
life
now
,
when
the
child


include
the
father
in
her
heart
.




meanwhile
William
grow
big
and
strong
and
more
active
,
while
Paul
,


always
rather
delicate
and
quiet
,
get
slim
,
and
trot
after
his


mother
like
her
shadow
.
he
be
usually
active
and
interested
,
but


sometimes
he
would
have
fit
of
depression
.
then
the
mother
would
find


the
boy
of
three
or
four
cry
on
the
sofa
.




"
what
’
the
matter
?
"
she
ask
,
and
get
no
answer
.




"
what
’
the
matter
?
"
she
insist
,
get
cross
.




"
I
do
n’t
know
,
"
sob
the
child
.




so
she
try
to
reason
he
out
of
it
,
or
to
amuse
he
,
but
without


effect
.
it
make
she
feel
beside
herself
.
then
the
father
,
always


impatient
,
would
jump
from
his
chair
and
shout
:




"
if
he
do
n’t
stop
,
I
’ll
smack
he
till
he
do
.
"




"
you
’ll
do
nothing
of
the
sort
,
"
say
the
mother
coldly
.
and
then
she


carry
the
child
into
the
yard
,
plump
he
into
his
little
chair
,
and


say
:
"
now
cry
there
,
Misery
!
"




and
then
a
butterfly
on
the
rhubarb
-
leave
perhaps
catch
his
eye
,
or


at
last
he
cry
himself
to
sleep
.
these
fit
be
not
often
,
but
they


cause
a
shadow
in
Mrs.
Morel
’s
heart
,
and
her
treatment
of
Paul
be


different
from
that
of
the
other
child
.




suddenly
one
morning
as
she

Bottoms

it
be
true

off

.




chapter
IV






 
the
YOUNG
life
of
PAUL




Paul
would
be
build
like
his
mother
,
slightly
and
rather
small
.
his


fair
hair
go
reddish
,
and
then
dark
brown
;
his
eye
be
grey
.
he
be


a
pale
,
quiet
child
,
with
eye
that
seem
to
listen
,
and
with
a
full
,


drop
underlip
.




as
a
rule
he
seem
old
for
his
year
.
he
be
so
conscious
of
what


other
people
feel
,
particularly
his
mother
.
when
she
fret
he


understand
,
and
could
have
no
peace
.
his
soul
seem
always
attentive


to
she
.




as
he
grow
old
he
become
strong
.
William
be
too
far
remove
from


he
to
accept
he
as
a
companion
.
so
the
small
boy
belong
at
first


almost
entirely
to
Annie
.
she
be
a
tomboy
and
a
"
flybie
-
skybie
"
,
as


her
mother
call
she
.
but
she
be
intensely
fond
of
her
second


brother
.
so
Paul
be
tow
round
at
the
heel
of
Annie
,
share
she


game
.
she
race
wildly
at
lerky
with
the
other
young
wild
-
cat
of
the


bottom
.
and
always
Paul
fly
beside
she
,
live
her
share
of
the
game
,


have
as
yet
no
part
of
his
own
.
he
be
quiet
and
not
noticeable
.
but


his
sister
adore
he
.
he
always
seem
to
care
for
thing
if
she


want
he
to
.




she
have
a
big
doll
of
which
she
be
fearfully
proud
,
though
not
so


fond
.
so
she
lay
the
doll
on
the
sofa
,
and
cover
it
with
an


antimacassar
,
to
sleep
.
then
she
forget
it
.
meantime
Paul
must
practise


jump
off
the
sofa
arm
.
so
he
jump
crash
into
the
face
of
the


hide
doll
.
Annie
rush
up
,
utter
a
loud
wail
,
and
sit
down
to
weep


a
dirge
.
Paul
remain
quite
still
.




"
you
could
n’t
tell
it
be
there
,
mother
;
you
could
n’t
tell
it
be


there
,
"
he
repeat
over
and
over
.
so
long
as
Annie
weep
for
the
doll


he
sit
helpless
with
misery
.
her
grief
wear
itself
out
.
she
forgive
she


brother
—
he
be
so
much
upset
.
but
a
day
or
two
afterwards
she
be


shocked
.




"
let
’s
make
a
sacrifice
of
Arabella
,
"
he
say
.
"
let
’s
burn
she
.
"




she
be
horrify
,
yet
rather
fascinated
.
she
want
to
see
what
the


boy
would
do
.
he
make
an
altar
of
brick
,
pull
some
of
the
shaving


out
of
Arabella
’s
body
,
put
the
waxen
fragment
into
the
hollow
face
,


pour
on
a
little
paraffin
,
and
set
the
whole
thing
alight
.
he
watch


with
wicked
satisfaction
the
drop
of
wax
melt
off
the
broken
forehead


of
Arabella
,
and
drop
like
sweat
into
the
flame
.
so
long
as
the
stupid


big
doll
burn
he
rejoice
in
silence
.
at
the
end
he
poke
among
the


ember
with
a
stick
,
fish
out
the
arm
and
leg
,
all
blacken
,
and


smash
they
under
stone
.




"
that
’
the
sacrifice
of
Missis
Arabella
,
"
he
say
.
"
an
'
I
’m
glad


there
’
nothing
leave
of
she
.
"




which
disturb
Annie
inwardly
,
although
she
could
say
nothing
.
he


seem
to
hate
the
doll
so
intensely
,
because
he
have
break
it
.




all
the
child
,
but
particularly
Paul
,
be
peculiarly
_
against
_


their
father
,
along
with
their
mother
.
Morel
continue
to
bully
and
to


drink
.
he
have
period
,
month
at
a
time
,
when
he
make
the
whole
life
of


the
family
a
misery
.
Paul
never
forget
come
home
from
the
Band
of


hope
one
Monday
evening
and
find
his
mother

her

and


discolour
,
his
father
stand
on
the
hearthrug
,
foot
astride
,
his


head

,
and
William
,
just
home
from
work
,
glare
at
his
father
.


there
be
a
silence
as

.
he
wait


until
the
child
be
silent
,
watch
with
child
’s
rage
and
hate
;


then
he
say
:




"

house
on

brow
of
the
hill

a
view
of
the
valley

a
convex
cockle

shell
,
or
a
clamp

huge
old
ash

west
wind
,

from
Derbyshire
,

the
house
with
full
force
,
and
the
tree

again

but
Paul
and
Arthur
and
Annie
hate
it
.
to
Paul
it
become
almost
a


demoniacal
noise
.
the
winter
of
their
first
year
in
the
new
house
their


father
be
very
bad
.
the
child
play
in
the
street
,
on
the
brim
of


the
wide
,
dark
valley
,
until
eight
o’clock
.
then
they
go
to
bed
.


their
mother
sit
sew
below
.
have
such
a
great
space
in
front
of


the
house
give
the
child
a
feeling
of
night
,
of
vastness
,
and
of


terror
.
this
terror
come
in
from
the
shrieking
of
the
tree
and
the


anguish
of
the
home
discord
.
often
Paul
would
wake
up
,
after
he
have


be
asleep
a
long
time
,
aware
of
thud
downstairs
.
instantly
he
be


wide
awake
.
then
he
hear
the
booming
shout
of
his
father
,
come
home


nearly
drunk
,
then
the
sharp
reply
of
his
mother
,
then
the
bang
,
bang


of
his
father
’s
fist
on
the
table
,
and
the
nasty
snarling
shout
as
the


man
’s
voice
get
high
.
and
then
the
whole
be
drown
in
a
pierce


medley
of
shriek
and
cry
from
the
great
,
wind
-
sweep
ash
-
tree
.
the


child
lie
silent
in
suspense
,
wait
for
a
lull
in
the
wind
to
hear


what
their
father
be
do
.
he
might
hit
their
mother
again
.
there
be


a
feeling
of
horror
,
a
kind
of
bristle
in
the
darkness
,
and
a
sense


of
blood
.
they
lie
with
their
heart
in
the
grip
of
an
intense
anguish
.


the
wind
come
through
the
tree
fiercer
and
fiercer
.
all
the
chord
of


the
great
harp
hum
,
whistle
,
and
shriek
.
and
then
come
the
horror


of
the
sudden
silence
,

,
they


hear
their
father
throw
down
his

one
tight
place
of
anxiety
in
their
heart
,

darkness
in
their

and
the
two
last
word
,
shout
in
a
bullying
fashion
,
usually
at


Annie
,
make
the
family
writhe
with
hate
of
the
man
.




he
be
shut
out
from
all
family
affair
.
no
one
tell
he
anything
.
the


child
,
alone
with
their
mother
,
tell
she

but
as
soon
as
the
father
come
in
,
everything


stop
.
he
be
like
the
scotch
in
the
smooth
,
happy
machinery
of
the


home
.
and
he
be
always
aware
of
this
fall
of
silence
on
his
entry
,
the


shut
off
of
life
,
the
unwelcome
.
but
now
it
be
go
too
far
to


alter
.




he
would
dearly
have
like
the
child
to
talk
to
he
,
but
they
could


not
.
sometimes
Mrs.
Morel
would
say
:




"
you
ought
to
tell
your

.
"

.
"




"
all
right
,
"
say
Paul
.
but
he
would
almost
rather
have
forfeit
the


prize
than
have
to
tell
his
father
.




"
I

he
say
.

.




"

"




"

"
and
how
much

and
that
be
all
.
conversation
be
impossible
between
the
father
and


any
other
member
of
the
family
.
he
be
an
outsider
.
he
have
deny
the


God
in
he
.




the
only
time
when
he
enter
again
into
the
life
of
his
own
people


be
when
he
work
,
and
be
happy
at
work
.
sometimes
,
in
the
evening
,


he
cobble
the
boot
or
mend
the
kettle
or
his
pit
-
bottle
.
then
he


always
want
several
attendant
,
and
the
child
enjoy
it
.
they


unite
with
he
in
the
work
,
in
the
actual
doing
of
something
,
when
he


be
his
real
self
again
.




he
be
a
good
workman
,
dexterous
,
and
one
who
,
when
he
be
in
a
good


humour
,
always
sing
.
he
have
whole
period
,
month
,
almost
year
,
of


friction
and
nasty
temper
.
then
sometimes
he
be
jolly
again
.
it
be


nice
to
see
he
run
with
a
piece
of
red
-
hot
iron
into
the
scullery
,


cry
:




"
out
of
my
road
—
out
of
my
road
!
"




then
he
hammer
the
soft
,
red
-
glow
stuff
on
his
iron
goose
,
and


make
the
shape
he
want
.
or
he
sat
absorb
for
a
moment
,
soldering
.


then
the
child
watch
with
joy
as
the
metal
sink
suddenly
molten
,


and
be
shove
about
against
the
nose
of
the
soldering

iron
,
while
the


room
be
full
of
a
scent
of
burn
resin
and
hot
tin
,
and
Morel
be


silent
and
intent
for
a
minute
.
he
always
sing
when
he
mend
boot


because
of
the
jolly
sound
of
hammering
.
and
he
be
rather
happy
when


he
sat
put
great
patch
on
his
moleskin
pit
trouser
,
which
he


would
often
do
,
consider
they
too
dirty
,
and
the
stuff
too
hard
,
for


his
wife
to
mend
.




but
the
good
time
for
the
young
child
be
when
he
make
fuse
.
Morel


fetch
a
sheaf
of
long
sound
wheat

straw
from
the
attic
.
these
he


clean
with
his
hand
,
till
each
one
gleam
like
a
stalk
of
gold
,


after
which
he
cut
the
straw
into
length
of
about
six
inch
,


leave
,
if
he
could
,
a
notch
at
the
bottom
of
each
piece
.
he
always


have
a
beautifully
sharp
knife
that
could
cut
a
straw
clean
without

these
happy
evening
could
not
take
place
unless
Morel
have
some
job
to


do
.
and
then
he
always
go
to
bed
very
early
,
often
before
the


child
.
there
be
nothing
remain
for
he
to
stay
up
for
,
when
he


have
finish
tinker
,
and
have
skim
the
headline
of
the
newspaper
.




and
the
child
feel
secure
when
their
father
be
in
bed
.
they
lie
and


talk
softly
awhile
.
then
they
start
as
the
light
go
suddenly


sprawl
over
the
ceiling
from
the
lamp
that
swing
in
the
hand
of


the
collier
tramp
by
outside
,
go
to
take
the
nine
o’clock
shift
.


they
listen
to
the
voice
of
the
man
,
imagine
they
dip
down
into


the
dark
valley
.
sometimes
they
go
to
the
window
and
watch
the


three
or
four
lamp
grow
tinier
and
tinier
,
sway
down
the
field


in
the
darkness
.
then
it
be
a
joy
to
rush
back
to
bed
and
cuddle


closely
in
the
warmth
.




Paul
be
rather
a
delicate
boy
,
subject
to
bronchitis
.
the
other
be


all
quite
strong
;
so
this
be
another
reason
for
his
mother
’s


difference
in
feeling
for
he
.
one
day
he
come
home
at
dinner
-
time


feel
ill
.
but
it
be
not
a
family
to
make
any
fuss
.




"
what
’
the
matter
with
_
you
?
_
"
his
mother
ask
sharply
.




"
nothing
,
"
he
reply
.




but
he
eat
no
dinner
.




"
if
you
eat
no
dinner
,
you
’re
not
go
to
school
,
"
she
say
.




"
why
?
"
he
ask
.




"
that
’
why
.
"




so
after
dinner
he
lie
down
on
the
sofa
,
on
the
warm
chintz
cushion


the
child
love
.
then
he
fall
into
a
kind
of
doze
.
that
afternoon


Mrs.
Morel
be
iron
.
she
listen
to
the
small
,
restless
noise
the


boy
make
in
his
throat
as
she
work
.
again
rise
in
her
heart
the
old
,


almost
weary
feeling
towards
he
.
she
have
never
expect
he
to
live
.


and
yet
he
have
a
great
vitality
in
his
young
body
.
perhaps
it
would


have
be
a
little
relief
to
she
if
he
have
die
.
she
always
feel
a


mixture
of
anguish
in
her
love
for
he
.




he
,
in
his
semi
-
conscious
sleep
,
be
vaguely
aware
of
the
clatter
of


the
iron
on
the
iron
-
stand
,
of
the
faint
thud
,
thud
on
the


ironing
-
board
.
once
rouse
,
he
open
his
eye
to
see
his
mother


stand
on
the
hearthrug
with
the
hot
iron
near
her
cheek
,
listen
,


as
it
be
,
to
the
heat
.
she
still
face
,
with
the
mouth
close
tight


from
suffering
and
disillusion
and
self
-
denial
,
and
her
nose
the


small
bit
on
one
side
,
and
her
blue
eye
so
young
,
quick
,
and
warm
,


make
his
heart
contract
with
love
.
when
she
be
quiet
,
so
,
she
look


brave
and
rich
with
life
,
but
as
if
she
have
be
do
out
of
she


right
.
it
hurt
the
boy
keenly
,
this
feeling
about
she
that
she
have


never
have
her
life
’s
fulfilment
:
and
his
own
incapability
to
make
up
to


her
hurt
he
with
a
sense
of
impotence
,
yet
make
he
patiently
dog


inside
.
it
be
his
childish
aim
.




she
spit
on
the
iron
,
and
a
little
ball
of
spit
bound
,
race
off
the


dark
,
glossy
surface
.
then
,
kneel
,
she
rub
the
iron
on
the
sack


lining
of
the
hearthrug
vigorously
.
she
be
warm
in
the
ruddy


firelight
.
Paul
love
the
way
she
crouch
and
put
her
head
on
one


side
.
her
movement
be
light
and
quick
.
it
be
always
a
pleasure
to


watch
she
.
nothing
she
ever
do
,
no
movement
she
ever
make
,
could
have


be
find
fault
with
by
her
child
.
the
room
be
warm
and
full
of


the
scent
of
hot
linen
.
later
on
the
clergyman
come
and
talk
softly


with
she
.




Paul
be

up
with
an
attack
of
bronchitis

not

much
.


what
happen
happen
,
and
it
be
no
good
kicking
against
the
prick
.


he
love
the
evening
,
after
eight
o’clock
,
when
the
light
be
put
out
,


and
he
could
watch
the
fire
-
flame
spring
over
the
darkness
of
the


wall
and
ceiling
;
could
watch
huge
shadow
wave
and
toss
,
till


the
room
seem
full
of
man
who

come
into

he
be


always
very
gentle
if
anyone
be
ill
.
but
he
disturb
the
atmosphere


for

profound
sleep
that


seem
to
give
her
faith

in
convalescence
he
would
sit
up
in
bed
,
see
the
fluffy
horse
feed


at
the
troughs
in
the
field

the


snowflake

round
the
corner
of
the

doubtfully


over
the
great
whiteness

while
they
be
so
poor
,
the
child
be
delighted
if
they
could
do


anything
to
help
economically
.
Annie
and
Paul
and
Arthur
go
out
early


in
the
morning
,
in
summer
,
look
for
mushroom
,
hunt
through
the


wet
grass
,
from
which
the
lark
be
rise
,
for
the
white
-
skinned
,


wonderful
naked
body
crouch
secretly
in
the
green
.
and
if
they
get


half
a
pound
they
feel
exceedingly
happy
:
there
be
the
joy
of
find


something
,
the
joy
of
accept
something
straight
from
the
hand
of


nature
,
and
the
joy
of
contribute
to
the
family
exchequer
.




but
the
most
important
harvest
,
after
glean
for
frumenty
,
be
the


blackberry
.
Mrs.
Morel
must
buy
fruit
for
pudding
on
the
Saturdays
;


also
she
like
blackberry
.
so
Paul
and
Arthur
scour
the
coppice


and
wood
and
old
quarry
,
so
long
as
a
blackberry
be
to
be
find
,


every
week

end
go
on
their

.
in
that
region
of
mining
village


blackberry
become
a
comparative
rarity
.
but
Paul
hunt
far
and
wide
.


he
love
be
out
in
the
country
,
among
the
bush
.
but
he
also
could


not
bear
to
go
home
to
his
mother
empty
.
that
,
he
feel
,
would


disappoint
she
,
and
he
would
have
die
rather
.




"
good
gracious
!
"
she
would
exclaim
as
the
lad
come
in
,
late
,
and
tired


to
death
,
and
hungry
,
"
wherever

you
be

"




"
well

reply
Paul
,
"

so

go
over
Misk
Hills
.


and
look

,
our
mother
!
"




she
peep
into
the
basket
.




"
now
,
those
be
fine
one

"
she
exclaim
.




"
and
there
’
over

—
isn’t
there
over

"
?




she
try
the
basket
.




"
yes
,
"
she
answer
doubtfully
.




then
Paul
fish
out
a
little
spray
.
he
always
bring
she
one
spray
,


the
good
he
could
find
.




"
Pretty
!
"
she
say
,
in
a
curious
tone
,
of
a
woman
accept
a


love
-
token
.




the
boy
walk
all
day
,
go
mile
and
mile
,
rather
than
own
himself


beat
and
come
home
to
her
empty
-
handed
.
she
never
realise
this
,


whilst
he
be
young
.
she
be
a
woman
who
wait
for
her
child
to


grow
up
.
and
William
occupy
she
chiefly
.




but
when
William
go
to
Nottingham
,
and
be
not
so
much
at
home
,
the


mother
make
a
companion
of
Paul
.
the
latter
be
unconsciously
jealous


of
his
brother
,
and
William
be
jealous
of
he
.
at
the
same
time
,
they


be
good
friend
.




Mrs.
Morel
’s
intimacy
with
her
second
son
be
more
subtle
and
fine
,


perhaps
not
so
passionate
as
with
her
eld
.
it
be
the
rule
that
Paul


should
fetch
the
money
on
Friday
afternoon
.
the
collier
of
the
five

be
pay
on
Fridays
,
but
not
individually
.
all
the
earning
of


each

be
put
down
to
the
chief
butty
,
as
contractor
,
and
he


divide
the
wage
again
,
either
in
the
public
-
house
or
in
his
own
home
.


so
that
the
child
could
fetch
the
money

on


Friday
afternoon
.
each

afternoon
,
until
they
go


themselves
to

occasionally
somebody
come

of

road
over
the


hilltop
,
steadily
,
like
a
great
bird

and
he
think
of
the
Bible
,
that


the
moon
should
be
turn
to
blood
.
and
the
next
day
he
make
haste
to


be

the
man

he
use
to
say
to
his
mother
with
joy
.


they
learn
how
perfectly
peaceful
the
home
could
be
.
and
they
almost


regret
—
though
none
of
they
would
have
own
to
such
callousness
—
that


their
father
be
soon

Paul
be
now
fourteen
,

be
look
for
work

he
be
a
rather
small


and
rather
finely
-
make
boy
,
with
dark
brown
hair
and
light
blue
eye
.


his
face
have
already
lose
its
youthful
chubbiness
,
and
be
become


somewhat
like
William’s
—
rough
-
feature
,
almost
rugged
—
and
it
be


extraordinarily
mobile
.
usually
he
look
as
if
he
see
thing
,
be
full


of
life
,
and
warm
;
then
his
smile
,
like
his
mother
’s
,
come
suddenly
and


be
very
lovable
;
and
then
,
when
there
be
any
clog
in
his
soul
’s
quick


run
,
his
face
go
stupid
and
ugly
.
he
be
the
sort
of
boy
that


become
a
clown
and
a
lout
as
soon
as
he
be
not
understand
,
or
feel


himself
hold
cheap
;
and
,
again
,
be
adorable
at
the
first
touch
of


warmth
.




he
suffer
very
much
from
the
first
contact
with
anything
.
when
he
be


seven
,
the
starting
school
have
be
a
nightmare
and
a
torture
to
he
.


but
afterwards
he
like
it
.
and
now
that
he
feel
he
have
to
go
out
into


life
,
he
go
through
agony
of
shrink
self
-
consciousness
.
he
be


quite
a
clever
painter
for
a
boy
of
his
year
,
and
he
know
some
french


and
german
and
mathematic
that
Mr.
Heaton
have
teach
he
.
but
nothing


he
have
be
of
any
commercial
value
.
he
be
not
strong
enough
for
heavy


manual
work
,
his
mother
say
.
he
do
not
care
for
make
thing
with


his
hand
,
preferred
racing
about
,
or
make
excursion
into
the


country
,
or
read
,
or
painting
.




"
what
do
you
want
to
be
?
"
his
mother
ask
.




"
anything
.
"




"
that
be
no
answer
,
"
say
Mrs.
Morel
.




but
it
be
quite
truthfully
the
only
answer
he
could
give
.
his


ambition
,
as
far
as
this
world
’s
gear
go
,
be
quietly
to
earn
his


thirty
or
thirty
-
five
shilling
a
week
somewhere
near
home
,
and
then
,


when
his
father
die
,
have
a
cottage
with
his
mother
,
paint
and
go
out


as
he
like
,
and
live
happy
ever
after
.
that
be
his
programme
as
far


as
do
thing
go
.
but
he
be
proud
within
himself
,
measure
people


against
himself
,
and
place
they
,
inexorably
.
and
he
think
that


_
perhaps
_
he
might
also
make
a
painter
,
the
real
thing
.
but
that
he


leave
alone
.




"
then
,
"
say
his
mother
,
"
you
must
look
in
the
paper
for
the


advertisement
.
"




he
look
at
she
.
it
seem
to
he
a
bitter
humiliation
and
an
anguish


to
go
through
.
but
he
say
nothing
.
when
he
get
up
in
the
morning
,
his


whole
being
be
knot
up
over
this
one
think
:




"
I
’ve
get
to
go
and
look
for
advertisement
for
a
job
.
"




it
stand
in
front
of
the
morning
,
that
think
,
kill
all
joy
and


even
life
,
for
he
.
his
heart
feel
like
a
tight
knot
.




and
then
,
at
ten
o’clock
,
he
set
off
.
he
be
suppose
to
be
a
queer
,


quiet
child
.
go
up
the
sunny
street
of
the
little
town
,
he
feel
as


if
all
the
folk
he
meet
say
to
themselves
:
"
he
’s
go
to
the
co
-
op
.


reading
-
room
to
look
in
the
paper
for
a
place
.
he
ca
n’t
get
a
job
.
I


suppose
he
’s
live
on
his
mother
.
"
then
he
creep
up
the
stone
stair


behind
the
drapery
shop
at
the
co
-
op
.
,
and
peep
in
the
reading

room
.


usually
one
or
two

be
there
,
either
old
,
useless
fellow
,
or


collier
"
on
the
club
"
.
so
he
enter
,
full
of
shrink
and
suffer


when
they
look
up
,
seat
himself
at
the
table
,
and
pretend
to
scan


the
news
.
he
know
they
would
think
:

thirteen

and
he
suffer
.




then
he
look
wistfully
out
of
the
window
.
already
he

do
all
thing
well
,


get
into
a
fever
of
impatience
.




the
eld
brother
be
become
quite
swanky
.
in
London
he
find
that
he


could
associate
with
man
far
above
his
Bestwood
friend
in
station
.


some
of
the
clerk
in
the
office
have
study
for
the
law
,
and
be
more


or
less
go
through
a
kind
of
apprenticeship
.
William
always
make


friend
among
man
wherever
he
go
,
he
be
so
jolly
.
therefore
he
be


soon
visit
and
stay
in
house
of
man
who
,
in
Bestwood
,
would
have


look
down
on
the
unapproachable
bank
manager
,
and
would
merely
have


call
indifferently
on
the
Rector
.
so
he
begin
to
fancy
himself
as
a


great
gun
.
he
be
,
indeed
,
rather
surprised
at
the
ease
with
which
he


become
a
gentleman
.




his
mother
be
glad
,
he
seem
so
pleased
.
and
his
lodge
in


Walthamstow
be
so
dreary
.
but
now
there
seem
to
come
a
kind
of
fever


into
the
young
man
’s
letter
.
he
be
unsettle
by
all
the
change
,
he


do
not
stand
firm
on
his
own
foot
,
but
seem
to
spin
rather
giddily


on
the
quick
current
of
the
new
life
.
his
mother
be
anxious
for
he
.


she
could
feel
he
lose
himself
.
he
have
dance
and
go
to
the


theatre
,
boat
on
the
river
,
be
out
with
friend
;
and
she
know
he


sit
up
afterwards
in
his
cold
bedroom
grind
away
at
Latin
,
because


he
intend
to
get
on
in
his
office
,
and
in
the
law
as
much
as
he


could
.
he
never
send
his
mother
any
money
now
.
it
be
all
take
,
the


little
he
have
,
for
his
own
life
.
and
she
do
not
want
any
,
except


sometimes
,
when
she
be
in
a
tight
corner
,
and
when
ten
shilling
would


have
save
her
much
worry
.
she
still
dream
of
William
,
and
of
what
he


would
do
,
with
herself
behind
he
.
never
for
a
minute
would
she
admit


to
herself
how
heavy
and
anxious
her
heart
be
because
of
he
.




also
he
talk
a
good
deal
now
of
a
girl
he
have
meet
at
a
dance
,
a


handsome
brunette
,
quite
young
,
and
a
lady
,
after
whom
the
man
be


run
thick
and
fast
.




"
I
wonder
if
you
would
run
,
my
boy
,

his
mother
write
to
he
,

you
see
all

feel
safe
enough

shrank
,
do
not
seem


to

bad
,

somewhat
disgusting
.
when

crucial
stage
of

of


satisfaction

,
while


they
be
so
irritably
sensitive
at
the
age

elderly

then
,
sometimes
,
the
father
would
seem
to
feel
the
contemptuous
hatred


of
his
child
.




"

not

do
his
good
for

for
the
threat

the
fact
that
he
do
not
try
so
hard
as
he


imagine
,
they
would
have
feel
sorry
.
as
it
be
,
the
battle
now
go
on


nearly
all
between
father
and
child
,
he
persist
in
his
dirty

disgusting
way
,
just
to
assert
his
independence

condescend
at
first
.
and
Miriam
also
refuse
to
be
approach
.
she
be


afraid
of
be
set
at
nought
,
as
by
her
own
brother
.
the
girl
be


romantic
in
her
soul
.
everywhere
be
a
Walter
Scott
heroine
be
love


by
man
with
helmet
or
with
plume
in
their
cap
.
she
herself
be


something
of
a
princess
turn
into
a
swine
-
girl
in
her
own


imagination
.
and
she
be
afraid
lest
this
boy
,
who
,
nevertheless
,


look
something
like
a
Walter

hero
,
who
could
paint
and
speak


french
,
and
know
what
algebra
mean
,
and
who
go
by
train
to


Nottingham
every
day
,
might
consider
she
simply
as
the
swine
-
girl
,


unable
to
perceive
the
princess
beneath
;
so
she
hold
aloof
.




her
great
companion
be
her
mother
.
they
be
both
brown
-
eyed
,
and


inclined
to
be
mystical
,
such
woman
as
treasure
religion
inside
they
,


breathe
it
in
their
nostril
,
and
see
the
whole
of
life
in
a
mist


thereof
.
so
to
Miriam
,
Christ
and
God
make
one
great
figure
,
which
she


love
tremblingly
and
passionately
when
a
tremendous
sunset
burn
out


the
western
sky
,
and
edith
,
and
Lucys
,
and
Rowenas
,
Brian
de
Bois


guilbert
,
Rob
Roys
,
and
Guy
Mannerings
,
rustle
the
sunny
leave
in


the
morning
,
or
sit
in
her
bedroom
aloft
,
alone
,
when
it
snow
.
that


be
life
to
she
.
for
the
rest
,
she
drudge
in
the
house
,
which
work
she


would
not
have
mind
have
not
her
clean
red
floor
be
muck
up


immediately
by
the
trample
farm
-
boot
of
her
brother
.
she
madly


want
her
little
brother
of
four
to
let
she
swathe
he
and
stifle
he


in
her
love
;
she
go
to
church
reverently
,
with
bow
head
,
and


quiver
in
anguish
from
the
vulgarity
of
the
other
choir
-
girl
and


from
the
common
-
sound
voice
of
the
curate
;
she
fight
with
she


brother
,
whom
she
consider
brutal
lout
;
and
she
hold
not
her
father


in
too
high
esteem
because
he
do
not
carry
any
mystical
ideal


cherish
in
his
heart
,
but
only
want
to
have
as
easy
a
time
as
he


could
,
and
his
meal
when
he
be
ready
for
they
.




she
hate
her
position
as
swine
-
girl
.
she
want
to
be
consider
.
she


want
to
learn
,
think
that
if
she
could
read
,
as
Paul
say
he
could


read
,
"
Colomba
"
,
or
the
"
voyage
autour
de
ma
Chambre
"
,
the
world
would


have
a
different
face
for
she
and
a
deepened
respect
.
she
could
not
be


princess
by
wealth
or
standing
.
so
she
be
mad
to
have
learn
whereon


to
pride
herself
.
for
she
be
different
from
other
folk
,
and
must
not


be
scoop
up
among
the
common
fry
.
learning
be
the
only
distinction


to
which
she
think
to
aspire
.




her
beauty
—
that
of
a
shy
,
wild
,
quiveringly
sensitive
thing
—
seem


nothing
to
she
.
even
her
soul
,
so
strong
for
rhapsody
,
be
not
enough
.


she
must
have
something
to
reinforce
her
pride
,
because
she
feel


different
from
other
people
.
Paul
she
eye
rather
wistfully
.
on
the


whole
,
she
scorn
the
male
sex
.
but
here
be
a
new
speciman
,
quick
,


light
,
graceful
,
who
could
be
gentle
and
who
could
be
sad
,
and
who
be


clever
,
and
who
know
a
lot
,
and
who
have
a
death
in
the
family
.
the


boy
’s
poor
morsel
of
learning
exalt
he
almost
sky
-
high
in
she


esteem
.
yet
she
try
hard
to
scorn
he
,
because
he
would
not
see
in


her
the
princess
but
only
the
swine
-
girl
.
and
he
scarcely
observe
she
.




then
he
be
so
ill
,
and
she
feel
he
would
be
weak
.
then
she
would
be


strong
than
he
.
then
she
could
love
he
.
if
she
could
be
mistress
of


he
in
his
weakness
,
take
care
of
he
,
if
he
could
depend
on
she
,
if


she
could
,
as
it
be
,
have
he
in
her
arm
,
how
she
would
love
he

pale
and
thin
,
but
his
eye
be
quick
and


bright
with
life
as
ever
.
he
watch
the
strange
,
almost
rhapsodic
way


in
which
the

move
about
,
carry
a
great
stew
-
jar
to
the
oven

in

the

different
from
that
of


his

if
something
have
come
break
in
on
her

there
be
a


sense
of
silence
inside

out
.
Miriam
seem
as
in
some


dreamy
tale
,
a
maiden
in
bondage
,
her
spirit
dream
in
a
land
far


away
and
magical
.
and
her
discolour
,
old
blue
frock
and
her
break


boot
seem
only
like
the
romantic
rag
of
King
Cophetua
’s


beggar
-
maid
.




she
suddenly
become
aware
of
his
keen
blue
eye
upon
she
,
take
she


all
in
.
instantly
her
broken
boot

the
brutal

it
puzzle
Paul

wonder
vaguely
why
all
this
intense
feeling
go


run
because
of

the

exalt


everything
—
even
a
bit
of
housework
—
to
the
plane
of
a
religious
trust
.


the
son
resent
this
;
they
feel
themselves
cut
away
underneath
,
and


they
answer
with
brutality
and
also
with
a
sneer
superciliousness
.




Paul
be
just
open
out
from
childhood
into
manhood

this
atmosphere
,


where
everything
take
a
religious
value
,
come
with
a
subtle
fascination


to
he
.
there
be
something
in
the
air
.
his
own
mother
be
logical
.


here
there
be
something
different
,
something
he
love
,
something
that


at
time
he
hate
.




Miriam
quarrel
with
her
brother
fiercely
.
later
in
the
afternoon
,


when
they
have
go
away
again
,
her
mother
say
:




"

flash


eye

the

"

so
hateful

cry
Miriam

"
and
—
and
_
low
_
.
"




"
yes

be


you
so
weak

you

"




Mrs.
Leivers
stick
unflinchingly
to
this
doctrine
of
"
the
other
cheek
"
.


she
could
not
instil
it
at
all
into
the
boy
.
with
the
girl
she


succeed
well
,
and
Miriam
be
the
child
of
her
heart
.
the
boy


loathe
the
other
cheek
when
it
be
present
to
they
.
Miriam
be
often


sufficiently
lofty
to
turn
it
.
then
they
spit
on
she
and
hate
she
.
but


she
walk
in
her
proud
humility
,
live
within
herself
.




there
be
always
this
feeling
of
jangle
and
discord
in
the
Leivers


family
.
although
the
boy
resent
so
bitterly
this
eternal
appeal
to


their
deep
feeling
of
resignation
and
proud
humility
,
yet
it
have
its


effect
on
they
.
they
could
not
establish
between
themselves
and
an


outsider
just
the
ordinary
human
feeling
and
unexaggerated
friendship
;


they
be
always
restless
for
the
something
deep
.
ordinary
folk


seem
shallow
to
they
,
trivial
and
inconsiderable
.
and
so
they
be


unaccustomed
,
painfully
uncouth
in
the
simple
social
intercourse
,


suffering
,
and
yet
insolent
in
their
superiority
.
then
beneath
be
the


yearn
for
the
soul
-
intimacy
to
which
they
could
not
attain
because


they
be
too
dumb
,
and
every
approach
to
close
connection
be
block


by
their
clumsy
contempt
of
other
people
.
they
want
genuine
intimacy
,


but
they
could
not
get
even
normally
near
to
anyone
,
because
they


scorn
to
take
the
first
step
,
they
scorn
the
triviality
which


form
common
human
intercourse
.




Paul
fall
under
Mrs.
Leivers
’s
spell
.
everything
have
a
religious
and


intensify
meaning
when
he
be
with
she
.
his
soul
,
hurt
,
highly


develop
,
seek
she
as
if
for
nourishment
.
together
they
seem
to


sift
the
vital
fact
from
an
experience
.




Miriam
be
her
mother
’s
daughter
.
in
the
sunshine
of
the
afternoon


mother
and
daughter
go
down
the
field
with
he
.
they
look
for


nest
.
there
be
a
jenny
wren
’s
in
the
hedge
by
the
orchard
.




"
I
_
do
_
want
you
to
see
this
,
"
say
Mrs.
Leivers
.




he
crouch
down
and
carefully
put
his
finger
through
the
thorn
into


the
round
door
of
the
nest
.




"
it
’
almost
as
if
you
be
feel
inside
the
live
body
of
the
bird
,
"


he
say
,
"
it
’
so
warm
.
they
say
a
bird
make
its
nest
round
like
a
cup


with
press
its
breast
on
it
.
then
how
do
it
make
the
ceiling
round
,


I
wonder
?
"




the
nest
seem
to
start
into
life
for
the
two
woman
.
after
that
,


Miriam
come
to
see
it
every
day
.
it
seem
so
close
to
she
.
again
,


go
down
the
hedgeside
with
the
girl
,
he
notice
the
celandine
,


scallop
splash
of
gold
,
on
the
side
of
the
ditch

themselves
at

"




and
then
the

Anthropomorphic
as
she

she
stimulate

into
appreciate

thus
,

then
they
live
for
she
.
she
seem
to
need
thing
kindle


in
her
imagination

in
her

before
she

and
she


be
cut
off
from
ordinary
life
by
her
religious
intensity
which
make


the
world
for
she
either
a

a

,
where
sin
and


knowledge
be
not
,
or
else
an
ugly
,
cruel
thing
.




so
it
be
in
this
atmosphere
of
subtle
intimacy
,
this
meeting
in
their


common
feeling
for
something
in
Nature
,
that
their
love
start
.

ten
month


he
have
to
stay
at

a
while

with
his
mother
,
and
be
perfectly
happy
.

even
from
the


seaside
he
write
long
letter
to
Mrs.
Leivers
about
the
shore
and
the


sea
.
and
he
bring
back
his
beloved
sketch
of
the
flat
Lincoln


coast
,
anxious
for
they
to
see
.
almost
they
would
interest
the
Leivers


more
than
they
interest
his
mother
.
it
be
not
his
art
Mrs.
Morel


care
about
;
it
be
himself
and
his
achievement
.
but
Mrs.
Leivers
and


her
child
be
almost
his
disciple
.
they
kindle
he
and
make
he


glow
to
his
work
,
whereas
his
mother
’s
influence
be
to
make
he


quietly
determine
,
patient
,
dog
,
unwearied
.




he
soon
be
friend
with
the
boy
,
whose
rudeness
be
only
superficial
.


they
have
all
,
when
they
could
trust
themselves
,
a
strange
gentleness


and
lovableness
.




"

out

book

long
over
the

would
look
up
at

her
dark
eye
alight
like


water
that
shake
with
a
stream
of
gold
in
the
dark
,

would
ask
:




"
why
do
I
like
this
so

always
something
in
his
breast

from
these

"
it
’
because

it
’
because
there
be

any
shadow
in
it

it
’


more
shimmery

as
if
I
’d
paint
the
shimmering
protoplasm
in
the


leave
and
everywhere

not
the
stiffness
of
the
shape
.
that
seem


dead
to
I
.
only
this
shimmeriness
be
the
real

and
she
,
with
her
little
finger
in

,
apologetic
,
ashamed
.
then

.




"

,
peck
into
lace
by
the
fowl
,
and
he
want

over
the
book
,


seem

at
the
same
instant
he
grow
gentle
,
see
her
hurt


because
she
do
not
understand
.




but
thing
come
slowly
to
she
.
and
when
she
hold
herself
in
a
grip
,


seem
so
utterly
humble
before
the
lesson
,

make
his
blood

.
he


storm
at
she

.

,
throw

cigarette
.
then
,
after

while
,

lesson

soul

ca
n’t
you
look
at
it
with
your


clear
simple
wit
?
"




often
,
when
he
go
again
into
the
kitchen
,
Mrs.
Leivers
would
look
at


he
reproachfully
,
say
:




"
Paul
,
do
n’t
be
so
hard
on
Miriam

she
may
not
be

but
I
’m
sure


she
try
.
"




"
I
ca
n’t
help
it
,
"
he
say
rather
pitiably
.
"
I
go
off
like
it
.
"




"
you
do
n’t
mind
I
,
Miriam
,
do
you
?
"
he
ask
of
the
girl
later
.




"
no
,
"
she
reassure
he
in
her
beautiful
deep
tones—“no

I
do
n’t

"




"

"




but
,
in
spite
of
himself
,
his
blood
begin
to
boil
with
she
.
it
be


strange
that
no
one
else
make
he
in
such
fury
.
he
flare
against
she
.


once
he
throw
the
pencil
in
her
face
.
there
be
a
silence
.
she
turn


her
face
slightly
aside
.




"
I
do
n’t
—
"
he
begin
,
but
get
no
far
,
feel
weak
in
all
his


bone
.
she
never
reproach
he
or
be
angry
with
he
.
he
be
often


cruelly
ashamed
.
but
still
again
his
anger
burst
like
a
bubble


surcharge
;
and
still
,
when
he
see
her
eager
,
silent
,
as
it
be
,
blind


face
,
he
feel
he
want
to
throw
the
pencil
in
it
;
and
still
,
when
he


see
her
hand
tremble
and
her
mouth
part
with
suffering
,
his
heart


be
scald
with
pain
for
she
.
and
because
of
the
intensity
to
which


she
rouse
he
,
he
seek
she
.




then
he
often
avoid
she
and
go
with
Edgar
.
Miriam
and
her
brother


be
naturally
antagonistic
.
Edgar
be
a
rationalist
,
who
be
curious
,


and
have
a
sort
of
scientific
interest
in
life
.
it
be
a
great


bitterness
to
Miriam
to
see
herself
desert
by
Paul
for
Edgar
,
who


seem
so
much
low
.
but
the
youth
be
very
happy
with
her
elder


brother
.
the
two
man
spend
afternoon
together
on
the
land
or
in
the


loft
do
carpentry
,
when
it
rain
.
and
they
talk
together
,
or
Paul


teach
Edgar
the
song
he
himself
have
learn
from
Annie
at
the
piano
.


and
often
all
the
man
,
Mr.
Leivers
as
well
,
have
bitter
debate
on
the


nationalize
of
the
land
and
similar
problem
.
Paul
have
already
hear


his
mother
’s
view
,
and
as
these
be
as
yet
his
own
,
he
argue
for


she
.
Miriam
attend
and
take
part
,
but
be
all
the
time
wait
until


it
should
be
over
and
a
personal
communication
might
begin
.




"
after
all
,
"
she
say
within
herself
,
"
if
the
land
be
nationalise
,


Edgar
and
Paul
and
I
would
be
just
the
same
.
"
so
she
wait
for
the


youth
to
come
back
to
she
.




he
be
study
for
his
painting
.
he
love
to
sit
at
home
,
alone
with


his
mother
,
at
night
,
work
and
work
.
she
sew
or
read
.
then
,


look
up
from
his
task
,
he
would
rest
his
eye
for
a
moment
on
she


face
,
that
be
bright
with
living
warmth
,
and
he
return
gladly
to
his


work
.




"
I
can
do
my
good
thing
when
you
sit
there
in
your
rocking
-
chair
,


mother
,
"
he
say
.




"
I
’m
sure
!
"
she
exclaim
,
sniff
with
mock
scepticism
.
but
she
feel


it
be
so
,
and
her
heart
quiver
with
brightness
.
for
many
hour
she


sit
still
,
slightly
conscious
of
he
labour
away
,
whilst
she
work


or
read
her
book
.
and
he
,
with
all
his
soul
’s
intensity
direct
his


pencil
,
could
feel
her
warmth
inside
he
like
strength
.
they
be
both


very
happy
so
,
and
both
unconscious
of
it
.
these
time
,
that
mean
so


much
,
and
which
be
real
living
,
they
almost
ignore
.




he
be
conscious
only
when
stimulate
.
a
sketch
finish
,
he
always


want
to
take
it
to
Miriam
.
then
he
be
stimulate
into
knowledge
of


the
work
he
have

unconsciously
.
in
contact
with
Miriam
he


gain
insight
;
his
vision
go
deeply
.
from
his
mother
he
draw
the


life
-
warmth
,
the
strength
to
produce
;
Miriam
urge
this
warmth
into


intensity
like
a
white
light
.




when
he
return
to
the
factory
the
condition
of

.
he

gradually
,

gold
in
the
west
sink
down
to

and


then
the
chill
blue
creep
up
against
the
glow
.




they
come
out
upon
the
high

of


the
pit
,
stand
in
black
silhouette
small
against
the

.




he
look
at
his

.




"

nibble
pasture
in
the
dusk
.
there
be
a


coolness
in
the
wood
,
a
scent
of
leave
,
of

,
and
a


twilight
.
the
two

wonderfully
there
,


among

it
,
she

.
almost
passionately
she
want
to

before
the
flower
.
they

to
have
a


communion
together
—
something

something
holy
.
he
be

in
silence
.
they

edge
of
the
wood
,
they
see

he
think
he
be

sane
for
such

the
man
do
all
the


discuss
of
farm
matter
outside

,
perhaps
,
because
of
the


continual
business
of
birth
and
of
begetting
which
go
on
upon
every


farm

the
more
hypersensitive
to

at

calm
.
the
young
folk

in
rapture

they
go
in
trepidation
,


almost
afraid

delight
of

tyre
of


the
wheel
brilliant
with
gold
-
red
rust

be
very
still
.




all
eagerly
pay
their
sixpence
,
and
go
timidly
through
the
fine


clean
arch
of
the
inner
courtyard
.
they
be
shy
.
here
on
the
pavement
,


where
the
hall

old
thorn

one
tall
tower
in
a
corner
,

tottering
,
where

"

Miriam
in
a
low
voice
,
as

"
if

through
the
loophole
,
go
rush
up
the
shaft
,
and
fill
the
girl
’s


skirt
like
a
balloon
,
so
that
she
be
ashamed
,
until

of
her
dress
and
hold
it
down
for
she
.
he

perfectly
simply
,

would
have

up
her
glove

to
lean
over
for
some
ivy
,
but
he
would
not
let
she
.
instead
,
she
have


to
wait
behind
he
,
and
take
from
he
each
spray
as
he
gather
it
and


hold
it
to
she
,
each
one
separately
,
in
the
pure
manner
of
chivalry
.


the
tower
seem
to
rock
in
the
wind
.
they
look
over
mile
and
mile


of
woode
country
,
and
country
with
gleam
of
pasture
.

beautiful
,
and
in
perfect


preservation
.

a
drawing
:
Miriam

with
he
.
she
be


thinking
of
Mary
Queen
of
Scots
look
with
her
strained
,
hopeless


eye
,
that
could
not
understand
misery
,
over
the
hill
whence
no
help


come
,
or
sit
in
this
crypt
,
be
tell
of
a
God
as
cold
as
the


place
she
sit
in
.




they
set
off
again
gaily
,
look
round
on
their
beloved
manor
that


stand
so
clean
and
big
on
its
hill
.




"

Paul
to
Miriam

"
would
n’t

be
lovely
to

"




they
be
now
in
the
bare
country
of
stone
wall
,
which
he
love
,
and


which
,
though
only
ten
mile
from
home
,
seem
so
foreign
to
Miriam
.


the
party
be
straggle
.
as
they
be
cross
a
large
meadow
that


slope
away
from
the
sun
,
along
a
path
embed
with
innumerable
tiny


glittering
point
,
Paul
,
walk
alongside
,
lace
his
finger
in
the


string
of
the
bag

be
carry
,
and
instantly
she
feel
Annie


behind
,
watchful
and
jealous
.
but
the
meadow
be
bathe
in
a
glory
of


sunshine
,
and
the
path
be
jewel
,
and
it
be
seldom
that
he
give
she


any
sign
.
she
hold
her
finger
very
still
among
the
string
of
the
bag
,


his
finger
touch
;
and
the
place
be
golden
as
a
vision
.




at
last
they
come
into
the

perplexity

she
lift

.
how

cause
her
shame
.

be
because
of
he

Paul
Morel
.
but
,


then
,
it
be
not
his
affair

to
be
a
sacrifice

it
be
God
’s
sacrifice

minute
she

her
face
in
the

Thy
will

almost
essential

then
she
fall


into
that
rapture
of
self

sacrifice
,

with
a
God

the
intimacy

so
abstract
,
such
a
matter
of
the
soul
,
all
thought
and


weary
struggle
into
consciousness
,
that
he

by
tacit
agreement
they


ignore
the
remark
and
insinuation
of
their
acquaintance
.




"
we

together
,
she
slip
her
arm
timidly


into
his

but
he
always
resent
it
,
and
she
know
it
.
it
cause
a


violent
conflict
in
he
.
with
Miriam
he
be
always
on
the
high
plane
of


abstraction
,
when
his
natural
fire
of
love
be
transmit
into
the


fine
stream
of
thought
.
she
would
have
it
so
.
if
he
be
jolly
and
,
as


she
put
it
,
flippant
,
she
wait
till
he
come
back
to
she
,
till
the


change
have
take
place
in
he
again
,
and
he
be
wrestle
with
his
own


soul
,
frowning
,
passionate
in
his
desire
for
understanding
.
and
in
this


passion
for
understand
her
soul
lie
close
to
his
;
she
have
he
all
to


herself
.
but
he
must
be
make
abstract
first
.




then
,
if
she
put
her
arm
in

run


hot
with
friction

he
be
one
internecine
battle
,
and
he

cruel


to
she
because
of
it

with
a
strange
warm
light


that
lift
every

.
Paul
pass
along
a
fine
row


of
sweet
-
pea
,
gather
a
blossom
here
and
there
,
all

,
breathe
the
fragrance

with
such
strength

feel
she
must
make
they
part
of


herself
.
when
she
bend
and
breathe
a
flower
,
it
be
as
if
she
and
the


flower
be
love
each
other
.
Paul
hate
she
for
it
.
there
seem
a


sort
of
exposure
about
the
action
,

direction
of


sentimentality
as
to

a
sullen
expression

and
a
defiant
carriage
.
it
be
strange
how
Miriam
,

she
bow
,


meditative
bearing
,
look
dwarfed
beside
this
woman

scornful
grey
eye
,
a
skin
like

honey

a
full
mouth
,
with
a
slightly
lift
upper
lip
that
do
not


know
whether
it
be
raise
in
scorn
of
all

out
of

large

dowdy
hat
of
black
beaver
,

a
sort
of
slightly
affect


simple
dress
that
make
she
look
rather
sack

she
be
evidently


poor

have
not

Miriam

"

look
at

would
not

then
:




"

and
directly
the
two

move
on

Paul
remember
that
Clara

the
daughter
of
an
old
friend
of


Mrs.
Leivers
.
Miriam

once

through
her
Miriam
feel
she
get
into
direct
contact
with
Jordan
’s
,


and
could
estimate
well
Paul
’s
position
.
but
Mrs.
Dawes
be
separate


from
her
husband
,
and
have
take
up
Women

she
be
suppose

a
man
of
thirty

one
or


thirty
-
two
.
he
come
occasionally
through
Paul
’s
corner
—
a
big
,
well
-
set


man
,
also
strike
to
look
at
,
and
handsome
.
there
be
a
peculiar


similarity
between
himself
and
his
wife
.
he
have
the
same
white
skin
,


with
a
clear
,
golden
tinge
.
his
hair
be
of
soft
brown
,
his
moustache


be
golden
.
and
he
have
a
similar
defiance
in
his
bearing
and
manner
.


but
then
come
the
difference
.
his
eye
,
dark
brown
and
quick
-
shift
,


be
dissolute
.
they
protrude
very
slightly
,
and
his
eyelid
hang
over


they
in
a
way
that
be
half
hate
.
his
mouth
,
too
,
be
sensual
.
his


whole
manner
be
of
cow
defiance
,
as
if
he
be
ready
to
knock


anybody
down
who
disapprove
of
he
—
perhaps
because
he
really


disapprove
of
himself
.




from
the
first
day
he
have
hate

counter


and
talk
to
Mr.
Pappleworth
.
his
speech
be
dirty
,
with
a
kind
of


rottenness
.
again
he
find
the
youth
with
his
cool
,
critical
gaze
fix


on
his
face

"

black
dress


and
black
apron
.
she
rise
to
meet
the
visitor
.
with
Edgar
she
be


cordial
,
but
with
Miriam
cold
and
rather
grudging
.
yet
Paul
think
the


girl
look
so
nice
in
her
brown
cashmere
frock
.




he

his
mother
to
get
the
tea
ready
.
Miriam
would
have
gladly


proffer
,
but
be
afraid
.
he
be
rather
proud
of
his
home
.
there
be


about
it
now
,
he
think
,
a
certain
distinction
.
the
chair
be
only


wooden
,
and
the
sofa
be
old
.
but
the
hearthrug
and
cushion
be
cosy
;


the
picture
be
print
in
good
taste
;
there
be
a
simplicity
in


everything
,
and
plenty
of
book
.
he
be
never
ashamed
in
the
least
of


his
home
,
nor
be
Miriam
of
hers
,
because
both
be
what
they
should


be
,
and
warm
.
and
then
he
be
proud
of
the
table
;
the
china
be
pretty
,


the
cloth
be
fine
.
it
do
not
matter
that
the
spoon
be
not
silver


nor
the
knife
ivory
-
handle
;
everything
look
nice
.
Mrs.
Morel
have


manage
wonderfully
while
her
child
be

up
,
so
that
nothing

out
of
place
.




Miriam
talk
book
a
little
.
that
be
her
unfailing
topic
.
but
Mrs.


Morel
be
not
cordial
,
and
turn
soon
to
Edgar
.




at
first
Edgar
and
Miriam
use
to
go
into
Mrs.
Morel
’s
pew
.
morel
never


go
to
chapel
,
prefer
the
public
-
house
.
Mrs.
Morel
,
like
a
little


champion
,
sit
at
the
head
of
her
pew
,
Paul
at
the
other
end
;
and
at


first
Miriam
sit
next
to
he
.
then
the
chapel
be
like
home
.
it
be
a


pretty
place
,
with
dark
pew
and
slim
,
elegant
pillar
,
and
flower
.


and
the
same
people
have
sit
in
the
same
place
ever
since
he
be
a
boy
.


it
be
wonderfully
sweet
and
soothe
to
sit
there
for
an
hour
and
a


half
,
next
to
Miriam
,
and
near
to
his
mother
,
unite
his
two
love


under
the
spell
of
the
place
of
worship
.
then
he
feel
warm
and
happy


and
religious
at
once
.
and
after
chapel
he
walk
home
with
Miriam
,


whilst
Mrs.
Morel
spend
the
rest
of
the
evening
with
her
old
friend
,


Mrs.
Burns
.
he
be
keenly
alive
on
his
walk
on
Sunday
night
with


Edgar
and
Miriam
.
he
never
go
past
the
pit
at
night
,
by
the
light


lamp
-
house
,
the
tall
black
headstock
and
line
of
truck
,
past
the


fan
spin
slowly
like
shadow
,
without
the
feeling
of
Miriam


return
to
he
,
keen
and
almost
unbearable
.




she
do
not
very
long
occupy
the
Morels
’
pew
.
her
father
take
one
for


themselves
once
more
.
it
be
under
the
little
gallery
,
opposite
the


Morels
'
.
when
Paul
and
his
mother
come
in
the
chapel
the
Leivers
’s
pew


be
always
empty
.
he
be
anxious
for
fear
she
would
not
come
:
it
be
so


far
,
and
there
be
so
many
rainy
Sundays
.
then
,
often
very
late


indeed
,
she
come
in
,
with
her
long
stride
,
her
head
bow
,
her
face


hide
under
her
hat
of
dark
green
velvet
.
her
face
,
as
she
sit


opposite
,
be
always
in
shadow
.
but
it
give
he
a
very
keen
feeling
,
as


if
all
his
soul
stir
within
he
,
to
see
she
there
.
it
be
not
the


same
glow
,
happiness
,
and
pride
,
that
he
feel
in
have
his
mother
in


charge
:
something
more
wonderful
,
less
human
,
and
tinge
to
intensity


by
a
pain
,
as
if
there
be
something
he
could
not
get
to
.




at
this
time
he
be
begin
to
question
the
orthodox
creed
.
he
be


twenty
-
one
,
and
she
be
twenty
.
she
be
begin
to
dread
the
spring
:


he
become
so
wild
,
and
hurt
she
so
much
.
all
the
way
he
go
cruelly


smash
her
belief
.
Edgar
enjoy
it
.
he
be
by
nature
critical
and


rather
dispassionate
.
but
Miriam
suffer
exquisite
pain
,
as
,
with
an


intellect
like
a
knife
,
the
man
she
love
examine
her
religion
in


which
she
live
and
move
and
have
her
being
.
but
he
do
not
spare
she
.


he
be
cruel
.
and
when
they
go
alone
he
be
even
more
fierce
,
as
if


he
would
kill
her
soul
.
he
bleed
her
belief
till
she
almost
lose


consciousness
.




"
she
exult
—
she
exult
as
she
carry
he
off
from
I
,
"
Mrs.
Morel


cry
in
her
heart
when
Paul
have
go
.
"
she
’
not
like
an
ordinary


woman
,
who
can
leave
I
my
share
in
he
.
she
want
to
absorb
he
.
she


want
to
draw
he
out
and
absorb
he
till
there
be
nothing
leave
of
he
,


even
for
himself
.
he
will
never
be
a
man
on
his
own
foot
—
she
will
suck


he
up
.
"
so
the
mother
sit
,
and
battle
and
brood
bitterly
.




and
he
,
come
home
from
his
walk
with
Miriam
,
be
wild
with
torture
.


he
walk
bite
his
lip
and
with
clenched
fist
,
go
at
a
great


rate
.
then
,
bring
up
against
a
stile
,
he
stand
for
some
minute
,
and


do
not
move
.
there
be
a
great
hollow
of
darkness
front
he
,
and
on


the
black
upslope
patch
of
tiny
light
,
and
in
the
low
trough
of


the
night
,
a
flare
of
the
pit
.
it
be
all
weird
and
dreadful
.
why
be


he
tear
so
,
almost
bewildered
,
and
unable
to
move
?
why
do
his
mother


sit
at
home
and
suffer
?
he
know
she
suffer
badly
.
but
why
should
she
?


and
why
do
he
hate
Miriam
,
and
feel
so
cruel
towards
she
,
at
the


think
of
his
mother
.
if
Miriam
cause
his
mother
suffering
,
then
he


hate
she
—
and
he
easily
hate
she
.
why
do
she
make
he
feel
as
if
he


be
uncertain
of
himself
,
insecure
,
an
indefinite
thing
,
as
if
he
have


not
sufficient
sheathe
to
prevent
the
night
and
the
space
breaking


into
he
?
how
he
hate
she
!
and
then
,
what
a
rush
of
tenderness
and


humility
!




suddenly
he
plunge
on
again
,
run
home
.
his
mother
see
on
he
the


mark
of
some
agony
,
and
she
say
nothing
.
but
he
have
to
make
her
talk


to
he
.
then
she
be
angry
with
he
for
go
so
far
with
Miriam
.




"
why

he
cry
in
despair
.




"

she
reply
piteously
.
"
I
’m
sure
I
’ve
try
to

"




and
he
feel
dreary
and
hopeless
between
the
two
.




spring
be
the
bad
time
.
he
be
changeable
,
and
intense
and
cruel
.
so


he
decide
to
stay
away
from

.
then
come
the
hour
when
he

on
with
his
work
.
he
could
do
nothing
.
it
be
as
if


something

his
soul
out
towards
Willey
Farm
.
then
he
put
on


his
hat
and
go
,
say
nothing
.
and
his
mother
know

and


as
soon
as
he
be
on
the
way
he
sigh
with
relief
.
and
when
he
be


with
she
he
be
cruel
again
.




one
day
in
March

to
look
at

into
herself
through
some
channel
which


unite
they

tilt
down
the
hill
at


random
.
he
think
it

his

lovable
.
it

the
naked
edge
of

for
cosiness
,
the
wild
country
scoop

a
valley

besides
Miriam
.
he

together
from
tonic
sol
-
fa
,
singe
in
a
circle

.
but
now
Paul

rarely
alone
with
Miriam
.
she
wait
.
when


she
and
Edgar
and
he
walk
home
together
from
chapel
or
from
the


literary
society
in
Bestwood
,
she
know
his
talk
,
so
passionate
and
so


unorthodox
nowadays
,
be
for
she

however
,

.
she

wood
,
reading
,
study
,


dream
,
wait

and
he
write
to

.




one
Sunday
evening
they
attain
to
their
old
rare
harmony
.
Edgar

stay
to
Communion
—
he
wonder
what
it
be
like
—
with
Mrs.

.
so


Paul
come
on
alone
with
Miriam
to
his
home
.
he
be
more
or
less
under


her
spell
again
.
as
usual
,
they
be
discuss
the
sermon
.
he
be


set
now
full
sail
towards
Agnosticism
,
but
such
a
religious


agnosticism
that
Miriam
do
not
suffer
so
badly
.
they
be
at
the
Renan


_
Vie
de
Jésus
_
stage
.
Miriam
be
the
threshing
-
floor
on
which
he


thresh
out
all
his
belief
.
while
he
trample
his
idea
upon
she


soul
,
the
truth
come
out
for
he
.
she
alone
be
his
threshing
-
floor
.


she
alone
help
he
towards
realisation
.
almost
impassive
,
she


submit
to
his
argument
and
expound
.
and
somehow
,
because
of
she
,


he
gradually
realise
where
he
be
wrong
.
and
what
he
realise
,
she


realise
.
she
feel
he
could
not
do
without
she
.




they
come
to
the
silent
house
.
he
take
the
key
out
of
the
scullery


window
,
and
they
enter
.
all
the
time
he
go
on
with
his
discussion
.


he
light
the
gas
,
mend
the
fire
,
and
bring
she
some
cake
from
the


pantry
.
she
sit
on
the
sofa
,
quietly
,
with
a
plate
on
her
knee
.
she


wear
a
large
white
hat
with
some
pinkish
flower
.
it
be
a
cheap
hat
,


but
he
like
it
.
her
face
beneath
be
still
and
pensive
,
golden
-
brown


and
ruddy
.
always
her
ear
be
hide
in
her
short
curl
.
she
watch


he
.




she
like
he

Sundays
.
then
he
wear
a
dark
suit
that
show
the


lithe
movement
of
his
body
.
there
be
a
clean
,
clear
-
cut
look
about


he
.
he
go
on
with
his
thinking
to
she
.
suddenly
he
reach
for
a


Bible
.
Miriam
like
the
way
he
reach
up
—
so
sharp
,
straight
to
the


mark
.
he
turn
the
page
quickly
,
and
read
she
a
chapter
of
St.
John
.


as
he
sit
in
the
armchair
reading
,
intent
,
his
voice
only
think
,
she


feel
as
if
he
be
use
she
unconsciously
as
a
man
use
his
tool
at


some
work
he
be
bent
on
.
she
love
it
.
and
the
wistfulness
of
his
voice


be
like
a
reach
to
something
,
and
it
be
as
if
she
be
what
he


reach
with
.
she
sit
back
on
the
sofa
away
from
he
,
and
yet
feel


herself
the
very
instrument
his
hand
grasp
.
it
give
she
great


pleasure
.




then
he
begin
to
falter
and
to
get
self
-
conscious
.
and
when
he
come
to


the
verse
,
"
a
woman
,
when
she
be
in
travail
,
hath
sorrow
because
she


hour
be
come
"
,
he
miss
it
out
.
Miriam
have
feel
he
grow


uncomfortable
.
she
shrink
when
the
well
-
know
word
do
not
follow
.
he


go
on
reading
,
but
she
do
not
hear
.
a
grief
and
shame
make
she
bend


her
head
.
six
month
ago
he
would
have
read
it
simply
.
now
there
be
a


scotch
in
his
run
with
she
.
now
she
feel
there
be
really
something


hostile
between
they
,
something
of
which
they
be
ashamed
.




she
eat
her
cake
mechanically
.
he
try
to
go
on
with
his
argument
,
but


could
not
get
back
the
right
note
.
soon
Edgar
come
in
.
Mrs.
Morel
have


go
to
her
friend
'
.
the
three
set
off
to
Willey
Farm
.




Miriam
brood
over
his
split
with
she
.
there
be
something
else
he


want
.
he
could
not
be
satisfied
;
he
could
give
she
no
peace
.
there


be
between
they
now
always
a
ground
for
strife
.
she
want
to
prove


he
.
she
believe
that
his
chief
need
in
life
be
herself
.
if
she
could


prove
it
,
both
to
herself
and
to
he
,
the
rest
might
go
;
she
could


simply
trust
to
the
future
.




so
in
May
she
ask
he
to
come
to
Willey
Farm
and
meet
Mrs.
Dawes
.


there
be
something
he
hanker
after
.
she
see
he
,
whenever
they
speak


of
Clara
Dawes
,
rouse
and
get
slightly
angry
.
he
say
he
do
not
like


she
.
yet
he
be
keen
to
know
about
she
.
well
,
he
should
put
himself
to


the
test
.
she
believe
that
there
be
in
he
desire
for
high


thing
,
and
desire
for
low
,
and
that
the
desire
for
the
high
would


conquer
.
at
any
rate
,
he
should
try
.
she
forget
that
her
"
high
"
and


"
low
"
be
arbitrary
.




he
be
rather
excited
at
the
idea
of
meet
Clara
at
Willey
Farm

of
her
head
.
she
wear
a
white
blouse
and
navy
skirt
,
and
somehow
,


wherever
she
be
,
seem
to
make
thing
look
paltry
and
insignificant
.


when
she
be
in
the

,
the
kitchen
seem
too
small
and
mean

rather
hard
to

up
with
.
yet
she
be
perfectly
amiable
,
but


indifferent
,
and
rather
hard
.

the


newcomer
.
Miriam
already

to
suffer
.
they
go
together
towards


the
house
.
he
take
the
clip

his
trouser
,
but
be
too
lazy
to


brush
the
dust
from
his
shoe
,
in
spite
of
the
sock
and
tie
.




Clara

Mrs.
Morel
sat
brood
—
about
her
daughter
,
about
Paul
,
about
Arthur
.


she
fret
at
lose
Annie
.
the
family
be
very
closely
bind
.
and
she


feel
she
_
must
_
live
now
,
to
be
with
her
child
.
life
be
so
rich
for


she
.
Paul
want
she
,
and
so
do
Arthur
.
Arthur
never
know
how
deeply


he
love
she
.
he
be
a
creature
of
the
moment
.
never
yet
have
he
be


force
to
realise
himself
.
the
army
have
discipline
his
body
,
but
not


his
soul
.
he
be
in
perfect
health
and
very
handsome
.
his
dark
,


vigorous
hair
sit
close
to
his
smallish
head
.
there
be
something


childish
about
his
nose
,
something
almost
girlish
about
his
dark
blue


eye
.
but
he
have
the
fun
red
mouth
of
a
man
under
his
brown
moustache
,


and
his
jaw
be
strong
.
it
be
his
father
’s
mouth
;
it
be
the
nose
and


eye
of
her
own
mother
’s
people

good
-
look
,
weak
-
principle
folk
.


Mrs.
Morel
be
anxious
about
he
.
once
he
have
really
run
the
rig
he
be


safe
.
but
how
far
would
he
go
?




the
army
have
not
really
do
he
any
good
.
he
resent
bitterly
the


authority
of
the
officer
.
he
hate
have
to
obey
as
if
he
be
an


animal
.
but
he
have
too
much
sense
to
kick
.
so
he
turn
his
attention


to
get
the
good
out
of
it
.
he
could
sing
,
he
be
a
boon
-
companion
.


often
he
get
into
scrape
,
but
they
be
the
manly
scrape
that
be


easily
condone
.
so
he
make
a
good
time
out
of
it
,
whilst
his


self
-
respect
be
in
suppression
.
he
trust
to
his
good
look
and


handsome
figure
,
his
refinement
,
his
decent
education
to
get
he
most


of
what
he
want
,
and
he
be
not
disappointed
.
yet
he
be
restless
.


something
seem
to
gnaw
he
inside
.
he
be
never
still
,
he
be
never


alone
.
with
his
mother
he
be
rather
humble
.
Paul
he
admire
and
love


and
despise
slightly

sometimes

want
.




he
grow
more
and
more
restless
.
Miriam
do
not
satisfy
he
.
his
old
mad


desire
to
be
with
she
grow
weak
.
sometimes
he
meet
Clara
in


Nottingham
,
sometimes
he
go
to
meeting
with
she
,
sometimes
he
see


she
at
Willey
Farm
.
but
on
these
last
occasion
the
situation
become


strained
.
there
be
a
triangle
of
antagonism
between
Paul
and
Clara
and


Miriam
.
with
Clara
he
take
on
a
smart
,
worldly
,
mock
tone
very


antagonistic
to
Miriam
.
it
do
not
matter
what
go
before
.
she
might


be
intimate
and
sad
with
he
.
then
as
soon
as
Clara
appear
,
it
all


vanish
,
and
he
play
to
the
newcomer
.




Miriam
have
one
beautiful
evening
with
he
in
the
hay
.
he
have
be
on


the
horse
-
rake
,
and
having
finish
,
come
to
help
she
to
put
the
hay
in


cock
.
then
he
talk
to
she
of
his
hope
and
despair
,
and
his
whole


soul
seem
to
lie
bare
before
she
.
she
feel
as
if
she
watch
the
very


quiver
stuff
of
life
in
he
.
the
moon
come
out
:
they
walk
home


together
:
he
seem
to
have
come
to
she
because
he
need
she
so
badly
,


and
she
listen
to
he
,
give
he
all
her
love
and
her
faith
.
it
seem


to
she
he
bring
she
the
good
of
himself
to
keep
,
and
that
she
would


guard
it
all
her
life
.
nay
,
the
sky
do
not
cherish
the
star
more


surely
and
eternally
than
she
would
guard
the
good
in
the
soul
of
Paul


Morel
.
she
go
on
home
alone
,
feel
exalted
,
glad
in
her
faith
.




and
then
,
the
next
day
,
Clara
come
.
they
be
to
have
tea
in
the


hayfield
.
Miriam
watch
the
evening
draw
to
gold
and
shadow
.
and


all
the
time
Paul
be
sport
with
Clara
.
he
make
high
and
high


heap
of
hay
that
they
be

over
.
Miriam
do
not
care
for
the


game
,
and
stand
aside
.
Edgar
and
Geoffrey
and
Maurice
and
Clara
and


Paul
jump
.
Paul
win
,
because
he
be
light
.
Clara
’s
blood
be
rouse
.


she
could
run
like
an
Amazon
.
Paul
love
the
determined
way
she
rush


at
the
hay
-
cock
and
leap
,
land
on
the
other
side
,

breast


shake
,

undone
.




"

"

none

"

"

"
I

she
cry
.




"
as

as
anything

Paul
.




"

she

"

"

"




"
and
nothing
can
alter
the
fact
that

"
laugh
Paul
.




she
be
furious
with
he
.
her
little
triumph
before
these
lad
and
man


be
go
.
she
have
forget
herself
in
the
game
.
now
he
be
to
humble


she
.




"
I
think
you
be
despicable
!
"
she
say
.




and
again
he
laugh
,
in
a
way
that
torture
Miriam
.




"
and
I
_
know
_
you
could
n’t
jump
that
heap
,
"
he
tease
.




she
turn
she
back
on
he
.
yet
everybody
could
see
that
the
only


person
she
listen
to
,
or
be
conscious
of
,
be
he
,
and
he
of
she
.
it


please
the
man
to
see
this
battle
between
they
.
but
Miriam
be


torture
.




Paul
could
choose
the
less
in
place
of
the
high
,
she
see
.
he
could


be
unfaithful
to
himself
,
unfaithful
to
the
real
,
deep
Paul
Morel
.


there
be
a
danger
of
his
become
frivolous
,
of
his
running
after
his


satisfaction
like
any
Arthur
,
or
like
his
father
.
it
make
Miriam
bitter


to
think
that
he
should
throw
away
his
soul
for
this
flippant
traffic


of
triviality
with
Clara
.
she
walk
in
bitterness
and
silence
,
while


the
other
two
rally
each
other
,
and
Paul
sport
.




and
afterwards
,
he
would
not
own
it
,
but
he
be
rather
ashamed
of


himself
,
and
prostrate
himself
before
Miriam
.
then
again
he
rebel
.




"
it
’
not
religious
to
be
religious
,
"
he
say
.
"
I
reckon
a
crow
be


religious
when
it
sail
across
the
sky
.
but
it
only
do
it
because
it


feel
itself
carry
to
where
it
’s
go
,
not
because
it
think
it
be


be
eternal
.
"




but
Miriam
know
that
one
should
be
religious
in
everything
,
have
God
,


whatever
God
might
be
,
present
in
everything
.




"
I
do
n’t
believe
God
know
such
a
lot
about
himself
,
"
he
cry
.
"
God


do
n’t
_
know
_
thing
,
he
_
be
_
thing
.
and
I
’m
sure
he
’
not
soulful
.
"




and
then
it
seem
to
she
that
Paul
be
argue
God
on
to
his
own
side
,


because
he
want
his
own
way
and
his
own
pleasure
.
there
be
a
long


battle
between
he
and
she
.
he
be
utterly
unfaithful
to
she
even
in


her
own
presence
;
then
he
be
ashamed
,
then
repentant
;
then
he
hate


she
,
and
go
off
again
.
those
be
the
ever
-
recur
condition
.




she
fret
he
to
the
bottom
of
his
soul
.
there
she
remain
—
sad
,


pensive
,
a
worshipper
.
and
he
cause
her
sorrow
.
half
the
time
he


grieve
for
she
,
half
the
time
he
hate
she
.
she
be
his
conscience
;


and
he
feel
,
somehow
,
he
have
get
a
conscience
that
be
too
much
for


he
.
he
could
not
leave
she
,
because
in
one
way
she
do
hold
the
good


of
he
.
he
could
not
stay
with
she
because
she
do
not
take
the
rest
of


he
,
which
be
three
-
quarter
.
so
he
chafe
himself
into
rawness
over


she
.




when
she
be
twenty
-
one
he
write
she
a
letter
which
could
only
have


be
write
to
she
.








"

would
shrug
her
shoulder
in
scorn
of
his

she
madden

.


he
be
furious
.
then

passion
to
be
instruct
,
have
teach
herself
french
,
and
could


read
in
that
language
with
a
struggle
.
she
consider
herself
as
a


woman
apart
,
and
particularly
apart
,
from
her
class
.
the
girl
in
the


spiral

.
it
be
a
small
,
special


industry
,

have
a
certain
distinction
.
there
be
an
air
of
refinement


in

Clara
be
aloof
also
from

none
of

thing
,
however
,
do
she
reveal
to
Paul
.
she
be
not
the


one
to
give
herself
away
.
there
be
a
sense
of
mystery
about
she

she


be
so
reserved
,
he
feel
she
have
much
to
reserve

open


on
the
surface

its
inner
meaning
be
hide
from
everybody
.
it
be


exciting
.
and
then
sometimes
he
catch

an
almost
furtive

she
give
he
a
little
,
lenient
smile
.


she
be
to
he
extraordinarily
provocative
,
because
of
the
knowledge


she
seem
to
possess
,
and
gather
fruit
of
experience

could
not


attain

himself
really
bind
to
Miriam
.
if
ever


he
should
marry
,
some
time
in
the
far
future
,
it
would
be
his
duty
to


marry
Miriam
.
that
he
give
Clara
to
understand
,
and
she
say
nothing
,


but
leave
he
to
his
course
.
he
come
to
she
,
Mrs.
Dawes
,
whenever
he


could
.
then
he
write
frequently
to
Miriam
,
and
visit
the
girl


occasionally
.
so
he
go
on
through
the
winter
;
but
he
seem
not
so


fret
.
his
mother
be
easy
about
he
.
she
think
he
be
get


away
from
Miriam
.




Miriam
know
now
how
strong
be
the
attraction
of
Clara
for
he
;
but


still
she
be
certain
that
the
good
in
he
would
triumph
.
his
feeling


for
Mrs.
Dawes
—
who
,
moreover
,
be
a
married
woman
—
be
shallow
and


temporal
,
compare
with
his
love
for
herself
.
he
would
come
back
to


she
,
she
be
sure
;
with
some
of
his
young
freshness
go
,
perhaps
,
but


cure
of
his
desire
for
the
less
thing
which
other
woman
than


herself
could
give
he
.
she
could
bear
all
if
he
be
inwardly
true
to


she
and
must
come
back
.




he
see
none
of
the
anomaly
of
his
position
.
Miriam
be
his
old
friend
,


lover
,
and
she
belong
to
Bestwood
and
home
and
his
youth
.
Clara
be
a


new
friend
,
and
she
belong
to
Nottingham
,
to
life
,
to
the
world
.
it


seem
to
he
quite
plain
.




Mrs.
Dawes
and
he
have
many
period
of
coolness
,
when
they
see
little
of


each
other
;
but
they
always
come
together
again
.




"
be
you
horrid

Baxter
Dawes
?
"
he
ask
she
.
it
be
a
thing
that


seem
to

some
time

the
test
ON
MIRIAM




with
the
spring
come
again
the
old
madness
and
battle
.
now
he
know
he


would
have
to
go
to
Miriam
.
but
what
be
his
reluctance
?
he
tell


himself
it
be
only
a
sort
of
overstrong
virginity
in
she
and
he
which


neither
could
break
through
.
he
might
have
marry
she
;
but
his


circumstance
at
home
make
it
difficult
,
and
,
moreover
,
he
do
not
want


to
marry
.
marriage
be
for
life
,
and
because
they
have
become
close


companion
,
he
and
she
,
he
do
not
see
that
it
should
inevitably
follow


they
should
be
man
and
wife
.
he
do
not
feel
that
he
want
marriage


with
Miriam
.
he
wish
he
do
.
he
would
have
give
his
head
to
have


feel
a
joyous
desire
to
marry
she
and
to
have
she
.
then
why
could
n’t
he


bring
it
off
?
there
be
some
obstacle
;
and
what
be
the
obstacle
?
it


lie
in
the
physical
bondage
.
he
shrink
from
the
physical
contact
.
but


why
?
with
she
he
feel
bind
up
inside
himself
.
he
could
not
go
out
to


she
.
something
struggle
in
he
,
but
he
could
not
get
to
she
.
why
?
she


love
he
.
Clara
say
she
even
want
he
;
then
why
could
n’t
he
go
to


she
,
make
love
to
she
,
kiss
she
?
why
,
when
she
put
her
arm
in
his
,


timidly
,
as
they
walk
,
do
he
feel
he
would
burst
forth
in
brutality


and
recoil
?
he
owe
himself
to
she
;
he
want
to
belong
to
she
.
perhaps


the
recoil
and
the
shrinking
from
she
be
love
in
its
first
fierce


modesty
.
he
have
no
aversion
for
she
.
no
,
it
be
the
opposite
;
it
be
a


strong
desire
battle
with
a
still
strong
shyness
and
virginity
.
it


seem
as
if
virginity
be
a
positive
force
,
which
fight
and
win
in


both
of
they
.
and
with
she
he
feel
it
so
hard
to
overcome
;
yet
he
be


near
to
she
,
and
with
she
alone
could
he
deliberately
break
through
.


and
he
owe
himself
to
she
.
then
,
if
they
could
get
thing
right
,
they


could
marry
;
but
he
would
not
marry
unless
he
could
feel
strong
in
the


joy
of
it
—
never
.
he
could
not
have
face
his
mother
.
it
seem
to
he


that
to
sacrifice
himself
in
a
marriage
he
do
not
want
would
be


degrade
,
and
would
undo
all
his
life
,
make
it
a
nullity
.
he
would
try


what
he
_
could
_
do
.




and
he
have
a
great
tenderness
for
Miriam
.
always
,
she
be
sad
,
dream


her
religion
;
and
he
be
nearly
a
religion
to
she
.
he
could
not
bear
to


fail
she
.
it
would
all
come
right
if
they
try
.




he
look
round
.
a
good
many
of
the
nice
man
he
know
be
like


himself
,
bind
in
by
their
own
virginity
,
which
they
could
not
break


out
of
.
they
be
so
sensitive
to
their
woman
that
they
would
go


without
they
for
ever
rather
than
do
they
a
hurt
,
an
injustice
.
be


the
son
of
mother
whose
husband
have
blunder
rather
brutally


through
their
feminine
sanctity
,
they
be
themselves
too
diffident


and
shy
.
they
could
easier
deny
themselves
than
incur
any
reproach
from


a
woman
;
for
a
woman
be
like
their
mother
,
and
they
be
full
of
the


sense
of
their
mother
.
they
prefer
themselves
to
suffer
the
misery


of
celibacy
,
rather
than
risk
the
other
person
.




he
go
back
to
she
.
something
in
she
,
when
he
look
at
she
,
bring


the
tear
almost
to
his
eye
.
one
day
he
stand
behind
she
as
she
sing
.


Annie
be
play
a
song
on
the
piano
.
as
Miriam
sing
her
mouth
seem


hopeless
.
she
sing
like
a
nun
singing
to
heaven
.
it
remind
he
so


much
of
the
mouth
and
eye
of
one
who
sing
beside
a
Botticelli


Madonna
,
so
spiritual
.
again
,
hot
as
steel
,
come
up
the
pain
in
he
.


why
must
he
ask
she
for
the
other
thing
?
why
be
there
his
blood


battle
with
she
?
if
only
he
could
have
be
always
gentle
,
tender


with
she
,
breathe
with
she
the
atmosphere
of
reverie
and
religious


dream
,
he
would
give
his
right
hand
.
it
be
not
fair
to
hurt
she
.


there
seem
an
eternal
maidenhood
about
she
;
and
when
he
think
of


her
mother
,
he
see
the
great
brown
eye
of
a
maiden
who
be
nearly


scared
and
shock
out
of
her
virgin
maidenhood
,
but
not
quite
,
in


spite
of
her
seven
child
.
they
have
be
bear
almost
leave
she
out


of
count
,
not
of
she
,
but
upon
she
.
so
she
could
never
let
they
go
,


because
she
never
have
possess
they
.




Mrs.
Morel
see
he
go
again
frequently
to
Miriam
,
and
be


astonish
.
he
say
nothing
to
his
mother
.
he
do
not
explain
nor


excuse
himself
.
if
he
come
home
late
,
and
she
reproach
he
,
he


frowned
and
turn
on
she
in
an
overbearing
way
:




"
I
shall
come
home
when
I
like
,
"
he
say
;
"
I
be
old
enough
.
"




"
must
she
keep
you
till
this
time
?
"




"
it
be
I
who
stay
,
"
he
answer
.




"
and
she
let
you
?
but
very
well
,
"
she
say
.




and
she
go
to
bed
,
leave
the
door
unlocked
for
he
;
but
she
lie


listen
until
he

be
a
new
quietness
about
he
which
she


have
wonder
at
.
she
almost
guess
.
she
would
leave
he
alone
,


however
.
precipitation
might
spoil
thing
.
she
watch
he
in
his


loneliness
,
wonder
where
he
would
end
.
he
be
sick
,
and
much
too


quiet
for
he
.
there
be
a
perpetual
little
knitting
of
his
brow
,
such


as
she
have
see
when
he
be
a
small
baby
,
and
which
have
be
go
for


many
year
.
now
it
be
the
same
again
.
and
she
could
do
nothing
for


he
.
he
have
to
go
on
alone
,
make
his
own
way
.




he
continue
faithful
to
Miriam
.
for
one
day
he
have
love
she
utterly
.


but
it
never
come
again
.
the
sense
of
failure
grow
strong
.
at
first


it
be
only
a
sadness
.
then
he
begin
to
feel
he
could
not
go
on
.
he


want
to
run
,
to
go
abroad
,
anything
.
gradually
he
cease
to
ask
she


to
have
he
.
instead
of
draw
they
together
,
it
put
they
apart
.
and


then
he
realise
,
consciously
,
that
it
be
no
good
.
it
be
useless


try
:
it
would
never
be
a
success
between
they
.




for
some
month
he
have
see
very
little
of
Clara
.
they
have
occasionally


walk
out
for
half
an
hour
at
dinner
-
time
.
but
he
always
reserve


himself
for
Miriam
.
with
Clara
,
however
,
his
brow
clear
,
and
he
be


gay
again
.
she
treat
he
indulgently
,
as
if
he
be
a
child
.
he


think
he
do
not
mind
.
but
deep
below
the
surface
it
pique
he
.




sometimes
Miriam
say
:




"
what
about
Clara
?
I
hear
nothing
of
she
lately
.
"




"
I
walk
with
she
about
twenty
minute
yesterday
,
"
he
reply
.




"
and
what
do
she
talk
about
?
"




"
I
do
n’t
know
.
I
suppose
I
do
all
the
jawing
—
I
usually
do
.
I
think
I


be
tell
she
about
the
strike
,
and
how
the
woman
take
it
.
"




"
yes
.
"




so
he
give
the
account
of
himself
.




but
insidiously
,
without
his
know
it
,
the
warmth
he
feel
for
Clara


draw
he
away
from
Miriam
,
for
whom
he
feel
responsible
,
and
to
whom
he


feel
he
belong
.
he
think
he
be
be
quite
faithful
to
she
.
it
be


not
easy
to
estimate
exactly
the
strength
and
warmth
of
one
’s
feeling


for
a
woman
till
they
have
run
away
with
one
.




he
begin
to
give
more
time
to
his
man
friend

game
of

a
wonderful
close
down
on
her
face
near


the
ear
that
he
want
to
touch
.
and
a
certain
heaviness
,
the
heaviness


of
a
very
full
ear
of
corn
that
dip
slightly
in
the
wind
,
that
there

blonde
hair

near
to

some
attribute
of

space
of
the
Midland
Railway
,
and


pass
the
cattle
enclosure
that

.
then
they
run
down


sordid
Wilford
Road
.




she

slightly
to
the
tram

motion
,
and
as
she

against

upon
he
.
he

a
vigorous
,
slender
man
,
with
exhaustless


energy
.
his
face
be
rough
,
with
rough
-
hewn
feature
,
like
the
common


people
’s
;
but
his
eye
under
the
deep
brow
be
so
full
of
life
that


they
fascinate
she
.
they
seem
to
dance
,
and
yet
they
be
still


tremble
on
the
fine
balance
of
laughter
.
his
mouth
the
same
be


just
go
to
spring
into
a
laugh
of
triumph
,
yet

there
be
a


sharp
suspense
about

lip
moodily
.

hand
be
hard


clench
over
hers
.




they
pay
their
two
halfpenny
at
the
turnstile
and

very
full
.

sweep
silent
and
insidious
under


the
bridge
,
travel
in
a
soft
body
.

be
a
great
deal

glisten
of
silver
here
and
there
.

Wilford
churchyard

dahlia
be
sodden
with
rain
—
wet
black

crimson
ball
.
no
one

on


the
path
that

it

a
cruelty
to

how
his

it
madden
she
to
hear
his
mechanical
voice
give
order


about
the
work

she
want
to
break
through
the
sham
of
it

the
evening

night

a
bliss
to
they

silent

for
hour
they

together

together

the
dark

only
a
few

her
bosom
leave
its
warmth

his
chest

more
from

a
sad


dissatisfied
tune

a
tune

soothe
upon
she
—
soothe
.
she
stand
clasp
he
and
caress
he
,


and
he
be
something
unknown
to
she
—
something
almost
uncanny
.
she


want
to
soothe
he
into
forgetfulness
.




and
soon
the
struggle
go
down
in
his
soul
,
and
he
forget
.
but
then


Clara
be
not
there
for
he
,
only
a
woman
,
warm
,
something
he
love
and


almost
worship
,
there
in
the
dark
.
but
it
be
not
Clara
,
and
she


submit
to
he
.
the
naked
hunger
and
inevitability
of
his
love
she
,


something
strong
and
blind
and
ruthless
in
its
primitiveness
,
make
the


hour
almost
terrible
to
she
.
she
know
how
stark
and
alone
he
be
,
and


she
feel
it
be
great
that
he
come
to
she
;
and
she
take
he
simply


because
his
need
be
big
either
than
she
or
he
,
and
her
soul
be


still
within
she
.
she
do
this
for
he
in
his
need
,
even
if
he
leave


she
,
for
she
love
he
.




all
the
while
the
peewit
be
scream
in
the
field
.
when
he
come
to
,


he
wonder
what
be
near
his
eye
,
curve
and
strong
with
life
in
the


dark
,
and
what
voice
it
be
speak
.
then
he
realise
it
be
the


grass
,
and
the
peewit
be
call
.
the
warmth
be
Clara
’s
breathing


heaving
.
he
lift
his
head
,
and
look
into
her
eye
.
they
be
dark


and
shine
and
strange
,
life
wild
at
the
source
stare
into
his
life
,


strange
to
he
,
yet
meet
he
;
and
he
put
his
face
down
on
she


throat
,
afraid
.
what
be
she
?
a
strong
,
strange
,
wild
life
,
that


breathe
with
his
in
the
darkness
through
this
hour
.
it
be
all
so
much


big
than
themselves
that
he
be
hush
.
they
have
meet
,
and
include


in
their
meeting
the
thrust
of
the
manifold
grass
stem
,
the
cry
of
the


peewit
,
the
wheel
of
the
star
.




when
they
stand
up
they
see
other
lover
steal
down
the
opposite


hedge
.
it
seem
natural
they
be
there
;
the
night
contain
they
.




and
after
such
an
evening
they
both
be
very
still
,
having
know
the


immensity
of
passion
.
they
feel
small
,
half
-
afraid
,
childish
and


wonder
,
like
Adam
and
Eve
when
they
lose
their
innocence
and


realise
the
magnificence
of
the
power
which
drive
they
out
of
Paradise


and
across
the
great
night
and
the
great
day
of
humanity
.
it
be
for


each
of
they
an
initiation
and
a
satisfaction
.
to
know
their
own


nothingness
,
to
know
the
tremendous
living
flood
which
carry
they


always
,
give
they
rest
within
themselves
.
if
so
great
a
magnificent


power
could
overwhelm
they
,
identify
they
altogether
with
itself
,
so


that
they
know
they
be
only
grain
in
the
tremendous
heave
that


lift
every
grass
blade
its
little
height
,
and
every
tree
,
and
live


thing
,
then
why
fret
about
themselves
?
they
could
let
themselves
be


carry
by
life
,
and
they
feel
a
sort
of
peace
each
in
the
other
.
there


be
a
verification
which
they
have
have
together
.
nothing
could
nullify


it
,
nothing
could
take
it
away
;
it
be
almost
their
belief
in
life
.




but
Clara
be
not
satisfied
.
something
great
be
there
,
she
know
;


something
great
envelop
she
.
but
it
do
not
keep
she
.
in
the
morning


it
be
not
the
same
.
they
have
_
know
_
,
but
she
could
not
keep
the


moment
.
she
want
it
again
;
she
want
something
permanent
.
she
have


not
realise
fully
.
she
think
it
be
he
whom
she
want
.
he
be
not


safe
to
she
.
this
that
have
be
between
they
might
never
be
again
;
he


might
leave
she
.
she
have
not
get
he
;
she
be
not
satisfied
.
she
have


be
there
,
but
she
have
not
grip
the
—
the
something
—
she
know
not


what
—
which
she
be
mad
to
have
.




in
the
morning
he
have
considerable
peace
,
and
be
happy
in
himself
.
it


seem
almost
as
if
he
have
know
the
baptism
of
fire
in
passion
,
and
it


leave
he
at
rest
.
but
it
be
not
Clara
.
it
be
something
that
happen


because
of
she
,
but
it
be
not
she
.
they
be
scarcely
any
near
each


other
.
it
be
as
if
they
have
be
blind
agent
of
a
great
force
.




when
she
see
he
that
day
at
the
factory
her
heart
melt
like
a
drop


of
fire
.
it
be
his
body
,
his
brow
.
the
drop
of
fire
grow
more
intense


in
her
breast
;
she
must
hold
he
.
but
he
,
very
quiet
,
very
subdued
this


morning
,
go
on
give
his
instruction
.
she
follow
he
into
the


dark
,
ugly
basement
,
and
lift
her
arm
to
he
.
he
kiss
she
,
and
the


intensity
of
passion
begin
to
burn
he
again
.
somebody
be
at
the
door
.


he
run
upstairs
;
she
return
to
her
room
,
move
as
if
in
a
trance
.




after
that
the
fire
slowly
go
down
.
he
feel
more
and
more
that
his


experience
have
be
impersonal
,
and
not
Clara
.
he
love
she
.
there
be


a
big
tenderness
,
as
after
a
strong
emotion
they
have
know
together
;


but
it
be
not
she
who
could
keep
his
soul
steady
.
he
have
want
she
to


be
something
she
could
not
be
.




and
she
be
mad
with
desire
of
he
.
she
could
not
see
he
without


touch
he
.
in
the
factory
,
as
he
talk
to
she
about
Spiral
hose
,


she
run
her
hand
secretly
along
his
side
.
she
follow
he
out
into
the


basement
for
a
quick
kiss
;
her
eye
,
always
mute
and
yearning
,
full
of


unrestrained
passion
,
she
keep
fix
on
his
.
he
be
afraid
of
she
,
lest


she
should
too
flagrantly
give
herself
away
before
the
other
girl
.
she


invariably
wait
for
he
at
dinnertime
for
he
to
embrace
she
before

.
he

grey
of
the
dawn

the
far
,
desolate
reach
of
the
fenland

with
winter

way
down

beach

long
waste
of

golden
glitter

sun

up

fierily
over
the
wave
in
little
splash

go
along
and
the
light
have
spill
from
her
pail

down
the
shore

stroke

tiny
seagull

level

sun

faint


noise
of
the
water
,
the
sharp
crying
of
the
gull

they
would
separate

the
rest
of

an
ache

later
.
even
if
they
marry
,
and
be
faithful
to
each
other
,


still
he
would
have
to
leave
she
,
go
on
alone
,
and
she
would
only
have


to
attend
to
he
when
he
come
home
.

it

lose
,

also
go
,
everything

along


in
one
flood
.
he
become
,
not
a
man
with
a
mind
,
but
a
great
instinct
.


his
hand
be
like
creature
,
live
;
his
limb
,
his
body
,
be
all


life
and
consciousness
,
subject
to
no
will
of
his
,
but
live
in


themselves
.
just
as
he
be
,
so
it
seem
the
vigorous
,
wintry
star


be
strong
also
with
life
.
he
and
they
strike
with
the
same
pulse
of


fire
,
and
the
same
joy
of
strength
which
hold
the
bracken
-
frond
stiff


near
his
eye
hold
his
own
body
firm
.
it
be
as
if
he
,
and
the
star
,


and
the
dark
herbage
,
and
Clara
be
lick
up
in
an
immense
tongue
of


flame
,
which
tear
onwards
and
upwards
.
everything
rush
along
in


live
beside
he
;
everything
be
still
,
perfect
in
itself
,
along
with


he
.
this
wonderful
stillness
in
each
thing
in
itself
,
while
it
be


be
bear
along
in
a
very
ecstasy
of
living
,
seem
the
high
point


of
bliss
.




and
Clara
know
this
hold
he
to
she
,
so
she
trust
altogether
to
the


passion
.
it
,
however
,
fail
she
very
often
.
they
do
not
often
reach


again
the
height
of
that
once
when
the
peewit
have
call
.
gradually
,


some
mechanical
effort
spoil
their
loving
,
or
,
when
they
have
splendid


moment
,
they
have
they
separately
,
and
not
so
satisfactorily
.
so
often


he
seem
merely
to
be
run
on
alone
;
often
they
realise
it
have


be
a
failure
,
not
what
they
have
want
.
he
leave
she
,
know
_
that
_


evening
have
only
make
a
little
split
between
they
.
their
loving
grow


more
mechanical
,
without
the
marvellous
glamour
.
gradually
they
begin


to
introduce
novelty
,
to
get
back
some
of
the
feeling
of


satisfaction
.
they
would
be
very
near
,
almost
dangerously
near
to
the


river
,
so
that
the
black
water
run
not
far
from
his
face
,
and
it
give
a


little
thrill
;
or
they
love
sometimes
in
a
little
hollow
below
the


fence
of
the
path
where
people
be
pass
occasionally
,
on
the
edge


of
the
town
,
and
they
hear
footstep
come
,
almost
feel
the
vibration


of
the
tread
,
and
they
hear
what
the
passer
-
by
say

give
he
a
subtle
pleasure
.

great
—
too
great
.

sort
of
friendship


between

two
man
,
who
be
all
the
while
deadly
rival
.

Mrs.

at
first
they
use
to
carry

,
sometimes
even
into
the

but
they
keep

a
pretence
of
cheerfulness
.
every
morning
,


when
he
get
up
,
he
go
into
her
room
in
his
pyjama
.




"

.
and

the
while

but
there
be
the


dark
pain
-
circle
beneath
that
make

.




"

.




"

"
she
answer
.




he
sit
down
by
the
bed
,
miserably
.
she
have
a
way
of
curl
and
lie


on
her
side
,
like
a
child
.
the
grey
and
brown
hair
be
loose
over
she


ear
.




"

"
he
say
,
gently
put

back
.




"

"
she
reply
.




his
face
be
near
hers
.
her
blue
eye
smile
straight
into
his
,
like
a


girl’s
—
warm
,
laugh
with
tender
love
.
it
make
he
pant
with
terror
,


agony
,
and
love
.




"
you
want
your
hair
do
in
a
plait
,
"
he
say
.
"
lie
still
.
"




and
go
behind
she
,
he
carefully
loosen
her
hair
,
brush
it
out
.


it
be
like
fine
long
silk
of
brown
and
grey
.
her
head
be
snuggle


between
her
shoulder
.
as
he
lightly
brush
and
plait
her
hair
,
he


bite
his
lip
and
feel
dazed
.
it
all
seem
unreal
,
he
could
not


understand
it
.




at
night
he
often
work
in
her
room
,
look
up
from
time
to
time
.
and


so
often
he
find
her
blue
eye
fix
on
he
.
and
when
their
eye
meet
,


she
smile
.
he
work
away
again
mechanically
,
produce
good
stuff


without
know
what
he
be
do
.




sometimes
he
come
in
,
very
pale
and
still
,
with
watchful
,
sudden
eye
,


like
a
man
who
be
drunk
almost
to
death
.
they
be
both
afraid
of
the


veil
that
be
rip
between
they
.




then
she
pretend
to
be
well
,
chatter
to
he
gaily
,
make
a
great


fuss
over
some
scrap
of
news
.
for
they
have
both
come
to
the
condition


when
they
have
to
make
much
of
the
trifle
,
lest
they
should
give
in
to


the
big
thing
,
and
their
human
independence
would
go
smash
.
they
be


afraid
,
so
they
make
light
of
thing
and
be
gay
.




sometimes
as
she
lie
he
know
she
be
think
of
the
past
.
her
mouth


gradually
shut
hard
in
a
line
.
she
be
hold
herself
rigid
,
so
that


she
might
die
without
ever
utter
the
great
cry
that
be
tear
from


she
.
he
never
forget
that
hard
,
utterly
lonely
and
stubborn
clenching


of
her
mouth
,
which
persist
for
week
.
sometimes
,
when
it
be


lighter
,
she
talk
about
her
husband
.
now
she
hate
he
.
she
do
not


forgive
he
.
she
could
not
bear
he
to
be
in
the
room
.
and
a
few


thing
,
the
thing
that
have
be
most
bitter
to
she
,
come
up
again
so


strongly
that
they
break
from
she
,
and
she
tell
her
son
.




he
feel
as
if
his
life
be
be
destroy
,
piece
by
piece
,
within


he
.
often
the
tear
come
suddenly
.
he
run
to
the
station
,
the


tear
-
drop
fall
on
the
pavement
.
often
he
could
not
go
on
with
his


work
.
the
pen
stop
write
.
he
sit
stare
,
quite
unconscious
.
and


when
he
come
round
again
he
feel
sick
,
and
tremble
in
his
limb
.
he


never
question
what
it
be
.
his
mind
do
not
try
to
analyse
or


understand
.
he
merely
submit
,
and
keep
his
eye
shut
;
let
the
thing


go
over
he
.




his
mother
do
the
same
.
she
think
of
the
pain
,
of
the
morphia
,
of


the
next
day
;
hardly
ever
of
the
death
.
that
be
come
,
she
know
.
she


have
to
submit
to
it
.
but
she
would
never
entreat
it
or
make
friend


with
it
.
blind
,
with
her
face
shut
hard
and
blind
,
she
be
push


towards
the
door
.
the
day
pass
,
the
week
,
the
month
.




sometimes
,
in
the
sunny
afternoon
,
she
seem
almost
happy
.




"
I
try
to
think
of
the
nice
time
—
when
we
go
to
Mablethorpe
,
and


Robin
Hood
’s
Bay
,
and
Shanklin
,
"
she
say
.
"
after
all
,
not
everybody


have
see
those
beautiful
place
.
and
be
n’t
it
beautiful
!
I
try
to


think
of
that
,
not
of
the
other
thing
.
"




then
,
again
,
for
a
whole
evening
she
speak
not
a
word
;
neither
do
he
.


they
be
together
,
rigid
,
stubborn
,
silent
.
he
go
into
his
room
at


last
to
go
to
bed
,
and
lean
against
the
doorway
as
if
paralyse
,


unable
to
go
any
far
.
his
consciousness
go
.
a
furious
storm
,
he


know
not
what
,
seem
to
ravage
inside
he
.
he
stand
lean
there
,


submit
,
never
question
.




in
the
morning
they
be
both
normal
again
,
though
her
face
be
grey


with
the
morphia
,
and
her
body
feel
like
ash
.
but
they
be
bright


again
,
nevertheless
.
often
,
especially
if
Annie
or
Arthur
be
at
home
,


he
neglect
she
.
he
do
not
see
much
of
Clara
.
usually
he
be
with


man
.
he
be
quick
and
active
and
lively
;
but
when
his
friend
see
he


go
white
to
the
gill
,
his
eye
dark
and
glitter
,
they
have
a
certain


mistrust
of
he
.
sometimes
he
go
to
Clara
,
but
she
be
almost
cold
to


he
.




"
take
I
!
"
he
say
simply
.




occasionally
she
would
.
but
she
be
afraid
.
when
he
have
she
then
,
there


be
something
in
it
that
make
she
shrink
away
from
he
—
something


unnatural
.
she
grow
to
dread
he
.
he
be
so
quiet
,
yet
so
strange
.
she


be
afraid
of
the
man
who
be
not
there
with
she
,
whom
she
could
feel


behind
this
make
-
belief
lover
;
somebody
sinister
,
that
fill
she
with


horror
.
she
begin
to
have
a
kind
of
horror
of
he
.
it
be
almost
as
if


he
be
a
criminal
.
he
want
she
—
he
have
she
—
and
it
make
she
feel
as
if


death
itself
have
she
in
its
grip
.
she
lie
in
horror
.
there
be
no
man


there
love
she
.
she
almost
hate
he
.
then
come
little
bout
of


tenderness
.
but
she
dare
not
pity
he
.




dawe
have
come
to
Colonel
Seely
’s
Home
near
Nottingham
.
there
Paul

he
sometimes
,
Clara
very
occasionally
.
between
the
two
man

friendship
develop
peculiarly
.
Dawes
,
who
mend
very
slowly
and


seem
very
feeble
,
seem
to
leave
himself
in
the
hand
of
Morel
.




in
the
beginning
of
November
Clara
remind
Paul
that
it
be
she


birthday
.




"
I
’d
nearly
forget
,
"
he
say
.




"
I
’d
think
quite
,
"
she
reply
.




"
no
.
shall
we
go
to
the
seaside
for
the
week
-
end
?
"




they
go
.
it
be
cold
and
rather
dismal
.
she
wait
for
he
to
be
warm


and
tender
with
she
,
instead
of
which
he
seem
hardly
aware
of
she
.
he


sit
in
the
railway
-
carriage
,
look
out
,
and
be
startled
when
she


speak
to
he
.
he
be
not
definitely
think
.
thing
seem
as
if
they


do
not
exist
.
she
go
across
to
he
.




"
what
be
it
dear
?
"
she
ask
.




"
nothing
!
"
he
say
.
"
do
n’t
those
windmill
sail
look
monotonous
?
"




he
sat
hold
her
hand
.
he
could
not
talk
nor
think
.
it
be
a
comfort
,


however
,
to
sit
hold
her
hand
.
she
be
dissatisfied
and
miserable
.


he
be
not
with
she
;
she
be
nothing
.




and
in
the
evening
they
sit
among
the
sandhill
,
look
at
the
black
,


heavy
sea
.




"
she
will
never
give
in
,
"
he
say
quietly
.




Clara
’s
heart
sink
.




"
no
,
"
she
reply
.




"

different
way
of

hunted
look

to


yield
himself

the
small
possible
compass

as

go
about


arrange
,
and
as
he
sat
talk
,
there
seem
something
false
about


he

out
of
tune
.
watch
he
unknown
,
she
say
to
herself
there


be
no
stability
about
he
.
he
be
fine
in
his
way
,
passionate
,
and


able
to
give
her
drink
of
pure
life
when
he
be
in
one
mood
.
and
now


he
look
paltry
and
insignificant
.
there
be
nothing
stable
about
he
.


her
husband
have
more
manly
dignity
.
at
any
rate
_
he
_
do
not
waft
about


with
any
wind
.
there
be
something
evanescent
about
Morel
,
she
think
,


something
shift
and
false
.
he
would
never
make
sure
ground
for
any


woman
to
stand
on
.
she
despise
he
rather
for
his
shrink
together
,


get
small
.
her
husband
at
least
be
manly
,
and
when
he
be
beat


give
in
.
but
this
other
would
never
own
to
be
beat
.
he
would
shift


round
and
round
,
prowl
,
get
small
.
she
despise
he
.
and
yet
she


watch
he
rather
than
Dawes
,
and
it
seem
as
if
their
three
fate


lie
in
his
hand
.
she
hate
he
for
it
.




she
seem
to
understand
well
now
about
man
,
and
what
they
could
or


would
do
.
she
be
less
afraid
of
they
,
more
sure
of
herself
.
that
they


be
not
the
small
egoist
she
have
imagine
they
make
she
more


comfortable
.
she
have
learn
a
good
deal
—
almost
as
much
as
she
want


to
learn
.
her
cup
have
be
full
.
it
be
still
as
full
as
she
could


carry

on
the
whole
,
she
would
not
be
sorry
when
he
be
go
.




they
have
dinner
,
and
sit
eat
nut
and
drink
by
the
fire
.
not
a


serious
word
have
be
speak
.
yet
Clara
realise
that
Morel
be


withdraw
from
the
circle
,
leave
she
the
option
to
stay
with
she


husband
.
it
anger
she
.
he
be
a
mean
fellow
,
after
all
,
to
take
what


he
want
and
then
give
she
back
.
she
do
not
remember
that
she
herself


have
have
what
she
want
,
and
really
,
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
,
wish


to
be
give
back
.




Paul
feel
crumple
up
and
lonely
.
his
mother
have
really
support
his


life
.
he
have
love
she
;
they
two
have

now
she
be
go
,
and
for
ever
behind
he
be
the
gap
in


life
,
the
tear
in
the
veil
,
through
which
his
life
seem
to
drift


slowly
,
as
if
he
be
draw
towards
death
.
he
want
someone
of
their


own
free
initiative
to
help
he
.
the
less
thing
he
begin
to
let
go


from
he
,
for
fear
of
this
big
thing
,
the
lapse
towards
death
,


follow
in
the
wake
of
his
beloved
.
Clara
could
not
stand
for
he
to


hold
on
to
.
she
want
he
,
but
not
to
understand
he
.
he
feel
she


want
the
man
on
top
,
not
the
real
he
that
be
in
trouble
.
that
would


be
too
much
trouble
to
she
;
he
dared
not

it
she
.
she
could
not


cope
with
he
.
it
make
he
ashamed
.
so
,
secretly
ashamed
because
he
be


in
such
a
mess
,
because
his
own
hold
on
life
be
so
unsure
,
because


nobody
hold
he
,
feel
unsubstantial
,
shadowy
,
as
if
he
do
not
count


for
much
in
this
concrete
world
,
he
draw
himself
together
small
and


small
.
he
do
not
want
to
die
;
he
would
not
give
in
.
but
he
be
not


afraid
of
death
.
if
nobody
would
help
,
he
would
go
on
alone
.




dawe
have
be
drive
to
the
extremity
of
life
,
until
he
be
afraid
.
he


could
go
to
the
brink
of
death
,
he
could
lie
on
the
edge
and
look
in
.


then
,
cow
,
afraid
,
he
have
to
crawl
back
,
and
like
a
beggar
take
what

there
be

DERELICT




Clara
go
with
her
husband
to
Sheffield
,
and
Paul
scarcely
see
she


again
.
Walter
Morel
seem
to
have
let
all
the
trouble
go
over
he
,
and


there
he
be
,
crawl
about
on
the
mud
of
it
,
just
the
same
.
there
be


scarcely
any
bond
between
father
and
son
,
save
that
each
feel
he
must


not
let
the
other
go
in
any
actual
want
.
as
there
be
no
one
to
keep
on


the
home
,
and
as
they
could
neither
of
they
bear
the
emptiness
of
the


house
,
Paul
take
lodging
in
Nottingham
,
and
Morel
go
to
live
with
a


friendly
family
in
Bestwood
.




everything
seem
to
have
go
smash
for
the
young
man
.
he
could
not


paint
.
the
picture
he
finish
on
the
day
of
his
mother
’s
death
—
one


that
satisfy
he
—
be
the
last
thing
he
do
.
at
work
there
be
no


Clara
.
when
he
come
home
he
could
not
take
up
his
brush
again
.
there


be
nothing
leave
.




so
he
be
always
in
the
town
at
one
place
or
another
,
drink
,


knock
about
with
the
man
he
know
.
it
really
weary
he
.
he
talk


to
barmaid
,
to
almost
any
woman
,
but
there
be
that
dark
,
strained


look
in
his
eye
,
as
if
he
be
hunt
something
.




everything
seem
so
different
,
so
unreal
.
there
seem
no
reason
why


people
should
go
along
the
street
,
and
house
pile
up
in
the
daylight
.


there
seem
no
reason
why
these
thing
should
occupy
the
space
,


instead
of
leave
it
empty
.
his
friend
talk
to
he
:
he
hear
the


sound
,
and
he
answer
.
but
why
there
should
be
the
noise
of
speech
he


could
not
understand
.




he
be
most
himself
when
he
be
alone
,
or
work
hard
and
mechanically


at
the
factory
.
in
the
latter
case
there
be
pure
forgetfulness
,
when


he
lapse
from
consciousness
.
but
it
have
to
come
to
an
end
.
it
hurt
he


so
,
that
thing
have
lose
their
reality
.
the
first
snowdrop
come
.
he


see
the
tiny
drop
-
pearl
among
the
grey
.
they
would
have
give
he
the


lively
emotion
at
one
time
.
now
they
be
there
,
but
they
do
not


seem
to
mean
anything
.
in
a
few
moment
they
would
cease
to
occupy
that


place
,
and
just
the
space
would
be
,
where
they
have
be
.
tall
,


brilliant
tram
-
car
run
along
the
street
at
night
.
it
seem
almost
a


wonder
they
should
trouble
to
rustle
backwards
and
forwards
.
"
why


trouble
to
go
tilt
down
to
Trent
Bridges
?
"
he
ask
of
the
big


tram
.
it
seem
they
just
as
well
might
_
not
_
be
as
be
.




the
real
thing
be
the
thick
darkness
at
night
.
that
seem
to
he


whole
and
comprehensible
and
restful
.
he
could
leave
himself
to
it
.


suddenly
a
piece
of
paper
start
near
his
foot
and
blow
along
down
the


pavement
.
he
stand
still
,
rigid
,
with
clenched
fist
,
a
flame
of
agony


go
over
he
.
and
he
see
again
the
sick
-
room
,
his
mother
,
her
eye
.


unconsciously
he
have
be
with
she
,
in
her
company
.
the
swift
hop
of


the
paper
remind
he
she
be
go
.
but
he
have
be
with
she
.
he


want
everything
to
stand
still
,
so
that
he
could
be
with
she
again
.




the
day
pass
,
the
week
.
but
everything
seem
to
have
fuse
,
go


into
a
conglomerate
mass
.
he
could
not
tell
one
day
from
another
,
one


week
from
another
,
hardly
one
place
from
another
.
nothing
be
distinct


or
distinguishable
.
often
he
lose
himself
for
an
hour
at
a
time
,
could


not
remember
what
he
have
do
.




one
evening
he
come
home
late
to
his
lodging
.
the
fire
be
burn
low
;


everybody
be
in
bed
.
he
throw
on
some
more
coal
,
glance
at
the
table
,


and
decide
he
want
no
supper
.
then
he
sit
down
in
the
arm
-
chair
.
it


be
perfectly
still
.
he
do
not
know
anything
,
yet
he
see
the
dim
smoke


waver
up
the
chimney
.
presently
two
mouse
come
out
,
cautiously
,


nibble
the
fallen
crumb
.
he
watch
they
as
it
be
from
a
long
way


off
.
the
church
clock
strike
two
.
far
away
he
could
hear
the
sharp


clink
of
the
truck
on
the
railway
.
no
,
it
be
not
they
that
be


far
away
.
they
be
there
in
their
place
.
but
where
be
he
himself
?




the
time
pass
.
the
two
mouse
,
career
wildly
,
scamper
cheekily


over
his
slipper
.
he
have
not
move
a
muscle
.
he
do
not
want
to
move
.


he
be
not
think
of
anything
.
it
be
easy
so
.
there
be
no
wrench


of
know
anything
.
then
,
from
time
to
time
,
some
other
consciousness
,


work
mechanically
,
flash
into
sharp
phrase
.




"
what
be
I
do
?
"




and
out
of
the
semi
-
intoxicated
trance
come
the
answer
:




"
destroy
myself
.
"




then
a
dull
,
live
feeling
,
go
in
an
instant
,
tell
he
that
it
be


wrong
.
after
a
while
,
suddenly
come
the
question
:




"
why
wrong
?
"




again
there
be

"

"
he
say
;
and
he
take
they
out
of
the
jar
,
dripping
as
they


be
,
and
go
quickly
into
the
kitchen
.
she
wait
for

,
take
the


flower
,
and

go
out
together
,

dead
.




she
be

from
he
now
.
in
her
misery
she
lean
against
he
as


they
sit
on
the
car
.
he
be
unresponsive
.
where
would
he
go
?
what
would


be
the
end
of
he
?
she
could
not
bear
it
,
the
vacant
feeling
where
he


should
be
.
he
be
so
foolish
,
so
wasteful
,
never
at
peace
with
himself
.


and
now
where
would
he
go
?
and
what
do
he
care
that
he
waste
she
?
he


have
no
religion
;
it
be
all
for
the
moment
’s
attraction
that
he
care
,


nothing
else
,
nothing
deep
.
well
,
she
would
wait
and
see
how
it


turn
out
with
he
.
when
he
have
have
enough
he
would
give
in
and
come


to
she
.




he
shake
hand
and
leave
she
at
the
door
of
her
cousin
’s
house
.
when
he


turn
away
he
feel
the
last
hold
for
he
have
go
.
the
town
,
as
he
sit


upon
the
car
,
stretch
away
over
the
bay
of
railway
,
a
level
fume
of


light
.
beyond
the
town
the
country
,
little
smoulder
spot
for
more


town
—
the
sea
—
the
night
—
on
and
on
!
and
he
have
no
place
in
it
!
whatever


spot
he
stand
on
,
there
he
stand
alone
.
from
his
breast
,
from
his


mouth
,
spring
the
endless
space
,
and
it
be
there
behind
he
,


everywhere
.
the
people
hurry
along
the
street
offer
no


obstruction
to
the
void
in
which
he
find
himself
.
they
be
small


shadow
whose
footstep
and
voice
could
be
hear
,
but
in
each
of
they


the
same
night
,
the
same
silence
.
he
get
off
the
car
.
in
the
country


all
be
dead
still
.
little
star
shine
high
up
;
little
star
spread
far


away
in
the
flood
-
water
,
a
firmament
below
.
everywhere
the
vastness


and
terror
of
the
immense
night
which
be
rouse
and
stir
for
a
brief


while
by
the
day
,
but
which
return
,
and
will
remain
at
last
eternal
,


hold
everything
in
its
silence
and
its
living
gloom
.
there
be
no


time
,
only
space
.
who
could
say
his
mother
have
live
and
do
not
live
?


she
have
be
in
one
place
,
and
be
in
another
;
that
be
all
.
and
his


soul
could
not
leave
she
,
wherever
she
be
.
now
she
be
go
abroad


into
the
night
,
and
he
be
with
she
still
.
they
be
together
.
but
yet


there
be
his
body
,
his
chest
,
that
lean
against
the
stile
,
his
hand


on
the
wooden
bar
.
they
seem
something
.
where
be
he?—one
tiny


upright
speck
of
flesh
,
less
than
an
ear
of
wheat
lose
in
the
field
.
he


could
not
bear
it
.
on
every
side
the
immense
dark
silence
seem


press
he
,
so
tiny
a
spark
,
into
extinction
,
and
yet
,
almost


nothing
,
he
could
not
be
extinct
.
night
,
in
which
everything
be
lose
,


go
reach
out
,
beyond
star
and
sun
.
star
and
sun
,
a
few
bright


grain
,
went
spin
round
for
terror
,
and
hold
each
other
in


embrace
,
there
in
a
darkness
that
outpasse
they
all
,
and
leave
they


tiny
and
daunt
.
so
much
,
and
himself
,
infinitesimal
,
at
the
core
a


nothingness
,
and
yet
not
nothing
.




"
Mother
!
"
he
whimpered—“mother
!
"




she
be
the
only
thing
that
hold
he
up
,
himself
,
amid
all
this
.
and


she
be
go
,
intermingle
herself
.
he
want
she
to
touch
he
,
have


he
alongside
with
she
.




but
no
,
he
would
not
give
in
.
turn
sharply
,
he
walk
towards
the


city
’s
gold
phosphorescence
.
his
fist
be
shut
,
his
mouth
set
fast
.


he
would
not
take
that
direction
,
to
the
darkness
,
to
follow
she
.
he


walk
towards
the
faintly
humming
,
glow
town
,
quickly
.

END
