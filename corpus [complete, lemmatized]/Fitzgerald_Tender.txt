an
isolated

,
whence
one
June
morning
in
1925
a
victoria
bring
a
woman
and
her
daughter
down
to
Gausse
's
Hotel
.
the
mother
's
face
be
of
a
fade
prettiness
that
would
soon
be
pat
with
break
vein
;
her
expression
be
both
tranquil
and
aware
in
a
pleasant
way
.
however
,
one
's
eye
move
on
quickly
to
her
daughter
,
who
have
magic
in
her
pink
palm
and
her
cheek
light
to
a
lovely
flame
,
like
the
thrilling
flush
of
child
after
their
cold
bath
in
the
evening
.
her
fine
forehead
slope
gently
up
to
where
her
hair
,
border
it
like
an
armorial
shield
,
burst
into
lovelock
and
wave
and
curlicue
of
ash
blonde
and
gold
.
her
eye
be
bright
,
big
,
clear
,
wet
,
and
shine
,
the
color
of
her
cheek
be
real
,
break
close
to
the
surface
from
the
strong
young
pump
of
her
heart
.
her
body
hover
delicately
on
the
last
edge
of
childhood
--
she
be
almost
eighteen
,
nearly
complete
,
but
the
dew
be
still
on
she
.




as
sea
and
sky
appear
below
they
in
a
thin
,
hot
line
the
mother
say
:




"

home
anyhow
,
"
the
girl
answer
.




they
both
speak
cheerfully
but
be
obviously
without
direction
and
bore
by
the
fact
--
moreover
,
just
any
direction
would
not
do
.
they
want
high
excitement
,
not
from
the
necessity
of
stimulate
jaded
nerve
but
with
the
avidity
of
prize
-
win
schoolchildren
who
deserve
their
vacation
.




"
we
'll
stay
three
day
and
then
go
home
.
I
'll
wire

"




at
the
hotel
the
girl
make
the
reservation
in
idiomatic
but
rather
flat
French

the
stone
veranda
that
run
the
length
of
the

dancer
,
not
slump
down
on
her
hip

back

water
.
when

back
toward

and
a
pair
of

gaze

man

the
monocle
,
which
go
into
hiding
amid
the
facetious
whisker
of
his
chest
,
and
pour
himself
a
glass
of
something
from
a
bottle
in
his
hand
.




Rosemary
lay
her
face
on
the
water
and
swam
a
choppy
little
four

beat
crawl
out
to
the
raft
.

water
reach
up
for
she
,
pull
she
down
tenderly
out
of
the
heat
,
seep
in
her
hair
and
run
into
the
corner
of
her
body
.
she
turn
round
and
round
in
it
,
embrace
it
,
wallow
in
it
.
reach
the
raft

be
out
of
breath
,
but
a
tan
woman
with
very
white
tooth
look
down
at
she
,
and
Rosemary
,
suddenly
conscious
of
the
raw
whiteness
of
her
own
body
,
turn
on
her
back
and
drift
toward
shore
.
the
hairy
man
hold
the
bottle

to
she
as
she
come
out
.




"
I
say

.
"




"

exclaim
Rosemary
.




"

in
for
the
refuse

"




glaze
his
eye
to
indicate
that
he
have
only
speak
in
order
to
warn
she
,
he
mince
off
two
step
and
pour
himself
another
drink
.




not
unpleasantly
self
-
conscious
,
since
there
have
be
a
slight
sway
of
attention
toward
she
during
this
conversation
,
Rosemary
look
for
a
place
to
sit
.
obviously
each
family
possess
the
strip
of
sand
immediately
in
front
of
its
umbrella
;
besides
there
be
much
visit
and
talk
back
and
forth
--
the
atmosphere
of
a
community
upon
which
it
would
be
presumptuous
to
intrude
.
far
up
,
where
the
beach
be
strew
with
pebble
and
dead
sea
-
weed
,
sit
a
group
with
flesh
as
white
as
her
own
.
they
lie
under
small
hand
-
parasol
instead
of
beach
umbrella
and
be
obviously
less
indigenous
to
the
place
.
between
the
dark
people
and
the
light
,
Rosemary
find
room
and
spread
out
her
peignoir
on
the
sand
.




lie
so
,
she
first
hear
their
voice
and
feel
their
foot
skirt
her
body
and
their
shape
pass
between
the
sun
and
herself
.
the
breath
of
an
inquisitive
dog
blow
warm
and
nervous
on
her
neck
;
she
could
feel
her
skin
broil
a
little
in
the
heat
and
hear
the
small
exhaust
wa
-
waa
of
the
expire
wave
.
presently
her
ear
distinguish
individual
voice
and
she
become
aware
that
some
one
refer
to
scornfully
as
"
that
North
guy
"
have
kidnap
a
waiter
from
a
café
in
Cannes
last
night
in
order
to
saw
he
in
two
.
the
sponsor
of
the
story
be
a
white
-
haired
woman
in
full
evening
dress
,
obviously
a
relic
of
the
previous
evening
,
for
a
tiara
still
clung
to
her
head
and
a
discouraged
orchid
expire
from
her
shoulder
.
Rosemary
,
form
a
vague
antipathy
to
she
and
her
companion
,
turn
away
.




Nearest
she
,
on
the
other
side
,
a
young
woman
lie
under
a
roof
of
umbrella
make
out
a
list
of
thing
from
a
book
open
on
the
sand
.
her
bathing
suit
be
pull
off
her
shoulder
and
her
back
,
a
ruddy
,
orange
brown
,
set
off
by
a
string
of
creamy
pearl
,
shine
in
the
sun
.
her
face
be
hard
and
lovely
and
pitiful
.
her
eye
meet
Rosemary
's
but
do
not
see
she
.
beyond
she
be
a
fine
man
in
a
jockey
cap
and
red
-
stripe
tight
;
then
the
woman
Rosemary
have
see
on
the
raft
,
and
who
look
back
at
she
,
see
she
;
then
a
man
with
a
long
face
and
a
golden
,
leonine
head
,
with
blue
tight
and
no
hat
,
talk
very
seriously
to
an
unmistakably
latin
young
man
in
black
tight
,
both
of
they
pick
at
little
piece
of
seaweed
in
the
sand
.
she
think
they
be
mostly
Americans
,
but
something
make
they
unlike
the
Americans
she
have
know
of
late
.




after
a
while
she
realize
that
the
man
in
the
jockey
cap
be
give
a
quiet
little
performance
for
this
group
;
he
move
gravely
about
with
a
rake
,
ostensibly
remove
gravel
and
meanwhile
develop
some
esoteric
burlesque
hold
in
suspension
by
his
grave
face
.
its
faint
ramification
have
become
hilarious
,
until
whatever
he
say
release
a
burst
of
laughter
.
even
those
who
,
like
herself
,
be
too
far
away
to
hear
,
send
out
antennæ
of
attention
until
the
only
person
on
the
beach
not
catch
up
in
it
be
the
young
woman
with
the
string
of
pearl
.
perhaps
from
modesty
of
possession
she
respond
to
each
salvo
of
amusement
by
bend
close
over
her
list
.




the
man
of
the
monocle
and
bottle

suddenly
out
of
the
sky
above

this
feeling
be
surcharge
by
listen
to
the
sad
tune
of
the
orchestra
,

of
the
melancholy

somewhere
about

about
an
enormous
pine
,
the
big
tree
in
the
garden
.
she
pause
there
a
moment
,
look
absently
at
a
growth
of
nasturtium
and
iris
tangle
at
its
foot
,
as
though
spring
from
a
careless
handful
of
seed
,
listen
to
the
plaint
and
accusation
of
some
nursery
squabble
in
the
house
.
when
this
die
away
on
the
summer
air
,
she
walk
on
,
between
kaleidoscopic
peony
mass
in
pink
cloud
,
black
and
brown
tulip
and
fragile
mauve
-
stem
rose
,
transparent
like
sugar
flower
in
a
confectioner
's
window
--
until
,
as
if
the
scherzo
of
color
could
reach
no
further
intensity
,
it
break
off
suddenly
in
mid
-
air
,
and
moist
step
go
down
to
a
level
five
foot
below
.




here
there
be
a
well
with
the
boarding
around
it
dank
and
slippery
even
on
the
bright
day
.
she
go
up
the
stair
on
the
other
side
and
into
the
vegetable
garden
;
she
walk
rather
quickly
;
she
like
to
be
active
,
though
at
time
she
give
an
impression
of
repose
that
be
at
once
static
and
evocative
.
this
be
because
she
know
few
word
and
believe
in
none
,
and
in
the
world
she
be
rather
silent
,
contribute
just
her
share
of
urbane
humor
with
a
precision
that
approach
meagreness
.
but
at
the
moment
when
stranger
tend
to
grow
uncomfortable
in
the
presence
of
this
economy
she
would
seize
the
topic
and
rush
off
with
it
,
feverishly
surprised
with
herself
--
then
bring
it
back
and
relinquish
it
abruptly
,
almost
timidly
,
like
an
obedient
retriever
,
having
be
adequate
and
something
more
.




as
she
stand
in
the
fuzzy
green
light
of
the
vegetable
garden
,
Dick
cross
the
path
ahead
of
she
go
to
his
work
house
.
Nicole
wait
silently
till
he
have
pass
;
then
she
go
on
through
line
of
prospective
salad
to
a
little
menagerie
where
pigeon
and
rabbit
and
a
parrot
make
a
medley
of
insolent
noise
at
she
.
descend
to
another
ledge
she
reach
a
low
,
curved
wall
and
look
down
seven
hundred
foot
to
the
Mediterranean
Sea
.




she
stand
in
the
ancient
hill
village
of
Tarmes
.
the
villa
and
its
ground
be
make
out
of
a
row
of
peasant
dwelling
that
abut
on
the
cliff
--
five
small
house
have
be
combine
to
make
the
house
and
four
destroy
to
make
the
garden
.
the
exterior
wall
be
untouched
so
that
from
the
road
far
below
it
be
indistinguishable
from
the
violet
gray
mass
of
the
town
.




for
a
moment
Nicole
stand
look
down
at
the
Mediterranean
but
there
be
nothing
to
do
with
that
,
even
with
her
tireless
hand
.
presently
Dick
come
out
of
his
one
-
room
house
carry
a
telescope
and
look
east
toward
Cannes
.
in
a
moment
Nicole
swam
into
his
field
of
vision
,
whereupon
he
disappear
into
his
house
and
come
out
with
a
megaphone
.
he
have
many
light
mechanical
device
.




"
Nicole
,
"
he
shout
,
"
I
forgot
to
tell
you
that
as
a
final
apostolic
gesture
I
invite
Mrs.
Abrams
,
the
woman
with
the
white
hair
.
"




"
I
suspect
it
.
it
be
an
outrage
.
"




the
ease
with
which
her
reply
reach
he
seem
to
belittle
his
megaphone
,
so
she
raise
her
voice
and
call
,
"
can
you
hear
I
?
"




"
yes
.
"
he
lower
the
megaphone
and
then
raise
it
stubbornly
.
"
I
be
go
to
invite
some
more
people
too
.
I
be
go
to
invite
the
two
young
man
.
"




"
all
right
,
"
she
agree
placidly
.




"
I
want
to
give
a
really
bad
party
.
I
mean
it
.
I
want
to
give
a
party
where
there
be
a
brawl
and
seduction
and
people
go
home
with
their
feeling
hurt
and
woman
pass
out
in
the
cabinet
de
toilette
.
you
wait
and
see
.
"




he
go
back
into
his
house
and
Nicole
see
that
one
of
his
most
characteristic
mood
be
upon
he
,
the
excitement
that
sweep
everyone
up
into
it
and
be
inevitably
follow
by
his
own
form
of
melancholy
,
which
he
never
display
but
at
which
she
guess
.
this
excitement
about
thing
reach
an
intensity
out
of
proportion
to
their
importance
,
generate
a
really
extraordinary
virtuosity
with
people
.
save
among
a
few
of
the
tough
-
minded
and
perennially
suspicious
,
he
have
the
power
of
arouse
a
fascinated
and
uncritical
love
.
the
reaction
come
when
he
realize
the
waste
and
extravagance
involve
.
he
sometimes
look
back
with
awe
at
the
carnival
of
affection
he
have
give
,
as
a
general
might
gaze
upon
a
massacre
he
have
order
to
satisfy
an
impersonal
blood
lust
.




but
to
be
include
in
Dick
Diver
's
world
for
a
while
be
a
remarkable
experience
:
people
believe
he
make
special
reservation
about
they
,
recognize
the
proud
uniqueness
of
their
destiny
,
bury
under
the
compromise
of
how
many
year
.
he
win
everyone
quickly
with
an
exquisite
consideration
and
a
politeness
that
move
so
fast
and
intuitively
that
it
could
be
examine
only
in
its
effect
.
then
,
without
caution
,
lest
the
first
bloom
of
the
relation
wither
,
he
open
the
gate
to
his
amusing
world
.
so
long
as
they
subscribe
to
it
completely
,
their
happiness
be
his
preoccupation
,
but
at
the
first
flicker
of
doubt
as
to
its
all
-
inclusiveness
he
evaporate
before
their
eye
,
leave
little
communicable
memory
of
what
he
have
say
or
do
.




at
eight
-
thirty
that
evening
he
come
out
to
meet
his
first
guest
,
his
coat
carry
rather
ceremoniously
,
rather
promisingly
,
in
his
hand
,
like
a
toreador
's
cape
.
it
be
characteristic
that
after
greet
Rosemary
and
her
mother
he
wait
for
they
to
speak
first
,
as
if
to
allow
they
the
reassurance
of
their
own
voice
in
new
surrounding
.




to
resume
Rosemary
's
point
of
view
it
should
be
say
that
,
under
the
spell
of
the
climb
to
Tarmes
and
the
fresher
air
,
she
and
her
mother
look
about
appreciatively
.
just
as
the
personal
quality
of
extraordinary
people
can
make
themselves
plain
in
an
unaccustomed
change
of
expression
,
so
the
intensely
calculate
perfection
of
Villa
Diana
transpire
all
at
once
through
such
minute
failure
as
the
chance
apparition
of
a
maid
in
the
background
or
the
perversity
of
a
cork
.
while
the
first
guest
arrive
bring
with
they
the
excitement
of
the
night
,
the
domestic
activity
of
the
day
recede
past
they
gently
,
symbolize
by
the
Diver
child
and
their
governess
still
at
supper
on
the
terrace
.




"
what
a
beautiful
garden
!
"
Mrs.
Speers
exclaim
.




"
Nicole
's
garden
,
"
say
Dick
.
"
she
wo
n't
let
it
alone
--
she
nag
it
all
the
time
,
worry
about
its
disease
.
any
day
now
I
expect
to
have
she
come
down
with
Powdery
Mildew
or
Fly
Speck
,
or
Late
Blight
.
"
he
point
his
forefinger
decisively
at
Rosemary
,
say
with
a
lightness
seem
to
conceal
a
paternal
interest
,
"
I
be
go
to
save
your
reason
--
i'm
go
to
give
you
a
hat
to
wear
on
the
beach
.
"




he
turn
they
from
the
garden
to
the
terrace
,
where
he
pour
a
cocktail
.
Earl
Brady
arrive
,
discover
Rosemary
with
surprise
.
his
manner
be
soft
than
at
the
studio
,
as
if
his
differentness
have
be
put
on
at
the
gate
,
and
Rosemary
,
compare
he
instantly
with
Dick
Diver
,
swing
sharply
toward
the
latter
.
in
comparison
Earl
Brady
seem
faintly
gross
,
faintly
ill
-
bred
;
once
more
,
though
,
she
feel
an
electric
response
to
his
person
.




he
speak
familiarly
to
the
child
who
be
get
up
from
their
outdoor
supper
.




"
hello
,
Lanier
,
how
about

"




"
what

agree
the
little
boy
,
with
the
odd
chant
accent
of
american
child
bring
up
in
France

"

song
about

brother
and
sister

side
by
side
without

consciousness

voice
soar
sweet
and
shrill
upon
the

the
singing
cease
and
the
child
,
their
face
aglow
with
the
late
sunshine
,
stand
smile
calmly
at
their
success
.
Rosemary
be
think
that
the
Villa
Diana
be
the
centre
of
the
world
.
on
such
a
stage
some
memorable
thing
be
sure
to
happen
.
she
light
up
higher
as
the
gate
tinkle
open
and
the
rest
of
the
guest
arrive
in
a
body
--
the
McKiscos
,
Mrs.
Abrams
,
Mr.
Dumphry
,
and
Mr.
Campion
come
up
to
the
terrace
.




Rosemary
have
a
sharp
feeling
of
disappointment
--
she
look
quickly
at
Dick
,
as
though
to
ask
an
explanation
of
this
incongruous
mingling
.
but
there
be
nothing
unusual
in
his
expression
.
he
greet
his
new
guest
with
a
proud
bearing
and
an
obvious
deference
to
their
infinite
and
unknown
possibility
.
she
believe
in
he
so
much
that
presently
she
accept
the
rightness
of
the
McKiscos
'
presence
as
if
she
have
expect
to
meet
they
all
along
.




"

to
Abe

"




the
interchange
fill
a
pause
and
Rosemary
's
instinct
be
that
something
tactful
should
be
say
by
somebody
,
but
Dick
make
no
attempt
to
break
up
the
grouping
form
by
these
late
arrival
,
not
even
to
disarm
Mrs.
McKisco
of
her
air
of
supercilious
amusement
.
he
do
not
solve
this
social
problem
because
he
know
it
be
not
of
importance
at
the
moment
and
would
solve
itself
.
he
be
save
his
newness
for
a
large
effort

wait
a
more
significant
moment
for
his
guest

of
a
good
time

Rosemary
stand
beside
Tommy
Barban

he
be
in
a
particularly
scornful
mood

there
seem
to
be
some
special
stimulus

she
consider
this

no
avail

the
Divers

want
to
stay
near
they
forever
.




"
you
be
half
american

she
say
,
as
if
that
should
solve
the
problem
.




"
also
I

I
hope
I

not

you
the
impression

"
how
could
any
one
help
it
?
"
she
say
simply
.




she
feel
far
from
he
.
the
undertone
of
his
word
repel
she
and
she
withdraw
her
adoration
for
the
Divers
from
the
profanity
of
his
bitterness
.
she
be
glad
he
be
not
next
to
she
at
dinner
and
she
be
still
think
of
his
word
"
especially
she
"
as
they
move
toward
the
table
in
the
garden
.




for
a
moment
now
she
be
beside
Dick
Diver
on
the
path
.
alongside
his
hard
,
neat
brightness
everything
fade
into
the
surety
that
he
know
everything
.
for
a
year
,
which
be
forever
,
she
have
have
money
and
a
certain
celebrity
and
contact
with
the
celebrated
,
and
these
latter
have
present
themselves
merely
as
powerful
enlargement
of
the
people
with
whom
the
doctor
's
widow
and
her
daughter
have
associate
in
a
hôtel
-
pension
in
Paris
.
Rosemary
be
a
romantic
and
her
career
have
not
provide
many
satisfactory
opportunity
on
that
score
.
her
mother
,
with
the
idea
of
a
career
for
Rosemary
,
would
not
tolerate
any
such
spurious
substitute
as
the
excitation
available
on
all
side
,
and
indeed
Rosemary
be
already
beyond
that
--
she
be
in
the
movie
but
not
at
all
at
they
.
so
when
she
have
see
approval
of
Dick
Diver
in
her
mother
's
face
it
mean
that
he
be
"
the
real
thing
"
;
it
mean
permission
to
go
as
far
as
she
could
.




"
I
be
watch
you

he
say
,
and
she
know
he

she
say
quietly
.
he
pretend
not
to
have
hear

as
if
the
compliment
be
purely
formal
.




"

he

,

"




with
that
remark
,
which
she
do
not
understand
precisely
,
she
find
herself
at
the
table
,
pick
out
by
slowly
emerge
light
against
the
dark
dusk
.
a
chord
of
delight
strike
inside
she
when
she
see
that
Dick
have
take
her
mother
on
his
right
hand
;
for
herself
she
be
between
Luis
Campion
and
Brady
.




surcharge
with
her
emotion
she
turn
to
Brady
with
the
intention
of
confide
in
he
,
but
at
her
first
mention
of
Dick
a
hard
-
boil
sparkle
in
his
eye
give
she
to
understand
that
he
refuse
the
fatherly
office
.
in
turn
she
be
equally
firm
when
he
try
to
monopolize
her
hand
,
so
they
talk
shop
or
rather
she
listen
while
he
talk
shop
,
her
polite
eye
never
leave
his
face
,
but
her
mind
be
so
definitely
elsewhere
that
she
feel
he
must
guess
the
fact
.
intermittently
she
catch
the
gist
of
his
sentence
and
supply
the
rest
from
her
subconscious
,
as
one
pick
up
the
striking
of
a
clock
in
the
middle
with
only
the
rhythm
of
the
first
uncounted
stroke
linger
in
the
mind
.




 



 



VII


 



in
a
pause
Rosemary
look
away
and
up
the
table
where
Nicole
sit
between
Tommy
Barban
and
Abe
North
,
her
chow
's
hair
foam
and
froth
in
the
candlelight
.
Rosemary
listen
,
catch
sharply
by
the
rich
clipped
voice
in
infrequent
speech
:




"
the
poor
man
,
"
Nicole
exclaim
.
"
why
do
you
want
to
saw
he
in
two
?
"




"
naturally
I
want
to
see
what
be
inside
a
waiter
.
would
n't
you
like
to
know
what
be
inside
a
waiter
?
"




"
old
menu
,
"
suggest
Nicole
with
a
short
laugh
.
"
piece
of
break
china
and
tip
and
pencil
stub
.
"




"
exactly
--
but
the
thing
be
to
prove
it
scientifically
.
and
of
course
do
it
with
that
musical
saw
would
have
eliminate
any
sordidness
.
"




"
do
you
intend
to
play
the
saw
while
you
perform
the
operation
?
"
Tommy
inquire
.




"
we
do
n't
get
quite
that
far
.
we
be
alarm
by
the
scream

we
think
he
might
rupture
something
.
"




"
all
sound
very
peculiar
to
I
,
"
say
Nicole
.
"
any
musician

'll
use
another
musician

"




they
have
be
at
table
half
an
hour
and
a
perceptible
change
have
set
in
--
person
by
person
have
give
up
something
,
a
preoccupation
,
an
anxiety
,
a
suspicion
,
and
now
they
be
only
their
good
self
and
the
Divers
'
guest
.
not
to
have
be
friendly
and
interested
would
have
seem
to
reflect
on
the
Divers
,
so
now
they
be
all
try
,
and
see
this
,
Rosemary
like
everyone
--
except
McKisco
,
who
have
contrive
to
be
the
unassimilated
member
of
the
party
.
this
be
less
from
ill
will
than
from
his
determination
to
sustain
with
wine
the
good
spirit
he
have
enjoy
on
his
arrival
.
lie
back
in
his
place
between
Earl
Brady
,
to
whom
he
have
address
several
wither
remark
about
the
movie
,
and
Mrs.
Abrams
,
to
whom
he
say
nothing
,
he
stare
at
Dick
Diver
with
an
expression
of
devastating
irony
,
the
effect
be
occasionally
interrupt
by
his
attempt
to
engage
Dick
in
a
cater
-
cornered
conversation
across
the
table
.




"
be
n't
you
a
friend
of
Van
Buren
Denby
?
"
he
would
say
.




"
I
do
n't
believe
I
know
he
.
"




"
I
think
you
be
a
friend
of
his
,
"
he
persist
irritably
.




when
the
subject
of
Mr.
Denby
fall
of
its
own
weight
,
he
essay
other
equally
irrelative
theme
,
but
each
time
the
very
deference
of
Dick
's
attention
seem
to
paralyze
he
,
and
after
a
moment
's
stark
pause
the
conversation
that
he
have
interrupt
would
go
on
without
he
.
he
try
break
into
other
dialogue
,
but
it
be
like
continually
shake
hand
with
a
glove
from
which
the
hand
have
be
withdraw
--
so
finally
,
with
a
resigned
air
of
be
among
child
,
he
devote
his
attention
entirely
to
the
champagne
.




Rosemary
's
glance
move
at
interval
around
the
table
,
eager
for
the
other
'
enjoyment
,
as
if
they
be
her
future
stepchildren
.
a
gracious
table
light
,
emanate
from
a
bowl
of
spicy
pink
,
fall
upon
Mrs.
Abrams
'
face
,
cook
to
a
turn
in
Veuve
Cliquot
,
full
of
vigor
,
tolerance
,
adolescent
good
will
;
next
to
she
sit
Mr.
Royal
Dumphry
,
his
girl
's
comeliness
less
startling
in
the
pleasure
world
of
evening
.
then
Violet
McKisco
,
whose
prettiness
have
be
pipe
to
the
surface
of
she
,
so
that
she
cease
her
struggle
to
make
tangible
to
herself
her
shadowy
position
as
the
wife
of
an
arriviste
who
have
not
arrive
.




then
come
Dick
,
with
his
arm
full
of
the
slack
he
have
take
up
from
other
,
deeply
merge
in
his
own
party
.




then
her
mother
,
forever
perfect
.




then
Barban
talk
to
her
mother
with
an
urbane
fluency
that
make
Rosemary
like
he
again
.
then
Nicole
.
Rosemary
see
she
suddenly
in
a
new
way
and
find
her
one
of
the
most
beautiful
people
she
have
ever
know
.
her
face
,
the
face
of
a
saint
,
a
vike
Madonna
,
shine
through
the
faint
mote
that
snow
across
the
candlelight
,
draw
down
its
flush
from
the
wine
-
color
lantern
in
the
pine
.
she
be
still
as
still
.




Abe
North
be
talk
to
she
about
his
moral
code
:
"
of
course
I
've
get
one
,
"
he
insist
,
"
--a
man
ca
n't
live
without
a
moral
code
.
mine
be
that
I
be
against
the
burning
of
witch
.
whenever
they
burn
a
witch
I
get
all
hot
under
the
collar
.
"
Rosemary
know
from
Brady
that
he
be
a
musician
who
after
a
brilliant
and
precocious
start
have
compose
nothing
for
seven
year
.




Next
be
Campion
,
manage
somehow
to
restrain
his
most
blatant
effeminacy
,
and
even
to
visit
upon
those
near
he
a
certain
disintereste
motherliness
.
then
Mary
North
with
a
face
so
merry
that
it
be
impossible
not
to
smile
back
into
the
white
mirror
of
her
tooth
--
the
whole
area
around
her
parted
lip
be
a
lovely
little
circle
of
delight
.




finally
Brady
,
whose
heartiness
become
,
moment
by
moment
,
a
social
thing
instead
of
a
crude
assertion
and
reassertion
of
his
own
mental
health
,
and
his
preservation
of
it
by
a
detachment
from
the
frailty
of
other
.




Rosemary
,
as
dewy
with
belief
as
a
child
from
one
of
Mrs.
Burnett
's
vicious
tract
,
have
a
conviction
of
homecoming
,
of
a
return
from
the
derisive
and
salacious
improvisation
of
the
frontier
.
there
be
firefly
ride
on
the
dark
air
and
a
dog
bay
on
some
low
and
far
-
away
ledge
of
the
cliff
.
the
table
seem
to
have
rise
a
little
toward
the
sky
like
a
mechanical
dancing
platform
,
give
the
people
around
it
a
sense
of
be
alone
with
each
other
in
the
dark
universe
,
nourish
by
its
only
food
,
warm
by
its
only
light
.
and
,
as
if
a
curious
hush
laugh
from
Mrs.
McKisco
be
a
signal
that
such
a
detachment
from
the
world
have
be
attain
,
the
two
Divers
begin
suddenly
to
warm
and
glow
and
expand
,
as
if
to
make
up
to
their
guest
,
already
so
subtly
assure
of
their
importance
,
so
flattered
with
politeness
,
for
anything
they
might
still
miss
from
that
country
well
leave
behind
.
just
for
a
moment
they
seem
to
speak
to
every
one
at
the
table
,
singly
and
together
,
assure
they
of
their
friendliness
,
their
affection
.
and
for
a
moment
the
face
turn
up
toward
they
be
like
the
face
of
poor
child
at
a
Christmas
tree
.
then
abruptly
the
table
break
up
--
the
moment
when
the
guest
have
be
daringly
lift
above
conviviality
into
the
rare
atmosphere
of
sentiment
,
be
over
before
it
could
be
irreverently
breathe
,
before
they
have
half
realize
it
be
there
.




but
the
diffused
magic
of
the
hot
sweet
South
have
withdraw
into
they
--
the
soft
-
paw
night
and
the
ghostly
wash
of
the
Mediterranean
far
below
--
the
magic
leave
these
thing
and
melt
into
the
two
Divers
and
become
part
of
they
.
Rosemary
watch
Nicole
press
upon
her
mother
a
yellow
evening
bag
she
have
admire
,
say
,
"
I
think
thing
ought
to
belong
to
the
people
that
like
them"--and
then
sweep
into
it
all
the
yellow
article
she
could
find
,
a
pencil
,
a
lipstick
,
a
little
note
book
,
"
because
they
all
go
together
.
"




Nicole
disappear
and
presently
Rosemary
notice
that
Dick
be
no
long
there
;
the
guest
distribute
themselves
in
the

slow
up

immediately
it
begin

with
the

itself
as
blur
as

change

deliberately

Rosemary

quite
sure
of
it

Dick
,
realize
that
he
never

a

make
the

into

have
be
two
day
in
Paris

actually
they
be
still
under
the
beach
umbrella
.
when
,
as
at
the
ball
of
the
Corps
des
Pages
the
night
before
,
the
surrounding
seem
formidable
to
Rosemary
,
who
have
yet
to
attend
a
Mayfair
party
in
Hollywood
,
Dick
would
bring
the
scene
within
range
by
greet
a
few
people
,
a
sort
of
selection
--
the
Divers
seem
to
have
a
large
acquaintance
,
but
it
be
always
as
if
the
person
have
not
see
they
for
a
long
,
long
time
,
and
be
utterly
bowl
over
,
"
why
,
where
do
you
keep
yourselves?"--and
then
re
-
create
the
unity
of
his
own
party
by
destroy
the
outsider
softly
but
permanently
with
an
ironic
coup
de
grâce
.
presently
Rosemary
seem
to
have
know
those
people
herself
in
some
deplorable
past
,
and
then
get
on
to
they
,
reject
they
,
discard
they
.




their
own
party
be
overwhelmingly
american
and
sometimes
scarcely
american
at
all
.
it
be
themselves
he
give
back
to
they
,
blur
by
the
compromise
of
how
many
year
.




into
the
dark
,
smoky
restaurant
,
smell
of
the
rich
raw
food
on
the
buffet
,
slide
Nicole
's
sky
-
blue
suit
like
a
stray
segment
of
the
weather
outside
.
see
from
their
eye
how
beautiful
she
be
,
she
thank
they
with
a
smile
of
radiant
appreciation
.
they
be
all
very
nice
people
for
a
while
,
very
courteous
and
all
that
.
then
they
grow
tired
of
it
and
they
be
funny
and
bitter
,
and
finally
they
make
a
lot
of
plan
.
they
laugh
at
thing
that
they
would
not
remember
clearly
afterward
--
laugh
a
lot
and
the
man
drink
three
bottle
of
wine
.
the
trio
of
woman
at
the
table
be
representative
of
the
enormous
flux
of
american
life
.
Nicole
be
the
granddaughter
of
a
self
-
make
american
capitalist
and
the
granddaughter
of
a
Count
of
the
House
of
Lippe
Weissenfeld
.
Mary
North
be
the
daughter
of
a
journeyman
paper
-
hanger
and
a
descendant
of
President
Tyler
.
Rosemary
be
from
the
middle
of
the
middle
class
,
catapult
by
her
mother
onto
the
uncharted
height
of
Hollywood
.
their
point
of
resemblance
to
each
other
and
their
difference
from
so
many
american
woman
,
lie
in
the
fact
that
they
be
all
happy
to
exist
in
a
man
's
world
--
they
preserve
their
individuality
through
man
and
not
by
opposition
to
they
.
they
would
all
three
have
make
alternatively
good
courtesan
or
good
wife
not
by
the
accident
of
birth
but
through
the
great
accident
of
find
their
man
or
not
find
he
.




so
Rosemary
find
it
a
pleasant
party
,
that
luncheon
,
nice
in
that
there
be
only
seven
people
,
about
the
limit
of
a
good
party
.
perhaps
,

,
the
fact
that

their
world
act
as
a
sort
of
catalytic
agent
to
precipitate
out
all
their

reservation
about

another
.
after

up
a

by
a
dim
orange
bulb
,
and

sure
,
they
have
a
print
of
"

be
out
for
the
moment
,
but
they
would
run
it
off
later
in
the
week
for

the
semi

booth
give
on
the
vestiaire
and
as
Rosemary
hang
up
the
receiver
she
hear
two
low
voice
not
five
foot
from
she
on
the
other
side
of
a
row
of
coat
.




"
--so

"




"
oh
,
do
I
!
"




it
be
Nicole
--
Rosemary
hesitate
in
the
door
of
the
booth
--
then
she
hear
Dick
say
:




"
I
want
you
terribly
--
let
's
go
to
the
hotel
now
.
"
Nicole
give
a
little
gasp
sigh
.
for
a
moment
the
word
convey
nothing
at
all
to
Rosemary
--
but
the
tone
do
.
the
vast
secretiveness
of
it
vibrate
to
herself
.




"
I
want
you
.
"




"
I
'll
be
at
the
hotel
at
four
.
"




Rosemary
stand
breathless
as
the
voice
move
away
.
she
be
at
first
even
astonish
--
she
have
see
they
in
their
relation
to
each
other
as
people
without
personal
exigency
--
as
something
cool
.
now
a
strong
current
of
emotion
flow
through
she
,
profound
and
unidentified
.
she
do
not
know
whether
she
be
attract
or
repel
,
but
only
that
she
be
deeply
move
.
it
make
she
feel
very
alone
as
she
go
back
into
the
restaurant
,
but
it
be
touch
to
look
in
upon
,
and
the
passionate
gratitude
of
Nicole
's
"
oh
,
do
I
!
"
echo
in
her
mind
.
the
particular
mood
of
the
passage
she
have
witness
lie
ahead
of
she
;
but
however
far
she
be
from
it
her
stomach
tell
she
it
be
all
right
--
she
have
none
of
the
aversion
she
have
feel
in
the
playing
of
certain
love
scene
in
picture
.




be
far
away
from
it
she
nevertheless
irrevocably
participate
in
it
now
,
and
shop
with
Nicole
she
be
much
more
conscious
of
the
assignation
than
Nicole
herself
.
she
look
at
Nicole
in
a
new
way
,
estimate
her
attraction
.
certainly
she
be
the
most
attractive
woman
Rosemary
have
ever
meet
--
with
her
hardness
,
her
devotion
and
loyalty
,
and
a
certain
elusiveness
,
which
Rosemary
,
think
now
through
her
mother
's
middle
-
class
mind
,
associate
with
her
attitude
about
money
.
Rosemary
spend
money
she
have
earn
--
she
be
here
in
Europe
due
to
the
fact

January

with
an
entirely
different
point
of

.
Nicole
be
the

of
much
ingenuity
and
toil
.

give
a
tithe
to

and
as
the
whole
system
sway
and
thunder
onward
it
lend
a
feverish
bloom
to
such
process
of
hers
as
wholesale
buying
,
like
the
flush
of
a
fireman

.
she

her
own
doom
,
but
illustrate
they
so
accurately
that
there
be
grace
in
the
procedure
,
and
presently
Rosemary
would
try
to
imitate
it
.




it
be
almost
four
.
Nicole
stand
in
a
shop
with
a
love
bird
on
her
shoulder
,
and
have
one
of
her
infrequent
outburst
of
speech
.




"

,
what
if
you
have
n't
go
in

about
such
thing
.
just
before
the
war

be
in
Berlin
--
I
be

just
before
Mother

to
start
she
have
a
side
ache
and
a
high
fever
.
the
doctor
say
it
be
appendicitis
and
she
ought
to
be
operate
on
.
but
Mother
have
her
plan
make
,
so
Baby
go
to
the
ball
and
dance
till
two
with
an
ice

o'clock

good
to

hard
,
then
;
all
nice
people
be
hard
on
themselves
.
but
it
be
four
o'clock
and
Rosemary
keep
think
of
Dick
wait
for
Nicole
now
at
the
hotel
.
she
must
go
there
,
she
must
not
make
he
wait
for
she

she
keep
think
,

then
suddenly
,
"

Nicole
go
to
one
more
place
to
buy
corsage
for
they
both
and
send
one
to
Mary
North
.
only
then
she
seem
to
remember
and
with
sudden
abstraction
she
signal
for
a
taxi
.




"

"

say
Rosemary
.
it
be
more
difficult
than
she
think

her
whole
self
protest
as
Nicole

go
on
along
the
trench
,
and
find
the
other
wait
for
he
in
the
next
traverse
.
he
be
full
of
excitement
and
he
want
to
communicate
it
to
they
,
to
make
they

to
Rosemary

obediently
at
the
rather
bare
green
plain
with
its

Rosemary
shed
tear
again
when
she
hear
of
the
mishap
--
altogether
it
have
be
a
watery
day
,

she
feel
that
she
have
learn
something
,
though
exactly
what
it
be
she
do
not
know
.
later
she
remember
all
the
hour
of
the
afternoon
as
happy
--
one
of
those
uneventful
time
that
seem
at
the
moment
only
a
link
between
past

pleasure

the
pleasure
itself

amien
be
an
echo
purple
town
,
still
sad
with
the
war
,
as
some
railroad
station
were:--the
Gare
du
Nord
and
Waterloo
station
in

in
the
daytime

little
trolley

of
twenty

the
great
gray
cobble
-
stone
square
in
front
of
the
cathedral
,
and
the
very
weather
seem
to
have
a
quality
of
the
past
,
faded
weather
like
that
of
old
photograph
.
but
after
dark
all
that
be
most
satisfactory
in
french
life
swim
back
into
the
picture
--
the
sprightly
tart
,
the
man
argue
with
a
hundred
Voilàs
in
the
cafés
,
the
couple
drift
,
head
to
head

toward
the
satisfactory
inexpensiveness
of
nowhere

wait
for
the
train

sit
in
a
big
arcade
,
tall
enough
to
release
the
smoke
and
chatter

music
upward
and
obligingly

orchestra
launch
into
"

no
bananas,"--they
clap
,

the
leader
look
so
pleased
with
himself

Tennessee
girl

her
sorrow

flirtation

tropical
eye

dissolution

incalculable

somewhat
afraid

sit
with

they
have
take
the
little
steamer
up
to

about

so
sure
of

much
ambition

the

at

all

romantic

in

sometimes
tight
,
sometimes
expectantly
half
open
to
the
world

Nicole
have
be
a
beauty
as

be
a
beauty
later

high
cheekbone

fineness

comprehend
what

move
first

make
some
mistake
in
the
playing
of
her
trump

still

faintly
annoyed
at

Dick
close
the
subject
with
a
somewhat
tart
discussion
of
actor

cross
that
threshold

it

bevel
mirror
.
the
effect
be
unlike
that
of
any
part
of
the
Decorative
Arts
Exhibition
--
for
there
be
people
in
it
,
not
in
front
of
it
.
Rosemary
have
the
detach
false
-
and
-
exalt
feeling
of
be
on
a
set
and
she
guess
that
every
one
else
present
have
that
feeling
too
.




there
be
about
thirty
people
,
mostly
woman
,
and
all
fashion
by
Louisa
M.
Alcott
or
Madame
de
Ségur
;
and
they
function
on
this
set
as
cautiously
,
as
precisely
,
as
do
a
human
hand
pick
up
jagged
broken
glass
.
neither
individually
nor
as
a
crowd
could
they
be
say
to
dominate
the
environment
,
as
one
come
to
dominate
a
work
of
art
he
may
possess
,
no
matter
how
esoteric
,
no
one
know
what
this
room
mean
because
it
be
evolve
into
something
else
,
become
everything
a
room
be
not
;
to
exist
in
it
be
as
difficult
as
walk
on
a
highly
polished
move
stairway
,
and
no
one
could
succeed
at
all
save
with
the
aforementioned
quality
of
a
hand
move
among
broken
glass
--
which
quality
limit
and
define
the
majority
of
those
present
.




these
be
of
two
sort
.
there
be
the
Americans
and
English
who
have
be
dissipate
all
spring
and
summer
,
so
that
now
everything
they
do
have
a
purely
nervous
inspiration
.
they
be
very
quiet
and
lethargic
at
certain
hour
and
then
they
explode
into
sudden
quarrel
and
breakdown
and
seduction
.
the
other
class
,
who
might
be
call
the
exploiter
,
be
form
by
the
sponge
,
who
be
sober
,
serious
people
by
comparison
,
with
a
purpose
in
life
and
no
time
for
fooling
.
these
keep
their
balance
good
in
that
environment
,
and
what
tone
there

Rosemary
suddenly
discover
herself
to
be
an
insincere
little
person
,
live
all
in
the
upper
register
of
her
throat
and
wish
the
director
would
come
.
there
be
however
such
a
wild
beating
of
wing
in
the
room
that
she
do
not
feel
her
position
be
more
incongruous
than
any
one
else

after
a
series
of

find
herself
presumably

to
a
neat

a
lovely

a
conversation

on
a
sort
of
gun

metal
ladder
diagonally
opposite
she

there
be
a
trio
of
young
woman

with
small

gracefully

dark
tailor

there

little
time
to

lover
now
they
fall
ravenously
on
the
quick
second
while
outside
the
taxi
window
the
green
and
cream
twilight
fade

the
fire

red

to
shine
smokily
through
the
tranquil
rain

it
be
nearly
six

the
street
be
in
movement
,
the
bistro
gleam
,
the
Place

by

pink
majesty
as
the
cab
turn
north

they
look
at
each
other
at
last
,
murmur
name
that
be
a
spell

softly
the
two

linger
on
the
air
,
die
away
more
slowly
than
other
word
,
other
name
,
slow
than
music
in
the
mind
.




"

cry
a
little
in
her
handkerchief

again
the

then
they
lurch
together
as
if

have
swing
they

breast
crush
flat
against
he
,
her
mouth
be
all
new
and
warm
,
own
in
common
.
they
stop
think
with
an
almost
painful
relief
,
stop
see
;
they
only
breathe
and
seek
each
other
.
they
be
both
in
the
gray
gentle
world
of
a
mild
hangover
of
fatigue
when
the
nerve
relax
in
bunche
like
piano
string
,
and
crackle
suddenly
like
wicker
chair
.
nerve
so
raw
and
tender
must
surely
join
other
nerve
,
lip
to
lip
,
breast
to
breast
.
.
.
.




they
be
still
in
the
happy
stage
of
love
.
they
be
full
of
brave
illusion
about
each
other
,
tremendous
illusion
,
so
that
the
communion
of
self
with
self
seem
to
be
on
a
plane
where
no
other
human
relation
matter
.
they
both
seem
to
have
arrive
there
with
an
extraordinary
innocence
as
though
a
series
of
pure
accident
have
drive
they
together
,
so
many
accident
that
at
last
they
be
force
to
conclude
that
they
be
for
each
other

they
have
arrive
with
clean
hand
,
or
so
it
seem
,
after
no
traffic
with
the
merely
curious
and
clandestine
.




but
for
Dick
that
portion
of
the
road
be
short
;
the
turning
come
before
they
reach
the
hotel

however

a
rather
cool
relation
,

actually
rather

when

a
letter
to

they

Dick

party
be
all
concerned
with
excitement
,
and
a
chance
breath
of
fresh
night
air
be
the
more
precious
for
be
experience
in
the
interval
of
the
excitement
.




the
party
that
night
move
with
the
speed
of
a
slapstick
comedy
.
they
be
twelve
,
they
be
sixteen
,
they
be
quartet
in
separate
motor
bind
on
a
quick
Odyssey
over
Paris
.
everything
have
be
foresee
.
People
join
they
as
if
by
magic
,
accompany
they
as
specialist
,
almost
guide
,
through
a
phase
of
the
evening
,
drop
out
and
be
succeed
by
other
people
,
so
that
it
appear
as
if
the
freshness
of
each
one
have
be
husband
for
they
all
day
.
Rosemary
appreciate
how
different
it
be
from
any
party
in
Hollywood
,
no
matter
how
splendid
in
scale
.
there
be
,
among
many
diversion
,
the
car
of
the
Shah
of
Persia
.
where
Dick
have
commandeer
this
vehicle
,
what
bribery
be
employ
,
these
be
fact
of
irrelevance
.
Rosemary
accept
it
as
merely
a
new
facet
of
the
fabulous
,
which
for
two
year
have
fill
her
life
.
the
car
have
be
build
on
a
special
chassis
in
America
.
its
wheel
be
of
silver
,
so
be
the
radiator
.
the
inside
of
the
body
be
inlay
with
innumerable
brilliant
which
would
be
replace
with
true
gem
by
the
court
jeweller
when
the
car
arrive
in
Teheran
the
following
week
.
there
be
only
one
real
seat
in
back
,
because
the
Shah
must
ride
alone
,
so
they
take
turn
ride
in
it
and
sit
on
the
marten
fur
that
cover
the
floor
.




but
always
there
be
Dick
.
Rosemary
assure
the
image
of
her
mother
,
ever
carry
with
she
,
that
never
,
never
have
she
know
any
one
so
nice
,
so
thoroughly
nice
as
Dick
be
that
night
.
she
compare
he
with
the
two
Englishmen
,
whom
Abe
address
conscientiously
as
"
Major
Hengest
and
Mr.
Horsa
,
"
and
with
the
heir
to
a
scandinavian
throne
and
the
novelist
just
back
from
Russia
,
and
with
Abe
,
who
be
desperate
and
witty
,
and
with
Collis
Clay
,
who
join
they
somewhere
and
stay
along
--
and
feel
there
be
no
comparison
.
the
enthusiasm
,
the
selflessness
behind
the
whole
performance
ravish
she
,
the
technic
of
move
many
varied
type
,
each
as
immobile
,
as
dependent
on
supply
of
attention
as
an
infantry
battalion
be
dependent
on
ration
,
appear
so
effortless
that
he
still
have
piece
of
his
own
most
personal
self
for
everyone
.




--Afterward
she
remember
the
time
when
she
have
feel
the
happy
.
the
first
time
be
when
she
and
Dick
dance
together
and
she
feel
her
beauty
sparkle
bright
against
his
tall
,
strong
form
as
they
float
,
hover
like
people
in
an
amusing
dream
--
he
turn
she
here
and
there
with
such
a
delicacy
of
suggestion
that
she
be
like
a
bright
bouquet
,
a
piece
of
precious
cloth
be
display
before
fifty
eye
.
there
be
a
moment
when
they
be
not
dance
at
all
,
simply
cling
together
.
some
time
in
the
early
morning
they
be
alone
,
and
her
damp
powdery
young
body
come
up
close
to

want
Dick
to
make
a
moral
comment
on
the
matter

not
leave
it
to
they

this
wish
be
not
entirely
conscious
,

on
the
part
of
Rosemary

be
accustomed

impetus

his

emotion
to
resolve
thing
into
the

of
the
holiday
,
so
the

miss
something

lapse
into

terminate

one
of

dozen
people
he
have

have
include
a

circus
clown

of
dancer

have
stake

well
know
how
seriously
these
people
interpret
his

enthusiasm

she
realize
also
that
,

while
their

Dick
have
not
spend
a
night
apart

on
the
other
hand

there
be
a
pleasingness
about
he
that
simply
have

be
use

those
who
possess
that
pleasingness

go
along

now
Dick
harden
himself

have

something
out

himself
before

could
forgive
he
for
not
having
first
compliment
Nicole

she
leave
almost
immediately

he
sit
with
Collis

;
less
difficult
than
most
of
the
Southerners
he
have
know
at
New
Haven
a
decade
previously
.
Dick
listen
with
amusement
to
the
conversation
that
accompany
the
slow
,
profound
stuffing
of
a
pipe
.
in
the
early
afternoon
child
and
nurse
be
trek
into
the
Luxembourg
Gardens
;
it
be
the
first
time
in
month
that
Dick
have
let
this
part
of
the
day
out
of
his
hand
.




suddenly
his
blood
run
cold
as
he
realize
the
content
of
Collis
's
confidential
monologue
.




"
--she
be
not
so
cold

you
'd
probably
think

I
admit
I
think
she
be
cold
for
a
long
time
.
but
she
get
into
a
jam
with
a
friend
of
mine
go
from
New
York
to
Chicago
at
Easter
--
a
boy
name
Hillis
she
think
be
pretty
nutsey
at
New
Haven
--
she
have
a
compartment
with
a
cousin
of
mine
but
she
and
Hillis
want
to
be
alone
,
so
in
the
afternoon
my
cousin
come
and
play
card
in
our
compartment

,

about
two
hour

go
back

Bill
Hillis

in
the

with

conductor

Rosemary
white
as

sheet

they
lock
the
door
and
pull
down
the
blind

I
guess
there
be
some
heavy
stuff
go
on
when
the
conductor
come
for
the
ticket
and
knock
on
the
door

they
think
it
be
we
kid
they
and
would
n't
let
he
in
at
first
,
and
when
they
do
,
he
be
plenty
sore

he
ask
Hillis
if
that
be
his
compartment
and
whether
he
and
Rosemary
be
married
that
they
lock
the
door
,
and
Hillis
lose
his
temper
try
to
explain
there
be
nothing
wrong
.
he
say
the
conductor
have
insult
Rosemary
and
he
want
he
to
fight
,
but
that
conductor
could
have
make
trouble

and
believe
I
I
have
an
awful
time
smooth
it
over

he
know
that
what
he
be
now
do
mark
a
turning
point
in
his
life
--
it
be
out
of
line
with
everything
that
have
precede
it
--
even
out
of
line
with
what
effect
he
might
hope
to
produce
upon
Rosemary
.
Rosemary
see
he
always
as
a
model
of
correctness
--
his
presence
walk
around
this
block
be
an
intrusion
.
but
Dick
's
necessity
of
behave
as
he
do
be
a
projection
of
some
submerge
reality
:
he
be
compel
to
walk
there
,
or
stand
there
,
his
shirt
-
sleeve
fit
his
wrist
and
his
coat

encase
his

sleeve

a

valve
,
his
collar
mold
plastically
to
his
neck
,
his
red
hair
cut
exactly
,
his
hand
hold
his
small
briefcase
like
a
dandy
--
just
as
another
man
once
find
it
necessary
to
stand
in
front
of
a
church
in
Ferrara
,
in
sackcloth
and
ashe
.
Dick
be
pay
some
tribute
to
thing
unforgotten
,
unshriven
,
unexpurgated
.




 



 



XXI


 



after
three
-
quarter
of
an
hour
of
stand
around
,
he
become
suddenly
involve
in
a
human
contact
.
it
be
just
the
sort
of
thing
that
be
likely
to
happen
to
he
when
he
be
in
the
mood
of
not
want
to
see
any
one
.
so
rigidly
do
he
sometimes
guard
his
expose
self
-
consciousness
that
frequently
he
defeat
his
own
purpose
;
as
an
actor
who
underplay
a
part
set
up
a
craning
forward
,
a
stimulated
emotional
attention
in
an
audience
,
and
seem
to
create
in
other
an
ability
to
bridge
the
gap
he
have
leave
open
.
similarly
we
be
seldom
sorry
for
those
who
need
and
crave
our
pity
--
we
reserve
this
for
those
who
,
by
other
mean
,
make
we
exercise
the
abstract
function
of
pity
.




so
Dick
might
,
himself
,
have
analyze
the
incident
that
ensue
.
as
he
pace
the
Rue

he
be

thin

American
,
perhaps
thirty
,
with
an
air
of
be
scarred
and
a
slight
but
sinister
smile
.
as
Dick
give
he
the
light
he
request
,
he
place
he
as
one
of
a
type
of
which
he
have
be
conscious
since
early
youth
--
a
type
that
loaf
about
tobacco
store
with
one
elbow
on
the
counter
and
watch
,
through
heaven

people
who
come
in

out

he

vague
business
conduct
in
undertone
,

the
lobby
of

in
such
place
,

any

face

up
in

savage

in
boyhood
Dick
have
often
throw
an
uneasy
glance
at
the
dim
borderland
of

morning
,
the
son
of
a
naval
officer
that
be
be
to
every
doctor
in
Europe
.
let
I
tell
you
about
him--
"




Dick
have
ring
off
at
this
point
--
perhaps
that
be
a
piece
of
ingratitude
for
he
need
grist
for
the
grind
activity
of
his
mind
.




"
Abe
use
to
be
so
nice
,
"
Nicole
tell
Rosemary
.
"
so
nice
.
long
ago
--
when
Dick
and
I
be
first
married
.
if
you
have
know
he
then
.
he
'd
come
to
stay
with
we
for
week
and
week
and
we
scarcely
know
he
be
in
the
house
.
sometimes
he
'd
play
--
sometimes
he
'd
be
in
the
library
with
a
muted
piano
,
make
love
to
it
by
the
hour
--
Dick
,
do
you
remember
that
maid
?
she
think
he
be
a
ghost
and
sometimes
Abe
use
to
meet
she
in
the
hall
and
moo
at
she
,
and
it
cost
we
a
whole
tea
service
once
--
but
we
do
n't
care
.
"




so
much
fun
--
so
long
ago
.
Rosemary
envy
they
their
fun
,
imagine
a
life
of
leisure
unlike
her
own
.
she
know
little
of
leisure
but
she
have
the
respect
for
it
of
those
who
have
never
have
it
.
she
think
of
it
as
a
resting
,
without
realize
that
the
Divers
be
as
far
from
relax
as
she
be
herself
.




"
what
do
this
to
he
?
"
she
ask
.
"
why
do
he
have
to
drink
?
"




Nicole
shake
her
head
right
and
leave
,
disclaim
responsibility
for
the
matter
:
"
so
many
smart
man
go
to
piece
nowadays
.
"




"
and
when
have
n't
they
?
"
Dick
ask
.
"
Smart
man
play
close
to
the
line
because
they
have
to
--
some
of
they
ca
n't
stand
it
,
so
they
quit
.
"




"
it
must
lie
deep
than
that
.
"
Nicole
clung
to
her
conversation
;
also
she
be
irritated
that
Dick
should
contradict
she
before
Rosemary
.
"
artist
like
--
well
,
like
Fernand
do
n't
seem
to
have
to
wallow
in
alcohol
.
why
be
it
just
Americans
who
dissipate
?
"




there
be
so
many
answer
to
this
question
that
Dick
decide
to
leave
it
in
the
air
,
to
buzz
victoriously
in
Nicole
's
ear
.
he
have
become
intensely
critical
of
she
.
though
he
think
she
be
the
most
attractive
human
creature
he
have
ever
see
,
though
he
get
from
she
everything
he
need
,
he
scent
battle
from
afar
,
and
subconsciously
he
have
be
harden
and
arm
himself
,
hour
by
hour
.
he
be
not
give
to
self
-
indulgence
and
he
feel
comparatively
graceless
at
this
moment
of
indulge
himself
,
blind
his
eye
with
the
hope
that
Nicole
guess
at
only
an
emotional
excitement
about
Rosemary
.
he
be
not
sure
--
last
night
at
the
theatre
she
have
refer
pointedly
to
Rosemary
as
a
child
.




the
trio
lunch
downstairs
in
an
atmosphere
of
carpet
and
padded
waiter
,
who
do
not
march
at
the
stomping
quick
-
step
of
those
man
who
bring
good
food
to
the
table
whereon
they
have
recently
dine
.
here
there
be
family
of
Americans
stare
around
at
family
of
Americans
,
and
try
to
make
conversation
with
one
another
.




there
be
a
party
at
the
next
table
that
they
could
not
account
for
.
it
consist
of
an
expansive
,
somewhat
secretarial
,
would
-
you
-
mind
-
repeat
young
man
,
and
a
score
of
woman
.
the
woman
be
neither
young
nor
old
nor
of
any
particular
social
class
;
yet
the
party
give
the
impression
of
a
unit
,
hold
more
closely
together
for
example
than
a
group
of
wife
stall
through
a
professional
congress
of
their
husband
.
certainly
it
be
more
of
a
unit
than
any
conceivable
tourist
party
.




an
instinct
make
Dick
suck
back
the
grave
derision
that
form
on
his
tongue
;
he
ask
the
waiter
to
find
out
who
they
be
.




"
those
be
the
gold
-
star
muzzer
,
"
explain
the
waiter
.




Aloud
and
in
low
voice
they
exclaim
.
Rosemary
's
eye
fill
with
tear
.




"
probably
the
young
one
be
the
wife
,
"
say
Nicole
.




over
his
wine
Dick
look
at
they
again
;
in
their
happy
face
,
the
dignity
that
surround
and
pervade
the
party
,
he
perceive
all
the
maturity
of
an
old
America
.
for
a
while
the
sober
woman
who
have
come
to
mourn
for
their
dead
,
for
something
they
could
not
repair
,
make
the
room
beautiful
.
momentarily
,
he
sit
again
on
his
father
's
knee
,
ride
with
Moseby
while
the
old
loyalty
and
devotion
fight
on
around
he
.
almost
with
an
effort
he
turn
back
to
his
two
woman
at
the
table
and
face
the
whole
new
world
in
which
he
believe
.




--Do
you
mind
if
I
pull
down
the
curtain
?




 



 



XXIII


 



Abe
North
be
still
in
the
Ritz
bar
,
where
he
have
be
since
nine
in
the
morning
.
when
he
arrive
seek
sanctuary
the
window
be
open
and
great
beam
be
busy
at
pull
up
the
dust
from
smoky
carpet
and
cushion
.
chasseur
tear
through
the
corridor
,
liberate
and
disembody
,
move
for
the
moment
in
pure
space
.
the
sit
-
down
bar
for
woman
,
across
from
the
bar
proper
,
seem
very
small
--
it
be
hard
to
imagine
what
throng
it
could
accommodate
in
the
afternoon
.




the
famous
Paul
,
the
concessionaire
,
have
not
arrive
,
but
Claude
,
who
be
check
stock
,
break
off
his
work
with
no
improper
surprise
to
make
Abe
a
pick
-
I
-
up
.
Abe
sit
on
a
bench
against
a
wall
.
after
two
drink
he
begin
to
feel
well
--
so
much
well
that
he
mount
to
the
barber
's
shop
and
be
shave
.
when
he
return
to
the
bar
Paul
have
arrive
--
in
his
custom
-
build
motor
,
from
which
he
have
disembark
correctly
at
the
Boulevard
des
Capucines
.
Paul
like
Abe
and
come
over
to
talk
.




"
I
be
suppose
to
ship
home
this
morning
,
"
Abe
say
.
"
I
mean
yesterday
morning
,
or
whatever
this
be
.
"




"
why
din
you
?
"
ask
Paul
.




Abe
consider
,
and
happen
finally
to
a
reason
:
"
I
be
read
a
serial
in
Liberty
and
the
next
installment
be
due
here
in
Paris
--
so
if
I
have
sail
I
'd
have
miss
it
--
then
I
never
would
have
read
it
.
"




"
it
must
be
a
very
good
story
.
"




"
it
be
a
terr
-
r
-
rible
story
.
"




Paul
arise
chuckle
and
pause
,
lean
on
the
back
of
a
chair
:




"
if
you
really
want
to
get
off
,
Mr.
North
,
there
be
friend
of
your
go
to
-
morrow
on
the
France
--
Mister
what
be
this
name
--
and
Slim
Pearson
.
Mister
--
I'll
think
of
it
--
tall
with
a
new
beard
.
"




"
yardly
,
"
Abe
supply
.




"
Mr.
Yardly
.
they
be
both
go
on
the
France
.
"




he
be
on
his
way
to
his
duty
but
Abe
try
to
detain
he
:
"
if
I
do
n't
have
to
go
by
way
of
Cherbourg
.
the
baggage
go
that
way
.
"




"
get
your
baggage
in
New
York
,
"
say
Paul
,
recede
.




the
logic
of
the
suggestion
fit
gradually
into
Abe
's
pitch
--
he
grow
rather
enthusiastic
about
be
care
for
,
or
rather
of
prolong
his
state
of
irresponsibility
.




other
client
have
meanwhile
drift
in
to
the
bar
:
first
come
a
huge
Dane
whom
Abe
have
somewhere
encounter
.
the
Dane
take
a
seat
across
the
room
,
and
Abe
guess
he
would
be
there
all
the
day
,
drink
,
lunching
,
talk
or
read
newspaper
.
he
feel
a
desire
to
out
-
stay
he
.
at
eleven
the
college
boy
begin
to
step
in
,
step
gingerly
lest
they
tear
one
another
bag
from
bag
.
it
be
about
then
he
have
the
chasseur
telephone
to
the
Divers
;
by
the
time
he
be
in
touch
with
they
he
be
in
touch
also
with
other
friend
--
and
his
hunch
be
to
put
they
all
on
different
phone
at
once
--
the
result
be
somewhat
general
.
from
time
to
time
his
mind
revert
to
the
fact
that
he
ought
to
go
over
and
get
Freeman
out
of
jail
,
but
he
shake
off
all
fact
as
part
of
the
nightmare
.




by
one
o'clock
the
bar
be
jammed
;
amidst
the
consequent
mixture
of
voice
the
staff
of
waiter
function
,
pin
down
their
client
to
the
fact
of
drink
and
money
.




"
that
make
two
stinger
.
.
.
and
one
more
.
.
.
two
martini
and
one
.
.
.
nothing
for
you
,
Mr.
Quarterly
.
.
.
that
make
three
round
.
that
make
seventy

Mr.

.
Mr.
Schaeffer
say
he
have
this

last

I
can
only
do
what
you

much

"




in
the
confusion
Abe
have
lose
his
seat
;
now
he
stand
gently
sway
and
talk
to
some
of
the
people
with
whom
he
have
involve
himself
.
a
terrier
run
a
leash
around
his
leg
but
Abe
manage
to
extricate
himself
without
upsetting
and
become
the
recipient
of
profuse
apology
.
presently
he
be
invite
to
lunch
,
but
decline
.
it
be
almost
Briglith
,
he
explain
,
and
there
be
something
he
have
to
do
at
Briglith
.
a
little
later
,
with
the
exquisite
manner
of
the
alcoholic
that
be
like
the
manner
of
a
prisoner
or
a
family
servant
,
he
say
good
-
by
to
an
acquaintance
,
and
turn
around
discover
that
the
bar
's
great
moment
be
over
as
precipitately
as
it
have
begin
.




across
from
he
the
Dane
and
his
companion
have
order
luncheon
.
Abe
do
likewise
but
scarcely
touch
it
.
afterwards
,
he
just
sit
,
happy
to
live
in
the
past
.
the
drink
make
past
happy
thing
contemporary
with
the
present
,
as
if
they
be
still
go
on
,
contemporary
even
with
the
future
as
if
they
be
about
to
happen
again
.




at
four
the
chasseur

an
inevitable

to
a

to
suggest
a

they
up
into

"




the
precaution
be
needless
for
the

so
harass
as
to
preclude
any
but
the
most
fleeting
judgment
on

not
pertinent
to
themselves
.
stand
there
be
Abe
,
age
by
several
month
in
the
last
twenty
-
four
hour
,
and
a
very
frightened
,
concerned
colored
man
whom
Abe
introduce
as
Mr.
Peterson
of
Stockholm
.




"
he
be
in
a
terrible
situation

it

my

some
good

they
cross
the
hall
to
the
Divers
'

.
Jules
Peterson
,
a
small
,
respectable
Negro
,
on
the
suave
model
that
heel
the
republican
party
in
the
border
States
,
follow
.




it
appear
that
the
latter
have
be
a
legal
witness
to
the
early
morning
dispute
in
Montparnasse
;
he
have
accompany
Abe
to
the
police
station
and
support
his
assertion
that
a
thousand
franc
note
have
be
seize
out
of
his
hand
by
a
Negro
,
whose
identification
be
one
of
the
point
of
the
case
.
Abe
and
Jules
Peterson
,
accompany
by
an
agent
of
police
,
return
to
the
bistro
and
too
hastily
identify
as
the
criminal
a
Negro
,
who
,
so
it
be
establish
after
an
hour
,
have
only
enter
the
place
after
Abe
leave
.
the
police
have
far
complicate
the
situation
by
arrest
the
prominent
Negro
restaurateur
,
Freeman
,
who
have
only
drift
through
the
alcoholic
fog
at
a
very
early
stage
and
then
vanish
.
the
true
culprit
,
whose
case
,
as
report
by
his
friend
,
be
that
he
have
merely
commandeer
a
fifty
-
franc
note
to
pay
for
drink
that
Abe
have
order
,
have
only
recently
and
in
a
somewhat
sinister
rôle
,
reappear
upon
the
scene
.




in
brief
,
Abe
have
succeed
in
the
space
of
an
hour
in
entangle
himself
with
the
personal
life
,
conscience
,
and
emotion
of
one
Afro
-
european
and
three
Afro
-
Americans
inhabit
the
French
latin
quarter
.
the
disentanglement
be
not
even
faintly
in
sight
and
the
day
have
pass
in
an
atmosphere
of
unfamiliar
Negro
face
bob
up
in
unexpected
place
and
around
unexpected
corner
,
and
insistent
Negro
voice
on
the
phone
.




in
person
,
Abe
have
succeed
in
evade
all
of
they
,
save
Jules
Peterson
.
Peterson
be
rather
in
the
position
of
the
friendly
Indian
who
have
help
a
white
.
the
Negroes
who
suffer
from
the
betrayal
be
not
so
much
after
Abe
as
after
Peterson
,
and
Peterson
be
very
much
after
what
protection
he
might
get
from
Abe
.




up
in
Stockholm
Peterson
have
fail
as
a
small
manufacturer
of
shoe
polish
and
now
possess
only
his
formula
and
sufficient
trade
tool
to
fill
a
small
box
;
however
,
his
new
protector
have
promise
in
the
early
hour
to
set
he
up
in
business
in
Versailles
.
Abe
's
former
chauffeur
be
a
shoemaker
there
and
Abe
have
hand
Peterson
two
hundred

on
account
.




Rosemary
listen
with
distaste
to
this
rigmarole
;
to
appreciate
its
grotesquerie
require
a
more
robust
sense
of
humor

his
portable
manufactory

insincere
eye

time
to

,
roll
white
semicircle
of
panic
into

figure
of

face
as
blur

the
gaunt
fine
line
of
it
would
permit
--
all
this
be
as
remote
from

"

ask
only
a

Peterson
with
the
sort
of
precise

distort
intonation
peculiar
to
colonial
country
.

withdraw
after
a
short
travesty
of
a
french
bow

the
deliberation

dirty

a
well

breed
way

slow
dream

curious

out

embrace
fleetingly
.
there
be
a
dust
of
Paris
over
both
of
they
through
which
they
scent
each
other
:
the
rubber
guard
on
Dick
's
fountain
pen
,
the
faint
odor
of
warmth
from
Rosemary
's
neck
and
shoulder
.
for
another
half
-
minute
Dick
clung
to
the
situation
;
Rosemary
be
first
to
return
to
reality
.




"
I
must
go
,
youngster
,
"
she
say
.




they
blink
at
each
other
across
a
widen
space
,
and
Rosemary
make
an
exit
that
she
have
learn
young
,
and
on
which
no
director
have
ever
try
to
improve
.




she
open
the
door
of
her
room
and
go
directly
to
her
desk
where
she
have
suddenly
remember
leave
her
wristwatch
.
it
be
there
;
slip
it
on
she
glance
down
at
the
daily
letter
to
her
mother
,
finish
the
last
sentence
in
her
mind
.
then
,
rather
gradually
,
she
realize
without
turn
about
that
she
be
not
alone
in
the
room
.




in
an
inhabited
room
there
be
refract
object
only
half
notice
:
varnish
wood
,
more
or
less
polished
brass
,
silver
and
ivory
,
and
beyond
these
a
thousand
conveyer
of
light
and
shadow
so
mild
that
one
scarcely
think
of
they
as
that
,
the
top
of
picture
-
frame
,
the
edge
of
pencil
or
ash
-
tray
,
of
crystal
or
china
ornament
;
the
totality
of
this
refraction
--
appeal
to
equally
subtle
reflex
of
the
vision
as
well
as
to
those
associational
fragment
in
the
subconscious
that
we
seem
to
hang
on
to
,
as
a
glass
-
fitter
keep
the
irregularly
shape
piece
that
may
do
some
time
--
this
fact
might
account
for
what
Rosemary
afterward
mystically
describe
as
"
realize
"
that
there
be
some
one
in
the
room
,
before
she
could
determine
it
.
but
when
she
do
realize
it
she
turn
swift
in
a
sort
of
ballet
step
and
see
that
a
dead
Negro
be
stretch
upon
her
bed
.




as
she
cry
"
aaouu

and
her
still
unfastened
wristwatch
bang
against
the
desk
she
have
the
preposterous
idea
that
it
be
Abe
North
.
then
she
dash
for
the
door
and
across
the
hall

Dick

have

.
he
have

up
coat
and

and
spread
his
shirt
on
another

a

of
his

.

jog
across
the

into
her
room
.
he
kneel
to
Peterson

heart
,
and
feel
the

the
body

warm
,
the

,

something

a
stain
on
the
green
coverlet
,
there
would
be
faint
blood
on
the

Dick
close
the
door
and
stand
think
;
he
hear
cautious
step
in
the
corridor
and
then
Nicole
call
he
by
name
.
open
the
door
he
whisper
:

he
add
quickly
,

point

his
examination

the

off

I


 



in
the
spring
of
1917
,
when
Doctor
Richard
Diver
first
arrive
in
Zurich
,
he
be
twenty
-
six
year
old
,
a
fine
age
for
a
man
,
indeed
the
very
acme
of
bachelorhood
.
even
in
war
-
time
day
,
it
be
a
fine
age
for
Dick
,
who
be
already
too
valuable
,
too
much
of
a
capital
investment
to
be
shoot
off
in
a
gun
.
year
later
it
seem
to
he
that
even
in
this
sanctuary
he
do
not
escape
lightly
,
but
about
that
he
never
fully
make
up
his
mind
--
in
1917
he
laugh
at
the
idea
,
say
apologetically
that
the
war
do
n't
touch
he
at
all
.
instruction
from
his
local
board
be
that
he
be
to
complete
his
study
in
Zurich
and
take
a
degree
as
he
have
plan
.




Switzerland
be
an
island
,
wash
on
one
side
by
the
wave
of
thunder
around
Gorizia
and
on
another
by
the
cataract
along
the
Somme
and
the
Aisne
.
for
once
there
seem
more
intriguing
stranger
than
sick
one
in
the
canton
,
but
that
have
to
be
guess
at
--
the
man
who
whisper
in
the
little
cafés
of
Berne
and
Geneva
be
as
likely
to
be
diamond
salesman
or
commercial
traveller
.
however
,
no
one
have
miss
the
long
train
of
blind
or
one
-
legged
man
,
or
die
trunk
,
that
cross
each
other
between
the
bright
lake
of
Constance
and
Neuchâtel
.
in
the
beer
-
hall
and
shop
-
window
be
bright
poster
present
the
Swiss
defend
their
frontier
in
1914
-
-with
inspiring
ferocity
young
man
and
old
man
glare
down
from
the
mountain
at
phantom
French
and
Germans
;
the
purpose
be
to
assure
the
swiss
heart
that
it
have
share
the
contagious
glory
of
those
day
.
as
the
massacre
continue
the
poster
wither
away
,
and
no
country
be
more
surprised
than
its
sister
republic
when
the
United
States
bungle
its
way
into
the
war
.




Doctor
Diver
have
see
around
the
edge
of
the
war
by
that
time
:
he
be
an
Oxford
Rhodes
Scholar
from
Connecticut
in
1914
.
he
return
home
for
a
final
year
at
Johns
Hopkins
,
and
take
his
degree
.
in
1916
he
manage
to
get
to
Vienna
under
the
impression
that
,
if
he
do
not
make
haste
,
the
great
Freud
would
eventually
succumb
to
an
aeroplane
bomb
.
even
then
Vienna
be
old
with
death
but
Dick
manage
to
get
enough
coal
and
oil
to
sit
in
his
room
in
the
Damenstiff
Strasse
and
write
the
pamphlet
that
he
later
destroy
,
but
that
,
rewrite
,
be
the
backbone
of
the
book
he
publish
in
Zurich
in
1920
.




Most
of
we
have
a
favorite
,
a
heroic
period
,
in
our
life
and
that
be
Dick
Diver
's
.
for
one
thing
he
have
no
idea
that
he
be
charming
,
that
the
affection
he
give
and
inspire
be
anything
unusual
among
healthy
people
.
in
his
last
year
at
New
Haven
some
one
refer
to
he
as
"
lucky
Dick"--the
name
linger
in
his
head
.




"
Lucky
Dick
,
you
big
stiff
,
"
he
would
whisper
to
himself
,
walk
around
the
last
stick
of
flame
in
his
room
.
"
you
hit
it
,
my
boy
.
nobody
know
it
be
there
before
you
come
along
.
"




at
the
beginning
of
1917
,
when
it
be
become
difficult
to
find
coal
,
Dick
burn
for
fuel
almost
a
hundred
textbook
that
he
have
accumulate
;
but
only
,
as
he
lay
each
one
on
the
fire
,
with
an
assurance
chuckle
inside
he
that
he
be
himself
a
digest
of
what
be
within
the
book
,
that
he
could
brief
it
five
year
from
now
,
if
it
deserve
to
be
brief
.
this
go
on
at
any
odd
hour
,
if
necessary
,
with
a
floor
rug
over
his
shoulder
,
with
the
fine
quiet
of
the
scholar
which
be
near
of
all
thing
to
heavenly
peace
--
but
which
,
as
will
presently
be
tell
,
have
to
end
.




for
its
temporary
continuance
he
thank
his
body
that
have
do
the
flying
ring
at
New
Haven
,
and
now
swam
in
the
winter
Danube
.
with
Elkins
,
second
secretary
at
the
Embassy
,
he
share
an
apartment
,
and
there
be
two
nice
girl
visitor
--
which
be
that
and
not
too
much
of
it
,
nor
too
much
of
the
Embassy
either
.
his
contact
with
Ed
Elkins
arouse
in
he
a
first
faint
doubt
as
to
the
quality
of
his
mental
process
;
he
could
not
feel
that
they
be
profoundly
different
from
the
thinking
of
Elkins
--
Elkins
,
who
would
name
you
all
the
quarterback
in
New
Haven
for
thirty
year
.




"
--And
Lucky
Dick
ca
n't
be
one
of
these
clever
man
;
he
must
be
less
intact
,
even
faintly
destroy
.
if
life
wo
n't
do
it
for
he
it
be
not
a
substitute
to
get
a
disease
,
or
a
broken
heart
,
or
an
inferiority
complex
,
though
it
'd
be
nice
to
build
out
some
broken
side
till
it
be
well
than
the
original
structure
.
"




he
mock
at
his
reasoning
,
call
it
specious
and
"
american"--his
criterion
of
uncerebral
phrase
-
making
be
that
it
be
american
.
he
know
,
though
,
that
the
price
of
his
intactness
be
incompleteness
.




"
the
good
I
can
wish
you
,
my
child
,
"
so
say
the
Fairy
Blackstick
in
Thackeray
's
the
Rose
and
the
Ring
,
"
be
a
little
misfortune
.
"




in
some
mood
he
gripe
at
his
own
reasoning
:
could
I
help
it
that
Pete
Livingstone
sit
in
the
locker
-
room
Tap
Day
when
everybody
look
all
over
hell
for
he
?
and
I
get
an
election
when
otherwise
I
would
n't
have
get
Elihu
,
know
so
few
man
.
he
be
good
and
right
and
I
ought
to
have
sit
in
the
locker
-
room
instead
.
maybe
I
would
,
if
I
'd
think
I
have
a
chance
at
an
election
.
but
Mercer
keep
come
to
my
room
all
those
week
.
I
guess
I
know
I
have
a
chance
all
right
,
all
right
.
but
it
would
have
serve
I
right
if
I
have
swallow
my
pin
in
the
shower
and
set
up
a
conflict
.




after
the
lecture
at
the
university
he
use
to
argue
this
point
with
a
young
Rumanian
intellectual
who
reassure
he
:
"
there
be
no
evidence
that
Goethe
ever
have
a
'
conflict
'
in
the
modern
sense
,
or
a
man
like
Jung
,
for
instance
.
you
be
not
a
romantic
philosopher
--
you're
a
scientist
.
memory
,
force
,
character
--
especially
good
sense
.
that
be
go
to
be
your
trouble
--
judgment
about
yourself
--
once
I
know
a
man
who
work
two
year
on
the
brain
of
an
armadillo
,
with
the
idea
that
he
would
soon
or
later
know
more
about
the
brain
of
an
armadillo
than
any
one
.
I
keep
argue
with
he
that
he
be
not
really
push
out
the
extension
of
the
human
range
--
it
be
too
arbitrary
.
and
sure
enough
,
when
he
send
his
work
to
the
medical
journal
they
refuse
it
--
they
have
just
accept
a
thesis
by
another
man
on
the
same
subject
.
"




Dick
get
up
to
Zurich
on
less
Achilles
'
heel
than
would
be
require
to
equip
a
centipede
,
but
with
plenty
--
the
illusion
of
eternal
strength
and
health
,
and
of
the
essential
goodness
of
people
;
illusion
of
a
nation
,
the
lie
of
generation
of
frontier
mother
who
have
to
croon
falsely
,
that
there
be
no
wolf
outside
the
cabin
door
.
after
he
take
his
degree
,
he
receive
his
order
to
join
a
neurological
unit
form
in
bar
-
sur
-
Aube
.




in
France
,
to
his
disgust
,
the
work
be
executive
rather
than
practical
.
in
compensation
he
find
time
to
complete
the
short
textbook
and
assemble
the
material
for
his
next
venture
.
he
return
to
Zurich
in
the
spring
of
1919
discharge
.




the
foregoing
have
the
ring
of
a
biography
,
without
the
satisfaction
of
know
that
the
hero
,
like
Grant
,
loll
in
his
general
store
in
Galena
,
be
ready
to
be
call
to
an
intricate
destiny
.
moreover
it
be
confusing
to
come
across
a
youthful
photograph
of
some
one
know
in
a
rounded
maturity
and
gaze
with
a
shock
upon
a
fiery
,
wiry
,
eagle

stranger

II


 



it
be
a
damp
April
day
,
with
long
diagonal
cloud
over
the
Albishorn
and
water
inert
in
the
low
place
.
Zurich
be
not
unlike
an
american
city
.
miss
something
ever
since
his
arrival
two
day
before
,
Dick
perceive
that
it
be
the
sense
he
have
have
in
finite
french
lane
that
there
be
nothing
more
.
in
Zurich
there
be
a
lot
besides
Zurich
--
the
roof
uple
the
eye
to
tinkle
cow
pasture
,
which
in
turn
modify
hilltop
far
up
--
so
life
be
a
perpendicular
start
off
to
a
postcard
heaven
.
the
Alpine
land
,
home
of
the
toy
and
the
funicular
,
the
merry
-
go
-
round
and
the
thin
chime
,
be
not
a
being
here
,
as
in
France
with
french
vine
grow
over
one
's
foot
on
the
ground
.




in
Salzburg
once
Dick
have
feel
the
superimpose
quality
of
a
buy
and
borrow
century
of
music
;
once
in
the
laboratory
of
the
university
in
Zurich
,
delicately
poke
at
the
cervical
of
a
brain
,
he
have
feel
like
a
toy
-
maker
rather
than
like
the
tornado
who
have
hurry
through
the
old
red
building
of
Hopkins
,
two
year
before
,
unstaye
by
the
irony
of
the
gigantic
Christ
in
the
entrance
hall
.




yet
he
have
decide
to
remain
another
two
year
in
Zurich
,
for
he
do
not
underestimate
the
value
of
toy
-
making
,
in
infinite
precision
,
of
infinite
patience
.




to
-
day
he
go
out
to
see
Franz
Gregorovius
at
Dohmler
's
clinic
on
the
Zurichsee
.
Franz
,
resident
pathologist
at
the
clinic
,
a
Vaudois
by
birth
,
a
few
year
old
than
Dick
,
meet
he
at
the
tram
stop
.
he
have
a
dark
and
magnificent
aspect
of
Cagliostro
about
he
,
contrast
with
holy
eye
;
he
be
the
third
of
the
Gregoroviuses
--
his
grandfather
have
instruct
Krapaelin
when
psychiatry
be
just
emerge
from
the
darkness
of
all
time
.
in
personality
he
be
proud
,
fiery
,
and
sheeplike
--
he
fancy
himself
as
a
hypnotist
.
if
the
original
genius
of
the
family
have
grow
a
little
tired
,
Franz
would
without
doubt
become
a
fine
clinician
.




on
the
way
to
the
clinic
he
say
:
"
tell
I
of
your
experience
in
the
war

be
you
change
like
the
rest

you
have
the
same
stupid

unage
american

not
stupid

"




"
I
do
n't
see
any

have
gather
that
from
my
letter
,
Franz
.
"




"
that
do
n't
matter

we
have
some
shell
-
shock
who
merely
hear
an
air
raid
from
a
distance
.
we
have
a
few
who
merely
read
newspaper

nonsense

CAPTAIN
DIVER
:




I
know
introspection
be
not
good
for
a
highly
nervous
state
like
mine
,
but
I
would
like
you
to
know
where
I
stand
.
last
year
or
whenever
it
be
in
Chicago
when
I
get
so
I
could
n't
speak
to
servant
or
walk
in
the
street
I
keep
wait
for
some
one
to
tell
I
.
it
be
the
duty
of
some
one
who
understand
.
the
blind
must
be
lead
.
only
no
one
would
tell
I
everything
--
they
would
just
tell
I
half
and
I
be
already
too
muddle
to
put
two
and
two
together
.
one
man
be
nice
--
he
be
a
french
officer
and
he
understand
.
he
give
I
a
flower
and
say
it
be
"
plus
petite
et




(

)




moin
entendue
.
"
we
be
friend
.
then
he
take
it
away
.
I
grow
sicker
and
there
be
no
one
to
explain
to
I
.
they
have
a
song
about
Joan
of
Arc
that
they
use
to
sing
at
I
but
that
be
just
mean
--
it
would
just
make
I
cry
,
for
there
be
nothing
the
matter
with
my
head
then
.
they
keep
make
reference
to
sport
,
too
,
but
I
do
n't
care
by
that
time
.
so
there
be
that
day
I
went
walk
on
Michigan
Boulevard
on
and
on
for
mile
and
finally
they
follow
I
in
an
automobile
,
but
I
would
n't
get




(
3
)




in
.
finally
they
pull
I
in
and
there
be
nurse
.
after
that
time
I
begin
to
realize
it
all
,
because
I
could
feel
what
be
happen
in
other
.
so
you
see
how
I
stand
.
and
what
good
can
it
be
for
I
to
stay
here
with
the
doctor
harp
constantly
in
the
thing
I
be
here
to
get
over
.
so
today
I
have
write
my
father
to
come
and
take
I
away
.
I
be
glad

you
be
so
interested
in
examine
people

send
they

they
just

I
some
phonograph
record
in
case
I
should
forget
my
lesson
and
I
break
they
all
so
the
nurse
wo
n't
speak
to
I
.
they
be
in
English
,
so
that
the
nurse
would
not
understand
.
one
doctor
in
Chicago
say
I
be
bluff
,
but
what
he
really
mean
be
that
I
be
a
twin
six

he

never

they
for
help
or
pity
.
I
have
have
enough
and
it
be
simply
ruin
my
health
and
waste
my
time
pretend
that
what
be
the
matter
with
my




(

head
be
curable
.




here
I
be
in
what
appear
to
be
a
semi
-
insane
-
asylum
,
all
because
nobody
see
fit
to
tell
I
the
truth
about
anything
.
if
I
have
only
know
what
be
go
on
like
I
know
now
I
could
have
stand
it
I
guess
for
I
be
pretty
strong
,
but
those
who
should
have
,
do
not
see
fit
to
enlighten
I
.




(

and
now
,
when
I
know
and
have
pay
such
a
price
for
know
,
they
sit
there
with
their
dog
live
and
say
I
should
believe
what
I
do
believe
.
especially
one
do
but
I
know
now
.




I
be
lonesome
all
the
time
far
away
from
friend
and
family
across
the
Atlantic
I
roam
all
over
the
place
in
a
half
daze
.
if
you

get
I
a
position

as
a

nurse
,
though
I
would
have
to

you
would
prove
a
great
blessing
.




 



and
again
:




 



since
you
will
not
accept
my
explanation
of
what
be
the
matter
you
could
at
least
explain
to
I
what
you
think
,
because
you
have
a
kind
cat
's
face
,
and
not
that
funny
look
that
seem
to
be
so
fashionable
here

I
a
snapshot

MON

so
glad

oh
,
I
understand
your
note
very
well
indeed
.
only
I
think
from
the
moment
I
meet
you
that
you
be
different
.




 



dear
capitaine
:




I
think
one
thing
today
and
another
tomorrow
.
that
be
really
all
that
be
the
matter
with
I
,
except
a
crazy
defiance
and
a
lack
of
proportion
.
I
would
gladly
welcome
any
alienist
you
might
suggest
.
here
they
lie
in
their
bath
tub
and
sing
play
in
your
Own
Backyard
as
if
I
have
my




(

)




backyard
to
play
in
or
any
hope
which
I
can
find
by
look
either
backward
or
forward
.
they
try
it
again
in
the
candy
store
again
and
I
almost
hit
the
man
with
the
weight
,
but
they
hold
I
.




I
be
not
go
to
write
you
any
more
.
I
be
too
unstable
.




 



and
then
a
month
with
no
letter
.
and
then
suddenly
the
change
.




 



--I
be
slowly

back
to

you
must
be
very
wise

you
do
n't
look
like
that
in
the
picture

I

.
.




--Today
I

strange
a

ago
before
I
be
sick

I
suppose
it
will
be
year
,
though
,
before
I
could
think
of
anything
like
that
.




 



but
when
Dick

answer
be
delay
for
any
reason

there
be
a
flutter
burst
of
worry

a
worry
of
a
lover

with

recover
,
all
except
the
formal
part
of
his
correspondence
be
sacrifice
to
the
consequent
fatigue
,
and
shortly
afterward
the
memory
of
she
become
overlaid
by
the
vivid
presence
of
a
Wisconsin
telephone
girl
at
headquarters
in
bar

sur

Aube
.
she

Dick

he
would
probably
be
a
fine
clinician

sonorous

staccato
cadence

which

not
from
his
nervous
system

from
a
tremendous
and
harmless
vanity
.
his
true
emotion
be
more
order

keep
to
himself

Doctor

one
section
of
the
latter
's
mind
keep
think
intermittently
of
Chicago
.
once
in
his
youth
he
could
have
go
to
Chicago
as
fellow
and
docent
at
the
university
,
and
perhaps
become
rich
there
and
own
his
own
clinic
instead
of
be
only
a
minor
shareholder
in
a
clinic
.

when
he
have
think
of
what
he
consider
his
own
thin
knowledge
spread
over
that
whole
area
,
over
all
those
wheat
field
,
those
endless
prairie
,
he
have
decide
against
it
.
but
he
have
read
about
Chicago
in
those
day
,
about
the
great
feudal
family
of
Armour
,
Palmer
,
Field
,
Crane
,
Warren
,
Swift

many
other

since
that
time

a
few

have
come
to
he
from
that
stratum
of
Chicago

a
matter

October

suddenly
.
two
thousand

the
necklace
and

of
light
that

Montreux
and
Vevey

a
dim
pendant
of
Lausanne

from
down
there
somewhere
ascend
a
faint
sound
of
dance
music
.
Nicole
be
up
in
her
head
now
,
cool
as
cool
,
try
to
collate
the
sentimentality
of
her
childhood
,
as
deliberate
as
a
man
get
drunk
after
battle
.
but
she
be
still
afraid
of
Dick
,
who
stand
near
she
,
lean
,
characteristically
,
against
the
iron
fence
that
rim
the
horseshoe
;
and
this
prompt
she
to
say
:
"
I
can
remember
how
I
stand
wait
for
you
in
the
garden
--
hold
all
my
self
in
my
arm
like
a
basket
of
flower
.
it
be
that
to
I

over

loud
down

with
it
come
a
dark

can
make
well
time
by

.
can
you
let
Nicole
ride
as
far
as
Zurich
with
you
,
since
you
be
go
back
Monday

and
drop
she
at
the
sanitarium
?
be
this
too
much
to
ask
?




sincerely
,




BETH
EVAN
WARREN
.




 



Dick
be
furious
--
Miss
Warren
have
know
he
have
a
bicycle
with
he
;
yet
she
have
so
phrase
her
note
that
it
be
impossible
to
refuse
.
throw
we
together
!
sweet
propinquity
and
the
Warren
money
!




he
be
wrong
;
Baby
Warren
have
no
such
intention
.
she
have
look
Dick
over
with
worldly
eye
,
she
have
measure
he
with
the
warped
rule
of
an
Anglophile
and
find
he
want
--
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
she
find
he
toothsome
.
but
for
she
he
be
too
"
intellectual
"
and
she
pigeonhole
he
with
a
shabby
-
snobby
crowd
she
have
once
know
in
London
--
he
put
himself
out
too
much
to
be
really
of
the
correct
stuff
.
she
could
not
see
how
he
could
be
make
into
her
idea
of
an
aristocrat
.




in
addition
to
that
he
be
stubborn
--
she
have
see
he
leave
her
conversation
and
get
down
behind
his
eye
in
that
odd
way
that
people
do
,
half
a
dozen
time
.
she
have
not
like
Nicole
's
free
and
easy
manner
as
a
child
and
now
she
be
sensibly
habituate
to
think
of
she
as
a
"
go
coon
"
;
and
anyhow
Doctor
Diver
be
not
the
sort
of
medical
man
she
could
envisage
in
the
family
.




she
only
want
to
use
he
innocently
as
a
convenience
.




but
her
request
have
the
effect
that
Dick
assume
she
desire
.
a
ride
in
a
train
can
be
a
terrible
,
heavy
-
hearted
or
comic
thing
;
it
can
be
a
trial
flight
;
it
can
be
a
prefiguration
of
another
journey
just
as
a
give
day
with
a
friend
can
be
long
,
from
the
taste
of
hurry
in
the
morning
up
to
the
realization
of
both
be
hungry
and
take
food
together
.
then
come
the
afternoon
with
the
journey
fade
and
die
,
but
quicken
again
at
the
end
.
Dick
be
sad
to
see
Nicole
's
meagre
joy
;
yet
it
be
a
relief
for
she
,
go
back
to
the
only
home
she
know
.
they
make
no
love
that
day
,

when

find
the

when

act
through
a

the

send

up

they
find
that

have
buy

they
look

to

a

the
germ
of
all

he
be
currently
uneasy
about
the
whole
thing
.
he
resent
the
waste
year
at
New

mostly
he
feel
a
discrepancy
between
the

the
Divers
live

and
the
need
for
display
which
apparently
go
along
with
it

remember
his
rumanian
friend
's
story
,
about
the
man
who
have
work

he
have
about

to
brief
the
work
in
its
present
condition

publish
it
in
an
undocumented
volume
of
a
hundred
thousand
word
as
an
introduction
to
more
scholarly
volume
to
follow
.




he
confirm
this
decision
walk
around
the
ray
of
late
afternoon
in
his
work

room
.
with
the
new
plan
he
could
be
through
by
spring

it
seem
to
he
that
when
a
man

his
energy

for
a
year
by
increase
doubt
,
it
indicate
some
fault
in
the
plan

he
lay
the
bar
of
gild
metal
that
he
use

send
off
an
order
to
a

an
ounce
of

with
twice
as

presently
he
must
encounter
she

the
prospect
give
he
a
leaden
feeling

while
she

morning

break
in
upon
her
confusion
before
it
could
form
,
with
word
of
tenderness
and
protection

she
sleep
again
with
his
face
against
the
warm
scent
of
her
hair
.
before
she
wake
he
have
arrange
everything
at
the
phone
in
the
next
room

for
the
Riviera
at
noon
.




then
there
be
a
reaction
.
as
they
settle
down
in
the
wagon
-
light
Dick
see
that
Nicole
be
wait
for
it
,
and
it
come
quickly
and
desperately
,
before
the
train
be
out
of
the
ceinture
--
his
only
instinct
be
to
step
off
while
the
train
be
still
go
slow
,
rush
back
and
see
where
Rosemary
be
,
what
she
be
do
.
he
open
a
book
and
bend
his
pince
-
nez
upon
it
,
aware
that
Nicole
be
watch
he
from
her
pillow
across
the
compartment
.
unable
to
read
,
he
pretend
to
be
tired
and
shut
his
eye
but
she
be
still
watch
he
,
and
though
still
she
be
half
asleep
from
the
hangover
of
the
drug
,
she
be
relieve
and
almost
happy
that
he
be
hers
again
.




it
be
bad
with
his
eye
shut
for
it
give
a
rhythm
of
find
and
lose
,
find
and
lose
;
but
so
as
not
to
appear
restless
he
lie
like
that
until
noon
.
at
luncheon
thing
be
well
--
it
be
always
a
fine
meal
;
a
thousand

lit
,
buffet
,
and
aeroplane
be
a
mighty
collation
to
have
take
together
.
the
familiar
hurry
of
the
train
waiter
,
the
little
bottle
of
wine
and
mineral
water
,
the
excellent
food
of
the
Paris
-
Lyons
-
Méditerranee
give
they
the
illusion
that
everything
be
the
same
as
before
,
but
it
be
almost
the
first
trip
he
have
ever
take
with
Nicole
that
be
a
go
away
rather
than
a
go
toward
.
he
drink
a
whole
bottle
of
wine
save
for
Nicole
's
single
glass
;
they
talk
about
the
house
and
the
child
.
but
once
back
in
the
compartment
a
silence
fall
over
they
like
the
silence
in
the
restaurant
across
from
the
Luxembourg
.
recede
from
a
grief
,
it
seem
necessary
to
retrace
the
same
step
that
bring
we
there
.
an
unfamiliar
impatience
settle
on
Dick
;
suddenly
Nicole
say
:

they
be
both
restless
in
the
night
.
in
a
day
or
two
Dick
would
try
to
banish
the
ghost
of
Rosemary
before
it
become
walled
up
with
they
,
but
for
the
moment
he
have
no
force
to
do
it
.
sometimes
it
be
hard
to
deprive
oneself
of
a
pain
than
of
a
pleasure
and
the
memory
so
possess
he
that
for
the
moment
there
be
nothing
to
do
but
to
pretend
.
this
be
more
difficult
because
he
be
currently
annoy
with
Nicole
,
who
,
after
all
these
year
,
should
recognize
symptom
of
strain
in
herself
and
guard
against
they
.
twice
within
a
fortnight
she
have
break
up
:
there
have
be
the
night
of
the
dinner
at
Tarmes
when
he
have
find
she
in
her
bedroom
dissolve
in
crazy
laughter
tell
Mrs.
McKisco
she
could
not
go
in
the
bathroom
because
the
key
be
throw
down
the
well
.
Mrs.
McKisco
be
astonish
and
resentful
,
baffled
and
yet
in
a
way
comprehend
.
Dick
have
not
be
particularly
alarm
then
,
for
afterward
Nicole
be
repentant
.
she
call
at
Gausse
's
Hotel
but
the
McKiscos
be
go
.




the
collapse
in
Paris
be
another
matter
,
add
significance
to
the
first
one
.
it
prophesy
possibly
a
new
cycle
,
a
new
pousse
of
the
malady
.
having
go
through
unprofessional
agony
during
her
long
relapse
follow
Topsy
's
birth

he
have
,
perforce
,
harden
himself
about
she
,
make
a
cleavage
between
Nicole
sick
and
Nicole
well
.
this
make
it
difficult
now
to
distinguish
between
his
self
-
protective
professional
detachment
and
some
new
coldness
in
his
heart
.
as
an
indifference
cherish
,
or
leave
to
atrophy
,
become
an
emptiness
,
to
this
extent
he
have
learn
to
become
empty
of
Nicole
,
serve
she
against
his
will
with
negation
and
emotional
neglect

one
write
of
scar
heal
,
a
loose
parallel
to
the
pathology
of
the
skin
,
but
there
be
no
such
thing
in
the
life
of
an
individual
.
there
be
open
wound
,
shrink
sometimes
to
the
size
of
a
pin
-
prick
but
wound
still
.
the
mark
of
suffering
be
more
comparable
to
the
loss
of
a
finger
,
or
of
the
sight
of
an
eye
.
we
may
not
miss
they
,
either
,
for
one
minute
in

if

Nicole
,
hear
it

would
guess
quickly
at
a
nostalgia
for
the
past

he
break
off

chord

leave

it
be
hard
to
know
where
to

about

that

have
make
,

for
cellar

,
and
for
Lanier
's

never

without
Dick

rather
ascetically

with
the
cheap

penalize
himself
for
any
extravagance

maintain
a
qualified
financial
independence

after
a
certain
point
,

,
it
be
difficult

again

again
it

necessary
to
decide
together

the

to
which

he
to
stand
still
forever

encourage
any
slackness
on
his

in
multiplying
way
he
be
constantly
inundate
by
a
trickling
of

in

,
her
income

increase
so
fast

it

also
,

the
purpose

for
many
year
pretend
to
a
rigid
domesticity
from

away

pretense

arduous
in
this
effortless
immobility
,

Round

round

around

the
bright
color
of

work
with
give
stranger
a
momentary
illusion

those

once

there
be
a

he
neglect
they

that
he
be
not
simple
,
or
that

their
response
be
not
dissimilar
to
those
that
Dick
evoke
in
non

professional
life
,
but
here
they
be
warp
and
distorted

unyielde

and
every
casual

,
perhaps
,
Dick

,
he
be
quite
right
.




his
most
interesting
case

exciting
emotional

by

that
only
after
the
episode
do
he
realize
with
the
consciousness
of
his
own
relaxation
from
tension
,
that
she
have
succeed
in

apart
,

the
child
,
resent
they
as
part
of
a
downright
world

seek
to
make

presently
Dick
find
they

by
woman
who

with
delight

"




they
start
back
with
a
hot
sorrow
stream
down
upon
they
;
the
car
be
weight
with
their
mutual
apprehension
and
anguish
,
and
the
child
's
mouth
be
grave
with
disappointment
.
Grief
present
itself
in
its
terrible
,
dark
unfamiliar
color
.
somewhere
around
Zug
,
Nicole
,
with
a
convulsive
effort
,
reiterate
a
remark
she
have
make
before
about
a
misty
yellow
house
set
back
from
the
road
that
look
like
a
painting
not
yet
dry
,
but
it
be
just
an
attempt
to
catch
at
a
rope
that
be
play
out
too
swiftly
.




Dick
try
to
rest
--
the
struggle
would
come
presently
at
home
and
he
might
have
to
sit
a
long
time
,
restate
the
universe
for
she
.
a
"
schizophrêne
"
be
well
name
as
a
split
personality
--
Nicole
be
alternately
a
person
to
whom
nothing
need
be
explain
and
one
to
whom
nothing
could
be
explain
.
it
be
necessary
to
treat
she
with
active
and
affirmative
insistence
,
keep
the
road
to
reality
always
open
,
make
the
road
to
escape
hard
go
.
but
the
brilliance
,
the
versatility
of
madness
be
akin
to
the
resourcefulness
of
water
seep
through
,
over
and
around
a
dike
.
it
require
the
united
front
of
many
people
to
work
against
it
.
he
feel
it
necessary
that
this
time
Nicole
cure
herself
;
he
want
to
wait
until
she
remember
the
other
time
,
and
revolt
from
they
.
in
a
tired
way
,
he
plan
that
they
would
again
resume
the
régime
relax
a
year
before
.




he
have
turn
up
a
hill
that
make
a
short
cut
to
the
clinic
,
and
now
as
he
step
on
the
accelerator
for
a
short
straightaway
run
parallel
to
the
hillside
the

swerve
violently
leave
,
swerve
right
,

on
two

,
as
Dick
,
with
Nicole
's
voice
scream
in
his
ear
,
crush
down
the
mad
hand

the
steering

once
more

shoot
off

through

again

settle
slowly
at
an
angle
of
ninety
degree
against
a
tree

the

be
scream
and
Nicole
be
scream
and
curse
and
try
to
tear
at
Dick
's
face
.
think
first
of
the
list
of
the
car
and
unable
to
estimate
it
Dick
bend
away
Nicole
's
arm
,
climb
over
the
top
side
and
lift
out
the
child
;
then
he
see
the
car
be
in
a
stable
position
.
before
do
anything
else
he
stand
there

on
the

have
imagine
that

have
cause
it
;
she
laugh
as
after
some
mild
escape
of
childhood

she
speak
with
such
force
that
in
his
shocked
state
Dick
wonder
if
he
have
be
frightened
for
himself

but
the
strained
face
of
the
child
,
look
from
parent

make
he
want
to
grind
her
grinning
mask
into

directly
above

half
a

by
the
winding

only
a

Dick
shout
after

the

climb
for
a
moment
until
they
disappear
among
the
pine
half
way
up

then
he
walk
around

car
to
see
the
damage
and
plan
how
to
get
it
back
on

in

dirt

have
pursue
for
over
a

be

in
a

there
would
be
cynical
Latins

some
man
of
Freud

articulate
among
they
would

the
great
Jung

on
his
round

boy

at
first
there
would
be
an
american
cast
to
the
congress
,
almost
rotarian
in
its
form
and
ceremony
,
then
the
close
-
knit
european
vitality
would
fight
through
,
and
finally
the
Americans
would
play
their
trump

the
announcement
of
colossal
gift

endowment
,
of
great
new

in
the
presence
of
the
figure
the
Europeans
would
blanch
and
walk
timidly

he
would
not
be
there
to
see

they
skirt
the
Vorarlberg
Alps
,
and
Dick
feel
a
pastoral
delight
in
watch
the
village
.
there
be
always
four
or
five
in
sight
,
each
one
gather
around
a
church
.
it
be
simple
look
at
the
earth
from
far
off
,
simple
as
play
grim
game
with
doll
and
soldier
.
this
be
the
way
statesman
and
commander
and
all
retire
people
look
at
thing
.
anyhow
,
it
be
a
good
draft
of
relief
.




an
Englishman
speak
to
he
from
across
the
aisle
but
he
find
something
antipathetic
in
the
English
lately
.
England
be
like
a
rich
man
after
a
disastrous
orgy
who
make
up
to
the
household
by
chat
with
they
individually
,
when
it
be
obvious
to
they
that
he
be
only
try
to
get
back
his
self
-
respect
in
order
to
usurp
his
former
power
.




Dick
have
with
he
what
magazine
be
available
on
the
station
quay
:
the
Century
,
the
Motion
Picture
,
l'lllustration
,
and
the
Fliegende
Blätter
,
but
it
be
more
fun
to
descend
in
his
imagination
into
the
village
and
shake
hand
with
the
rural
character
.
he
sit
in
the
church
as
he
sit
in
his
father
's
church
in
Buffalo
,
amid
the
starchy
must
of
Sunday
clothe
.
he
listen
to
the
wisdom
of
the
Near
East
,
be
crucify
,
Died
,
and
be
bury
in
the
cheerful
church
,
and
once
more
worried
between
five
or
ten
cent
for
the
collection
plate
,
because
of
the
girl
who
sit
in
the
pew
behind
.




the
Englishman
suddenly
borrow
his
magazine
with
a
little
small
change
of
conversation
,
and
Dick
,
glad
to
see
they
go
,
thought
of
the
voyage
ahead
of
he
.
Wolf
-
like
under
his
sheep
's
clothing
of
long
-
staple
australian
wool
,
he
consider
the
world
of
pleasure
--
the
incorruptible
Mediterranean
with
sweet
old
dirt
cake
in
the
olive
tree
,
the
peasant
girl
near
Savona
with
a
face
as

far
away

walk
in
the
garden
later
when
it
be
quite
dark
he
think
about
she
with
detachment
,
love
she
for
her
good
self
.
he
remember
once
when
the
grass
be
damp
and
she
come
to
he
on
hurried
foot
,
her
thin
slipper

with
dew

upon
his

close
and

"




but
Dick
have
come
away
for
his
soul
's
sake
,
and
he
begin
think
about
that
.
he
have
lose
himself
--
he
could
not
tell
the
hour
when
,
or
the
day
or
the
week
,
the
month
or
the
year
.
once
he
have
cut
through
thing
,
solve
the
most
complicated
equation
as
the
simple
problem
of
his
simple
patient
.
between
the
time
he
find
Nicole
flower
under
a
stone
on
the
Zurichsee
and
the
moment
of
his
meeting
with
Rosemary
the
spear
have
be
blunt
.




watch
his
father
's
struggle
in
poor
parish
have
wed
a
desire
for
money
to
an
essentially
unacquisitive
nature
.
it
be
not
a
healthy
necessity
for
security
--
he
have
never
feel
more
sure
of
himself
,
more
thoroughly
his
own
man
,
than
at
the
time
of
his
marriage
to
Nicole
.
yet
he
have
be
swallow
up
like
a
gigolo
,
and
somehow
permit
his
arsenal
to
be
lock
up
in
the
Warren
safety
-
deposit
vault
.




"
there
should
have
be
a
settlement
in
the
continental
style
;
but
it
be
n't
over
yet
.
I
've
waste
eight
year
teach
the
rich
the
ABC

of
human
decency

but
I

not

.
I
've
get
too
many
unplayed

in
my
hand

"




he
loiter
among
the
fallow
rose
bush
and
the
bed
of
damp
sweet
indistinguishable
fern
.
it
be
warm
for
October
but
cool
enough
to
wear
a
heavy
tweed
coat
button
by
a
little
elastic
tape
at
the
neck
.
a
figure
detach
itself
from
the
black
shape
of
a
tree
and
he
know
it
be
the
woman
whom
he
have
pass
in
the
lobby
come
out
.
he
be
in
love
with
every
pretty
woman
he
see
now
,
their
form
at
a
distance
,
their
shadow
on
a
wall
.




her
back
be
toward
he
as
she
face
the
light
of
the
town
.
he
scratch
a
match
that
she
must
have
hear
,
but
she
remain
motionless
.




--was
it
an
invitation
?
or
an
indication
of
obliviousness
?
he
have
long
be
outside
of
the
world
of
simple
desire
and
their
fulfillment
,
and
he
be
inept
and
uncertain
.
for
all
he
know
there
might
be
some
code
among
the
wanderer
of
obscure
spa
by
which
they
find
each
other
quickly
.




--Perhaps
the
next
gesture
be
his
.
strange
child
should
smile
at
each
other
and
say
,
"
let
's
play
.
"




he
move
close
,
the
shadow
move
sideways
.
possibly
he
would
be
snub
like
the
scapegrace
drummer
he
have
hear
of
in
youth
.
his
heart
beat
loud
in
contact
with
the
unprobe
,
undissected
,
unanalyzed
,
unaccounted
for
.
suddenly
he
turn
away
,
and
,
as
he
do
,
the
girl
,
too
,
break
the
black
frieze
she
make
with
the
foliage
,
round
a
bench
at
a
moderate
but
determined
pace
and
take
the
path
back
to
the
hotel
.




with
a
guide
and
two
other
man
,
Dick
start
up
the
Birkkarspitze
next
morning
.
it
be
a
fine
feeling
once
they
be
above
the
cowbell
of
the
high
pasture
--
Dick
look
forward
to
the
night
in
the
shack
,
enjoy
his
own
fatigue
,
enjoy
the
captaincy
of
the
guide
,
feel
a
delight
in
his
own
anonymity
.
but
at
mid
-
day
the
weather
change
to
black
sleet
and
hail
and
mountain
thunder
.
Dick
and
one
of
the
other
climber
want
to
go
on
but
the
guide
refuse
.
regretfully
they
struggle
back
to
innsbruck
to
start
again
to
-
morrow
.




after
dinner
and
a
bottle
of
heavy
local
wine
in
the
deserted
dining
-
room
,
he
feel
excited
,
without
know
why
,
until
he
begin
think
of
the
garden
.
he
have
pass
the
girl
in
the
lobby
before
supper
and
this
time
she
have
look
at
he
and
approve
of
he
,
but
it
keep
worry
he
:
why
?
when
I
could
have
have
a
good
share
of
the
pretty
woman
of
my
time
for
the
asking
,
why
start
that
now
?
with
a
wraith
,
with
a
fragment
of
my
desire
?
why
?




his
imagination
push
ahead
--
the
old
asceticism
,
the
actual
unfamiliarity
,
triumph
:
God
,
I
might
as
well
go
back
to
the
Riviera
and
sleep
with
Janice
Caricamento
or
the
wilburhazy
girl
.
to
belittle
all
these
year
with
something
cheap
and
easy
?




he
be
still
excited
,
though
,
and
he
turn
from
the
veranda
and
go
up
to
his
room
to
think
.
be
alone
in
body
and
spirit
beget
loneliness
,
and
loneliness
beget
more
loneliness
.




Upstairs
he
walk
around
thinking
of
the
matter
and
lay
out
his
climbing
clothe
advantageously
on
the
faint
heater
;
he
again
encounter
Nicole
's
telegram
,
still
unopened
,
with
which
diurnally
she
accompany
his
itinerary
.
he
have
delay
opening
it
before
supper
--
perhaps
because
of
the
garden
.
it
be
a
cablegram
from
Buffalo
,
forward
through
Zurich
.




 



"

father
die
peacefully
tonight
.
HOLMES
.
"




 



he
feel
a
sharp
wince
at
the
shock
,
a
gathering
of
the
force
of
resistance
;
then
it
roll
up
through
his
loin
and
stomach
and
throat
.




he
read
the
message
again
.
he
sit
down
on
the
bed
,
breathe
and
stare
;
think
first
the
old
selfish
child
's
thought
that
come
with
the
death
of
a
parent
,
how
will
it
affect
I
now
that
this
early
and
strong
of
protection
be
go
?




the
atavism
pass
and
he
walk
the
room
still
,
stop
from
time
to
time
to
look
at
the
telegram
.
Holmes
be
formally
his
father
's
curate
but
actually
,
and
for
a
decade
,
rector
of
the
church
.
how
do
he
die
?
of
old
age
--
he
be
seventy
-
five
.
he
have
live
a
long
time
.




Dick
feel
sad
that
he
have
die
alone
--
he
have
survive
his
wife
,
and
his
brother
and
sister
;
there
be
cousin
in
Virginia
but
they
be
poor
and
not
able
to
come
North
,
and
Holmes
have
have
to
sign
the
telegram
.
Dick
love
his
father
--
again
and
again
he
refer
judgment
to
what
his
father
would
probably
have
think
or
do
.
Dick
be
bear
several
month
after
the
death
of
two
young
sister
and
his
father
,
guess
what
would
be
the
effect
on
Dick
's
mother
,
have
save
he
from
a
spoiling
by
become
his
moral
guide
.
he
be
of
tired
stock
yet
he
raise
himself
to
that
effort
.




in
the
summer
father
and
son
walk
downtown
together
to
have
their
shoe
shine
--
Dick
in
his
starched
duck
sailor
suit
,
his
father
always
in
beautifully
cut
clerical
clothe
--
and
the
father
be
very
proud
of
his
handsome
little
boy
.
he
tell
Dick
all
he
know
about
life
,
not
much
but
most
of
it
true
,
simple
thing
,
matter
of
behavior
that
come
within
his
clergyman
's
range
.
"
once
in
a
strange
town
when
I
be
first
ordain
,
I
go
into
a
crowded
room
and
be
confuse
as
to
who
be
my
hostess
.
several
people
I
know
come
toward
I
,
but
I
disregard
they
because
I
have
see
a
gray
-
haired
woman
sit
by
a
window
far
across
the
room
.
I
go
over
to
she
and
introduce
myself
.
after
that
I
make
many
friend
in
that
town
.
"




his
father
have
do
that
from
a
good
heart
--
his
father
have
be
sure
of
what
he
be
,
with
a
deep
pride
of
the
two
proud
widow
who
have
raise
he
to
believe
that
nothing
could
be
superior
to
"
good
instinct
,
"
honor
,
courtesy
,
and
courage

the
father
always
consider
that
his
wife
's
small
fortune
belong
to
his
son
,
and
in
college
and
in
medical
school
send
he
a
check
for
all
of
it
four
time
a
year
.
he
be
one
of
those
about
whom
it
be
say
with
smug
finality
in
the
gilded
age
:

from
the
telegram
open
on
his
bureau
,
he
choose
a
ship
to
go
to
America
.
then
he
put
in
a
call
for
Nicole
in
Zurich
,
remember
so
many
thing
as
he
wait
,
and
wish
he
have
always

XIX


 



for
an
hour
,
tie
up
with
his
profound
reaction
to
his
father
's
death
,
the
magnificent
façade
of
the
homeland
,
the
harbor
of
New
York
,
seem
all
sad
and
glorious
to
Dick
,

once
ashore
the
feeling
vanish
,
nor
do
he
find
it
again
in
the
street
or
the
hotel
or
the
train
that
bear
he
first
to
Buffalo
,
and
then
south
to
Virginia
with
his

the
local
train
shamble
into
the
low
-
forest
clayland
of
Westmoreland
County
,
do
he
feel
once
more
identify
with
his
surrounding
;
at
the
station
he
see
a
star
he
know
,
and
a
cold
moon
bright
over
Chesapeake
Bay
;

listless
band

tango

a
dozen
couple
cover
the
wide
floor

those
elaborate
and
dainty
step

offensive

air

with

be
wait
for
something
to
happen
.
with
the
narrow
vision
of
his
one
eye
Dick
could
see
the
carabinieri
;
they
be
tuscan
peasant
with
short
upper
lip
and
he
find
it
difficult
to
associate
they
with
the
brutality
of
last
night
.
he
send
one
of
they
to
fetch
he
a
glass
of
beer

the
beer
make
he
light
-
head
and
the
episode
be
momentarily
illumined
by
a
ray
of
sardonic
humor
.
Collis
be
under
the
impression
that
the
english
girl
have
something
to
do
with
the
catastrophe
,
but
Dick
be
sure
she
have
disappear
long
before
it
happen

Collis
be
still
absorb
by
the
fact
that

rage

vast
criminal
irresponsibility

what
have
happen
to
he
be
so
awful
that
nothing
could
make
any
difference

he
could
choke
it
to
death
,
and
,
as
this
be
unlikely
,
he
be
hopeless
.
he
would
be
a
different
person
henceforward
,
and
in
his
raw
state
he
have
bizarre
feeling
of
what
the
new
self
would
be
.
the
matter
have
about
it
the
impersonal
quality
of
an
act
of
God
.
no
mature
Aryan
be
able
to
profit
by
a
humiliation
;
when
he
forgive
it
have
become
part
of

life

he
have
identify
himself
with
the
thing

humiliate

an
upshot
that
in
this
case
be
impossible

when
Collis

of
retribution

stream
of
scold
at
his

be
in

the
first
thing
be
to

less
a

an
ammoniacal
reminder

the
eternity

decay

to
Franz
this
be
as
natural
as
the
thick
dark
scent

who
have
recently

their
degree

neuropathology

I
turn
to
Dick
when
case
be
highly
involve
.
his
publication
be
still
standard
in
their
line
--
go
into
any
medical
library
and
ask
.
Most
student
think
he
be
an
Englishman

they
do
n't
believe
that
such
thoroughness
could
come
out

Kaethe

"
you
be
the
solid
one
,
you
do
the
work

it
be
a
case

hare

tortoise

in
my
opinion
the
hare

race
be
almost
do

push
down
air
briskly
.




"
stop
!
"




the
upshot
be
that
they
have
exchange
viewpoint
like
debater
.
Kaethe
admit
to
herself
that
she
have
be
too
hard
on
Dick
,
whom
she
admire
and
of
whom
she
stand
in
awe
,
who
have
be
so
appreciative
and
understanding
of
herself
.
as
for
Franz
,
once
Kaethe
's
idea
have
have
time
to
sink
in
,
he
never
after
believe
that
Dick
be
a
serious
person
.
and
as
time
go
on
he
convince
himself
that
he
have
never
think
so
.




 



 



II


 



Dick
tell
Nicole
an
expurgate
version
of
the
catastrophe
in
Rome
--
in
his
version
he
have
go
philanthropically
to
the
rescue
of
a
drunken
friend
.
he
could
trust
Baby
Warren
to
hold
her
tongue
,
since
he
have
paint
the
disastrous
effect
of
the
truth
upon
Nicole
.
all
this
,
however
,
be
a
low
hurdle
compare
to
the
linger
effect
of
the
episode
upon
he
.




in
reaction
he
take
himself
for
an
intensified
beating
in
his
work
,
so
that
Franz
,
try
to
break
with
he
,
could
find
no
basis
on
which
to
begin
a
disagreement
.
no
friendship
worth
the
name
be
ever
destroy
in
an
hour
without
some
painful
flesh
be
tear
--
so
Franz
let
himself
believe
with
ever
-
increase
conviction
that
Dick
travel
intellectually
and
emotionally
at
such
a
rate
of
speed
that
the
vibration
jar
he
--
this
be
a
contrast
that
have
previously
be
consider
a
virtue
in
their
relation
.
so
,
for
the
shoddiness
of
need
,
be
shoe
make
out
of
last
year
's
hide
.




yet
it
be
May
before
Franz
find
an
opportunity
to
insert
the
first
wedge
.
Dick
come
into
his
office
white
and
tired
one
noon
and
sit
down
,
say
:




"

Dick

nearest

.
during
three
night
he
have
remain
with
the
scabbe
anonymous
woman

artist

have
come
to
love
,
formally
to
portion
out
the
adrenaline
,
but
really
to
throw
as
much
wan
light
as
he
could
into
the
darkness
ahead
.




half
appreciate
his
feeling
,
Franz
travel
quickly
over
an
opinion

the
Villa

have
be
rent

cathedral

they
be
always
happy

Dick
write
a
little
with
no
particular
method
;
it
be
one
of
those
part
of
life
that
be
an
awaiting
;
not
upon

's
health
,
which
seem
to
thrive
on
travel
,
nor
upon
work
,
but
simply
an
awaiting
.
the
factor
that
give
purposefulness
to
the
period
be
the
child
.




Dick
's
interest
in
they
increase
with
their
age
,
now
eleven
and
nine
.
he
manage
to
reach
they
over
the
head
of
employee
on
the
principle
that
both
the
forcing
of
child
and
the
fear
of
force
they
be
inadequate
substitute
for
the
long
,
careful
watchfulness
,
the
checking
and
balancing
and
reckoning
of
account
,
to
the
end
that
there
should
be
no
slip
below
a
certain
level
of
duty
.
he
come
to
know
they
much
well
than
Nicole
do
,
and
in
expansive
mood
over
the
wine
of
several
country
he
talk
and
play
with
they
at
length
.
they
have
that
wistful
charm
,
almost
sadness
,
peculiar
to
child
who
have
learn
early
not
to
cry
or
laugh
with
abandon
;
they
be
apparently
move
to
no
extreme
of
emotion
,
but
content
with
a
simple
regimentation
and
the
simple
pleasure
allow
they
.
they
live
on
the
even
tenor
find
advisable
in
the
experience
of
old
family
of
the
western
world
,
bring
up
rather
than
bring
out
.
Dick
think
,
for
example
,
that
nothing
be
more
conducive
to
the
development
of
observation
than
compulsory
silence
.




Lanier
be
an
unpredictable
boy
with
an
inhuman
curiosity
.
"
well
,
how
many
Pomeranians
would
it
take
to
lick
a
lion
,
father
?
"
be
typical
of
the
question
with
which
he
harass
Dick
.
Topsy
be
easy
.
she
be
nine
and
very
fair
and
exquisitely
make
like
Nicole
,
and
in
the
past
Dick
have
worry
about
that
.
lately
she
have
become
as
robust
as
any
american
child
.
he
be
satisfied
with
they
both
,
but
convey
the
fact
to
they
only
in
a
tacit
way
.
they
be
not
let
off
breach
of
good
conduct--"Either
one
learn
politeness
at
home
,
"
Dick
say
,
"

the
world
teach
it
to
you
with
a
whip
and
you
may
get
hurt
in
the
process
.
what
do
I
care
whether
Topsy
'
adore
'
I
or
not
?
I
be
not
bring
she
up
to
be
my
wife
.
"




another
element
that
distinguish
this
summer
and
autumn
for
the
Divers
be
a
plenitude
of
money
.
due
to
the
sale
of
their
interest
in
the
clinic
,
and
to
development
in
America
,
there
be
now
so
much
that
the
mere
spending
of
it
,
the
care
of
good
,
be
an
absorption
in
itself
.
the
style
in
which
they
travel
seem
fabulous
.




regard
they
,
for
example
,
as
the
train
slow
up
at
Boyen
where
they
be
to
spend
a
fortnight
visiting
.

not

poverty

spirit
that
make
a
woman

herself
with
life

be

superabundance

with
Dick
as
he
have
appear
last
night
,
she
must
be
something
in
addition
,
not
just
an
image
on
his
mind
,
condemn
to
endless
parade
around
the
circumference
of
a
medal
.




Nicole
have
choose
this
part
of
the
wall
on
which
to
sit
,
because

cliff

to
a
slanting
meadow
with
a
cultivate
vegetable
garden
.
through
a
cluster
of
bough
she
see
two
man
carry
rake
and
spade
and
talk
in
a
counterpoint
of
Niçoise
and
Provençal
.
attract
by
their
word
and
gesture

catch
the
sense

down
here--
"

that
night
I
never
even
feel
a
woman
's
breast
against
my
chest
since
I
marry
--
twelve
year

Nicole
watch
they
through
the
bough
;
it
seem
all
right
what
they
be

--
one
thing
be
good
for
one
person
,
another
for
another

be
a
man

have
overhear
;

back
to
the
house

Dick
and
Tommy

on
the
terrace
.
she
walk
through

into
the
house

Dick
say
lightly
.
how
could
he
talk
so
trivially
with
the
blood
still
drain
down
from
his
cheek
so
that
the
auburn
lather
of
beard
show
red
as
his
eye

she
turn
to
Tommy

:




"

eye
resolutely
away
from
Dick
.
presently

excuse
himself
and
go
inside

Tommy
begin
but
interrupt
himself
to
clear
the
harshness
from
his
throat

"

"
when
she
return
with
the
jar
neither
of
the

move
,
though
she
gather
they
have
have
some
sort
of
excited
conversation
about
nothing

the
chauffeur
be
at
the
door
,
with
a
bag

Tommy

Tommy
come
back
within
hearing
and
the
three
of
they
stand
in
the
sunshine
,
Tommy
squarely
before
the
car
so
that
it
seem
by
lean
forward
he
would
tip
it
upon
his
back
.




Nicole
step
down
to
the
path
.




"
now

it
,
"
she
advise
he
.
"
it

extremely
rare
.
"




she
hear
Dick
grow
silent
at
her
side
;
she
take
a
step
off
from
he
and
wave
as
the
car
drive
off
with
Tommy
and
the
special
camphor
rub
.
then
she
turn
to
take
her
own
medicine
.




"
there
be
no
necessity
for
that
gesture
,
"
Dick
say
.
"
there
be
four
of
we
here
--
and
for
year
whenever
there
be
a
cough--
"




they
look
at
each
other
.




"
we
can
always
get
another
jar--
"
then
she
lose
she
nerve
and
presently
follow
he
upstairs
where
he
lie
down
on
his
own
bed
and
say
nothing
.




"
do
you
want
lunch
to
be
bring
up
to
you
?
"
she
ask
.




he
nod
and
continue
to
lie
quiescent
,
stare
at
the
ceiling
.
doubtfully
she
go
to
give
the
order
.
upstairs
again
she
look
into
his
room
--
the
blue
eye
,
like
searchlight
,
play
on
a
dark
sky
.
she
stand
a
minute
in
the
doorway
,
aware
of
the
sin
she
have
commit
against
he
,
half
afraid
to
come
in
.
.
.
.
she
put
out
her
hand
as
if
to
rub
his
head
,
but
he
turn
away
like
a
suspicious
animal
.
Nicole
could
stand
the
situation
no
long
;
in
a
kitchen
-
maid
's
panic
she
run
downstairs
,
afraid
of
what
the
stricken
man
above
would
feed
on
while
she
must
still
continue
her
dry
suckling
at
his
lean
chest
.




 



 



in
a
week
Nicole
forget
her
flash
about
Tommy
--
she
have
not
much
memory
for
people
and
forget
they
easily
.
but
in
the
first
hot
blast
of
June
she
hear
he
be
in
Nice
.
he
write
a
little
note
to
they
both
--
and
she
open
it
under
the
parasol
,
together
with
other
mail
they
have
bring
from
the
house
.
after
read
it
she
toss
it
over
to
Dick
,
and
in
exchange
he
throw
a
telegram
into
the
lap
of
her
beach
pajama
:




 



dear
will
be
at
gauss
to
-
morrow
unfortunately
without
mother
be
count
on
see
you
.




 



"
I
'll
be
glad
to
see
she
,
"
say
Nicole
,
grimly
.




 



 



VII


 



but
she
go
to
the
beach
with
Dick
next
morning
with
a
renewal
of
her
apprehension
that
Dick
be
contrive
at
some
desperate
solution
.
since
the
evening
on
Golding
's
yacht
she
have
sense
what
be
go
on
.
so
delicately
balanced
be
she
between
an
old
foothold
that
have
always
guarantee
her
security
,
and
the
imminence
of
a
leap
from
which
she
must
alight
change
in
the
very
chemistry
of
blood
and
muscle
,
that
she
do
not
dare
bring
the
matter
into
the
true
forefront
of
consciousness
.
the
figure
of
Dick
and
herself
,
mutating
,
undefined
,
appear
as
spook
catch
up
into
a
fantastic
dance
.
for
month
every
word
have
seem
to
have
an
overtone
of
some
other
meaning
,
soon
to
be
resolve
under
circumstance
that
Dick
would
determine
.
though
this
state
of
mind
be
perhaps
more
hopeful,--the
long
year
of
sheer
be
have
have
an
enliven
effect
on
the
part
of
her
nature
that
early
illness
have
kill
,
that
Dick
have
not
reach
--
through
no
fault
of
his
but
simply
because
no
one
nature
can
extend
entirely
inside
another
--
it
be
still
disquiet
.
the
most
unhappy
aspect
of
their
relation
be
Dick
's
grow
indifference
,
at
present
personify
by
too
much
drink
;
Nicole
do
not
know
whether
she
be
to
be
crush
or
spare
--
Dick
's
voice
,
throb
with
insincerity
,
confuse
the
issue
;
she
could
n't
guess
how
he
be
go
to
behave
next
upon
the
tortuously
slow
unrolling
of
the
carpet
,
nor
what
would
happen
at
the
end
,
at
the
moment
of
the
leap
.




for
what
might
occur
thereafter
she
have
no
anxiety
--
she
suspect
that
that
would
be
the
lifting
of
a
burden
,
an
unblinding
of
eye
.
Nicole
have
be
design
for
change
,
for
flight
,
with
money
as
fin
and
wing
.
the
new
state
of
thing
would
be
no
more
than
if
a
racing
chassis
,
conceal
for
year
under
the
body
of
a
family
limousine
,
should
be
strip
to
its
original
self
.
Nicole
could
feel
the
fresh
breeze
already
--
the
wrench
it
be
she
fear
,
and
the
dark
manner
of
its
coming
.




the
Divers
go
out
on
the
beach
with
her
white
suit
and
his
white
trunk
very
white
against
the
color
of
their
body
.
Nicole
see
Dick
peer
about
for
the
child
among
the
confused
shape
and
shadow
of
many
umbrella
,
and
as
his
mind
temporarily
leave
she
,
cease
to
grip
she
,
she
look
at
he
with
detachment
,
and
decide
that
he
be
seek
his
child
,
not
protectively
but
for
protection
.
probably
it
be
the
beach
he
fear
,
like
a
depose
ruler
secretly
visit
an
old
court
.
she
have
come
to
hate
his
world
with
its
delicate
joke
and
politeness
,
forget
that
for
many
year
it
be
the
only
world
open
to
she
.
let
he
look
at
it
--
his
beach
,
pervert
now
to
the
taste
of
the
tasteless
;
he
could
search
it
for
a
day
and
find
no
stone
of
the
Chinese
Wall
he
have
once
erect
around
it
,
no
footprint
of
an
old
friend
.




for
a
moment
Nicole
be
sorry
it
be
so
;
remember
the
glass
he
have
rake
out
of
the
old
trash
heap
,
remember
the
sailor
trunk
and
sweater
they
have
buy
in
a
Nice
back
street
--
garment
that
afterward
run
through
a
vogue
in
silk
among
the
Paris
couturier
,
remember
the
simple
little
french
girl
climb
on
the
breakwater
cry
"
Dites
donc
!
dite
donc
!
"
like
bird
,
and
the
ritual
of
the
morning
time
,
the
quiet
restful
extraversion
toward
sea
and
sun
--
many
invention
of
his
,
bury
deep
than
the
sand
under
the
span
of
so
few
year
.
.
.
.




now
the
swimming
place
be
a
"
club
,
"
though
,
like
the
international
society
it
represent
,
it
would
be
hard
to
say
who
be
not
admit
.




Nicole
harden
again
as
Dick
kneel
on
the
straw
mat
and
look
about
for
Rosemary
.
her
eye
follow
his
,
search
among
the
new
paraphernalia
,
the
trapeze
over
the
water
,
the
swinge
ring
,
the
portable
bathhouse
,
the
float
tower
,
the
searchlight
from
last
night
's
fête
,
the
modernistic
buffet
,
white
with
a
hackneyed
motif
of
endless
handlebar
.




the
water
be
almost
the
last
place
he
look
for
Rosemary
,
because
few
people
swam
any
more
in
that
blue
paradise
,
child
and
one
exhibitionistic
valet
who
punctuate
the
morning
with
spectacular
dive
from
a
fifty
-
foot
rock
--
most
of
Gausse
's
guest
strip
the
conceal
pajama
from
their
flabbiness
only
for
a
short
hangover
dip
at
one
o'clock
.




"
there
she
be
,
"
Nicole
remark
.




she
watch
Dick
's
eye
follow
Rosemary
's
track
from
raft
to
raft
;
but
the
sigh
that
rock
out
of
her
bosom
be
something
leave
over
from
five
year
ago
.




"
let
's
swim
out
and
speak
to
Rosemary
,
"
he
suggest
.




"
you
go
.
"




"
we
'll
both
go
.
"
she
struggle
a
moment
against
his
pronouncement
,
but
eventually
they
swam
out
together
,
trace
Rosemary
by
the
school
of
little
fish
who
follow
she
,
take
their
dazzle
from
she
,
the
shine
spoon
of
a
trout
hook
.




Nicole
stay
in
the
water
while
Dick
hoist
himself
up
beside

supper
with
Dick

much
beer

be
cheerful
with
the

the
dusky
room

afterward
he
play
some
Schubert
song

some
new
jazz
from
America
that
Nicole
hum
in
her
harsh

contralto
over

two
casino

far
apart

down
on

lonely

next
morning
,
back
from

Nicole
find
a
note
say
that

take
the
small
car

go
up
into
Provence
for
a
few
day
by
himself

from
Monte

that

crunch

she
look
microscopically
at
the
line
of
her
flank
,
wonder
how
soon
the
fine
,
slim
edifice

begin

sink
squat

she
be
not

.
the
only
physical
disparity
between
Nicole
at
present
and
the
Nicole
of
five
year
before
be
simply
that
she
be
no

the
contrary

exigent
womb
of
the
twenty
do
not
pull
the
outside
world
centripetally
around
itself

the
former

age

to

not

to
anticipate
the
subsequent
year
when
her
insight
will
often
be
blur
by
panic
,
by
the
fear
of
stop

the
fear
of
go
on
.

on
the

of

with
Dick

from
a

blame
Dick
for
the

it

moreover
,
in
spite
of
her
intention
of
no
long
lie
to
herself
,
she
prefer
to

detail
that

similar
moment
when

fresh
and
intact

slight
that

that
it

to
have
be
tinge
with
sentimental

from
the

the

how
she
have
feel
when
she
and
Dick
have
possess
each
other
in
secret
place
around
the
corner
of
the
world
,
during
the
month
before
they
be
married

just
so

night

entirely

completely

for
this
moment
of
betrayal
,
which
so
cavalierly
belittle
a
decade
of
her
life

turn
her
walk
toward
Dick

sanctuary

he
behind
his
cottage

sit
in
a
steamer

by
the
cliff
wall

for
a
moment

in
the
small
motion
of
his
face
,

brow
raise

lower
,
the
eye
narrow
or
widen
,

play
of
his
hand

from
phase
to
phase
of
his
own
story
spin
out
inside
he
,
his
own
,
not
her
.
once

clench
his
fist
and
lean
forward
,
once
it
bring
into
his
face
an
expression
of
torment
and

almost
the

for
those
who

once

mentally
afflict
to
be
sorry
for
those
who

for
Abe

and
his
ignoble
destiny

Dick
open
an
office
in
Buffalo
,
but
evidently
without
success
.
Nicole
do
not
find
what
the
trouble
be
,
but
she
hear
a
few
month
later
that
he
be
in
a
little
town
name
Batavia
,
N.Y.
,
practise
general
medicine
,
and
later
that
he
be
in
Lockport
,
do
the
same
thing
.
by
accident
she
hear
more
about
his
life
there
than
anywhere
:
that
he
bicycle
a
lot
,
be
much
admire
by
the
lady
,
and
always
have
a
big
stack
of
paper
on
his
desk
that
be
know
to
be
an
important
treatise
on
some
medical
subject
,
almost
in
process
of
completion
.
he
be
consider
to
have
fine
manner
and
once
make
a
good
speech
at
a
public
health
meeting
on
the
subject
of
drug
;
but
he
become
entangle
with
a
girl
who
work
in
a
grocery
store
,
and
he
be
also
involve
in
a
lawsuit
about
some
medical
question
;
so
he
leave
Lockport
.




after
that
he
do
n't
ask
for
the
child
to
be
send
to
America
and
do
n't
answer
when
Nicole
write
ask
he
if
he
need
money
.
in
the
last
letter
she
have
from
he
he
tell
she
that
he
be
practise
in
Geneva
,
New
York
,
and
she
get
the
impression
that
he
have
settle
down
with
some
one
to
keep
house
for
he
.
she
look
up
Geneva
in
an
atlas
and
find
it
be
in
the
heart
of
the
Finger
Lakes
Section
and
consider
a
pleasant
place
.
perhaps
,
so
she
like
to
think
,
his
career
be
bide
its
time
,
again
like
Grant
's
in
Galena
;
his
late
note
be
post
-
mark
from
Hornell
,
New
York
,
which
be
some
distance
from
Geneva
and
a
very
small
town
;
in
any
case
he
be
almost
certainly
in
that
section
of
the
country
,
in
one
town
or
another
.
