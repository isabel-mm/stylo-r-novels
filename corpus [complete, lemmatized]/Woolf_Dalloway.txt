Mrs.
Dalloway
say
she
would
buy
the
flower
herself
.




for
Lucy
have
her
work
cut
out
for
she
.
the
door
would
be
take
off
their
hinge
;
Rumpelmayer
's
man
be
come
.
and
then
,
think
Clarissa
Dalloway
,
what
a
morning
--
fresh
as
if
issue
to
child
on
a
beach
.




what
a
lark
!
what
a
plunge
!
for
so
it
have
always
seem
to
she
,
when
,
with
a
little
squeak
of
the
hinge
,
which
she
could
hear
now
,
she
have
burst
open
the
french
window
and
plunge
at
Bourton
into
the
open
air
.
how
fresh
,
how
calm
,
still
than
this
of
course
,
the
air
be
in
the
early
morning
;
like
the
flap
of
a
wave
;
the
kiss
of
a
wave
;
chill
and
sharp
and
yet
(
for
a
girl
of
eighteen
as
she
then
be
)
solemn
,
feel
as
she
do
,
stand
there
at
the
open
window
,
that
something
awful
be
about
to
happen
;
look
at
the
flower
,
at
the
tree
with
the
smoke
wind
off
they
and
the
rook
rise
,
fall
;
standing
and
look
until
Peter
Walsh
say
,
"
musing
among
the
vegetables?"--was
that
it?--"i
prefer
man
to
cauliflowers"--wa
that
it
?
he
must
have
say
it
at
breakfast
one
morning
when
she
have
go
out
on
to
the
terrace
--
Peter
Walsh
.
he
would
be
back
from
India
one
of
these
day
,
June
or
July
,
she
forget
which
,
for
his
letter
be
awfully
dull
;
it
be
his
saying
one
remember
;
his
eye
,
his
pocket
-
knife
,
his
smile
,
his
grumpiness
and
,
when
million
of
thing
have
utterly
vanish
--
how
strange
it
was!--a
few
saying
like
this
about
cabbage
.




she
stiffen
a
little
on
the
kerb
,
wait
for
Durtnall
's
van
to
pass
.
a
charming
woman
,
Scrope
Purvis
think
she
(
know
she
as
one
do
know
people
who
live
next
door
to
one
in
Westminster
)
;
a
touch
of
the
bird
about
she
,
of
the
jay
,
blue
-
green
,
light
,
vivacious
,
though
she
be
over
fifty
,
and
grow
very
white
since
her
illness
.
there
she
perch
,
never
see
he
,
wait
to
cross
,
very
upright
.




for
having
live
in
Westminster
--
how
many
year
now
?
over
twenty,--one
feel
even
in
the
midst
of
the
traffic
,
or
wake
at
night
,
Clarissa
be
positive
,
a
particular
hush
,
or
solemnity
;
an
indescribable
pause
;
a
suspense
(
but
that
might
be
her
heart
,
affect
,
they
say
,
by
influenza
)
before
Big
Ben
strike
.
there
!
out
it
boom
.
first
a
warning
,
musical
;
then
the
hour
,
irrevocable
.
the
leaden
circle
dissolve
in
the
air
.
such
fool
we
be
,
she
think
,
cross
Victoria
Street
.
for
Heaven
only
know
why
one
love
it
so
,
how
one
see
it
so
,
make
it
up
,
build
it
round
one
,
tumble
it
,
create
it
every
moment
afresh
;
but
the
veri
frump
,
the
most
deject
of
misery
sit
on
doorstep
(
drink
their
downfall
)
do
the
same
;
ca
n't
be
deal
with
,
she
feel
positive
,
by
act
of
Parliament
for
that
very
reason
:
they
love
life
.
in
people
's
eye
,
in
the
swing
,
tramp
,
and
trudge
;
in
the
bellow
and
the
uproar
;
the
carriage
,
motor
car
,
omnibus
,
van
,
sandwich
man
shuffle
and
swinge
;
brass
band
;
barrel
organ
;
in
the
triumph
and
the
jingle
and
the
strange
high
singing
of
some
aeroplane
overhead
be
what
she
love
;
life
;
London
;
this
moment
of
June
.




for
it
be
the
middle
of
June
.
the
War
be
over
,
except
for
some
one
like
Mrs.
Foxcroft
at
the
Embassy
last
night
eat
her
heart
out
because
that
nice
boy
be
kill
and
now
the
old
Manor
House
must
go
to
a
cousin
;
or
Lady
Bexborough
who
open
a
bazaar
,
they
say
,
with
the
telegram
in
her
hand
,
John
,
her
favourite
,
kill
;
but
it
be
over
;
thank
Heaven
--
over
.
it
be
June
.
the
King
and
Queen
be
at
the
Palace
.
and
everywhere
,
though
it
be
still
so
early
,
there
be
a
beating
,
a
stirring
of
gallop
pony
,
tap
of
cricket
bat
;
Lords
,
Ascot
,
Ranelagh
and
all
the
rest
of
it
;
wrap
in
the
soft
mesh
of
the
grey
-
blue
morning
air
,
which
,
as
the
day
wear
on
,
would
unwind
they
,
and
set
down
on
their
lawn
and
pitch
the
bounce
pony
,
whose
forefeet
just
strike
the
ground
and
up
they
spring
,
the
whirl
young
man
,
and
laugh
girl
in
their
transparent
muslin
who
,
even
now
,
after
dance
all
night
,
be
take
their
absurd
woolly
dog
for
a
run
;
and
even
now
,
at
this
hour
,
discreet
old
dowager
be
shoot
out
in
their
motor
car
on
errand
of
mystery
;
and
the
shopkeeper
be
fidget
in
their
window
with
their
paste
and
diamond
,
their
lovely
old
sea
-
green
brooch
in
eighteenth
-
century
setting
to
tempt
Americans
(
but
one
must
economise
,
not
buy
thing
rashly
for
Elizabeth
)
,
and
she
,
too
,
love
it
as
she
do
with
an
absurd
and
faithful
passion
,
be
part
of
it
,
since
her
people
be
courtier
once
in
the
time
of
the
Georges
,
she
,
too
,
be
go
that
very
night
to
kindle
and
illuminate
;
to
give
her
party
.
but
how
strange
,
on
enter
the
Park
,
the
silence
;
the
mist
;
the
hum
;
the
slow
-
swim
happy
duck
;
the
pouched
bird
waddle
;
and
who
should
be
come
along
with
his
back
against
the
Government
building
,
most
appropriately
,

a
despatch
box

with
the
Royal
Arms
,
who
but
Hugh
Whitbread
;

old
friend
Hugh

the
admirable
Hugh

"
good
-
morning
to
you
,
Clarissa
!
"
say
Hugh
,
rather
extravagantly
,
for
they
have
know
each
other
as
child
.
"
where
be
you
off
to
?
"




"
I
love
walk
in
London
,
"
say
Mrs.
Dalloway
.
"
really
it
be
well
than
walk
in
the
country
.
"




they
have
just
come
up
--
unfortunately
--
to
see
doctor
.
other
people
come
to
see
picture
;
go
to
the
opera
;
take
their
daughter
out
;
the
Whitbreads
come
"
to
see
doctor
.
"
time
without
number
Clarissa
have
visit
Evelyn
Whitbread
in
a
nursing
home
.
be
Evelyn
ill
again
?
Evelyn
be
a
good
deal
out
of
sort
,
say
Hugh
,
intimate
by
a
kind
of
pout
or
swell
of
his
very
well
-
cover
,
manly
,
extremely
handsome
,
perfectly
upholstered
body
(
he
be
almost
too
well
dressed
always
,
but
presumably
have
to
be
,
with
his
little
job
at
Court
)
that
his
wife
have
some
internal
ailment
,
nothing
serious
,
which
,
as
an
old
friend
,
Clarissa
Dalloway
would
quite
understand
without
require
he
to
specify
.
ah
yes
,
she
do
of
course
;
what
a
nuisance
;
and
feel
very
sisterly
and
oddly
conscious
at
the
same
time
of
her
hat
.
not
the
right
hat
for
the
early
morning
,
be
that
it
?
for
Hugh
always
make
she
feel
,
as
he
bustle
on
,
raise
his
hat
rather
extravagantly
and
assure
she
that
she
might
be
a
girl
of
eighteen
,
and
of
course
he
be
come
to
her
party
to
-
night
,
Evelyn
absolutely
insist
,
only
a
little
late
he
might
be
after
the
party
at
the
Palace
to
which
he
have
to
take
one
of
Jim
's
boys,--she
always
feel
a
little
skimpy
beside
Hugh
;
schoolgirlish
;
but
attach
to
he
,
partly
from
having
know
he
always
,
but
she
do
think
he
a
good
sort
in
his
own
way
,
though
Richard
be
nearly
drive
mad
by
he
,
and
as
for
Peter
Walsh
,
he
have
never
to
this
day
forgive
she
for
like
he
.




she
could
remember
scene
after
scene
at
Bourton
--
Peter
furious
;
Hugh
not
,
of
course
,
his
match
in
any
way
,
but
still
not
a
positive
imbecile
as
Peter
make
out
;
not
a
mere
barber
's
block
.
when
his
old
mother
want
he
to
give
up
shooting
or
to
take
she
to
Bath
he
do
it
,
without
a
word
;
he
be
really
unselfish
,
and
as
for
say
,
as
Peter
do
,
that
he
have
no
heart
,
no
brain
,
nothing
but
the
manner
and
breeding
of
an
english
gentleman
,
that
be
only
her
dear
Peter
at
his
bad
;
and
he
could
be
intolerable
;
he
could
be
impossible
;
but
adorable
to
walk
with
on
a
morning
like
this
.




(
June
have
draw
out
every
leaf
on
the
tree
.
the
mother
of
Pimlico
give
suck
to
their
young
.
message
be
pass
from
the
Fleet
to
the
Admiralty
.
Arlington
Street
and
Piccadilly
seem
to
chafe
the
very
air
in
the
Park
and
lift
its
leave
hotly
,
brilliantly
,
on
wave
of
that
divine
vitality
which
Clarissa
love
.
to
dance
,
to
ride
,
she
have
adore
all
that
.
)




for
they
might
be
part
for
hundred
of
year
,
she
and
Peter
;
she
never
write
a
letter
and
his
be
dry
stick
;
but
suddenly
it
would
come
over
she
,
if
he
be
with
I
now
what
would
he
say?--some
day
,
some
sight
bring
he
back
to
she
calmly
,
without
the
old
bitterness
;
which
perhaps
be
the
reward
of
having
care
for
people
;
they
come
back
in
the
middle
of
St.
James
's
Park
on
a
fine
morning
--
indeed
they
do
.
but
Peter
--
however
beautiful
the
day
might
be
,
and
the
tree
and
the
grass
,
and
the
little
girl
in
pink
--
Peter
never
see
a
thing
of
all
that
.
he
would
put
on
his
spectacle
,
if
she
tell
he
to
;
he
would
look
.
it
be
the
state
of
the
world
that
interest
he
;
Wagner
,
Pope
's
poetry
,
people
's
character
eternally
,
and
the
defect
of
her
own
soul
.
how
he
scold
she
!
how
they
argue
!
she
would
marry
a
Prime
Minister
and
stand
at
the
top
of
a
staircase
;
the
perfect
hostess
he
call
she
(
she
have
cry
over
it
in
her
bedroom
)
,
she
have
the
making
of
the
perfect
hostess
,
he
say
.




so
she
would
still
find
herself
argue
in
St.
James
's
Park
,
still
make
out
that
she
have
be
right
--
and
she
have
too
--
not
to
marry
he
.
for
in
marriage
a
little
licence
,
a
little
independence
there
must
be
between
people
live
together
day
in
day
out
in
the
same
house
;
which
Richard
give
she
,
and
she
he
.
(
where
be
he
this
morning
for
instance
?
some
committee
,
she
never
ask
what
.
)
but
with
Peter
everything
have
to
be
share
;
everything
go
into
.
and
it
be
intolerable
,
and
when
it
come
to
that
scene
in
the
little
garden
by
the
fountain
,
she
have
to
break
with
he
or
they
would
have
be
destroy
,
both
of
they
ruin
,
she
be
convince
;
though
she
have
bear
about
with
she
for
year
like
an
arrow
stick
in
her
heart
the
grief
,
the
anguish
;
and
then
the
horror
of
the
moment
when
some
one
tell
she
at
a
concert
that
he
have
marry
a
woman
meet
on
the
boat
go
to
India
!
never
should
she
forget
all
that
!
cold
,
heartless
,
a
prude
,
he
call
she
.
never
could
she
understand
how
he
care
.
but
those
indian
woman
do
presumably
--
silly
,
pretty
,
flimsy
nincompoop
.
and
she
waste
her
pity
.
for
he
be
quite
happy
,
he
assure
she
--
perfectly
happy
,
though
he
have
never
do
a
thing
that
they
talk
of
;
his
whole
life
have
be
a
failure
.
it
make
she
angry
still
.




she
have
reach
the
Park
gate
.
she
stand
for
a
moment
,
look
at
the
omnibus
in
Piccadilly
.




she
would
not
say
of
any
one
in
the
world
now
that
they
be
this
or
be
that
.
she
feel
very
young
;
at
the
same
time
unspeakably
aged
.
she
slice
like
a
knife
through
everything
;
at
the
same
time
be
outside
,
look
on
.
she
have
a
perpetual
sense
,
as
she
watch
the
taxi
cab
,
of
be
out
,
out
,
far
out
to
sea
and
alone
;
she
always
have
the
feeling
that
it
be
very
,
very
dangerous
to
live
even
one
day
.
not
that
she
think
herself
clever
,
or
much
out
of
the
ordinary
.
how
she
have
get
through
life
on
the
few
twig
of
knowledge
Fräulein
Daniels
give
they
she
could
not
think
.
she
know
nothing
;
no
language
,
no
history
;
she
scarcely
read
a
book
now
,
except
memoir
in
bed
;
and
yet
to
she
it
be
absolutely
absorbing
;
all
this
;
the
cab
pass
;
and
she
would
not
say
of
Peter
,
she
would
not
say
of
herself
,
I
be
this
,
I
be
that
.




her
only
gift
be
know
people
almost
by
instinct
,
she
think
,
walk
on
.
if
you
put
she
in
a
room
with
some
one
,
up
go
she
back
like
a
cat
's
;
or
she
purr
.
Devonshire
House
,
Bath
House
,
the
house
with
the
china
cockatoo
,
she
have
see
they
all
light
up
once
;
and
remember
Sylvia
,
Fred
,
Sally
Seton
--
such
host
of
people
;
and
dance
all
night
;
and
the
waggon
plod
past
to
market
;
and
drive
home
across
the
Park
.
she
remember
once
throw
a
shilling
into
the
Serpentine
.
but
every
one
remember
;
what
she
love
be
this
,
here
,
now
,
in
front
of
she
;
the
fat
lady
in
the
cab
.
do
it
matter
then
,
she
ask
herself
,
walk
towards
Bond
Street
,
do
it
matter
that
she
must
inevitably
cease
completely
;
all
this
must
go
on
without
she
;
do
she
resent
it
;
or
do
it
not
become
console
to
believe
that
death
end
absolutely
?
but
that
somehow
in
the
street
of
London
,
on
the
ebb
and
flow
of
thing
,
here
,
there
,
she
survive
,
Peter
survive
,
live
in
each
other
,
she
be
part
,
she
be
positive
,
of
the
tree
at
home
;
of
the
house
there
,
ugly
,
ramble
all
to
bit
and
piece
as
it
be
;
part
of
people
she
have
never
meet
;
be
lay
out
like
a
mist
between
the
people
she
know
well
,
who
lift
she
on
their
branch
as
she
have
see
the
tree
lift
the
mist
,
but
it
spread
ever
so
far
,
her
life
,
herself
.
but
what
be
she
dream
as
she
look
into
Hatchards
'
shop
window
?
what
be
she
try
to
recover
?
what
image
of
white
dawn
in
the
country
,
as
she
read
in
the
book
spread
open
:




 



fear
no
more
the
heat
o
'
the
sun


nor
the
furious
winter
's
rage
.




 



this
late
age
of
the
world
's
experience
have
breed
in
they
all
,
all
man
and
woman
,
a
well
of
tear
.
tear
and
sorrow
;
courage
and
endurance
;
a
perfectly
upright
and
stoical
bearing
.
think
,
for
example
,
of
the
woman
she
admire
most
,
Lady
Bexborough
,
open
the
bazaar
.




there
be
Jorrocks
'
Jaunts
and
Jollities
;
there
be
Soapy
Sponge
and
Mrs.
Asquith
's
Memoirs
and
Big
Game
Shooting
in
Nigeria
,
all
spread
open
.
ever
so
many
book
there
be
;
but
none
that
seem
exactly
right
to
take
to
Evelyn
Whitbread
in
her
nursing
home
.
nothing
that
would
serve
to
amuse
she
and
make
that
indescribably
dry
-
up
little
woman
look
,
as
Clarissa
come
in
,
just
for
a
moment
cordial
;
before
they
settle
down
for
the
usual
interminable
talk
of
woman
's
ailment
.
how
much
she
want
it
--
that
people
should
look
pleased
as
she
come
in
,
Clarissa
think
and
turn
and
walk
back
towards
Bond
Street
,
annoy
,
because
it
be
silly
to
have
other
reason
for
do
thing
.
much
rather
would
she
have
be
one
of
those
people
like
Richard
who
do
thing
for
themselves
,
whereas
,
she
think
,
wait
to
cross
,
half
the
time
she
do
thing
not
simply
,
not
for
themselves
;
but
to
make
people
think
this
or
that
;
perfect
idiocy
she
know
(
and
now
the
policeman
hold
up
his
hand
)
for
no
one
be
ever
for
a
second
take
in
.
oh
if
she
could
have
have
her
life
over
again
!
she
think
,
step
on
to
the
pavement
,
could
have
look
even
differently
!




she
would
have
be
,
in
the
first
place
,
dark
like
Lady
Bexborough
,
with
a
skin
of
crumpled
leather
and
beautiful
eye
.
she
would
have
be
,
like
Lady
Bexborough
,
slow
and
stately
;
rather
large
;
interested
in
politic
like
a
man
;
with
a
country
house
;
very
dignified
,
very
sincere
.
instead
of
which
she
have
a
narrow
pea
-
stick
figure
;
a
ridiculous
little
face
,
beak
like
a
bird
's
.
that
she
hold
herself
well
be
true
;
and
have
nice
hand
and
foot
;
and
dress
well
,
consider
that
she
spend
little
.
but
often
now
this
body
she
wear
(
she
stop
to
look
at
a
dutch
picture
)
,
this
body
,
with
all
its
capacity
,
seem
nothing
--
nothing
at
all
.
she
have
the
oddest
sense
of
be
herself
invisible
;
unseen
;
unknown
;
there
be
no
more
marrying
,
no
more
having
of
child
now
,
but
only
this
astonishing
and
rather
solemn
progress
with
the
rest
of
they
,
up
Bond
Street
,
this
be
Mrs.
Dalloway
;
not
even
clarissa
any
more
;
this
be
Mrs.
Richard
Dalloway
.




Bond
Street
fascinate
she
;
Bond
Street
early
in
the
morning
in
the
season
;
its
flag
fly
;
its
shop
;
no
splash
;
no
glitter
;
one
roll
of
tweed
in
the
shop
where
her
father
have
buy
his
suit
for
fifty
year
;
a
few
pearl
;
salmon
on
an
iceblock
.




"
that
be
all
,
"
she
say
,
look
at
the
fishmonger
's
.
"
that
be
all
,
"
she
repeat
,
pause
for
a
moment
at
the
window
of
a
glove
shop
where
,
before
the
War
,
you
could
buy
almost
perfect
glove
.
and
her
old
Uncle
William
use
to
say
a
lady
be
know
by
her
shoe
and
her
glove
.
he
have
turn
on
his
bed
one
morning
in
the
middle
of
the
War
.
he
have
say
,
"
I
have
have
enough
.
"
glove
and
shoe
;
she
have
a
passion
for
glove
;
but
her
own
daughter
,
her
Elizabeth
,
care
not
a
straw
for
either
of
they
.




not
a
straw
,
she
think
,
go
on
up
Bond
Street
to
a
shop
where
they
keep
flower
for
she
when
she
give
a
party
.
Elizabeth
really
care
for
her
dog
most
of
all
.
the
whole
house
this
morning
smell
of
tar
.
still
,
well
poor
grizzle
than
Miss
Kilman
;
well
distemper
and
tar
and
all
the
rest
of
it
than
sit
mew
in
a
stuffy
bedroom
with
a
prayer
book
!
well
anything
,
she
be
inclined
to
say
.
but
it
might
be
only
a
phase
,
as
Richard
say
,
such
as
all
girl
go
through
.
it
might
be
fall
in
love
.
but
why
with
Miss
Kilman
?
who
have
be
badly
treat
of
course
;
one
must
make
allowance
for
that
,
and
Richard
say
she
be
very
able
,
have
a
really
historical
mind
.
anyhow
they
be
inseparable
,
and
Elizabeth
,
her
own
daughter
,
go
to
Communion
;
and
how
she
dress
,
how
she
treat
people
who
come
to
lunch
she
do
not
care
a
bit
,
it
be
her
experience
that
the
religious
ecstasy
make
people
callous
(
so
do
cause
)
;
dull
their
feeling
,
for
Miss
Kilman
would
do
anything
for
the
Russians
,
starve
herself
for
the
Austrians
,
but
in
private
inflict
positive
torture
,
so
insensitive
be
she
,
dress
in
a
green
mackintosh
coat
.
year
in
year
out
she
wear
that
coat
;
she
perspire
;
she
be
never
in
the
room
five
minute
without
make
you
feel
her
superiority
,
your
inferiority
;
how
poor
she
be
;
how
rich
you
be
;
how
she
live
in
a
slum
without
a
cushion
or
a
bed
or
a
rug
or
whatever
it
might
be
,
all
her
soul
rust
with
that
grievance
stick
in
it
,
her
dismissal
from
school
during
the
War
--
poor
embitter
unfortunate
creature
!
for
it
be
not
her
one
hate
but
the
idea
of
she
,
which
undoubtedly
have
gather
in
to
itself
a
great
deal
that
be
not
Miss
Kilman
;
have
become
one
of
those
spectre
with
which
one
battle
in
the
night
;
one
of
those
spectre
who
stand
astride
we
and
suck
up
half
our
life
-
blood
,
dominator
and
tyrant
;
for
no
doubt
with
another
throw
of
the
dice
,
have
the
black
be
uppermost
and
not
the
white
,
she
would
have
love
Miss
Kilman
!
but
not
in
this
world
.
no
.




it
rasp
she
,
though
,
to
have
stir
about
in
she
this
brutal
monster
!
to
hear
twig
crack
and
feel
hoof
plant
down
in
the
depth
of
that
leaf
-
encumber
forest
,
the
soul
;
never
to
be
content
quite
,
or
quite
secure
,
for
at
any
moment
the
brute
would
be
stir
,
this
hatred
,
which
,
especially
since
her
illness
,
have
power
to
make
her
feel
scrape
,
hurt
in
her
spine
;
give
her
physical
pain
,
and
make
all
pleasure
in
beauty
,
in
friendship
,
in
be
well
,
in
be
love
and
make
her
home
delightful
rock
,
quiver
,
and
bend
as
if
indeed
there
be
a
monster
grub
at
the
root
,
as
if
the
whole
panoply
of
content
be
nothing
but
self
love
!
this
hatred
!




nonsense
,
nonsense
!
she
cry
to
herself
,
push
through
the
swing
door
of
Mulberry

the
florist
.

to
Miss

,
the
exquisite
coolness
.
and
then
,
open
her
eye
,
how

up

away

,
away

away

shot
;
soar
over
Greenwich

all
the
mast
;
over
the
little
island
of
grey
church
,
St.

's
and
the
rest

,
on

side

out

.




away
and
away
the

,
till
it
be
nothing
but
a
bright
spark
;
an
aspiration
;
a
concentration
;
a
symbol
(

it
seem
to
Mr.

his
strip
of

man
's
soul
;

round
the

tree

Einstein
,

what
balm
,
how
great
a
welcome
,
how
many
tomb
with
banner
wave
over
they
,
token
of
victory
not
over
army
,
but
over
,
he
think
,
that
plaguy
spirit
of
truth
seek
which
leave
I
at

more
than
that
,

;
martyr

,
put
this
leather
bag
stuff
with
pamphlet
before
an
altar
,
a
cross
,
the
symbol
of
something
which
have
soar
beyond
seek
and
quest
and
knocking
of
word
together
and
have
become
all
spirit

disembody
,
ghostly

why
not

out

to
the
maid
who

Mrs.

raise
her

to
her
eye
,
and
,

the
swish
of
Lucy

devotion

for
the

the
moment
in

have
not

no
vulgar
jealousy
could
separate
she
from
Richard
.
but
she
fear
time
itself
,
and
read
on
Lady
Bruton
's
face
,
as
if
it
have
be
a
dial
cut
in
impassive
stone
,
the
dwindling
of
life
;
how
year
by
year
her
share
be
slice
;
how
little
the
margin
that
remain
be
capable
any
long
of
stretch
,
of
absorbing
,
as
in
the
youthful
year
,
the
colour
,
salt
,
tone
of
existence
,
so
that
she
fill
the
room
she
enter
,
and
feel
often
as
she
stood
hesitate
one
moment
on
the
threshold
of
her
drawing
-
room
,
an
exquisite
suspense
,
such
as
might
stay
a
diver
before
plunge
while
the
sea
darken
and
brighten
beneath
he
,
and
the
wave
which
threaten
to
break
,
but
only
gently
split
their
surface
,
roll
and
conceal
and
encrust
as
they
just
turn
over
the
weed
with
pearl
.




she
put
the
pad
on
the
hall
table
.
she
begin
to
go
slowly
upstairs
,
with
her
hand
on
the
bannister
,
as
if
she
have
leave
a
party
,
where
now
this
friend
now
that
have
flash
back
her
face
,
her
voice
;
have
shut
the
door
and
go
out
and
stand
alone
,
a
single
figure
against
the
appalling
night
,
or
rather
,
to
be
accurate
,
against
the
stare
of
this
matter
-
of
-
fact
June
morning
;
soft
with
the
glow
of
rose
petal
for
some
,
she
know
,
and
feel
it
,
as
she
pause
by
the
open
staircase
window
which
let
in
blind
flapping
,
dog
bark
,
let
in
,
she
think
,
feel
herself
suddenly
shrivel
,
aged
,
breastless
,
the
grinding
,
blow
,
flowering
of
the
day
,
out
of
door
,
out
of
the
window
,
out
of
her
body
and
brain
which
now
fail
,
since
Lady
Bruton
,
whose
lunch
party
be
say
to
be
extraordinarily
amusing
,
have
not
ask
she
.




like
a
nun
withdrawing
,
or
a
child
explore
a
tower
,
she
go
upstairs
,
pause
at
the
window
,
come
to
the
bathroom
.
there
be
the
green
linoleum
and
a
tap
dripping
.
there
be
an
emptiness
about
the
heart
of
life
;
an
attic
room
.
woman
must
put
off
their
rich
apparel
.
at
midday
they
must
disrobe
.
she
pierce
the
pincushion
and
lay
her
feather
yellow
hat
on
the
bed
.
the
sheet
be
clean
,
tight
stretch
in
a
broad
white
band
from
side
to
side
.
narrower
and
narrow
would
her
bed
be
.
the
candle
be
half
burn
down
and
she
have
read
deep
in
Baron
Marbot
's
Memoirs
.
she
have
read
late
at
night
of
the
retreat
from
Moscow
.
for
the
House
sit
so
long
that
Richard
insist
,
after
her
illness
,
that
she
must
sleep
undisturbed
.
and
really
she
prefer
to
read
of
the
retreat
from
Moscow
.
he
know
it
.
so
the
room
be
an
attic
;
the
bed
narrow
;
and
lie
there
read
,
for
she
sleep
badly
,
she
could
not
dispel
a
virginity
preserve
through
childbirth
which
clung
to
she
like
a
sheet
.
lovely
in
girlhood
,
suddenly
there
come
a
moment
--
for
example
on
the
river
beneath
the
wood
at
Clieveden
--
when
,
through
some
contraction
of
this
cold
spirit
,
she
have
fail
he
.
and
then
at
Constantinople
,
and
again
and
again
.
she
could
see
what
she
lack
.
it
be
not
beauty
;
it
be
not
mind
.
it
be
something
central
which
permeate
;
something
warm
which
break
up
surface
and
ripple
the
cold
contact
of
man
and
woman
,
or
of
woman
together
.
for
that
she
could
dimly
perceive
.
she
resent
it
,
have
a
scruple
pick
up
Heaven
know
where
,
or
,
as
she
feel
,
send
by
Nature
(
who
be
invariably
wise
)
;
yet
she
could
not
resist
sometimes
yield
to
the
charm
of
a
woman
,
not
a
girl
,
of
a
woman
confess
,
as
to
she
they
often
do
,
some
scrape
,
some
folly
.
and
whether
it
be
pity
,
or
their
beauty
,
or
that
she
be
old
,
or
some
accident
--
like
a
faint
scent
,
or
a
violin
next
door
(
so
strange
be
the
power
of
sound
at
certain
moment
)
,
she
do
undoubtedly
then
feel
what
man
feel
.
only
for
a
moment
;
but
it
be
enough
.
it
be
a
sudden
revelation
,
a
tinge
like
a
blush
which
one
try
to
check
and
then
,
as
it
spread
,
one
yield
to
its
expansion
,
and
rush
to
the
farth
verge
and
there
quiver
and
feel
the
world
come
close
,
swell
with
some
astonishing
significance
,
some
pressure
of
rapture
,
which
split
its
thin
skin
and
gush
and
pour
with
an
extraordinary
alleviation
over
the
crack
and
sore
!
then
,
for
that
moment
,
she
have
see
an
illumination
;
a
match
burn
in
a
crocus
;
an
inner
meaning
almost
express
.
but
the
close
withdraw
;
the
hard
soften
.
it
be
over
--
the
moment
.
against
such
moment
(
with
woman
too
)
there
contrast
(
as
she
lay
her
hat
down
)
the
bed
and
Baron
Marbot
and
the
candle
half
-
burn
.
lie
awake
,
the
floor
creak
;
the
light
house
be
suddenly
darken
,
and
if
she
raise
her
head
she
could
just
hear
the
click
of
the
handle
release
as
gently
as
possible
by
Richard
,
who
slip
upstairs
in
his
sock
and
then
,
as
often
as
not
,
drop
his
hot
-
water
bottle
and
swore
!
how
she
laugh
!




but
this
question
of
love
(
she
think
,
put
her
coat
away
)
,
this
fall
in
love
with
woman
.
take
Sally
Seton
;
her
relation
in
the
old
day
with
Sally
Seton
.
have
not
that
,
after
all
,
be
love
?




she
sit
on
the
floor
--
that
be
her
first
impression
of
Sally
--
she
sit
on
the
floor
with
her
arm
round
her
knee
,
smoke
a
cigarette
.
where
could
it
have
be
?
the
manning
?
the
Kinloch
-
Jones
's
?
at
some
party
(
where
,
she
could
not
be
certain
)
,
for
she
have
a
distinct
recollection
of
say
to
the
man
she
be
with
,
"
who
be
that
?
"
and
he
have
tell
she
,
and
say
that
Sally
's
parent
do
not
get
on
(
how
that
shock
she
--
that
one
's
parent
should
quarrel
!
)
.
but
all
that
evening
she
could
not
take
her
eye
off
Sally
.
it
be
an
extraordinary
beauty
of
the
kind
she
most
admired
,
dark
,
large
-
eyed
,
with
that
quality
which
,
since
she
have
n't
get
it
herself
,
she
always
envy
--
a
sort
of
abandonment
,
as
if
she
could
say
anything
,
do
anything
;
a
quality
much
commoner
in
foreigner
than
in
Englishwomen
.
Sally
always
say
she
have
french
blood
in
her
vein
,
an
ancestor
have
be
with
Marie
Antoinette
,
have
his
head
cut
off
,
leave
a
ruby
ring
.
perhaps
that
summer
she
come
to
stay
at
Bourton
,
walk
in
quite
unexpectedly
without
a
penny
in
her
pocket
,
one
night
after
dinner
,
and
upset
poor
Aunt
Helena
to
such
an
extent
that
she
never
forgave
she
.
there
have
be
some
quarrel
at
home
.
she
literally
have
n't
a
penny
that
night
when
she
come
to
they
--
have
pawn
a
brooch
to
come
down
.
she
have
rush
off
in
a
passion
.
they
sit
up
till
all
hour
of
the
night
talk
.
Sally
it
be
who
make
she
feel
,
for
the
first
time
,
how
sheltered
the
life
at
Bourton
be
.
she
know
nothing
about
sex
--
nothing
about
social
problem
.
she
have
once
see
an
old
man
who
have
drop
dead
in
a
field
--
she
have
see
cow
just
after
their
calf
be
bear
.
but
Aunt
Helena
never
like
discussion
of
anything
(
when
Sally
give
she
William
Morris
,
it
have
to
be
wrap
in
brown
paper
)
.
there
they
sit
,
hour
after
hour
,
talk
in
her
bedroom
at
the
top
of
the
house
,
talk
about
life
,
how
they
be
to
reform
the
world
.
they
mean
to
find
a
society
to
abolish
private
property
,
and
actually
have
a
letter
write
,
though
not
send
out
.
the
idea
be
Sally
's
,
of
course
--
but
very
soon
she
be
just
as
excited
--
read
Plato
in
bed
before
breakfast
;
read
Morris
;
read
Shelley
by
the
hour
.




Sally
's
power
be
amazing
,
her
gift
,
her
personality
.
there
be
her
way
with
flower
,
for
instance
.
at
Bourton
they
always
have
stiff
little
vase
all
the
way
down
the
table
.
Sally
go
out
,
pick
hollyhock
,
dahlia
--
all
sort
of
flower
that
have
never
be
see
together
--
cut
their
head
off
,
and
make
they
swim
on
the
top
of
water
in
bowl
.
the
effect
be
extraordinary
--
come
in
to
dinner
in
the
sunset
.
(
of
course
Aunt
Helena
think
it
wicke
to
treat
flower
like
that
.
)
then
she
forget
her
sponge
,
and
run
along
the
passage
naked
.
that
grim
old
housemaid
,
Ellen
Atkins
,
go
about
grumbling--"Suppose
any
of
the
gentleman
have
see
?
"
indeed
she
do
shock
people
.
she
be
untidy
,
Papa
say
.




the
strange
thing
,
on
look
back
,
be
the
purity
,
the
integrity
,
of
her
feeling
for
Sally
.
it
be
not
like
one
's
feeling
for
a
man
.
it
be
completely
disintereste
,
and
besides
,
it
have
a
quality
which
could
only
exist
between
woman
,
between
woman
just
grow
up
.
it
be
protective
,
on
her
side
;
spring
from
a
sense
of
be
in
league
together
,
a
presentiment
of
something
that
be
bind
to
part
they
(
they
speak
of
marriage
always
as
a
catastrophe
)
,
which
lead
to
this
chivalry
,
this
protective
feeling
which
be
much
more
on
her
side
than
Sally
's
.
for
in
those
day
she
be
completely
reckless
;
do
the
most
idiotic
thing
out
of
bravado
;
bicycle
round
the
parapet
on
the
terrace
;
smoked
cigar
.
absurd
,
she
be
--
very
absurd
.
but
the
charm
be
overpower
,
to
she
at
least
,
so
that
she
could
remember
stand
in
her
bedroom
at
the
top
of
the
house
hold
the
hot
-
water
can
in
her
hand
and
say
aloud
,
"
she
be
beneath
this
roof
.
.
.
.
she
be
beneath
this
roof
!
"




no
,
the
word
mean
absolutely
nothing
to
she
now
.
she
could
not
even
get
an
echo
of
her
old
emotion
.
but
she
could
remember
go
cold
with
excitement
,
and
do
her
hair
in
a
kind
of
ecstasy
(
now
the
old
feeling
begin
to
come
back
to
she
,
as
she
take
out
her
hairpin
,
lay
they
on
the
dressing
-
table
,
begin
to
do
her
hair
)
,
with
the
rook
flaunt
up
and
down
in
the
pink
evening
light
,
and
dress
,
and
go
downstairs
,
and
feel
as
she
cross
the
hall
"
if
it
be
now
to
die
'
twere
now
to
be
most
happy
.
"
that
be
her
feeling
--
Othello
's
feeling
,
and
she
feel
it
,
she
be
convince
,
as
strongly
as
Shakespeare
mean
Othello
to
feel
it
,
all
because
she
be
come
down
to
dinner
in
a
white
frock
to
meet
Sally
Seton
!




she
be
wear
pink
gauze
--
be
that
possible
?
she
seem
,
anyhow
,
all
light
,
glowing
,
like
some
bird
or
air
ball
that
have
fly
in
,
attach
itself
for
a
moment
to
a
bramble
.
but
nothing
be
so
strange
when
one
be
in
love
(
and
what
be
this
except
be
in
love
?
)
as
the
complete
indifference
of
other
people
.
Aunt
Helena
just
wander
off
after
dinner
;
Papa
read
the
paper
.
Peter
Walsh
might
have
be
there
,
and
old
Miss
Cummings
;
Joseph
Breitkopf
certainly
be
,
for
he
come
every
summer
,
poor
old
man
,
for
week
and
week
,
and
pretend
to
read
German
with
she
,
but
really
play
the
piano
and
sing
Brahms
without
any
voice
.




all
this
be
only
a
background
for
Sally
.
she
stand
by
the
fireplace
talk
,
in
that
beautiful
voice
which
make
everything
she
say
sound
like
a
caress
,
to
Papa
,
who
have
begin
to
be
attract
rather
against
his
will
(
he
never
get
over
lend
her
one
of
his
book
and
find
it
soak
on
the
terrace
)
,
when
suddenly
she
say
,
"
what
a
shame
to
sit
indoor
!
"
and
they
all
go
out
on
to
the
terrace
and
walk
up
and
down
.
Peter
Walsh
and
Joseph
Breitkopf
go
on
about
Wagner
.
she
and
Sally
fall
a
little
behind
.
then
come
the
most
exquisite
moment
of
her
whole
life
pass
a
stone
urn
with
flower
in
it
.
Sally
stop
;
pick
a
flower
;
kiss
she
on
the
lip
.
the
whole
world
might
have
turn
upside
down
!
the
other
disappear
;
there
she
be
alone
with
Sally
.
and
she
feel
that
she
have
be
give
a
present
,
wrap
up
,
and
tell
just
to
keep
it
,
not
to
look
at
it
--
a
diamond
,
something
infinitely
precious
,
wrap
up
,
which
,
as
they
walk
(
up
and
down
,
up
and
down
)
,
she
uncover
,
or
the
radiance
burn
through
,
the
revelation
,
the
religious
feeling!--when
old
Joseph
and
Peter
face
they
:




"
star
-
gazing
?
"
say
Peter
.




it
be
like
run
one
's
face
against
a
granite
wall
in
the
darkness
!
it
be
shocking
;
it
be
horrible
!




not
for
herself
.
she
feel
only
how
Sally
be
be
maul
already
,
maltreat
;
she
feel
his
hostility
;
his
jealousy
;
his
determination
to
break
into
their
companionship
.
all
this
she
see
as
one
see
a
landscape
in
a
flash
of
lightning
--
and
Sally
(
never
have
she
admire
she
so
much
!
)
gallantly
take
her
way
unvanquished
.
she
laugh
.
she
make
old
Joseph
tell
she
the
name
of
the
star
,
which
he
like
do
very
seriously
.
she
stand
there
:
she
listen
.
she
hear
the
name
of
the
star
.




"
oh
this
horror
!
"
she
say
to
herself
,
as
if
she
have
know
all
along
that
something
would
interrupt
,
would
embitter
her
moment
of
happiness
.




yet
,
after
all
,
how
much
she
owe
to
he
later
.
always
when
she
think
of
he
she
think
of
their
quarrel
for
some
reason
--
because
she
want
his
good
opinion
so
much
,
perhaps
.
she
owe
he
word
:
"
sentimental
,
"
"
civilised
"
;
they
start
up
every
day
of
her
life
as
if
he
guard
she
.
a
book
be
sentimental
;
an
attitude
to
life
sentimental
.
"
sentimental
,
"
perhaps
she
be
to
be
think
of
the
past
.
what
would
he
think
,
she
wonder
,
when
he
come
back
?




that
she
have
grow
old
?
would
he
say
that
,
or
would
she
see
he
think
when
he
come
back
,
that
she
have
grow
old
?
it
be
true
.
since
her
illness
she
have
turn
almost
white
.




lay
her
brooch
on
the
table
,
she
have
a
sudden
spasm
,
as
if
,
while
she
muse
,
the
icy
claws
have
have
the
chance
to
fix
in
she
.
she
be
not
old
yet
.

into
her

almost
whole
,
and
,
as
if
to
catch
the
fall
drop
,
Clarissa
(
cross
to
the
dressing
-
table
)
plunge
into
the
very
heart
of
the
moment
,
transfix
it
,
there
--
the
moment
of
this
June
morning
on
which
be
the
pressure
of
all
the
other
morning
,
see
the
glass
,
the
dressing
-
table
,
and
all
the
bottle
afresh
,
collect
the
whole
of
she
at
one
point
(
as
she
look
into
the
glass
)
,
see
the
delicate
pink
face
of
the
woman
who
be
that
very
night
to
give
a
party
;
of
Clarissa
Dalloway
;
of
herself
.




how
many
million
time
she
have
see
her
face
,
and
always
with
the
same
imperceptible
contraction
!
she
purse
her
lip
when
she
look
in
the
glass
.
it
be
to
give
her
face
point
.
that
be
her
self
--
point
;
dartlike
;
definite
.
that
be
her
self
when
some
effort
,
some
call
on
she
to
be
her
self
,
draw
the
part
together
,
she
alone
know
how
different
,
how
incompatible
and
compose
so
for
the
world
only
into
one
centre
,
one
diamond
,
one
woman
who
sit
in
her
drawing
-
room
and
make
a
meeting
-
point
,
a
radiancy
no
doubt
in
some
dull
life
,
a
refuge
for
the
lonely
to
come
to
,
perhaps
;
she
have
help
young
people
,
who
be
grateful
to
she
;
have
try
to
be
the
same
always
,
never
show
a
sign
of
all
the
other
side
of
she
--
fault
,
jealousy
,
vanity
,
suspicion
,
like
this
of
Lady
Bruton
not
ask
she
to
lunch
;
which
,
she
think
(
comb
her
hair
finally
)
,
be
utterly
base
!
now
,
where
be
her
dress
?




her
evening
dress
hang
in
the
cupboard
.
Clarissa
,
plunge
her
hand
into
the
softness
,
gently
detach
the
green
dress
and
carry
it
to
the
window
.
she
have
tear
it
.
some
one
have
trod
on
the
skirt
.
she
have
feel
it
give
at
the
Embassy
party
at
the
top
among
the
fold
.
by
artificial
light
the
green
shone
,
but
lose
its
colour
now
in
the
sun
.
she
would
mend
it
.
her
maid
have
too
much
to
do
.
she
would
wear
it
to
-
night
.
she
would
take
her
silk
,
her
scissor
,
she
--
what
be
it?--her
thimble
,
of
course
,
down
into
the
drawing
-
room
,
for
she
must
also
write
,
and
see
that
thing
generally
be
more
or
less
in
order
.




strange
,
she
think
,
pause
on
the
landing
,
and
assemble
that
diamond
shape
,
that
single
person
,
strange
how
a
mistress
know
the
very
moment
,
the
very
temper
of
her
house
!
Faint

now
I
remember
how
impossible
it
be
ever
to

and
why
do
I
make
up

,
that
awful
summer

"




"

"
he
say
;
and
he
remember
breakfast
alone
,
very
awkwardly
,
with
her
father
;
who
have
die
;
and
he
have
not
write

but
he
have
never
get
on
well
with
old
Parry

that
querulous
,
weak

kneed
old
man
,
Clarissa

Justin
Parry

"

"
but
he

our
friend

"
say
Clarissa
;
and
could
have
bite
her
tongue
for
thus
remind
Peter
that
he
have
want
to
marry
she
.




of
course
I
do
,
think
Peter
;
it
almost
break
my
heart
too
,
he
think
;
and
be
overcome
with
his
own
grief
,
which
rise
like
a
moon
look
at
from
a
terrace
,
ghastly
beautiful
with
light
from
the
sunken
day
.
I
be
more
unhappy
than
I
've
ever
be
since

he
think
.
and
as
if
in
truth
he
be
sit
there
on
the
terrace
he
edge
a
little
towards
Clarissa
;
put
his
hand
out
;
raise
it
;
let
it
fall
.
there
above
they
it
hang
,
that
moon
.
she
too
seem
to
be
sit
with
he
on
the
terrace
,
in
the
moonlight
.




"

.
"
I

she
say
.




then
,
just
as
happen
on
a
terrace
in
the
moonlight
,
when
one
person
begin
to
feel
ashamed
that
he
be
already
bored
,

yet
as
the
other
sit
silent
,
very
quiet
,
sadly
look
at
the

not

move
his
foot

clear
his

some
iron
scroll
on
a

say
nothing

so
Peter
Walsh

now
.
for
why
go
back
like
this
to
the
past

why
make
he
suffer
,
when

so
infernally

why
?




"

"
she
say
,
in
an
abrupt
voice
,
under
the
pressure
of
an
emotion
which
catch
her
heart
,
make
the
muscle
of
her
throat
stiff
,
and
contract
her
lip
in
a
spasm
as
she
say

for

it
become
a
whole

a
complete

she
put
down
by
they

through
all
that
time
and
that
emotion
,
reach
he
doubtfully
;
settle
on
he
tearfully
;
and
rise
and
flutter
away
,
as
a
bird
touch
a
branch

positively
hurt

a
clean
breast

she
be
too
cold

he
think
;
sewing
,
with
her
scissor

Daisy
would
look
ordinary
beside
Clarissa

I
detest

charming
,

and
this
have
be
go
on

he
think
;
week
after
week
;
Clarissa
's
life
;
while
I
--
he
think
;
and
at
once
everything
seem
to
radiate
from

journey
;

;
quarrel
;
adventure
;
bridge
party
;
love
affair
;
work
;

and
he
take
out
his
knife
quite
openly
--
his
old
horn
-
handle
knife
which
Clarissa
could
swear
he
have
have
these
thirty
year
--
and
clench
his
fist
upon
it
.




what
an
extraordinary
habit
that
be
,
Clarissa
think
;
always
play
with
a
knife
.
always
make
one
feel
,
too
,
frivolous
;
empty
-
minded
;
a
mere
silly
chatterbox
,
as
he
use
.
but
I
too
,
she
think
,
and
,
take
up
her
needle
,
summon
,
like
a
queen
whose
guard
have
fall
asleep
and
leave
she
unprotected
(
she
have
be
quite
take
aback
by
this
visit
--
it
have
upset
she
)
so
that
any
one
can
stroll
in
and
have
a
look
at
she
where
she
lie
with
the
bramble
curve
over
she
,
summon
to
her
help
the
thing
she
do
;
the
thing
she
like
;
her
husband
;
Elizabeth
;
her
self
,
in
short
,
which
Peter
hardly
know
now
,
all
to
come
about
she
and
beat
off
the
enemy
.




"
well
,
and
what
be
happen
to
you

"
she
say
.
so
before
a
battle
begin
,
the
horse
paw
the
ground
;
toss
their
head
;
the
light
shine
on
their
flank
;
their
neck
curve
.
so
Peter
Walsh
and
Clarissa
,
sit
side
by
side
on
the
blue
sofa
,
challenge
each
other

assemble
from
different
quarter
all
sort
of
thing
;
praise
;
his
career
at
Oxford
;
his
marriage
,
which
she
know
nothing
whatever
about
;
how
he
have
love
;
and
altogether
do
his
job
.




"
million
of

"
he
exclaim
,
and
,
urge
by
the
assembly
of
power
which
be
now
charge
this
way
and
that
and
give
he
the
feeling
at
once
frightening
and
extremely
exhilarating
of
be
rush
through
the
air
on
the
shoulder
of
people
he
could
no
long
see

he
raise
his
hand
to
his

.




Clarissa
sit
very
upright
;
draw
in
her
breath
.




"
I
be
in

he
say
,
not
to
she
however
,
but
to
some
one
raise
up
in
the
dark
so
that
you
could
not
touch
she
but
must
lay
your
garland
down
on
the
grass
in
the
dark
.




"
in
love
,
"
he
repeat
,
now
speak
rather
dryly
to
Clarissa
Dalloway
;
"
in

with
a
girl
in
India
.
"
he

hour
.
(
the
leaden
circle
dissolve
in
the
air
.
)
oh
these
party
,
he
think
;
Clarissa
's
party
.
why
do
she
give
these
party
,
he
think
.
not
that
he
blame
she
or
this
effigy
of
a
man
in
a
tail
-
coat
with
a
carnation
in
his
buttonhole
come
towards
he
.
only
one
person
in
the
world
could
be
as
he
be
,
in
love
.
and
there
he
be
,
this
fortunate
man
,
himself
,
reflect
in
the
plate
-
glass
window
of
a
motor
-
car
manufacturer
in
Victoria
Street
.
all
India
lie
behind
he
;
plain
,
mountain
;
epidemic
of
cholera
;
a
district
twice
as
big
as
Ireland
;
decision
he
have
come
to
alone
--
he
,
Peter
Walsh
;
who
be
now
really
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
,
in
love
.
Clarissa
have
grow
hard
,
he
think
;
and
a
trifle
sentimental
into
the
bargain
,
he
suspect
,
look
at
the
great
motor
-
car
capable
of
do
--
how
many
mile
on
how
many
gallon
?
for
he
have
a
turn
for
mechanic
;
have
invent
a
plough
in
his
district
,
have
order
wheel
-
barrow
from
England
,
but
the
coolie
would
n't
use
they
,
all
of
which
Clarissa
know
nothing
whatever
about
.




the
way
she
say
"
here
be
my
elizabeth!"--that
annoy
he
.
why
not
"
here
be
Elizabeth
"
simply
?
it
be
insincere
.
and
Elizabeth
do
n't
like
it
either
.
(
still
the
last
tremor
of
the
great
booming
voice
shake
the
air
round
he
;
the
half
-
hour
;
still
early
;
only
half
-
past
eleven
still
.
)
for
he
understand
young
people
;
he
like
they
.
there
be
always
something
cold
in
Clarissa
,
he
think
.
she
have
always
,
even
as
a
girl
,
a
sort
of
timidity
,
which
in
middle
age
become
conventionality
,
and
then
it
be
all
up
,
it
be
all
up
,
he
think
,
look
rather
drearily
into
the
glassy
depth
,
and
wonder
whether
by
call
at
that
hour
he
have
annoy
she
;
overcome
with
shame
suddenly
at
having
be
a
fool
;
weep
;
be
emotional
;
tell
she
everything
,
as
usual
,
as
usual
.




as
a
cloud
cross
the
sun
,
silence
fall
on
London
;
and
fall
on
the
mind
.
effort
cease
.
time
flap
on
the
mast
.
there
we
stop
;
there
we
stand
.
rigid
,
the
skeleton
of
habit
alone
uphold
the
human
frame
.
where
there
be
nothing
,
Peter
Walsh
say
to
himself
;
feel
hollow
out
,
utterly
empty
within
.
Clarissa
refuse
I
,
he
think
.
he
stand
there
think
,
Clarissa
refuse
I
.




ah
,
say
St.
Margaret
's
,
like
a
hostess
who
come
into
her
drawing
-
room
on
the
very
stroke
of
the
hour
and
find
her
guest
there
already
.
I
be
not
late
.
no
,
it
be
precisely
half
-
past
eleven
,
she
say
.
yet
,
though
she
be
perfectly
right
,
her
voice
,
be
the
voice
of
the
hostess
,
be
reluctant
to
inflict
its
individuality
.
some
grief
for
the
past
hold
it
back
;
some
concern
for
the
present
.
it
be
half
-
past
eleven
,
she
say
,
and
the
sound
of
St.
Margaret
's
glide
into
the
recess
of
the
heart
and
bury
itself
in
ring
after
ring
of
sound
,
like
something
alive
which
want
to
confide
itself
,
to
disperse
itself
,
to
be
,
with
a
tremor
of
delight
,
at
rest
--
like
Clarissa
herself
,
think
Peter
Walsh
,
come
down
the
stair
on
the
stroke
of
the
hour
in
white
.
it
be
Clarissa
herself
,
he
think
,
with
a
deep
emotion
,
and
an
extraordinarily
clear
,
yet
puzzle
,
recollection
of
she
,
as
if
this
bell
have
come
into
the
room
year
ago
,
where
they
sit
at
some
moment
of
great
intimacy
,
and
have
go
from
one
to
the
other
and
have
leave
,
like
a
bee
with
honey
,
laden
with
the
moment
.
but
what
room
?
what
moment
?
and
why
have
he
be
so
profoundly
happy
when
the
clock
be
strike
?
then
,
as
the
sound
of
St.
Margaret
's
languish
,
he
think
,
she
have
be
ill
,
and
the
sound
express
languor
and
suffering
.
it
be
her
heart
,
he
remember
;
and
the
sudden
loudness
of
the
final
stroke
toll
for
death
that
surprise
in
the
midst
of
life
,
Clarissa
fall
where
she
stand
,
in
her
drawing
-
room
.
no
!
no
!
he
cry
.
she
be
not
dead
!
I
be
not
old
,
he
cry
,
and
march
up
Whitehall
,
as
if
there
roll
down
to
he
,
vigorous
,
unending
,
his
future
.




he
be
not
old
,
or
set
,
or
dry
in
the
least
.
as
for
care
what
they
say
of
he
--
the
Dalloways
,
the
Whitbreads
,
and
their
set
,
he
care
not
a
straw
--
not
a
straw
(
though
it
be
true
he
would
have
,
some
time
or
other
,
to
see
whether
Richard
could
n't
help
he
to
some
job
)
.
stride
,
stare
,
he
glare
at
the
statue
of
the
Duke
of
Cambridge
.
he
have
be
send
down
from
Oxford
--
true
.
he
have
be
a
Socialist
,
in
some
sense
a
failure
--
true
.
still
the
future
of
civilisation
lie
,
he
think
,
in
the
hand
of
young
man
like
that
;
of
young
man
such
as
he
be
,
thirty
year
ago
;
with
their
love
of
abstract
principle
;
get
book
send
out
to
they
all
the
way
from
London
to
a
peak
in
the
Himalayas
;
read
science
;
read
philosophy
.
the
future
lie
in
the
hand
of
young
man
like
that
,
he
think
.




a
patter
like
the
patter
of
leave
in
a
wood
come
from
behind
,
and
with
it
a
rustling
,
regular
thudding
sound
,
which
as
it
overtake
he
drum
his
thought
,
strict
in
step
,
up
Whitehall
,
without
his
doing
.
boy
in
uniform
,
carry
gun
,
march
with
their
eye
ahead
of
they
,
march
,
their
arm
stiff
,
and
on
their
face
an
expression
like
the
letter
of
a
legend
write
round
the
base
of
a
statue
praise
duty
,
gratitude
,
fidelity
,
love
of
England
.




it
be
,
think
Peter
Walsh
,
begin
to
keep
step
with
they
,
a
very
fine
training
.
but
they
do
not
look
robust
.
they
be
weedy
for
the
most
part
,
boy
of
sixteen
,
who
might
,
to
-
morrow
,
stand
behind
bowl
of
rice
,
cake
of
soap
on
counter
.
now
they
wear
on
they
unmixe
with
sensual
pleasure
or
daily
preoccupation
the
solemnity
of
the
wreath
which
they
have
fetch
from
Finsbury
Pavement
to
the
empty
tomb
.
they
have
take
their
vow
.
the
traffic
respect
it
;
van
be
stop
.




I
ca
n't
keep
up
with
they
,
Peter
Walsh
think
,
as
they
march
up
Whitehall
,
and
sure
enough
,
on
they
march
,
past
he
,
past
every
one
,
in
their
steady
way
,
as
if
one
will
work
leg
and
arm
uniformly
,
and
life
,
with
its
variety
,
its
irreticence
,
have
be
lay
under
a
pavement
of
monument
and
wreath
and
drug
into
a
stiff
yet
stare
corpse
by
discipline
.
one
have
to
respect
it
;
one
might
laugh
;
but
one
have
to
respect
it
,
he
think
.
there
they
go
,
think
Peter
Walsh
,
pause
at
the
edge
of
the
pavement
;
and
all
the
exalted
statue
,
Nelson
,
Gordon
,
Havelock
,
the
black
,
the
spectacular
image
of
great
soldier
stand
look
ahead
of
they
,
as
if
they
too
have
make
the
same
renunciation
(
Peter
Walsh
feel
he
too
have
make
it
,
the
great
renunciation
)
,
trample
under
the
same
temptation
,
and
achieve
at
length
a
marble
stare
.
but
the
stare
Peter
Walsh
do
not
want
for
himself
in
the
least
;
though
he
could
respect
it
in
other
.
he
could
respect
it
in
boy
.
they
do
n't
know
the
trouble
of
the
flesh
yet
,
he
think
,
as
the
march
boy
disappear
in
the
direction
of
the
Strand
--
all
that
I
've
be
through
,
he
think
,
cross
the
road
,
and
stand
under
Gordon
's
statue
,
Gordon
whom
as
a
boy
he
have
worship
;
Gordon
stand
lonely
with
one
leg
raise
and
his
arm
crossed,--poor
Gordon
,
he
think
.




and
just
because
nobody
yet
know
he
be
in
London
,
except
Clarissa
,
and
the
earth
,
after
the
voyage
,
still
seem
an
island
to
he
,
the
strangeness
of
stand
alone
,
alive
,
unknown
,
at
half
-
past
eleven
in
Trafalgar
Square
overcome
he
.
what
be
it
?
where
be
I
?
and
why
,
after
all
,
do
one
do
it
?
he
think
,
the
divorce
seem
all
moonshine
.
and
down
his
mind
go
flat
as
a
marsh
,
and
three
great
emotion
bowl
over
he
;
understanding
;
a
vast
philanthropy
;
and
finally
,
as
if
the
result
of
the
other
,
an
irrepressible
,
exquisite
delight
;
as
if
inside
his
brain
by
another
hand
string
be
pull
,
shutter
move
,
and
he
,
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
,
yet
stand
at
the
opening
of
endless
avenue
,
down
which
if
he
choose
he
might
wander
.
he
have
not
feel
so
young
for
year
.




he
have
escape
!
be
utterly
free
--
as
happen
in
the
downfall
of
habit
when
the
mind
,
like
an
unguarded
flame
,
bow
and
bend
and
seem
about
to
blow
from
its
holding
.
I
have
n't
feel
so
young
for
year
!
think
Peter
,
escape
(
only
of
course
for
an
hour
or
so
)
from
be
precisely
what
he
be
,
and
feel
like
a
child
who
run
out
of
door
,
and
see
,
as
he
run
,
his
old
nurse
wave
at
the
wrong
window
.
but
she
be
extraordinarily
attractive
,
he
think
,
as
,
walk
across
Trafalgar
Square
in
the
direction
of
the
Haymarket
,
come
a
young
woman
who
,
as
she
pass
Gordon
's
statue
,
seem
,
Peter
Walsh
think
(
susceptible
as
he
be
)
,
to
shed
veil
after
veil
,
until
she
become
the
very
woman
he
have
always
have
in
mind
;
young
,
but
stately
;
merry
,
but
discreet
;
black
,
but
enchant
.




straighten
himself
and
stealthily
finger
his
pocket
-
knife
he
start
after
she
to
follow
this
woman
,
this
excitement
,
which
seem
even
with
its
back
turn
to
shed
on
he
a
light
which
connect
they
,
which
single
he
out
,
as
if
the
random
uproar
of
the
traffic
have
whisper
through
hollow
hand
his
name
,
not
Peter
,
but
his
private
name
which
he
call
himself
in
his
own
thought
.
"
you
,
"
she
say
,
only
"
you
,
"
say
it
with
her
white
glove
and
her
shoulder
.
then
the
thin
long
cloak
which
the
wind
stir
as
she
walk
past
Dent
's
shop
in
Cockspur
Street
blow
out
with
an
envelop
kindness
,
a
mournful
tenderness
,
as
of
arm
that
would
open
and
take
the
tired--




but
she
be
not
married
;
she
be
young
;
quite
young
,
think
Peter
,
the
red
carnation
he
have
see
she
wear
as
she
come
across
Trafalgar
Square
burn
again
in
his
eye
and
make
her
lip
red
.
but
she
wait
at
the
kerbstone
.
there
be
a
dignity
about
she
.
she
be
not
worldly
,
like
Clarissa
;
not
rich
,
like
Clarissa
.
be
she
,
he
wonder
as
she
move
,
respectable
?
Witty
,
with
a
lizard
's
flickering
tongue
,
he
think
(
for
one
must
invent

shoulder
combine
with
the
fringe
and
the
lace
and
the
feather

in
the
window
to
make
the
spirit
of
finery
and
whimsy
which
dwindle
out
of
the
shop
on
to
the
pavement
,

Clarissa
's
voice
say
,
remember
my
party
,
remember
my
party
,
sing
in
his
ear
.
the
house
be
one
of
those
flat
red
house
with
hang
flower
-
basket
of
vague
impropriety
.
it
be
over
.




well
,
I
've
have
my
fun
;
I
've
have
it
,
he
think
,
look
up
at
the
swinge
basket
of
pale
geranium
.
and
it
be
smash
to
atom
--
his
fun
,
for
it
be
half
make
up
,
as
he
know
very
well
;
invent
,
this
escapade
with
the
girl
;
make
up
,
as
one
make
up
the
well
part
of
life
,
he
think
--
make
oneself
up
;
make
she
up
;
create
an
exquisite
amusement
,
and
something
more
.
but
odd
it
be
,
and
quite
true
;
all
this
one
could
never
share
--
it
smash
to
atom
.




he
turn
;
go
up
the
street
,
think
to
find
somewhere
to
sit
,
till
it
be
time
for
Lincoln
's
Inn
--
for
Messrs.
Hooper
and
Grateley
.
where
should
he
go
?
no
matter
.
up
the
street
,
then
,
towards
Regent
's
Park
.
his
boot
on
the
pavement
strike
out
"
no
matter
"
;
for
it
be
early
,
still
very
early
.




it
be
a
splendid
morning
too
.
like
the
pulse
of
a
perfect
heart
,
life
strike
straight
through
the
street
.
there
be
no
fumbling
--
no
hesitation
.
sweep
and
swerve
,
accurately
,
punctually
,
noiselessly
,
there
,
precisely
at
the
right
instant
,
the
motor
-
car
stop
at
the
door
.
the
girl
,
silk
-
stockinge
,
feather
,
evanescent
,
but
not
to
he
particularly
attractive
(
for
he
have
have
his
fling
)
,
alight
.
admirable
butler
,
tawny
chow
dog
,
hall
lay
in
black
and
white
lozenge
with
white
blind
blow
,
Peter
see
through
the
open
door
and
approve
of
.
a
splendid
achievement
in
its
own
way
,
after
all
,
London
;
the
season
;
civilisation
.
come
as
he
do
from
a
respectable
anglo
-
indian
family
which
for
at
least
three
generation
have
administer
the
affair
of
a
continent
(
it
be
strange
,
he
think
,
what
a
sentiment
I
have
about
that
,
dislike
India
,
and
empire
,
and
army
as
he
do
)
,
there
be
moment
when
civilisation
,
even
of
this
sort
,
seem
dear
to
he
as
a
personal
possession
;
moment
of
pride
in
England
;
in
butler
;
chow
dog
;
girl
in
their
security
.
ridiculous
enough
,
still
there
it
be
,
he
think
.
and
the
doctor
and
man
of
business
and
capable
woman
all
go
about
their
business
,
punctual
,
alert
,
robust
,
seem
to
he
wholly
admirable
,
good
fellow
,
to
whom
one
would
entrust
one
's
life
,
companion
in
the
art
of
living
,
who
would
see
one
through
.
what
with
one
thing
and
another
,
the
show
be
really
very
tolerable
;
and
he
would
sit
down
in
the
shade
and
smoke
.




there
be
Regent
's
Park
.
yes
.
as
a
child
he
have
walk
in
Regent
's
Park
--
odd
,
he
think
,
how
the
thought
of
childhood
keep
come
back
to
I
--
the
result
of
see
Clarissa
,
perhaps
;
for
woman
live
much
more
in
the
past
than
we
do
,
he
think
.
they
attach
themselves
to
place
;
and
their
father
--
a
woman
be
always
proud
of
her
father
.
Bourton
be
a
nice
place
,
a
very
nice
place
,
but
I
could
never
get
on
with
the
old
man
,
he
think
.
there
be
quite
a
scene
one
night
--
an
argument
about
something
or
other
,
what
,
he
could
not
remember
.
politic
presumably
.




yes
,
he
remember
Regent
's
Park
;
the
long
straight
walk
;
the
little
house
where
one
buy
air
-
ball
to
the
left
;
an
absurd
statue
with
an
inscription
somewhere
or
other
.
he
look
for
an
empty
seat
.
he
do
not
want
to
be
bother
(
feel
a
little
drowsy
as
he
do
)
by
people
ask
he
the
time
.
an
elderly
grey
nurse
,
with
a
baby
asleep
in
its
perambulator
--
that
be
the
good
he
could
do
for
himself
;
sit
down
at
the
far
end
of
the
seat
by
that
nurse
.




she
be
a
queer
-
look
girl
,
he
think
,
suddenly
remember
Elizabeth
as
she
come
into
the
room
and
stand
by
her
mother
.
grow
big
;
quite
grow
-
up
,
not
exactly
pretty
;
handsome
rather
;
and
she
ca
n't
be
more
than
eighteen
.
probably
she
do
n't
get
on
with
Clarissa
.
"
there
be
my
Elizabeth"--that
sort
of
thing
--
why
not
"
here
be
Elizabeth
"
simply?--trye
to
make
out
,
like
most
mother
,
that
thing
be
what
they
be
not
.
she
trust
to
her
charm
too
much
,
he
think
.
she
overdo
it
.




the
rich
benignant
cigar
smoke
eddy
coolly
down
his
throat
;
he
puff
it
out
again
in
ring
which
breast
the
air
bravely
for
a
moment
;
blue
,
circular
--
I
shall
try
and
get
a
word
alone
with
Elizabeth
to
-
night
,
he
think
--
then
begin
to
wobble
into
hour
-
glass
shape
and
taper
away
;
odd
shape
they
take
,
he
think
.
suddenly
he
close
his
eye
,
raise
his
hand
with
an
effort
,
and
throw
away
the
heavy
end
of
his
cigar
.
a
great
brush
sweep
smooth
across
his
mind
,
sweep
across
it
move
branch
,
child
's
voice
,
the
shuffle
of
foot
,
and
people
pass
,
and
hum
traffic
,
rise
and
fall
traffic
.
down
,
down
he
sink
into
the
plume
and
feather
of
sleep
,
sink
,
and
be
muffle
over
.




 



 



the
grey
nurse
resume
her
knitting
as
Peter
Walsh
,
on
the
hot
seat
beside
she
,
begin
snore
.
in
her
grey
dress
,
move
her
hand
indefatigably
yet
quietly
,
she
seem
like
the
champion
of
the
right
of
sleeper
,
like
one
of
those
spectral
presence
which
rise
in
twilight
in
wood
make
of
sky
and
branch
.
the
solitary
traveller
,
haunter
of
lane
,
disturber
of
fern
,
and
devastator
of
great
hemlock
plant
,
look
up
,
suddenly
see
the
giant
figure
at
the
end
of
the
ride
.




by
conviction
an
atheist
perhaps
,
he
be
take
by
surprise
with
moment
of
extraordinary
exaltation
.
nothing
exist
outside
we
except
a
state
of
mind
,
he
think
;
a
desire
for
solace
,
for
relief
,
for
something
outside
these
miserable
pigmy
,
these
feeble
,
these
ugly
,
these
craven
man
and
woman
.
but
if
he
can
conceive
of
she
,
then
in
some
sort
she
exist
,
he
think
,
and
advance
down
the
path
with
his
eye
upon
sky
and
branch
he
rapidly
endow
they
with
womanhood
;
see
with
amazement
how
grave
they
become
;
how
majestically
,
as
the
breeze
stir
they
,
they
dispense
with
a
dark
flutter
of
the
leave
charity
,
comprehension
,
absolution
,
and
then
,
fling
themselves
suddenly
aloft
,
confound
the
piety
of
their
aspect
with
a
wild
carouse
.




such
be
the
vision
which
proffer
great
cornucopias
full
of
fruit
to
the
solitary
traveller
,
or
murmur
in
his
ear
like
siren
lollop
away
on
the
green
sea
wave
,
or
be
dash
in
his
face
like
bunche
of
rose
,
or
rise
to
the
surface
like
pale
face
which
fisherman
flounder
through
flood
to
embrace
.




such
be
the
vision
which
ceaselessly
float
up
,
pace
beside
,
put
their
face
in
front
of
,
the
actual
thing
;
often
overpower
the
solitary
traveller
and
take
away
from
he
the
sense
of
the
earth
,
the
wish
to
return
,
and
give
he
for
substitute
a
general
peace
,
as
if
(
so
he
think
as
he
advance
down
the
forest
ride
)
all
this
fever
of
living
be
simplicity
itself
;
and
myriad
of
thing
merge
in
one
thing
;
and
this
figure
,
make
of
sky
and
branch
as
it
be
,
have
rise
from
the
troubled
sea
(
he
be
elderly
,
past
fifty
now
)
as
a
shape
might
be
suck
up
out
of
the
wave
to
shower
down
from
her
magnificent
hand
compassion
,
comprehension
,
absolution
.
so
,
he
think
,
may
I
never
go
back
to
the
lamplight
;
to
the
sitting
-
room
;
never
finish
my
book
;
never
knock
out
my
pipe
;
never
ring
for
Mrs.
Turner
to
clear
away
;
rather
let
I
walk
straight
on
to
this
great
figure
,
who
will
,
with
a
toss
of
her
head
,
mount
I
on
her
streamer
and
let
I
blow
to
nothingness
with
the
rest
.




such
be
the
vision
.
the
solitary
traveller
be
soon
beyond
the
wood
;
and
there
,
come
to
the
door
with
shaded
eye
,
possibly
to
look
for
his
return
,
with
hand
raise
,
with
white
apron
blow
,
be
an
elderly
woman
who
seem
(
so
powerful
be
this
infirmity
)
to
seek
,
over
a
desert
,
a
lost
son
;
to
search
for
a
rider
destroy
;
to
be
the
figure
of
the
mother
whose
son
have
be
kill
in
the
battle
of
the
world
.
so
,
as
the
solitary
traveller
advance
down
the
village
street
where
the
woman
stand
knitting
and
the
man
dig
in
the
garden
,
the
evening
seem
ominous
;
the
figure
still
;
as
if
some
august
fate
,
know
to
they
,
await
without
fear
,
be
about
to
sweep
they
into
complete
annihilation
.




indoor
among
ordinary
thing
,
the
cupboard
,
the
table
,
the
window
-
sill
with
its
geranium
,
suddenly
the
outline
of
the
landlady
,
bend
to
remove
the
cloth
,
become
soft
with
light
,
an
adorable
emblem
which
only
the
recollection
of
cold
human
contact
forbid
we
to
embrace
.

a
bold
thing
to

he
could
see
Clarissa
now
,
turn
bright
pink
;
somehow
contract
;
and

,

Whereupon
the
whole
party
sit
round
the
tea

table
seem
to
wobble
.
it
be
very
uncomfortable
.




he
have
n't
blame
she
for
mind
the
fact
,
since
in
those
day
a
girl
bring
up
as
she
be
,
know
nothing
,
but
it
be
her
manner
that
annoy
he
;
timid
;
hard
;
something
arrogant
;
unimaginative
;
prudish
.
"
the
death
of
the
soul
.
"
he
have
say
that
instinctively
,
ticket
the
moment
as
he
use
to
do
--
the
death
of
her
soul
.




every
one
wobble
;
every
one
seem
to
bow
,
as
she
speak
,
and
then
to
stand
up
different
.
he
could
see
Sally
Seton
,
like
a
child
who
have
be
in
mischief
,
lean
forward
,
rather
flushed
,
want
to
talk
,
but
afraid
,
and
Clarissa
do
frighten
people
.
(
she
be
Clarissa
's
great
friend
,
always
about
the
place
,
totally
unlike
she
,
an
attractive
creature
,
handsome
,
dark
,
with
the
reputation
in
those
day
of
great
daring
and
he
use
to
give
her
cigar
,
which
she
smoke
in
her
bedroom
.
she
have
either
be
engage
to
somebody
or
quarrel
with
her
family
and
old
Parry
dislike
they
both
equally
,
which
be
a
great
bond
.
)
then
Clarissa
,
still
with
an
air
of
be
offend
with
they
all
,
get
up
,
make
some
excuse
,
and
go
off
,
alone
.
as
she
open
the
door
,
in
come
that
great
shaggy
dog
which
run
after
sheep
.
she
fling
herself
upon
he
,
go
into
rapture
.
it
be
as
if
she
say
to
Peter
--
it
be
all
aim
at
he
,
he
knew--"I
know
you
think
I
absurd
about
that
woman
just
now
;
but
see
how
extraordinarily
sympathetic
I
be
;
see
how
I
love
my
Rob
!
"




they
have
always
this
queer
power
of
communicating
without
word
.
she
know
directly
he
criticise
she
.
then
she
would
do
something
quite
obvious
to
defend
herself
,
like
this
fuss
with
the
dog
--
but
it
never
take
he
in
,
he
always
see
through
Clarissa
.
not
that
he
say
anything
,
of
course
;
just
sat
look
glum
.
it
be
the
way
their
quarrel
often
begin
.




she
shut
the
door
.
at
once
he
become
extremely
depressed
.
it
all
seem
useless
--
go
on
be
in
love
;
go
on
quarrel
;
go
on
make
it
up
,
and
he
wander
off
alone
,
among
outhouse
,
stable
,
look
at
the
horse
.
(
the
place
be
quite
a
humble
one
;
the
Parrys
be
never
very
well
off
;
but
there
be
always
groom
and
stable

boy
about
--
Clarissa
love
riding

and
an
old
coachman
--
what
be
his
name?--an
old
nurse
,
old
Moody
,
old
Goody
,
some
such
name
they
call
she
,
whom
one
be
take
to
visit
in
a
little
room
with
lot
of
photograph
,
lot
of
bird
-
cage
.
)




it
be
an
awful
evening
!
he
grow
more
and
more
gloomy
,
not
about
that
only
;
about
everything
.
and
he
could
n't
see
she
;
could
n't
explain
to
she
;
could
n't
have
it
out
.
there
be
always
people
about
--
she'd
go
on
as
if
nothing
have
happen
.
that
be
the
devilish
part
of
she
--
this
coldness
,
this
woodenness
,
something
very
profound
in
she
,
which
he
have
feel
again
this
morning
talk
to
she
;
an
impenetrability
.
yet
Heaven
know
he
love
she
.
she
have
some
queer
power
of
fiddle
on
one
's
nerve
,
turn
one
's
nerve
to
fiddle
-
string
,
yes
.




he
have
go
in
to
dinner
rather
late
,
from
some
idiotic
idea
of
make
himself
feel
,
and
have
sit
down
by
old
Miss
Parry
--
Aunt
Helena
--
Mr.
Parry
's
sister
,
who
be
suppose
to
preside
.
there
she
sit
in
her
white
Cashmere
shawl
,
with
her
head
against
the
window
--
a
formidable
old
lady
,
but
kind
to
he
,
for
he
have
find
she
some
rare
flower
,
and
she
be
a
great
botanist
,
march
off
in
thick
boot
with
a
black
collecting
-
box
slung
between
her
shoulder
.
he
sit
down
beside
she
,
and
could
n't
speak
.
everything
seem
to
race
past
he
;
he
just
sit
there
,
eat
.
and
then
half
-
way
through
dinner
he
make
himself
look
across
at
Clarissa
for
the
first
time
.
she
be
talk
to
a
young
man
on
her
right
.
he
have
a
sudden
revelation
.
"
she
will
marry
that
man
,
"
he
say
to
himself
.
he
do
n't
even
know
his
name
.




for
of
course
it
be
that
afternoon
,
that
very
afternoon
,
that
Dalloway
have
come
over
;
and
Clarissa
call
he
"
Wickham
"
;
that
be
the
beginning
of
it
all
.
somebody
have
bring
he
over
;
and
Clarissa
get
his
name
wrong
.
she
introduce
he
to
everybody
as
Wickham
.
at
last
he
say
"
my
name
be
dalloway!"--that
be
his
first
view
of
Richard
--
a
fair
young
man
,
rather
awkward
,
sit
on
a
deck
-
chair
,
and
blurt
out
"
my
name
be
Dalloway
!
"
Sally
get
hold
of
it
;
always
after
that
she
call
he
"
my
name
be
Dalloway
!
"




he
be
a
prey
to
revelation
at
that
time
.
this
one
--
that
she
would
marry
Dalloway
--
be
blind
--
overwhelming
at
the
moment
.
there
be
a
sort
of
--
how
could
he
put
it?--a
sort
of
ease
in
her
manner
to
he
;
something
maternal
;
something
gentle
.
they
be
talk
about
politic
.
all
through
dinner
he
try
to
hear
what
they
be
say
.




afterwards
he
could
remember
stand
by
old
Miss
Parry
's
chair
in
the
drawing
-
room
.
Clarissa
come
up
,
with
her
perfect
manner
,
like
a
real
hostess
,
and
want
to
introduce
he
to
some
one
--
speak
as
if
they
have
never
meet
before
,
which
enrage
he
.
yet
even
then
he
admire
she
for
it
.
he
admire
her
courage
;
her
social
instinct
;
he
admire
her
power
of
carry
thing
through
.
"
the
perfect
hostess
,
"
he
say
to
she
,
whereupon
she
wince
all
over
.
but
he
mean
she
to
feel
it
.
he
would
have
do
anything
to
hurt
she
after
see
she
with
Dalloway
.
so
she
leave
he
.
and
he
have
a
feeling
that
they
be
all
gather
together
in
a
conspiracy
against
he
--
laugh
and
talk
--
behind
his
back
.
there
he
stand
by
Miss
Parry
's
chair
as
though
he
have
be
cut
out
of
wood
,
he
talk
about
wild
flower
.
never
,
never
have
he
suffer
so
infernally
!
he
must
have
forget
even
to
pretend
to
listen
;
at
last
he
wake
up
;
he
see
Miss
Parry
look
rather
disturb
,
rather
indignant
,
with
her
prominent
eye
fix
.
he
almost
cry
out
that
he
could
n't
attend
because
he
be
in
Hell
!
People
begin
go
out
of
the
room
.
he
hear
they
talk
about
fetch
cloak
;
about
its
be
cold
on
the
water
,
and
so
on
.
they
be
go
boat
on
the
lake
by
moonlight
--
one
of
Sally
's
mad
idea
.
he
could
hear
she
describe
the
moon
.
and
they
all
go
out
.
he
be
leave
quite
alone
.




"
do
n't
you
want
to
go
with
they
?
"
say
Aunt
Helena
--
old
Miss
Parry!--she
have
guess
.
and
he
turn
round
and
there
be
Clarissa
again
.
she
have
come
back
to
fetch
he
.
he
be
overcome
by
her
generosity
--
her
goodness
.




"
come
along
,
"
she
say
.
"
they
be
wait
.
"
he
have
never
feel
so
happy
in
the
whole
of
his
life
!
without
a
word
they
make
it
up
.
they
walk
down
to
the
lake
.
he
have
twenty
minute
of
perfect
happiness
.
her
voice
,
her
laugh
,
her
dress
(
something
floating
,
white
,
crimson
)
,
her
spirit
,
her
adventurousness
;
she
make
they
all
disembark
and
explore
the
island
;
she
startle
a
hen
;
she
laugh
;
she
sing
.
and
all
the
time
,
he
know
perfectly
well
,
Dalloway
be
fall
in
love
with
she
;
she
be
fall
in
love
with
Dalloway
;
but
it
do
n't
seem
to
matter
.
nothing
matter
.
they
sit
on
the
ground
and
talk
--
he
and
Clarissa
.
they
go
in
and
out
of
each
other
's
mind
without
any
effort
.
and
then
in
a
second
it
be
over
.
he
say
to
himself
as
they
be
get
into
the
boat
,
"
she
will
marry
that
man
,
"
dully
,
without
any
resentment
;
but
it
be
an
obvious
thing
.
Dalloway
would
marry
Clarissa
.




Dalloway
row
they
in
.
he
say
nothing
.
but
somehow
as
they
watched
he
start
,
jump
on
to
his
bicycle
to
ride
twenty
mile
through
the
wood
,
wobble
off
down
the
drive
,
wave
his
hand
and
disappear
,
he
obviously
do
feel
,
instinctively
,
tremendously
,
strongly
,
all
that
;
the
night
;
the
romance
;
Clarissa
.
he
deserve
to
have
she
.




for
himself
,
he
be
absurd
.
his
demand
upon
Clarissa
(
he
could
see
it
now
)
be
absurd
.
he
ask
impossible
thing
.
he
make
terrible
scene
.
she
would
have
accept
he
still
,
perhaps
,
if
he
have
be
less
absurd
.
Sally
think
so
.
she
write
he
all
that
summer
long
letter
;
how
they
have
talk
of
he
;
how
she
have
praise

eye
.
to
be
rock
by
this
malignant
torturer
be
her
lot
.
but
why
?
she
be
like
a
bird
shelter
under
the
thin
hollow
of
a
leaf
,
who
blink
at
the
sun
when
the
leaf
move
;
start
at
the
crack
of
a
dry
twig
.
she

expose
;
she
be
surround
by
the
enormous
tree
,
vast
cloud
of
an
indifferent
world
,
expose
;
torture
;
and
why
should
she
suffer
?
why
?




she
frown
;
she
stamp
her
foot
.
she
must
go
back
again
to
Septimus
since
it
be
almost
time
for
they
to
be
go
to
Sir
William
Bradshaw
.
she
must
go
back
and
tell
he
,
go
back
to
he
sit
there
on
the
green
chair
under
the
tree
,
talk
to
himself
,
or
to
that
dead
man
Evans
,
whom
she
have
only
see
once
for
a
moment
in
the
shop
.
he
have
seem
a
nice
quiet
man
;
a
great
friend
of
Septimus
's
,
and
he
have
be

.
but
such
thing

to
every
one
.
every
one
have
friend
who
be
kill
in
the
War
.
every
one
give
up
something
when
they
marry
.
she
have
give
up
her
home
.
she
have
come
to
live
here
,
in
this
awful
city
.
but
Septimus
let
himself
think
about
horrible
thing
,
as
she
could
too
,
if
she
try
.
he
have
grow
strange
and
strange
.
he
say
people
be
talk
behind
the
bedroom
wall
.
Mrs.
Filmer
think
it
odd
.
he
see
thing
too
--
he
have
see
an
old
woman
's
head
in
the
middle
of
a
fern
.
yet
he
could
be
happy
when
he
choose
.
they
go
to
Hampton
Court
on
top
of
a
bus
,
and
they
be
perfectly
happy
.
all
the
little
red
and
yellow
flower
be
out
on
the
grass
,
like
float
lamp
he
say
,
and
talk
and
chatter
and
laugh
,
make
up
story
.
suddenly
he
say
,
"
now
we
will
kill
ourselves
,
"
when
they
be
stand
by
the
river
,
and
he
look
at
it
with
a
look
which
she
have
see
in
his
eye
when
a
train
go
by
,
or
an
omnibus
--
a
look
as
if
something
fascinate
he
;
and
she
feel
he
be
go
from
she
and
she
catch
he
by
the
arm
.
but
go
home
he
be
perfectly
quiet
--
perfectly
reasonable
.
he
would
argue
with
she
about
kill
themselves
;
and
explain
how
wicked
people
be
;
how
he
could
see
they
make
up
lie
as
they
pass
in
the
street
.
he
know
all
their
thought
,
he
say
;
he
know
everything
.
he
know
the
meaning
of
the
world
,
he
say
.




then
when
they
get
back
he
could
hardly
walk
.
he
lie
on
the
sofa
and
make
she
hold
his
hand
to
prevent
he
from
fall
down
,
down
,
he
cry
,
into
the
flame
!
and
see
face
laugh
at
he
,
call
he
horrible
disgusting
name
,
from
the
wall
,
and
hand
point
round
the
screen
.
yet
they
be
quite
alone
.
but
he
begin
to
talk
aloud
,
answer
people
,
argue
,
laugh
,
cry
,
get
very
excited
and
make
she
write
thing
down
.
perfect
nonsense
it
be
;
about
death
;
about
Miss
Isabel
Pole
.
she
could
stand
it
no
long
.
she
would
go
back
.




she
be
close
to
he
now
,
could
see
he
stare
at
the
sky
,
mutter
,
clasp
his
hand
.
yet
Dr.
Holmes
say
there
be
nothing
the
matter
with
he
.
what
then
have
happen
--
why
have
he
go
,
then
,
why
,
when
she
sit
by
he
,
do
he
start
,
frown
at
she
,
move
away
,
and
point
at
her
hand
,
take
her
hand
,
look
at
it
terrify
?




be
it
that
she
have
take
off
her
wedding
ring
?
"
my
hand
have
grow
so
thin
,
"
she
say
.
"
I
have
put
it
in
my
purse
,
"
she
tell
he
.




he
drop
her
hand
.
their
marriage
be
over
,

think
,
with
agony
,
with
relief
.
the
rope
be
cut
;
he
mount
;
he
be
free
,
as
it
be
decree
that
he
,
Septimus
,
the
lord
of
man
,
should
be
free
;
alone
(
since
his
wife
have
throw
away
her
wedding
ring
;
since
she
have
leave
he
)
,
he
,
Septimus
,
be
alone
,
call
forth
in
advance
of
the
mass
of
man
to
hear
the
truth
,
to
learn
the
meaning
,
which
now
at
last
,
after
all
the
toil
of
civilisation
--
Greeks
,
Romans
,
Shakespeare
,
Darwin
,
and
now
himself
--
be
to
be
give
whole
to
.
.
.
.
"
to
whom
?
"
he
ask
aloud
.
"
to
the
Prime
Minister
,
"
the
voice
which
rustle
above
his
head
reply
.
the
supreme
secret
must
be
tell
to
the
Cabinet
;
first
that
tree
be
alive
;
next
there
be
no
crime
;
next
love
,
universal
love
,
he
mutter
,
gasp
,
tremble
,
painfully
draw
out
these
profound
truth
which
need
,
so
deep
be
they
,
so
difficult
,
an
immense
effort
to
speak
out
,
but
the
world
be
entirely
change
by
they
for
ever
.




no
crime
;
love
;
he
repeat
,
fumble
for
his
card
and
pencil
,
when
a
Skye
terrier
snuff
his
trouser
and
he
start
in
an
agony
of
fear
.
it
be
turn
into
a
man
!
he
could
not
watch
it
happen
!
it
be
horrible
,
terrible
to
see
a
dog
become
a
man
!
at
once
the
dog
trot
away
.




Heaven
be
divinely
merciful
,
infinitely
benignant
.
it
spare
he
,
pardon
his
weakness
.
but
what
be
the
scientific
explanation
(
for
one
must
be
scientific
above
all
thing
)
?
why
could
he
see
through
body
,
see
into
the
future
,
when
dog
will
become
man
?
it
be
the
heat
wave
presumably
,
operate
upon
a
brain
make
sensitive
by
eon
of
evolution
.
scientifically
speak
,
the
flesh
be
melt
off
the
world
.
his
body
be
macerate
until
only
the
nerve
fibre
be
leave
.
it
be
spread
like
a
veil
upon
a
rock
.




he
lie
back
in
his
chair
,
exhausted
but
uphold
.
he
lie
rest
,
wait
,
before
he
again
interpret
,
with
effort
,
with
agony
,
to
mankind
.
he
lie
very
high
,
on

up
here

up

in
shock
of

that

)
and
become
an
anthem
,
an
anthem
twine
round

a
shepherd
boy

piping
(
that
be
an
old
man

,
as
the
boy
stand
still
come
bubble
from
his
pipe
,
and
then
,
as
he
climb
higher
,
make
its
exquisite
plaint
while
the
traffic
pass
beneath
.
this
boy
's
elegy
be
play
among
the
traffic
,
think
Septimus
.
now
he
withdraw
up
into
the
snow
,
and
rose
hang
about
he
--
the
thick
red
rose
which
grow
on

bedroom
wall

he
remind
himself
.
the
music
stop
.
he
have
his
penny
,
he
reason
it
out
,
and
have
go
on
to
the
next
public
-
house
.




but
he
himself
remain
high
on
his
rock
,
like
a
drown
sailor
on
a
rock
.
I
leant
over
the
edge
of
the
boat
and
fall
down
,
he
think
.
I
go
under
the
sea
.
I
have
be
dead
,
and
yet
be
now
alive
,

let
I
rest
still
;
he
beg
(

to
himself
again

awful
,
awful
!
)
;

as
,
before
wake
,
the
voice
of
bird
and
the
sound
of
wheel
chime
and
chatter
in
a
queer
harmony
,
grow
louder
and
louder
and
the
sleeper
feel
himself
draw
to
the
shore
of
life
,
so
he
feel
himself
draw
towards
life
,
the
sun
grow
hotter
,
cry
sound
louder
,
something
tremendous
about
to
happen
.

scene

in

middle
of
the
morning

what

about

wonder

what

get
themselves
into
,
both
to
look
so
desperate
as
that
on
a
fine
summer
morning
?
the
amusing
thing
about
come
back
to
England
,
after
five
year
,
be
the
way
it
make
,
anyhow
the

he

the
softness
of
the
distance
;
the
richness
;
the
greenness
;
the
civilisation
,
after
India
,
he
think
,
stroll
across
the
grass
.




this
susceptibility
to
impression
have
be
his
undo
no
doubt
.
still
at
his
age
he
have
,
like
a
boy
or
a
girl
even
,
these
alternation
of
mood
;
good
day
,
bad
day
,
for
no
reason
whatever
,
happiness
from
a
pretty

fall
in

there
be
a
freshness
about
they
;
even
the
poorest
dressed
well
than
five
year
ago
surely
;
and
to
his
eye
the
fashion
have
never
be
so
become
;
the
long
black
cloak
;
the
slimness
;
the
elegance
;
and
then
the
delicious
and
apparently
universal
habit
of
paint
.
every
woman
,
even
the
most
respectable
,
have
rose
bloom
under

what
do
the
young
people
think
about

Peter
Walsh
ask
himself
.




those
five
years--1918
to
1923
-
-had
be
,
he
suspect
,
somehow
very
important
.
People
look
different
.
newspaper
seem
different
.
now
for
instance
there
be
a
man
write
quite
openly
in
one
of
the
respectable
weekly
about
water
-
closet
.
that
you
could
n't
have
do
ten
year
ago
--
write
quite
openly
about
water
-
closet
in
a
respectable
weekly
.
and
then
this
take
out
a
stick
of
rouge
,
or
a
powder
-
puff
and
make
up
in
public
.
on
board
ship
come
home
there
be
lot
of
young
man

girl
--
Betty
and
Bertie

remember
in
particular
--
carry
on
quite
openly
;
the
old
mother
sit
and
watch
they
with
her
knitting
,
cool
as
a
cucumber
.
the
girl
would
stand
still
and
powder
her
nose
in
front
of
every
one
.
and
they
be
n't
engage
;
just
have
a
good
time
;
no
feeling
hurt
on
either
side

as
hard
as

Betty
what'shername--
;
but
a
thorough
good
sort
.
she
would
make
a
very
good
wife
at
thirty

she
would
marry
when
it
suit
she
to
marry
;
marry
some
rich
man

who
be
it
now

have
do
that

Peter

ask
himself
,
turn
into
the
Broad
walk,--marrie
a
rich
man
and
live
in
a
large

quite
lately
about

blue

blue

make
she
think
of
he
and
the
old
day
--
Sally
Seton
,
of
course
!
it
be
Sally
Seton
--
the
last
person
in
the
world
one
would
have
expect
to
marry
a
rich
man
and
live
in
a
large
house
near
Manchester
,
the
wild
,
the
daring
,
the
romantic
Sally
!




but
of
all
that
ancient
lot
,
Clarissa
's
friend
--
Whitbreads
,
Kinderleys
,
Cunninghams
,
Kinloch
-
Jones's
--
Sally
be
probably
the
good
.
she
try
to
get
hold
of
thing
by
the
right
end
anyhow
.
she
see
through
Hugh
Whitbread
anyhow
--
the
admirable
Hugh
--
when
Clarissa
and
the
rest
be
at
his
foot
.




"
the
Whitbreads
?
"
he
could
hear
she
say
.
"
who
be
the
Whitbreads
?
coal
merchant
.
respectable
tradespeople
.
"




Hugh
she
detest
for
some
reason
.
he
think
of
nothing
but
his
own
appearance
,
she
say
.
he
ought
to
have
be
a
Duke
.
he
would
be
certain
to
marry
one
of
the
Royal
Princesses
.
and
of
course
Hugh
have
the
most
extraordinary
,
the
most
natural
,
the
most
sublime
respect
for
the
british
aristocracy
of
any
human
being
he
have
ever
come
across
.
even
Clarissa
have
to
own
that
.
oh
,
but
he
be
such
a
dear
,
so
unselfish
,
give
up
shoot
to
please
his
old
mother
--
remember
his
aunt
'
birthday
,
and
so
on
.




Sally
,
to
do
her
justice
,
see
through
all
that
.
one
of
the
thing
he
remember
well
be
an
argument
one
Sunday
morning
at
Bourton
about
woman

right
(
that
antediluvian
topic
)
,
when
Sally
suddenly
lose
her
temper
,
flare
up
,
and
tell
Hugh
that
he
represent
all
that
be
most
detestable
in
british
middle

class
life
.
she
tell
he
that
she
consider
he
responsible
for
the
state
of
"

perfect
gentleman
,
poor
Hugh!--never
do
a
man

more
horrified
!
she
do
it
on
purpose
she
say
afterwards
(
for
they
use
to
get
together
in
the
vegetable
garden
and
compare
note
)
.
"

read
nothing
,

nothing
,

he
could
hear
she

in
that
very
emphatic
voice
which
carry
so
much
far
than
she
know

stable
boy
have
more
life
in

than
Hugh
,
she
say
.

be
a
perfect
speciman
of
the
public
school
type

he
.
she
be
really
spiteful
,
for
some
reason
;
have
some
grudge
against
he
.
something
have
happen
--
he
forget
what
--
in
the
smoking
-
room
.
he
have
insult
she
--
kiss
she
?
incredible
!
nobody
believe
a
word
against
Hugh
of
course
.
who
could
?
Kissing
Sally
in
the
smoking
-
room
!
if
it
have
be
some
honourable
Edith
or
Lady
Violet
,
perhaps
;
but
not
that
ragamuffin
Sally
without
a
penny
to
her
name
,
and
a
father
or
a
mother
gambling
at
Monte
Carlo
.
for
of
all
the
people
he
have
ever
meet
Hugh
be
the
great
snob
--
the
most
obsequious
--
no
,
he
do
n't
cringe
exactly
.
he
be
too
much
of
a
prig
for
that
.
a
first
-
rate
valet
be
the
obvious
comparison
--
somebody
who
walk
behind
carry
suit
case
;
could
be
trust
to
send
telegram
--
indispensable
to
hostess
.
and
he
'd
find
his
job
--
marry
his
honourable
Evelyn
;
get
some
little
post
at
Court
,
look
after
the
King
's
cellar
,
polish
the
imperial
shoe
-
buckle
,
go
about
in
knee
-
breech
and
lace
ruffle
.
how
remorseless
life
be
!
a
little
job
at
Court
!




he
have
marry
this
lady
,
the
honourable
Evelyn
,
and
they
live
hereabouts
,
so
he
think
(
look
at
the
pompous
house
overlook
the
Park
)
,
for
he
have
lunch
there
once
in
a
house
which
have
,
like
all
Hugh
's
possession
,
something
that
no
other
house
could
possibly
have
--
linen
cupboard
it
might
have
be
.
you
have
to
go
and
look
at
they
--
you
have
to
spend
a
great
deal
of
time
always
admire
whatever
it
be
--
linen
cupboard
,
pillow
-
case
,
old
oak
furniture
,
picture
,
which
Hugh
have
pick
up
for
an
old
song
.
but
Mrs.
Hugh
sometimes
give
the
show
away
.
she
be
one
of
those
obscure
mouse
-
like
little
woman
who
admire
big
man
.
she
be
almost
negligible
.
then
suddenly
she
would
say
something
quite
unexpected
--
something
sharp
.
she
have
the
relic
of
the
grand
manner
perhaps
.
the
steam
coal
be
a
little
too
strong
for
she
--
it
make
the
atmosphere
thick
.
and
so
there
they
live
,
with
their
linen
cupboard
and
their
old
master
and
their
pillow
-
case
fringe
with
real
lace
at
the
rate
of
five
or
ten
thousand
a
year
presumably
,
while
he
,
who
be
two
year
old
than
Hugh
,
cadge
for
a
job
.




at
fifty
-
three
he
have
to
come
and
ask
they
to
put
he
into
some
secretary
's
office
,
to
find
he
some
usher
's
job
teach
little
boy
latin
,
at
the
beck
and
call
of
some
mandarin
in
an
office
,
something
that
bring
in
five
hundred
a
year
;
for
if
he
marry
Daisy
,
even
with
his
pension
,
they
could
never
do
on
less
.
Whitbread
could
do
it
presumably
;
or
Dalloway
.
he
do
n't
mind
what
he
ask
Dalloway
.
he
be
a
thorough
good
sort
;
a
bit
limited
;
a
bit
thick
in
the
head
;
yes
;
but
a
thorough
good
sort
.
whatever
he
take
up
he
do
in
the
same
matter
-
of
-
fact
sensible
way
;
without
a
touch
of
imagination
,
without
a
spark
of
brilliancy
,
but
with
the
inexplicable
niceness
of
his
type
.
he
ought
to
have
be
a
country
gentleman
--
he
be
waste
on
politic
.
he
be
at
his
good
out
of
door
,
with
horse
and
dog
--
how
good
he
be
,
for
instance
,
when
that
great
shaggy
dog
of
Clarissa
's
got
catch
in
a
trap
and
have
its
paw
half
tear
off
,
and
Clarissa
turn
faint
and
Dalloway
do
the
whole
thing
;
bandaged
,
make
splint
;
tell
Clarissa
not
to
be
a
fool
.
that
be
what
she
like
he
for
perhaps
--
that
be
what
she
need
.
"
now
,
my
dear
,
do
n't
be
a
fool
.
hold
this
--
fetch
that
,
"
all
the
time
talk
to
the
dog
as
if
it
be
a
human
being
.




but
how
could
she
swallow
all
that
stuff
about
poetry
?
how
could
she
let
he
hold
forth
about
Shakespeare
?
seriously
and
solemnly
Richard
Dalloway
get
on
his
hind
leg
and
say
that
no
decent
man
ought
to
read
Shakespeare
's
sonnet
because
it
be
like
listen
at
keyhole
(
besides
the
relationship
be
not
one
that
he
approve
)
.
no
decent
man
ought
to
let
his
wife
visit
a
deceased
wife
's
sister
.
incredible
!
the
only
thing
to
do
be
to
pelt
he
with
sugar
almond
--
it
be
at
dinner
.
but
Clarissa
suck
it
all
in
;
think
it
so
honest
of
he
;
so
independent
of
he
;
Heaven
know
if
she
do
n't
think
he
the
most
original
mind
she
'd
ever
meet
!




that
be
one
of
the
bond
between
Sally
and
himself
.
there
be
a
garden
where
they
use
to
walk
,
a
wall
-
in
place
,
with
rose
-
bush
and
giant
cauliflower
--
he
could
remember
Sally
tear
off
a
rose
,
stop
to
exclaim
at
the
beauty
of
the
cabbage
leave
in
the
moonlight
(
it
be
extraordinary
how
vividly
it
all
come
back
to
he
,
thing
he
have
n't
think
of
for
year
,
)
while
she
implore
he
,
half
laugh
of
course
,
to
carry
off
Clarissa
,
to
save
she
from
the
Hughs
and
the
Dalloways
and
all
the
other
"
perfect
gentleman
"
who
would
"
stifle
her
soul
"
(
she
write
ream
of
poetry
in
those
day
)
,
make
a
mere
hostess
of
she
,
encourage
her
worldliness
.
but
one
must
do
Clarissa
justice
.
she
be
n't
go
to
marry
Hugh
anyhow
.
she
have
a
perfectly
clear
notion
of
what
she
want
.
her
emotion
be
all
on
the
surface
.
beneath
,
she
be
very
shrewd
--
a
far
well
judge
of
character
than
Sally
,
for
instance
,
and
with
it
all
,
purely
feminine
;
with
that
extraordinary
gift
,
that
woman
's
gift
,
of
make
a
world
of
her
own
wherever
she
happen
to
be
.
she
come
into
a
room
;
she
stand
,
as
he
have
often
see
she
,
in
a
doorway
with
lot
of
people
round
she
.
but
it
be
Clarissa
one
remember
.
not
that
she
be
strike
;
not
beautiful
at
all
;
there
be
nothing
picturesque
about
she
;
she
never
say
anything
specially
clever
;
there
she
be
,
however
;
there
she
be
.




no
,
no
,
no
!
he
be
not
in
love
with
she
any
more
!
he
only
feel
,
after
see
she
that
morning
,
among
her
scissor
and
silk
,
make
ready
for
the
party
,
unable
to
get
away
from
the
thought
of
she
;
she
keep
come
back
and
back
like
a
sleeper
jolting
against
he
in
a
railway
carriage
;
which
be
not
be
in
love
,
of
course
;
it
be
think
of
she
,
criticise
she
,
start
again
,
after
thirty
year
,
try
to
explain
she
.
the
obvious
thing
to
say
of
she
be
that
she
be
worldly
;
care
too
much
for
rank
and
society
and
get
on
in
the
world
--
which
be
true
in
a
sense
;
she
have
admit
it
to
he
.
(
you
could
always
get
she
to
own
up
if
you
take
the
trouble
;
she
be
honest
.
)
what
she
would
say
be
that
she
hate
frump
,
fogy
,
failure
,
like
himself
presumably
;
think
people
have
no
right
to
slouch
about
with
their
hand
in
their
pocket
;
must
do
something
,
be
something
;
and
these
great
swell
,
these
Duchesses
,
these
hoary
old
Countesses
one
meet
in
her
drawing
-
room
,
unspeakably
remote
as
he
feel
they
to
be
from
anything
that
matter
a
straw
,
stand
for
something
real
to
she
.
Lady
Bexborough
,
she
say
once
,
hold
herself
upright
(
so
do
Clarissa
herself
;
she
never
lounge
in
any
sense
of
the
word
;
she
be
straight
as
a
dart
,
a
little
rigid
in
fact
)
.
she
say
they
have
a
kind
of
courage
which
the
old
she
grow
the
more
she
respect
.
in
all
this
there
be
a
great
deal
of
Dalloway
,
of
course
;
a
great
deal
of
the
public
-
spirited
,
British
Empire
,
tariff
-
reform
,
governing
-
class
spirit
,
which
have
grow
on
she
,
as
it
tend
to
do
.
with
twice
his
wit
,
she
have
to
see
thing
through
his
eye
--
one
of
the
tragedy
of
married
life
.
with
a
mind
of
her
own
,
she
must
always
be
quote
Richard
--
as
if
one
could
n't
know
to
a
tittle
what
Richard
think
by
read
the
Morning
Post
of
a
morning
!
these
party
for
example
be
all
for
he
,
or
for
her
idea
of
he
(
to
do
Richard
justice
he
would
have
be
happy
farming
in
Norfolk
)
.
she
make
her
drawing
-
room
a
sort
of
meeting
-
place
;
she
have
a
genius
for
it
.
over
and
over
again
he
have
see
she
take
some
raw
youth
,
twist
he
,
turn
he
,
wake
he
up
;
set
he
go
.
infinite
number
of
dull
people
conglomerate
round
she
of
course
.
but
odd
unexpected
people
turn
up
;
an
artist
sometimes
;
sometimes
a
writer
;
queer
fish
in
that
atmosphere
.
and
behind
it
all
be
that
network
of
visit
,
leave
card
,
be
kind
to
people
;
run
about
with
bunche
of
flower
,
little
present
;
so
-
and
-
so
be
go
to
France
--
must
have
an
air
-
cushion
;
a
real
drain
on
her
strength
;
all
that
interminable
traffic
that
woman
of
her
sort
keep
up
;
but
she
do
it
genuinely
,
from
a
natural
instinct
.




oddly
enough
,
she
be
one
of
the
most
thoroughgoing
sceptic
he
have
ever
meet
,
and
possibly
(
this
be
a
theory
he
use
to
make
up
to
account
for
she
,
so
transparent
in
some
way
,
so
inscrutable
in
other
)
,
possibly
she
say
to
herself
,
as
we
be
a
doomed
race
,
chain
to
a
sink
ship
(
her
favourite
reading
as
a
girl
be
Huxley
and
Tyndall
,
and
they
be
fond
of
these
nautical
metaphor
)
,
as
the
whole
thing
be
a
bad
joke
,
let
we
,
at
any
rate
,
do
our
part
;
mitigate
the
suffering
of
our
fellow
-
prisoner
(
Huxley
again
)
;
decorate
the
dungeon
with
flower
and
air
-
cushion
;
be
as
decent
as
we
possibly
can
.
those
ruffian
,
the
Gods
,
sha
n't
have
it
all
their
own
way,--her
notion
be
that
the
Gods
,
who
never
lose
a
chance
of
hurt
,
thwart
and
spoil
human
life
be
seriously
put
out
if
,
all
the
same
,
you
behave
like
a
lady
.
that
phase
come
directly
after
Sylvia
's
death
--
that
horrible
affair
.
to
see
your
own
sister
kill
by
a
fall
tree
(
all
Justin
Parry
's
fault
--
all
his
carelessness
)
before
your
very
eye
,
a
girl
too
on
the
verge
of
life
,
the
most
gifted
of
they
,
Clarissa
always
say
,
be
enough
to
turn
one
bitter
.
later
she
be
n't
so
positive
perhaps
;
she
think
there
be
no
Gods
;
no
one
be
to
blame
;
and
so
she
evolve
this
atheist
's
religion
of
do
good
for
the
sake
of
goodness
.




and
of
course
she
enjoy
life
immensely
.
it
be
her
nature
to
enjoy
(
though
goodness
only
know
,
she
have
her
reserve
;
it
be
a
mere
sketch
,
he
often
feel
,
that
even
he
,
after
all
these
year
,
could
make
of
Clarissa
)
.
anyhow
there
be
no
bitterness
in
she
;
none
of
that
sense
of
moral
virtue
which
be
so
repulsive
in
good
woman
.
she
enjoy
practically
everything
.
if
you
walk
with
she
in
Hyde
Park
now
it
be
a
bed
of
tulip
,
now
a
child
in
a
perambulator
,
now
some
absurd
little
drama
she
make
up
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
.
(
very
likely
,
she
would
have
talk
to
those
lover
,
if
she
have
think
they
unhappy
.
)
she
have
a
sense
of
comedy
that
be
really
exquisite
,
but
she
need
people
,
always
people
,
to
bring
it
out
,
with
the
inevitable
result
that
she
fritter
her
time
away
,
lunching
,
dining
,
give
these
incessant
party
of
hers
,
talk
nonsense
,
saying
thing
she
do
n't
mean
,
blunt
the
edge
of
her
mind
,
lose
her
discrimination
.
there
she
would
sit
at
the
head
of
the
table
take
infinite
pain
with
some
old
buffer
who
might
be
useful
to
Dalloway
--
they
know
the
most
appalling
bore
in
Europe
--
or
in
come
Elizabeth
and
everything
must
give
way
to
she
.
she
be
at
a
High
School
,
at
the
inarticulate
stage
last
time
he
be
over
,
a
round
-
eyed
,
pale
-
faced
girl
,
with
nothing
of
her
mother
in
she
,
a
silent
stolid
creature
,
who
take
it
all
as
a
matter
of
course
,
let
her
mother
make
a
fuss
of
she
,
and
then
say
"
may
I
go
now
?
"
like
a
child
of
four
;
go
off
,
Clarissa
explain
,
with
that
mixture
of
amusement
and
pride
which
dalloway
himself
seem
to
rouse
in
she
,
to
play
hockey
.
and
now
Elizabeth
be
"
out
,
"
presumably
;
think
he
an
old
fogy
,
laugh
at
her
mother
's
friend
.
ah
well
,
so
be
it
.
the
compensation
of
grow
old
,
Peter
Walsh
think
,
come
out
of
Regent
's
Park
,
and
hold
his
hat
in
hand
,
be
simply
this
;
that
the
passion
remain
as
strong
as
ever
,
but
one
have
gain
--
at
last!--the
power
which
add
the
supreme
flavour
to
existence,--the
power
of
take
hold
of
experience
,
of
turn
it
round
,
slowly
,
in
the
light
.




a
terrible
confession
it
be
(
he
put
his
hat
on
again
)
,
but
now
,
at
the
age
of
fifty
-
three
one
scarcely
need
people
any
more
.
life
itself
,
every
moment
of
it
,
every
drop
of
it
,
here
,
this
instant
,
now
,
in
the
sun
,
in
Regent
's
Park
,
be
enough
.
too
much
indeed
.
a
whole
lifetime
be
too
short
to
bring
out
,
now
that
one
have
acquire
the
power
,
the
full
flavour
;
to
extract
every
ounce
of
pleasure
,
every
shade
of
meaning
;
which
both
be
so
much
more
solid
than
they
use
to
be
,
so
much
less
personal
.
it
be
impossible
that
he
should
ever
suffer
again
as
Clarissa
have
make
he
suffer
.
for
hour
at
a
time
(
pray
God
that
one
might
say
these
thing
without
be
overhear
!
)
,
for
hour
and
day
he
never
think
of
Daisy
.




could
it
be
that
he
be
in
love
with
she
then
,
remember
the
misery
,
the
torture
,
the
extraordinary
passion
of
those
day
?
it
be
a
different
thing
altogether
--
a
much
pleasanter
thing
--
the
truth
being
,
of
course
,
that
now
she
be
in
love
with
he
.
and
that
perhaps
be
the
reason
why
,
when
the
ship
actually
sail
,
he
feel
an
extraordinary
relief
,
want
nothing
so
much
as
to
be
alone
;
be
annoyed
to
find
all
her
little
attention
--
cigar
,
note
,
a
rug
for
the
voyage
--
in
his
cabin
.
every
one
if
they
be
honest
would
say
the
same
;
one
do
n't
want
people
after
fifty
;
one
do
n't
want
to
go
on
tell
woman
they
be
pretty
;
that
be
what
most
man
of
fifty
would
say
,
Peter
Walsh
think
,
if
they
be
honest
.




but
then
these
astonishing
access
of
emotion
--
burst
into
tear
this
morning
,
what
be
all
that
about
?
what
could
Clarissa
have
think
of
he
?
think
he
a
fool
presumably
,
not
for
the
first
time
.
it
be
jealousy
that
be
at
the
bottom
of
it
--
jealousy
which
survive
every
other
passion
of
mankind
,
Peter
Walsh
think
,
hold
his
pocket
-
knife
at
arm
's
length
.
she
have
be
meet
Major
Orde
,
Daisy
say
in
her
last
letter
;
say
it
on
purpose
he
know
;
say
it
to
make
he
jealous
;
he
could
see
she
wrinkle
her
forehead
as
she
write
,
wonder
what
she
could
say
to
hurt
he
;
and
yet
it
make
no
difference
;
he
be
furious
!
all
this
pother
of
come
to
England
and
see
lawyer
be
n't
to
marry
she
,
but
to
prevent
she
from
marry
anybody
else
.
that
be
what
torture
he
,
that
be
what
come
over
he
when
he
see
Clarissa
so
calm
,
so
cold
,
so
intent
on
her
dress
or
whatever
it
be
;
realise
what
she
might
have
spare
he
,
what
she
have
reduce
he
to
--
a
whimpering
,
snivel
old
ass
.
but
woman
,
he
think
,
shut
his
pocket
-
knife
,
do
n't
know
what
passion
be
.
they
do
n't
know
the
meaning
of
it
to
man
.
Clarissa
be
as
cold
as
an
icicle
.
there
she
would
sit
on
the
sofa
by
his
side
,
let
he
take
her
hand
,
give
he
one
kiss
--
here
he
be
at
the
crossing
.




a
sound
interrupt
he
;
a
frail
quiver
sound
,
a
voice
bubble
up
without
direction
,
vigour
,
beginning
or
end
,
run
weakly
and
shrilly
and
with
an
absence
of
all
human
meaning
into




 



ee
um
fah
um
so


foo
swee
too
eem
oo--




 



the
voice
of
no
age
or
sex
,
the
voice
of
an
ancient
spring
spouting
from
the
earth
;
which
issue
,
just
opposite
Regent
's
Park
Tube
station
from
a
tall
quiver
shape
,
like
a
funnel
,
like
a
rusty
pump
,
like
a
wind
-
beat
tree
for
ever
barren
of
leave
which
let
the
wind
run
up
and
down
its
branch

and
rock
and
creak
and
moan
in
the
eternal
breeze
.




through
all
age
--
when
the
pavement
be
grass
,
when
it
be
swamp
,
through
the
age
of
tusk
and
mammoth
,
through
the
age
of
silent
sunrise
,
the
batter
woman
--
for
she
wear
a
skirt
--
with
her
right
hand
expose
,

her

of
love
--
love
which
have
last
a
million
year
,
she
sing
,
love
which
prevail
,
and
million
of
year
ago
,
her
lover
,
who
have
be
dead
these
century
,
have
walk
,
she
croon
,
with
she
in
May
;
but
in
the
course
of
age
,
long
as
summer
day
,
and
flame
,
she
remember
,
with
nothing
but
red
aster
,
he
have
go
;
death
's
enormous
sickle
have
sweep
those
tremendous
hill
,
and
when
at
last
she
lay
her
hoary
and
immensely
aged
head
on
the
earth
,
now
become
a
mere
cinder
of
ice
,
she
implore
the
Gods
to
lay
by
her
side
a
bunch
of
purple
-
heather
,
there
on
her
high
burial
place
which
the
last
ray
of
the
last
sun
caress
;
for
then
the
pageant
of
the
universe
would
be
over
.




as
the
ancient
song
bubble
up
opposite
Regent
's
Park
Tube
station
still
the
earth
seem
green
and
flowery
;
still
,

it
issue
from
so
rude
a
mouth
,
a
mere
hole
in
the
earth
,
muddy
too
,
mat
with
root
fibre
and
tangle
grass
,
still
the
old
bubble
burbling
song
,
soak
through
the
knotted
root
of
infinite
age
,
and
skeleton
and
treasure
,
stream
away
in
rivulet
over
the
pavement
and
all
along
the
Marylebone
Road
,
and
down
towards
Euston
,
fertilise
,
leave
a
damp
stain
.




still
remember
how
once
in
some
primeval
may
she
have
walk
with
her
lover
,
this
rusty
pump
,
this
batter
old
woman
with
one
hand
expose
for
copper
the
other
clutch
her
side
,
would
still
be
there
in
ten
million
year
,
remember
how
once
she
have
walk
in
May
,
where
the
sea
flow
now
,
with
whom
it
do
not

he
be
a
man
,
oh
yes
,
a
man
who
have
love
she

the
passage
of
age

blur
the
clarity
of
that
ancient
May
day

the
bright
petalle
flower

silver
frost

be
,
moreover
,
the
happy
man
in
the
world
,
and
the
most
miserable
?
perhaps
they
walk
more
slowly
than
other
people
,
and
there
be
something
hesitate
,
trail
,
in
the
man
's
walk
,
but
what
more
natural
for
a
clerk
,
who
have
not
be
in
the
West
End
on
a
weekday
at
this
hour
for
year
,
than
to
keep
look
at
the
sky
,
look
at
this
,
that
and
the
other
,
as
if
Portland
Place
be
a
room
he
have
come
into
when
the
family
be
away
,
the

be
hang
in
holland
bag
,
and
the
caretaker
,
as
she
let
in
long
shaft
of
dusty
light
upon
desert
,
queer
-
look
armchair
,
lift
one
corner
of
the
long
blind
,
explain
to
the
visitor
what
a
wonderful
place
it
be
;
how
wonderful
,
but
at
the
same
time
,
he
think
,
as
he
look
at
chair
and
table
,
how
strange
.




to
look
at
,
he
might
have
be
a
clerk
,
but
of
the
well
sort
;
for
he
wear
brown
boot
;
his
hand
be
educate
;
so
,
too
,
his
profile
--
his
angular
,
big
-
nosed
,
intelligent
,
sensitive
profile
;
but
not
his
lip
altogether
,
for
they
be
loose
;
and
his
eye
(
as
eye
tend
to
be

,
eye
merely
;
hazel
,
large
;
so
that

,
on
the
whole
,
a
border
case
,
neither
one
thing
nor
the
other
,

end
with
a
house
at
Purley

for
the

solitary
one
,
which
people
go
through
alone
,
in
their

because
he
come
down
to
tea
for
the
fiftieth
time
with
his

unwashed
;
because
he
could
see
no
future
for
a
poet
in
Stroud
;
and
so
,
make
a
confidant
of

a
pink
innocent
oval

of
all
this
what
could
the

observant
of

how
she

over

paternal
with
his

very
highly
of
Smith

prophesy
that
he

,
in

of

insidious
be

smash
a

,
the
young
of
the
two
,
the
gay
,
the
frivolous
,
with
those
little
artist
's

Ill

dressing

dressing
she
stigmatise
,
not
savagely
,
rather
with
impatient
movement
of
the
hand
,
like
those
of
a
painter
who
put
from
he
some
obvious
well
-
mean
glaring
imposture
;
and
then
,
generously
,
but
always
critically
,
she
would
welcome
a
shopgirl
who
have
turn
she
little
bit
of
stuff
gallantly
,
or
praise
,
wholly
,
with
enthusiastic
and
professional
understanding
,
a
french
lady
descend
from
her
carriage
,
in
chinchilla
,
robe
,
pearl
.




"
beautiful
!
"
she
would
murmur
,
nudging
Septimus
,
that
he
might
see
.
but
beauty
be
behind
a
pane
of
glass
.
even
taste
(
Rezia
like
ice
,
chocolate
,
sweet
thing
)
have
no
relish
to
he
.
he
put
down
his
cup
on
the
little
marble
table
.
he
look
at
people
outside
;
happy
they
seem
,
collect
in
the
middle
of
the
street
,
shout
,
laugh
,
squabble
over
nothing
.
but
he
could
not
taste
,
he
could
not
feel
.
in
the
tea
-
shop
among
the
table
and
the
chatter
waiter
the
appalling
fear
come
over
he
--
he
could
not
feel
.
he
could
reason
;
he
could
read
,
Dante
for
example
,
quite
easily
(
"
Septimus
,
do
put
down
your
book
,
"
say
Rezia
,
gently
shut
the
Inferno
)
,
he
could
add
up
his
bill
;
his
brain
be
perfect
;
it
must
be
the
fault
of
the
world
then
--
that
he
could
not
feel
.




"
the
English
be
so
silent
,
"
Rezia
say
.
she
like
it
,
she
say
.
she
respect
these
Englishmen
,
and
want
to
see
London
,
and
the
english
horse
,
and
the
tailor
-
make
suit
,

could
remember
hear
how
wonderful
the
shop
be
,
from
an
aunt
who
have
marry
and
live
in
Soho
.




it
might
be
possible
,
Septimus
think
,
look
at
England
from
the
train
window
,
as
they
leave
Newhaven
;
it
might
be
possible
that
the
world
itself
be
without
meaning
.




at
the
office
they
advance
he
to
a
post
of
considerable
responsibility
.
they
be
proud
of

"

"
begin
Mr.
Brewer
;

could
not
finish
,
so
pleasurable
be
his
emotion
.
they
take
admirable
lodging
off
the
Tottenham

.




one
can
not
bring

a
world
like

;
only
each
time
she

in
this
profound
,
this
silent
,
this
hopeless
way
,
he
descend
another
step
into
the
pit
.




at
last
,
with
a
melodramatic
gesture
which
he
assume
mechanically
and
with
complete
consciousness
of
its
insincerity
,
he
drop
his
head
on
his
hand
.
now

People

oh
,
what
a
relief
!
what
a

Dr.
Holmes
.
he
take
a
day
off

.
why
not
try
two
tabloid
of
bromide
dissolve
in
a
glass
of
water
at
bedtime
?
these
old
Bloomsbury
house
,
say
Dr.
Holmes
,
tap
the
wall
,
be
often
full
of
very
fine
panelling
,
which
the

.
only
the
other
day
,
visit
a
patient
,
Sir
Somebody
something
in
Bedford
square--




so
there
be
no
excuse
;
nothing
whatever
the
matter
,

the
sin
for
which
human
nature
have
condemn
he
to
death
;
that
he
do
not
feel
.
he
have
not
care
when
Evans
be
kill
;
that
be
bad
;
but
all
the
other
crime
raise
their
head
and
shake
their
finger
and
jeered
and
sneer
over
the
rail
of
the
bed
in
the
early
hour
of
the
morning
at
the
prostrate
body

degradation
;
how
he
have

without
love
she
;
have
lie
to
she
;
seduce
she
;
outrage
Miss
Isabel

and
be
so
pocked
and
mark
with
vice
that
woman
shudder
when
they
see
he
in
the
street
.
the
verdict
of
human
nature
on
such
a
wretch
be
death
.




Dr.

headache
,
sleeplessness
,
fear
,
dream
--
nerve
symptom
and
nothing
more
,
he
say
.
if
Dr.
Holmes

himself
even
half
a
pound
below
eleven
stone
six
,
he
ask
his

another
plate
of

.
)
but
,
he
continue
,

largely
a
matter
in
our

up
some

Antony
and
Cleopatra
;
push
Shakespeare
aside
.
some
hobby
,
say
Dr.
Holmes
,
for
do
he
not
owe
his
own
excellent
health
(
and
he
work
as
hard
as
any
man
in
London
)
to
the
fact
that
he
could
always
switch
off
from
his
patient
on
to
old
furniture
?
and
what
a
very
pretty
comb
,
if
he
might
say
so
,
Mrs.
Warren
Smith
be

refuse
to
see
he
.
do
he
indeed
?
say
Dr.
Holmes
,
smile
agreeably
.
really
he
have
to
give
that
charming
little
lady
,
Mrs.
Smith
,
a
friendly
push
before
he
could
get
past
she
into
her
husband
's
bedroom
.




"
so
you
be
in
a
funk
,
"
he
say
agreeably
,
sit
down
by
his
patient
's
side
.
he
have
actually
talk
of
kill
himself
to
his
wife
,
quite
a
girl
,
a
foreigner
,
be
n't
she
?
do
n't
that
give
she
a
very
odd
idea
of
english
husband
?
do
n't
one
owe
perhaps
a
duty
to
one
's
wife
?
would
n't
it
be
well
to
do
something
instead
of
lie
in
bed
?
for
he
have
have
forty
year
'
experience
behind
he
;
and
Septimus
could
take
Dr.
Holmes
's
word
for
it
--
there
be
nothing
whatever
the
matter
with
he
.
and
next
time
Dr.
Holmes
come
he
hope
to
find
Smith
out
of
bed
and
not
make
that
charming
little
lady
his
wife
anxious
about
he
.




human
nature
,
in
short
,
be
on
he
--
the
repulsive
brute
,
with
the
blood
-
red
nostril
.
Holmes
be
on
he
.
Dr.
Holmes
come
quite
regularly
every
day
.
once
you
stumble
,
Septimus
write
on
the
back
of
a
postcard
,
human
nature
be
on
you
.
holme
be
on
you
.
their
only
chance

to
Italy
--
anywhere
,
anywhere
,
away
from
Dr.
Holmes
.




but
Rezia
could
not
understand
he
.
Dr.
Holmes
be
such
a
kind
man
.
he
be
so
interested

little
child

he
have
ask
she
to
tea

tell
Septimus

so
he
be
deserted
.
the
whole
world
be
clamour
:
kill
yourself
,
kill
yourself
,
for
our
sake
.
but
why
should
he
kill
himself
for
their
sake
?
food
be
pleasant
;
the
sun
hot
;
and
this
kill
oneself
,
how
do
one
set
about
it
,
with
a
table
knife
,
uglily
,
with
flood
of
blood,--by
suck
a
gaspipe
?
he
be
too
weak
;
he
could
scarcely
raise
his
hand
.
besides
,
now
that
he
be
quite
alone
,
condemn
,
desert
,
as
those
who
be
about
to
die

alone
,
there
be
a
luxury
in
it
,
an
isolation
full
of
sublimity
;
a
freedom
which
the
attach
can
never

even

not

of
the

this
outcast
,

only
as
the
evening
wear
on
a
very
slight
dulness
,
or
uneasiness
perhaps
,
a
nervous
twitch
,
fumble
,
stumble
and
confusion
indicate
,
what
it
be
really
painful
to

that
the
poor
lady
lie
.
once
,
long
ago
,
she
have
catch
salmon
freely
:
now
,
quick
to
minister
to
the
craving
which
light
her
husband
's
eye
so
oilily
for
dominion
,
for
power
,
she
cramp
,
squeeze
,
pare
,
prune
,
draw
back
,
peep
through
;
so
that
without
know
precisely
what
make
the
evening
disagreeable
,
and
cause
this
pressure
on
the
top
of
the
head
(
which
might
well
be
impute
to
the
professional
conversation
,

the
fatigue
of
a
great
doctor

life
,
Lady

say
,
"
be
not
his
own

his

disagreeable
it
be
:
so
that
guest
,
when
the
clock
strike
ten
,
breathe
in
the
air
of
Harley
Street
even
with
rapture
;
which
relief
,
however
,
be
deny
to
his
patient
.




there
in
the
grey
room
,
with
the
picture
on
the
wall
,
and
the
valuable
furniture
,
under
the
ground
glass
skylight
,
they
learn
the
extent
of
their
transgression
;
huddle
up
in
arm
-
chair
,
they
watch
he
go
through
,
for
their
benefit
,
a
curious
exercise
with
the
arm
,
which
he
shoot
out
,
bring
sharply
back
to
his
hip
,
to
prove
(
if
the
patient
be
obstinate
)
that
Sir
William
be
master
of
his
own
action
,
which
the
patient
be
not
.
there
some
weakly
break
down
;
sob
,
submit
;
other
,
inspire
by
Heaven
know
what
intemperate
madness
,
call
Sir
William
to
his
face
a
damnable
humbug
;
question
,
even
more
impiously
,
life
itself
.
why
live
?
they
demand
.
Sir
William
reply
that
life
be
good
.
certainly
Lady
Bradshaw
in
ostrich
feather
hang
over
the
mantelpiece
,
and
as
for
his
income
it
be
quite
twelve
thousand
a
year
.
but
to
we
,
they
protest
,
life
have
give
no
such
bounty
.
he
acquiesce
.
they
lack
a
sense
of
proportion
.
and
perhaps
,
after
all
,
there
be
no
God
?
he
shrug
his
shoulder
.
in
short
,
this
living
or
not
live
be
an
affair
of
our
own
?
but
there
they
be
mistaken
.
Sir
William
have
a
friend
in
Surrey
where
they
teach
,
what
Sir
William
frankly
admit
be
a
difficult
art
--
a
sense
of
proportion
.
there
be
,
moreover
,
family
affection
;
honour
;
courage
;
and
a
brilliant
career
.
all
of
these
have
in
Sir
William
a
resolute
champion
.
if
they
fail
he
,
he
have
to
support
police
and
the
good
of
society
,
which
,
he
remark
very
quietly
,
would
take
care
,
down
in
Surrey
,
that
these
unsocial
impulse
,
breed
more
than
anything
by
the
lack
of
good
blood
,
be
hold
in
control
.
and
then
steal
out
from
her
hiding
-
place
and
mount
her
throne
that
Goddess
whose
lust
be
to
override
opposition
,
to
stamp
indelibly
in
the
sanctuary
of
other
the
image
of
herself
.
naked
,
defenceless
,
the
exhausted
,
the
friendless
receive
the
impress
of
Sir
William
's
will
.
he
swoop
;
he
devour
.
he
shut
people
up
.
it
be
this
combination
of
decision
and
humanity
that
endear
Sir
William
so
greatly
to
the
relation
of
his
victim
.




but
Rezia
Warren
Smith
cry
,

down
Harley

,
that
she

at
the
June
day
,
counsel
submission
,
uphold
authority
,
and
point
out
in
chorus
the
supreme
advantage
of

the
mound

a
magnificent
figure
he
cut
too
,
pause
for
a
moment
(
as
the
sound
of
the
half
hour
die
away
)
to
look
critically
,
magisterially
,
at

;
impeccable
,

,
as
if
he
behold
the

from
a
certain
eminence
,
and

to
match
;
but
realise
the
obligation
which
size
,
wealth
,
health
,
entail
,
and
observe
punctiliously
even
when
not
absolutely
necessary
,
little
courtesy
,
old
-
fashioned
ceremony
which
give
a
quality
to
his
manner
,
something
to
imitate
,
something
to
remember
he
by
,
for
he
would
never
lunch
,
for
example
,
with
Lady
Bruton
,
whom
he
have
know
these
twenty
year
,
without
bring
she
in
his
outstretched
hand
a
bunch
of
carnation
and
ask
Miss
Brush
,
Lady
Bruton
's
secretary
,
after
her
brother
in
South
Africa
,
which
,
for
some
reason
,
Miss
Brush
,
deficient
though
she
be
in
every
attribute
of
female
charm
,
so
much
resent
that
she
say
"
thank
you
,
he
be
do
very
well
in
South
Africa
,
"
when
,
for
half
a
dozen
year
,
he
have
be
do
badly
in
Portsmouth
.




Lady
Bruton
herself
prefer
Richard
Dalloway
,
who
arrive
at
the
next
moment
.
indeed
they
meet
on
the
doorstep
.




Lady
Bruton
prefer
Richard
Dalloway
of
course
.
he
be
make
of
much
fine
material
.
but
she
would
n't
let
they
run
down
her
poor
dear
Hugh
.
she
could
never
forget
his
kindness
--
he
have
be
really
remarkably
kind
--
she
forget
precisely
upon
what
occasion
.
but
he
have
be
--
remarkably
kind
.
anyhow
,
the
difference
between
one
man
and
another
do
not
amount
to
much
.
she
have
never
see
the
sense
of
cut
people
up
,
as
Clarissa
Dalloway
do
--
cut
they
up
and
stick
they
together
again
;
not
at
any
rate
when
one
be
sixty
-
two
.
she
take
Hugh
's
carnation
with
her
angular
grim
smile
.
there
be
nobody
else
come
,
she
say
.
she
have
get
they
there
on
false
pretence
,
to
help
she
out
of
a
difficulty--




"
but
let
we
eat
first
,
"
she
say
.




and
so
there
begin
a
soundless
and
exquisite
pass
to
and
fro
through
swing
door
of
aprone
white
-
cap
maid
,
handmaiden
not
of
necessity
,
but
adept
in
a
mystery
or
grand
deception
practise
by
hostess
in
Mayfair
from
one
-
thirty
to
two
,
when
,
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
,
the
traffic
cease
,
and
there
rise
instead
this
profound
illusion
in
the
first
place
about
the

the
reputation

utterance

half
a
dozen

all
three
,
Lady

the

thing

how
passionately
Peter

be
in
love
;
be
reject
;
go
to
India
;
come
a
cropper

Richard

a
very
great
liking

Milly

once
might
almost
have
fall
in
love
with
these

and
Mr.

be
always
so
dependable
;
such
a
gentleman
too
.
now
,
be
forty
,
Lady
Bruton
have
only
to
nod
,
or
turn
her
head
a
little
abruptly
,
and
Milly
Brush
take
the
signal
,
however
deeply
she
might
be
sink
in
these
reflection
of
a
detach
spirit
,
of
an
uncorrupted
soul
whom
life
could
not
bamboozle
,
because
life
have
not
offer
she
a
trinket
of
the
slight
value
;
not
a
curl
,
smile
,
lip
,
cheek
,
nose
;
nothing
whatever
;
Lady
Bruton
have
only
to
nod
,
and
Perkins
be
instruct
to
quicken
the
coffee
.




"
yes
;
Peter
Walsh
have
come
back
,
"
say
Lady
Bruton
.
it
be
vaguely
flattering
to
they
all
.
he
have
come
back
,
batter
,
unsuccessful
,
to
their
secure
shore
.
but
to
help
he
,
they
reflect
,
be
impossible
;
there
be
some
flaw
in
his
character
.
Hugh
Whitbread
say
one
might
of
course
mention
his
name
to
so
-
and
-
so
.
he
wrinkle
lugubriously
,
consequentially
,
at
the
thought
of
the
letter
he
would
write
to
the
head
of
Government
office
about
"
my
old
friend
,
Peter
Walsh
,
"
and
so
on
.
but
it
would
n't
lead
to
anything
--
not
to
anything
permanent
,
because
of
his
character
.




"
in
trouble
with
some
woman
,
"
say
Lady
Bruton
.
they
have
all
guess
that
that
be
at
the
bottom
of
it
.




"
however
,
"
say
Lady
Bruton
,
anxious
to
leave
the
subject
,
"
we
shall
hear
the
whole

"
the
address

"
murmur
Hugh
Whitbread
;
and
there
be
at
once
a
ripple
in
the
grey
tide
of
service
which
wash
round
Lady
Bruton
day
in
,
day
out
,
collect
,
intercept
,
envelop
she
in
a
fine
tissue
which
break
concussion
,
mitigate
interruption
,
and
spread
round
the
house
in
Brook
Street
a
fine
net
where
thing
lodge
and
be
pick
out
accurately
,
instantly
,

grey

haired
Perkins
,
who
have
be
with
Lady
Bruton
these
thirty
year

now
write
down
the
address

hand
it
to
Mr.
Whitbread

who
take
out
his
pocket

book
,
raise
his
eyebrow
,
and
slip
it
in
among
document
of
the
high
importance

that

would
get
Evelyn

Hugh
be
very
slow
,
Lady
Bruton
think
.
he
be
get
fat
,
she
notice
.
Richard
always
keep
himself
in
the
pink
of
condition
.
she
be
get
impatient
;
the
whole
of
her
being
be
set
positively
,
undeniably
,
domineeringly
brush
aside
all
this
unnecessary
trifling
(
Peter
Walsh
and
his
affair
)
upon
that
subject
which
engage
her
attention
,
and
not
merely
her
attention
,
but
that
fibre
which
be
the
ramrod
of
her
soul
,
that
essential
part
of
she
without
which
Millicent
Bruton
would
not
have
be
Millicent
Bruton
;
that
project
for
emigrate
young
people
of
both
sex
bear
of
respectable
parent
and
set
they
up
with
a
fair
prospect
of
do
well
in
Canada
.
she
exaggerate
.
she
have
perhaps
lose
her
sense
of
proportion
.
Emigration
be
not
to
other
the
obvious
remedy
,
the
sublime
conception
.
it
be
not
to
they
(
not
to
Hugh
,
or
Richard
,
or
even
to
devote
Miss
Brush
)
the
liberator
of
the
pent
egotism
,
which
a
strong
martial
woman
,
well
nourished
,
well
descend
,
of
direct
impulse
,
downright
feeling
,
and
little
introspective
power
(
broad
and
simple
--
why
could
not
every
one
be
broad
and
simple
?
she
ask
)
feels
rise
within
she
,
once
youth
be
past
,
and
must
eject
upon
some
object
--
it
may
be
Emigration
,
it
may
be
Emancipation
;
but
whatever
it
be
,
this
object
round
which
the
essence
of
her
soul
be
daily
secrete
,
become
inevitably
prismatic
,
lustrous
,
half
look
-
glass
,
half
precious
stone
;
now
carefully
hide
in
case
people
should
sneer
at
it
;
now
proudly
display
.
Emigration
have
become
,
in
short
,
largely
Lady
Bruton
.




but
she
have
to
write
.
and
one
letter
to
the
Times
,
she
use
to
say
to
Miss
Brush
,
cost
she
more
than
to
organise
an
expedition
to
South
Africa
(
which
she
have
do
in
the
war
)
.
after
a
morning
's
battle
begin
,
tear
up
,
begin
again
,
she
use
to
feel
the
futility
of
her
own
womanhood
as
she
feel
it
on
no
other
occasion
,
and
would
turn
gratefully
to
the
thought
of
Hugh
Whitbread
who
possess
--
no
one
could
doubt
it
--
the
art
of
write
letter
to
the
Times
.




a
being
so
differently
constitute
from
herself
,
with
such
a
command
of
language
;
able
to
put
thing
as
editor
like
they
put
;
have
passion
which
one
could
not
call
simply
greed
.
Lady
Bruton
often
suspend
judgement
upon
man
in
deference
to
the
mysterious
accord
in
which
they
,
but
no
woman
,
stand
to
the
law
of
the
universe
;
know
how
to
put
thing
;
know
what
be
say
;
so
that
if
Richard
advise
she
,
and
Hugh
write
for
she
,
she
be
sure
of
be
somehow
right
.
so
she
let
Hugh
eat
his
soufflé
;
ask
after
poor
Evelyn
;
wait
until
they
be
smoke
,
and
then
say
,




"
milly
,
would
you
fetch
the
paper
?
"




and
Miss
Brush
go
out
,
come
back
;
lay
paper
on
the
table
;
and

;

,
which
have
do
twenty
year
'
service
,
he
say
,
unscrew
the
cap
.
it
be
still
in
perfect
order
;
he
have
show
it
to
the
maker
;
there
be
no
reason
,
they
say
,
why
it
should
ever
wear
out
;
which
be
somehow
to
Hugh
's
credit
,
and
to
the
credit
of
the
sentiment
which
his
pen
express
(
so
Richard
Dalloway
feel
)
as
Hugh
began
carefully
write
capital
letter
with
ring
round
they
in
the
margin
,
and
thus
marvellously
reduce
Lady
Bruton
's
tangle
to
sense
,
to
grammar
such
as
the
editor
of
the
Times
,
Lady
Bruton
feel
,
watch
the
marvellous
transformation
,
must
respect
.
Hugh
be
slow
.
Hugh
be
pertinacious
.
Richard
say
one
must
take
risk
.
Hugh
propose
modification
in
deference
to
people
's
feeling
,
which
,
he
say
rather
tartly
when
Richard
laugh
,
"
have
to
be
consider
,
"
and
read
out
"
how
,
therefore
,
we
be
of
opinion
that
the
time
be
ripe
.
.
.
the
superfluous
youth
of
our
ever
-
increase
population
.
.
.
what
we
owe
to
the
dead
.
.
.
"
which
Richard
think
all
stuffing
and
bunkum
,
but
no
harm
in
it
,
of
course
,
and
Hugh
go
on
draft
sentiment
in
alphabetical
order
of
the
high
nobility
,
brush
the
cigar
ash
from
his
waistcoat
,
and
sum
up
now
and
then
the
progress
they
have
make
until
,
finally
,
he
read
out
the
draft
of
a
letter
which
Lady
Bruton
feel
certain
be
a
masterpiece
.
could
her
own
meaning
sound
like
that
?




Hugh
could
not
guarantee
that
the
editor
would
put
it
in
;
but
he
would
be
meet
somebody
at
luncheon
.




Whereupon
Lady
Bruton
,
who
seldom
do
a
graceful
thing
,
stuff
all
Hugh
's
carnation
into
the
front
of
her
dress
,
and
fling
her

they
rise
.
and
Richard
Dalloway
stroll
off
as
usual
to
have
a
look
at
the
General

moment
of

.




and
Millicent

with

with
some
sort
of
lapse
in
the
tide
of

in
a
swirl

condescendingly
with
air
of
connoisseurship

he
think
of
ask
the
price
of
in
case
Evelyn

one
stand
stark
with
the
lethargy
of
the
old
,
stiff
with
the
rigidity
of
the
old
,
look
in
.
Evelyn
Whitbread
might
like
to
buy
this
spanish
necklace

so
she
might
.
Yawn
he
must
.
Hugh
be
go
into
the

.




"
right
you

.




goodness
know
he
do
n't
want
to
go
buy
necklace
with
Hugh
.
but
there
be
tide
in
the
body
.
morning
meet
afternoon
.
borne
like
a
frail
shallop
on
deep
,
deep
flood
,
Lady
Bruton
's
great
-
grandfather
and
his
memoir
and
his
campaign
in
North
America
be
whelm
and
sink
.
and
Millicent
Bruton
too
.
she
go
under
.
Richard
do
n't
care
a
straw
what
become
of
Emigration
;
about
that
letter
,
whether
the
editor
put
it
in
or
not
.
the
necklace
hang
stretch
between
Hugh
's
admirable
finger

let
he
give
it
to
a
girl
,
if
he
must
buy
jewel
--
any
girl
,
any
girl
in
the
street
.
for
the
worthlessness
of
this
life
do
strike
Richard
pretty
forcibly
--
buy
necklace
for
Evelyn
.
if
he
have
have
a
boy
he
'd
have
say

.
but
he
have
his
Elizabeth

he
adore
his
Elizabeth
.




"
I
should
like
to
see
Mr.
Dubonnet
,
"
say
Hugh
in
his
curt
worldly
way
.
it
appear
that
this
Dubonnet
have
the
measurement
of
Mrs.
Whitbread
's
neck
,
or
,
more
strangely
still
,
know
her
view
upon
spanish
jewellery
and
the
extent
of
her
possession
in
that
line
(
which
Hugh
could
not
remember
)
.
all
of
which
seem
to
Richard
Dalloway
awfully
odd
.
for
he
never
give
Clarissa
present
,
except
a
bracelet
two
or
three
year
ago
,
which
have
not
be
a
success
.
she
never
wear
it
.
it
pain
he
to
remember
that
she
never
wear
it
.
and
as
a
single
spider
's
thread
after
waver
here
and
there
attach
itself
to
the
point
of
a
leaf
,
so
Richard
's
mind
,
recover
from
its
lethargy
,
set
now
on
his
wife
,
Clarissa
,
whom
Peter
Walsh
have
love
so
passionately
;
and
Richard
have
have
a
sudden
vision
of
she
there
at
luncheon
;
of
himself
and
Clarissa
;
of
their
life
together
;
and
he
draw
the
tray
of
old
jewel
towards
he
,
and
take
up
first
this
brooch
then
that
ring
,
"
how
much
be
that
?
"
he
ask
,
but
doubt
his
own
taste
.
he
want
to
open
the
drawing
-
room
door
and
come
in
hold
out
something
;
a
present
for
Clarissa
.
only
what
?
but
Hugh
be
on
his
leg
again
.
he
be
unspeakably
pompous
.
really
,
after
deal
here
for
thirty
-
five
year
he
be
not
go
to
be
put
off
by
a
mere
boy
who
do
not
know
his
business
.
for
Dubonnet
,
it
seem
,
be
out
,
and
Hugh
would
not
buy
anything
until
Mr.
Dubonnet
choose
to
be
in
;
at
which
the
youth
flush
and
bow
his
correct
little
bow
.
it
be
all
perfectly
correct
.
and
yet
Richard
could
n't
have
say
that
to
save
his
life
!
why
these
people
stand
that
damn
insolence
he
could
not
conceive
.
Hugh
be
become
an
intolerable
ass
.
Richard
Dalloway
could
not
stand
more
than
an
hour
of
his
society
.
and
,
flick
his
bowler
hat
by
way
of
farewell
,
Richard
turn
at
the
corner
of
Conduit
Street
eager
,
yes
,
very
eager
,
to
travel
that
spider
's
thread
of
attachment
between
himself
and
Clarissa
;
he
would
go
straight
to
she
,
in
Westminster
.




but
he
want
to
come
in
hold
something
.
flower
?
yes
,
flower
,
since
he
do
not
trust
his
taste
in
gold
;
any
number
of
flower

.
partly
one
's
lazy
;
partly
one
be
shy
.
and
Clarissa
--
it
be
difficult
to
think
of
she
;
except
in
start
,
as
at
luncheon
,
when
he
see
she
quite
distinctly
;
their
whole
life
.
he
stop
at
the
crossing
;
and
repeat
--
be
simple
by
nature
,
and
undebauched
,
because
he
have
tramp
,
and
shoot
;
be
pertinacious
and
dog
,
having
champion
the
down

and
follow
his
instinct
in
the
House
of

;
be
preserve
in
his
simplicity
yet
at
the
same
time
grow
rather
speechless
,
rather
stiff
--
he
repeat
that
it
be
a
miracle
that
he
should
have
marry
Clarissa
;
a
miracle
--
his
life
have
be
a
miracle
,
he
think
;
hesitate
to
cross

it
do
make
his
blood
boil
to
see
little
creature

ought
to
have

have
no
illusion
about
the
London
police
.
indeed
,
he
be
collect
evidence
of
their
malpractice
;
and
those
costermonger
,
not
allow
to
stand
their
barrow
in
the
street
;
and
prostitute
,
good
Lord
,
the
fault
be
n't
in
they
,
nor
in
young
man
either
,
but
in
our
detestable
social
system

so
forth
;

he
consider
,
could
be

grey
,

,
as
he
walk
across
the
Park
to
tell
his
wife
that
he
love
she
.




for
he
would
say
it
in
so
many
word
,
when
he
come
into
the
room
.
because
it
be
a
thousand
pity
never
to

what
one
feel

,
cross
the

with
pleasure
how
in

could
easily
be
pick
up
(
if
people
object
)
by
one
of
those
fat
gentleman
in
livery
;
for
he
be
of
opinion
that
every
park
,
and
every
square
,
during
the
summer
month
should
be
open
to

to
observe
curiously
,
to
speculate
boldly
,
to
consider
the
why
s
and
the
wherefore
,
impudent
,
loose
-
lipped
,
humorous
)
,
he

not

his
flower
like

;

;
still
there
be
time
for
a
spark
between

--
she
laugh
at
the
sight
of
he
,
he
smile
good
-
humouredly
,
consider
the
problem
of
the
female
vagrant
;
not
that
they
would
ever
speak
.
but
he
would
tell
Clarissa
that
he
love
she
,
in
so
many
word
.
he
have
,
once
upon
a
time
,
be
jealous
of
Peter
Walsh
;
jealous
of
he
and
Clarissa
.
but
she
have
often
say
to
he
that
she
have
be
right
not
to
marry
Peter
Walsh
;
which
,
know
Clarissa
,
be
obviously
true
;
she
want
support
.
not
that
she
be
weak
;
but
she
want
support
.




as
for
Buckingham
Palace
(

an
old
prima

the
audience
all
in

)
you
ca
n't
deny
it
a
certain
dignity
,
he
consider
,
nor
despise
what
do
,
after
all
,
stand
to
million
of
people
(
a
little
crowd
be
wait
at
the
gate
to
see
the
King
drive
out
)
for
a
symbol
,
absurd
though
it
be
;
a
child
with
a
box
of
brick
could
have
do
well
,
he

;

at
the
memorial
to
Queen
Victoria

he
could
remember
in
her
horn
spectacle

through
Kensington
)
,
its
white
mound
,
its
billow

;
but
he
like
be
rule
by
the
descendant
of
Horsa
;
he
like
continuity
;
and
the
sense
of
handing
on
the
tradition
of
the
past
.
it
be
a
great
age

he
make
no
mistake
about
it
;
here

.




how
like
he
!
he
would
go
on
say
"
an
hour
's
complete
rest
after
luncheon
"
to
the
end
of
time
,
because
a
doctor
have
order
it
once
.
it
be
like
he
to
take
what
doctor
say
literally
;
part
of
his
adorable
,
divine
simplicity
,
which
no
one
have
to
the
same
extent
;
which
make
he
go
and
do
the
thing
while
she
and
Peter
fritter
their
time
away
bickering
.
he
be
already
halfway
to
the
House
of
Commons
,
to
his
Armenians
,
his
Albanians
,
having
settle
she
on
the
sofa
,
look
at
his
rose
.
and
people
would
say
,
"
Clarissa
Dalloway
be
spoil
.
"
she
care
much
more
for
her
rose
than
for
the
Armenians
.
hunt
out
of
existence
,
maim
,
frozen
,
the
victim
of
cruelty
and
injustice
(
she
have
hear
Richard
say
so
over
and
over
again)--no
,
she
could
feel
nothing
for
the
Albanians
,
or
be
it
the
Armenians
?
but
she
love
her
rose
(
do
n't
that
help
the
armenians?)--the
only
flower
she
could
bear
to
see
cut
.
but
Richard
be
already
at
the
House
of
Commons
;
at
his
Committee
,
having
settle
all
her
difficulty
.
but
no
;
alas
,
that
be
not
true
.
he
do
not
see
the
reason
against
ask
Ellie
Henderson
.
she
would
do
it
,
of
course
,
as
he
wish
it
.
since
he
have
bring
the
pillow
,
she
would
lie
down
.
.
.
.
but
--
but
--
why
do
she
suddenly
feel
,
for
no
reason
that
she
could
discover
,
desperately
unhappy
?
as
a
person
who
have
drop
some
grain
of
pearl
or
diamond
into
the
grass
and
part
the
tall
blade
very
carefully
,
this
way
and
that
,
and
search
here
and
there
vainly
,
and
at
last
spy
it
there
at
the
root
,
so
she
go
through
one
thing
and
another
;
no
,
it
be
not
Sally
Seton
say
that
Richard
would
never
be
in
the
Cabinet
because
he
have
a
second
-
class
brain
(
it
come
back
to
she
)
;
no
,
she
do
not
mind
that
;
nor
be
it
to
do
with
Elizabeth
either
and
Doris
Kilman
;
those
be
fact
.
it
be
a
feeling
,
some
unpleasant
feeling
,
early
in
the
day
perhaps
;
something
that
Peter
have
say
,
combine
with
some
depression
of
her
own
,
in
her
bedroom
,
take
off
her
hat
;
and
what
Richard
have
say
have
add
to
it
,
but
what
have
he
say
?
there
be
his
rose
.
her
party
!
that
be
it
!
her
party
!
both
of
they
criticise
she
very
unfairly
,
laugh
at
she
very
unjustly
,
for
her
party
.
that
be
it
!
that
be
it
!




well
,
how
be
she
go
to
defend
herself
?
now
that
she
know
what
it
be
,
she
feel
perfectly
happy
.
they
think
,
or
Peter
at
any
rate
thought
,
that
she
enjoyed
impose
herself
;
like
to
have
famous
people
about
she
;
great
name
;
be
simply
a
snob
in
short
.
well
,
Peter
might
think
so
.
Richard
merely
think
it
foolish
of
she
to
like
excitement
when
she
know
it
be
bad
for
her
heart
.
it
be
childish
,
he
think
.
and
both
be
quite
wrong
.
what
she
like
be
simply
life
.




"
that
be
what
I
do
it
for
,
"
she
say
,
speak
aloud
,
to
life
.




since
she
be
lie
on
the
sofa
,
cloister
,
exempt
,
the
presence
of
this
thing
which
she
feel
to
be
so
obvious
become
physically
existent
;
with
robe
of
sound
from
the
street
,
sunny
,
with
hot
breath
,
whispering
,
blow
out
the
blind
.
but
suppose
Peter
say
to
she
,
"
yes
,
yes
,
but
your
party
--
what
be
the
sense
of
your
party
?
"
all
she
could
say
be
(
and
nobody
could
be
expect
to
understand
):
they
be
an
offering
;
which
sound
horribly
vague
.
but
who
be
Peter
to
make
out
that
life
be
all
plain
sailing?--peter
always
in
love
,
always
in
love
with
the
wrong
woman
?
what
be
your
love
?
she
might
say
to
he
.
and
she
know
his
answer
;
how
it
be
the
most
important
thing
in
the
world
and
no
woman
possibly
understand
it
.
very
well
.
but
could
any
man
understand
what
she
mean
either
?
about
life
?
she
could
not
imagine
Peter
or
Richard
take
the
trouble
to
give
a
party
for
no
reason
whatever
.




but
to
go
deeply
,
beneath
what
people
say
(
and
these
judgement
,
how
superficial
,
how
fragmentary
they
be
!
)
in
her
own
mind
now
,
what
do
it
mean
to
she
,
this
thing
she
call
life
?
oh
,
it
be
very
queer
.
here
be
so
-
and
-
so
in
South
Kensington
;
some
one
up
in
bayswater
;
and
somebody
else
,
say
,
in
Mayfair
.
and
she
feel
quite
continuously
a
sense
of
their
existence
;
and
she
feel
what
a
waste
;
and
she
feel
what
a
pity
;
and
she
feel
if
only
they
could
be
bring
together
;
so
she
do
it
.
and
it
be
an
offering
;
to
combine
,
to
create
;
but
to
whom
?




an
offering
for
the
sake
of
offering
,
perhaps
.
anyhow
,
it
be
her
gift
.
nothing
else
have
she
of
the
slight
importance
;
could
not
think
,
write
,
even
play
the
piano
.
she
muddle
Armenians
and
Turks
;
love
success
;
hate
discomfort
;
must
be
like
;
talk
ocean
of
nonsense
:
and
to
this
day
,
ask
she
what
the
Equator
be
,
and
she
do
not
know
.
all
the
same
,
that
one
day
should
follow
another
;
Wednesday
,
Thursday
,
Friday
,
Saturday
;
that
one
should
wake
up
in
the
morning
;
see
the
sky
;
walk
in
the
park
;
meet
Hugh
Whitbread
;
then
suddenly
in
come
Peter
;
then
these
rose
;
it
be
enough
.
after
that
,
how
unbelievable
death
was!--that
it
must
end
;
and
no
one
in
the
whole
world
would
know
how
she
have
love
it
all
;
how
,
every
instant
.
.
.




the
door
open
.
Elizabeth
know
that
her
mother
be
rest
.
she
come
in
very
quietly
.
she
stand
perfectly
still
.
be
it
that
some
Mongol
have
be
wreck
on
the
coast
of
Norfolk
(
as
Mrs.
Hilbery
say
)
,
have
mix
with
the
Dalloway
lady
,
perhaps
,
a
hundred
year
ago
?
for
the
Dalloways
,
in
general
,
be
fair
-
haired
;
blue
-
eyed
;
Elizabeth
,
on
the
contrary
,
be
dark
;
have
chinese
eye
in
a
pale
face
;
an
oriental
mystery
;
be
gentle
,
considerate
,
still
.
as
a
child
,
she
have
have
a
perfect
sense
of
humour
;
but
now
at
seventeen
,
why
,
Clarissa
could
not
in
the
least
understand
,
she
have
become
very
serious
;
like
a
hyacinth
,
sheathe
in
glossy
green
,
with
bud
just
tint
,
a
hyacinth
which
have
have
no
sun
.




she
stand
quite
still
and
look
at
her
mother
;
but
the
door
be
ajar
,
and
outside
the
door
be
Miss
Kilman
,
as
Clarissa
know
;
Miss
Kilman
in
her
mackintosh
,
listen
to
whatever
they
say
.




yes
,
Miss
Kilman
stand
on
the
landing
,
and
wear
a
mackintosh
;
but
have
her
reason
.
first
,
it
be
cheap
;
second
,
she
be
over
forty
;
and
do
not
,
after
all
,
dress
to
please
.
she
be
poor
,
moreover
;
degradingly
poor
.
otherwise
she
would
not
be
take
job
from
people
like
the
Dalloways
;
from
rich
people
,
who
like
to
be
kind
.
Mr.
Dalloway
,
to
do
he
justice
,
have
be
kind
.
but
Mrs.
Dalloway
have
not
.
she
have
be
merely
condescend
.
she
come
from
the
most
worthless
of
all
class
--
the
rich
,
with
a
smattering
of
culture
.
they
have
expensive
thing
everywhere
;
picture
,
carpet
,
lot
of
servant
.
she
consider
that
she
have
a
perfect
right
to
anything
that
the
Dalloways
do
for
she
.




she
have
be
cheat
.
yes
,
the
word
be
no
exaggeration
,
for
surely
a
girl
have
a
right
to
some
kind
of
happiness
?
and
she
have
never
be
happy
,
what
with
be
so
clumsy
and
so
poor
.
and
then
,
just
as
she
might
have
have
a
chance
at
Miss
Dolby
's
school
,
the
war
come
;
and
she
have
never
be
able
to
tell
lie
.
Miss
Dolby
think
she
would
be
happy
with
people
who
share
her
view
about
the
Germans
.
she
have
have
to
go
.
it
be
true
that
the
family
be
of
german
origin
;
spelt
the
name
Kiehlman
in
the
eighteenth
century
;
but
her
brother
have
be
kill
.
they
turn
she
out
because
she
would
not
pretend
that
the
Germans
be
all
villain
--
when
she
have
german
friend
,
when
the
only
happy
day
of
her
life
have
be
spend
in
Germany
!
and
after
all
,
she
could
read
history
.
she
have
have
to
take
whatever
she
could
get
.
Mr.
Dalloway
have
come
across
she
work
for
the
Friends
.
he
have
allow
she
(
and
that
be
really
generous
of
he
)
to
teach
his
daughter
history
.
also
she
do
a
little
extension
lecturing
and
so
on
.
then
our
Lord
have
come
to
she
(
and
here
she
always
bow
her
head
)
.
she
have
see
the
light
two
year
and
three
month
ago
.
now
she
do
not
envy
woman
like
Clarissa
Dalloway
;
she
pity
they
.




she
pity
and
despise
they
from
the
bottom
of
her
heart
,
as
she
stand
on
the
soft
carpet
,
look
at
the
old
engraving
of
a
little
girl
with
a
muff
.
with
all
this
luxury
go
on
,
what
hope
be
there
for
a
well
state
of
thing
?
instead
of
lie
on
a
sofa--"my
mother
be
rest
,
"
Elizabeth
have
say
--
she
should
have
be
in
a
factory
;
behind
a
counter
;
Mrs.
Dalloway
and
all
the
other
fine
lady
!




bitter
and
burning
,
Miss
Kilman
have
turn
into
a
church
two
year
three
month
ago
.
she
have
hear
the
Rev.
Edward
Whittaker
preach
;
the
boy
sing
;
have
see
the
solemn
light
descend
,
and
whether
it
be
the
music
,
or
the
voice
(
she
herself
when
alone
in
the
evening
find
comfort
in
a
violin
;
but
the
sound
be
excruciating
;
she
have
no
ear
)
,
the
hot
and
turbulent
feeling
which
boil
and
surge
in
she
have
be
assuage
as
she
sit
there
,
and
she
have
weep
copiously
,
and
go
to
call
on
Mr.
Whittaker
at
his
private
house
in
Kensington
.
it
be
the
hand
of
God
,
he
say
.
the
Lord
have
show
she
the
way
.
so
now
,
whenever
the
hot
and
painful
feeling
boil
within
she
,
this
hatred
of
Mrs.
Dalloway
,
this
grudge
against
the
world
,
she
think
of
God
.
she
think
of
Mr.
Whittaker
.
rage
be
succeed
by
calm
.
a
sweet
savour
fill
her
vein
,
her
lip
part
,
and
,
stand
formidable
upon
the
landing
in
her
mackintosh
,
she
look
with
steady
and
sinister
serenity
at
Mrs.
Dalloway
,
who
come
out
with
her
daughter
.




Elizabeth
say
she
have
forget
her
glove
.
that
be
because
Miss
Kilman
and
her
mother
hate
each
other
.
she
could
not
bear
to
see
they
together
.
she
run
upstairs
to
find
her
glove
.




but
Miss
Kilman
do
not
hate
Mrs.
Dalloway
.
turn
her
large
gooseberry
-
colour
eye
upon
Clarissa
,
observe
her
small
pink
face
,
her
delicate
body
,
her
air
of
freshness
and
fashion
,
Miss
Kilman
feel
,
Fool
!
Simpleton
!
you
who
have
know
neither
sorrow
nor
pleasure
;
who
have
trifle
your
life
away
!
and
there
rise
in
she
an
overmaster
desire
to
overcome
she
;
to
unmask
she
.
if
she
could
have
fell
she
it
would
have
ease
she
.
but
it
be
not
the
body
;
it
be
the
soul
and
its
mockery
that
she
wish
to
subdue
;
make
feel
her
mastery
.
if
only
she
could
make
she
weep
;
could
ruin
she
;
humiliate
she
;
bring
she
to
her
knee
cry
,
you
be
right
!
but
this
be
God
's
will
,
not
Miss
Kilman
's
.
it
be
to
be
a
religious
victory
.
so
she
glare
;
so
she
glower
.




Clarissa
be
really
shocked
.
this
a
Christian
--
this
woman
!
this
woman
have
take
her
daughter
from
she
!
she
in
touch
with
invisible
presence
!
heavy
,
ugly
,
commonplace
,
without
kindness
or
grace
,
she
know
the
meaning
of
life
!




"
you
be
take
Elizabeth
to
the
Stores
?
"
Mrs.
Dalloway
say
.




Miss
Kilman
say
she
be
.
they
stand
there
.
Miss
Kilman
be
not
go
to
make
herself
agreeable
.
she
have
always
earn
her
living
.
her
knowledge
of
modern
history
be
thorough
in
the
extreme
.
she
do
out
of
her
meagre
income
set
aside
so
much
for
cause
she
believe
in
;
whereas
this
woman
do
nothing
,
believe
nothing
;
bring
up
her
daughter
--
but
here
be
Elizabeth
,
rather
out
of
breath
,
the
beautiful
girl
.




so
they
be
go
to
the
Stores
.
Odd
it
be
,
as
Miss
Kilman
stand
there
(
and
stand
she
do
,
with
the
power
and
taciturnity
of
some
prehistoric
monster
armoured
for
primeval
warfare
)
,
how
,
second
by
second
,
the
idea
of
she
diminish
,
how
hatred
(
which
be
for
idea
,
not
people
)
crumble
,
how
she
lose
her
malignity
,
her
size
,
become
second
by
second
merely
Miss
Kilman
,
in
a
mackintosh
,
whom
Heaven
know
Clarissa
would
have
like
to
help
.




at
this
dwindling
of
the
monster
,
Clarissa
laugh
.
say
good
-
bye
,
she
laugh
.




off
they
go
together
,
Miss
Kilman
and
Elizabeth
,
downstairs
.




with
a
sudden
impulse
,
with
a
violent
anguish
,
for
this
woman
be
take
her
daughter
from
she
,
Clarissa
leant
over
the
bannister
and
cry
out
,
"
remember
the
party
!
remember
our
party
tonight
!
"




but
Elizabeth
have
already
open
the
front
door
;
there
be
a
van
pass
;
she
do
not
answer
.




love
and
religion
!
think
Clarissa
,
go
back
into
the
drawing
-
room
,
tingle
all
over
.
how
detestable
,
how
detestable
they
be
!
for
now
that
the
body
of
Miss
Kilman
be
not
before
she
,
it
overwhelm
she
--
the
idea
.
the
cruel
thing
in
the
world
,
she
think
,
see
they
clumsy
,
hot
,
domineering
,
hypocritical
,
eavesdropping
,
jealous
,
infinitely
cruel
and
unscrupulous
,
dress
in
a
mackintosh
coat
,
on
the
landing
;
love
and
religion
.
have
she
ever
try
to
convert
any
one
herself
?
do
she
not
wish
everybody
merely
to
be
themselves
?
and
she
watch
out
of
the
window
the
old
lady
opposite
climb
upstairs
.
let
she
climb
upstairs
if
she
want
to
;
let
she
stop
;
then
let
she
,
as
Clarissa
have
often
see
she
,
gain
her
bedroom
,
part
her
curtain
,
and
disappear
again
into
the
background
.
somehow
one
respect
that
--
that
old
woman
look
out
of
the
window
,
quite
unconscious
that
she
be
be
watch
.
there
be
something
solemn
in
it
--
but
love
and
religion
would
destroy
that
,
whatever
it
be
,
the
privacy
of
the
soul
.
the
odious
Kilman
would
destroy
it
.
yet
it
be
a
sight
that
make
she
want
to
cry
.




love
destroy
too
.
everything
that
be
fine
,
everything
that
be
true
go
.
take
Peter
Walsh
now
.
there
be
a
man
,
charming
,
clever
,
with
idea
about
everything
.
if
you
want
to
know
about
Pope
,
say
,
or
Addison
,
or
just
to
talk
nonsense
,
what
people
be
like
,
what
thing
mean
,
Peter
know
well
than
any
one
.
it
be
Peter
who
have
help
she
;
Peter
who
have
lend
her
book
.
but
look
at
the
woman
he
love
--
vulgar
,
trivial
,
commonplace
.
think
of
Peter
in
love
--
he
come
to
see
she
after
all
these
year
,
and
what
do
he
talk
about
?
himself
.
horrible
passion
!
she
think
.
degrading
passion
!
she
think
,
thinking
of
Kilman
and
her
Elizabeth
walk
to
the
Army
and
Navy
Stores
.




Big
Ben
strike
the
half
-
hour
.




how
extraordinary
it
be
,
strange
,
yes
,
touching
,
to
see
the
old
lady
(
they
have
be
neighbour
ever
so
many
year
)
move
away
from
the
window
,
as
if
she
be
attach
to
that
sound
,
that
string
.
gigantic
as
it
be
,
it
have
something
to
do
with
she
.
down
,
down
,
into
the
midst
of
ordinary
thing
the
finger
fall
make
the
moment
solemn
.
she
be
force
,
so
Clarissa
imagine
,
by
that
sound
,
to
move
,
to
go
--
but
where
?
Clarissa
try
to
follow
she
as
she
turn
and
disappear
,
and
could
still
just
see
her
white
cap
move
at
the
back
of
the
bedroom
.
she
be
still
there
move
about
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
.
why
creed
and
prayer
and
mackintosh
?
when
,
think
Clarissa
,
that
be
the
miracle
,
that
be
the
mystery
;
that
old
lady
,
she
mean
,
whom
she
could
see
go
from
chest
of
drawer
to
dressing
-
table
.
she
could
still
see
she
.
and
the
supreme
mystery
which
Kilman
might
say
she
have
solve
,
or
Peter
might
say
he
have
solve
,
but
Clarissa
do
n't
believe
either
of
they
have
the
ghost
of
an
idea
of
solving
,
be
simply
this
:
here
be
one
room
;
there
another
.
do
religion
solve
that
,
or
love
?




love
--
but
here
the
other
clock
,
the
clock
which
always
strike
two
minute
after
Big
Ben
,
came
shuffle
in
with
its
lap
full
of
odd
and
end
,
which
it
dump
down
as
if
Big
Ben
be
all
very
well
with
his
majesty
lay
down
the
law
,
so
solemn
,
so
just
,
but
she
must
remember
all
sort
of
little
thing
besides
--
Mrs.
Marsham
,
Ellie
Henderson
,
glass
for
ice
--
all
sort
of
little
thing
come
flood
and
lapping
and
dance
in
on
the
wake
of
that
solemn
stroke
which
lie
flat
like
a
bar
of
gold
on
the
sea
.
Mrs.
Marsham
,
Ellie
Henderson
,
glass
for
ice
.
she
must
telephone
now
at
once
.




volubly
,
troublously
,
the
late
clock
sound
,
come
in
on
the
wake
of
Big
Ben
,
with
its
lap
full
of
trifle
.
beat
up
,
break
up
by
the
assault
of
carriage
,
the
brutality
of
van
,
the
eager
advance
of
myriad
of
angular
man
,
of
flaunt
woman
,
the
dome
and
spire
of
office
and
hospital
,
the
last
relic
of
this
lap
full
of
odd
and
end
seem
to
break
,
like
the
spray
of
an
exhausted
wave
,
upon
the
body
of
Miss
Kilman
stand
still
in
the
street
for
a
moment
to
mutter
"
it
be
the
flesh
.
"




it
be
the
flesh
that
she
must
control
.
Clarissa
Dalloway
have
insult
she
.
that
she
expect
.
but
she
have
not
triumph
;
she
have
not
master
the
flesh
.
Ugly
,
clumsy
,
Clarissa
Dalloway
have
laugh
at
she
for
be
that
;
and
have
revive
the
fleshly
desire
,
for
she
mind
look
as
she
do
beside
Clarissa
.
nor
could
she
talk
as
she
do
.
but
why
wish
to
resemble
she
?
why
?
she
despise
Mrs.
Dalloway
from
the
bottom
of
her
heart
.
she
be
not
serious
.
she
be
not
good
.
her
life
be
a
tissue
of
vanity
and
deceit
.
yet
Doris
Kilman
have
be
overcome
.
she
have
,
as
a
matter
of
fact
,
very
nearly
burst
into
tear
when
Clarissa
Dalloway
laugh
at
she
.
"
it
be
the
flesh
,
it
be
the
flesh
,
"
she
mutter
(
it
be
her
habit
to
talk
aloud
)
try
to
subdue
this
turbulent
and
painful
feeling
as
she
walk
down
Victoria
Street
.
she
pray
to
God
.
she
could
not
help
be
ugly
;
she
could
not
afford
to
buy
pretty
clothe
.
Clarissa
Dalloway
have
laugh
--
but
she
would
concentrate
her
mind
upon
something
else
until
she
have
reach
the
pillar
-
box
.
at
any
rate
she
have
get
Elizabeth
.
but
she
would
think
of
something
else
;
she
would
think
of
Russia
;
until
she
reach
the
pillar
-
box
.




how
nice
it
must
be
,
she
say
,
in
the
country
,
struggle
,
as
Mr.
Whittaker
have
tell
she
,
with
that
violent
grudge
against
the
world
which
have
scorn
she
,
sneer
at
she
,
cast
she
off
,
begin
with
this
indignity
--
the
infliction
of
her
unlovable
body
which
people
could
not
bear
to
see
.
do
her
hair
as
she
might
,
her
forehead
remain
like
an
egg
,
bald
,
white
.
no
clothe
suit
she
.
she
might
buy
anything
.
and
for
a
woman
,
of
course
,
that
meant
never
meet
the
opposite
sex
.
never
would
she
come
first
with
any
one
.
sometimes
lately
it
have
seem
to
she
that
,
except
for
Elizabeth
,
her
food
be
all
that
she
live
for
;
her
comfort
;
her
dinner
,
her
tea
;
her
hot
-
water
bottle
at
night
.
but
one
must
fight
;
vanquish
;
have
faith
in
God
.
Mr.
Whittaker
have
say
she
be
there
for
a
purpose
.
but
no
one
know
the
agony
!
he
say
,
point
to
the
crucifix
,
that
God
know
.
but
why
should
she
have
to
suffer
when
other
woman
,
like
Clarissa
Dalloway
,
escape
?
Knowledge
come
through
suffering
,
say
Mr.
Whittaker
.




she
have
pass
the
pillar
-
box
,
and
Elizabeth
have
turn
into
the
cool
brown
tobacco
department
of
the
Army
and
Navy
Stores
while
she
be
still
mutter
to
herself
what
Mr.
Whittaker
have
say
about
knowledge
come
through
suffering
and
the
flesh
.
"
the
flesh
,
"
she
mutter
.




what
department
do
she
want
?
Elizabeth
interrupt
she
.




"
petticoat
,
"
she
say
abruptly
,
and
stalk
straight
on
to
the
lift
.




up
they
go
.
Elizabeth
guide
she
this
way
and
that
;
guide
she
in
her
abstraction
as
if
she
have
be
a
great
child
,
an
unwieldy
battleship
.
there
be
the
petticoat
,
brown
,
decorous
,
stripe
,
frivolous
,
solid
,
flimsy
;
and
she
choose
,
in
her
abstraction
,
portentously
,
and
the
girl
serve
think
her
mad
.




Elizabeth
rather
wonder
,
as
they
do
up
the
parcel
,
what
Miss
Kilman
be
think
.
they
must
have
their
tea
,
say
Miss
Kilman
,
rouse
,
collect
herself
.
they
have
their
tea
.




Elizabeth
rather
wonder
whether
Miss
Kilman
could
be
hungry
.
it
be
her
way
of
eat
,
eat
with
intensity
,
then
look
,
again
and
again
,
at
a
plate
of
sugar
cake
on
the
table
next
they
;
then
,
when
a
lady
and
a
child
sit
down
and
the
child
take
the
cake
,
could
Miss
Kilman
really
mind
it
?
yes
,
Miss
Kilman
do
mind
it
.
she
have
want
that
cake
--
the
pink
one
.
the
pleasure
of
eat
be
almost
the
only
pure
pleasure
leave
she
,
and
then
to
be
baffle
even
in
that
!




when
people
be
happy
,
they
have
a
reserve
,
she
have
tell
Elizabeth
,
upon
which
to
draw
,
whereas
she
be
like
a
wheel
without
a
tyre
(
she
be
fond
of
such
metaphor
)
,
jolt
by
every
pebble
,
so
she
would
say
stay
on
after
the
lesson
stand
by
the
fire
-
place
with
her
bag
of
book
,
she
"
satchel
,
"
she
call
it
,
on
a
Tuesday
morning
,
after
the
lesson
be
over
.
and
she
talk
too
about
the
war
.
after
all
,
there
be
people
who
do
not
think
the
English
invariably
right
.
there
be
book
.
there
be
meeting
.
there
be
other
point
of
view
.
would
Elizabeth
like
to
come
with
she
to
listen
to
so
-
and
-
so
(
a
most
extraordinary
look
old
man
)
?
then
Miss
Kilman
take
she
to
some
church
in
Kensington
and
they
have
tea
with
a
clergyman
.
she
have
lend
her
book
.

,
medicine
,
politic
,
all
profession
be
open
to
woman
of
your
generation
,
say
Miss
Kilman
.
but
for
herself
,
her
career
be
absolutely
ruin
and
be
it
her
fault
?
good
gracious
,
say
Elizabeth
,
no
.




and
her
mother
would
come
call
to
say
that
a
hamper
have
come
from
Bourton
and
would
miss
Kilman
like
some
flower
?
to
Miss
Kilman
she
be
always
very
,
very
nice
,
but
Miss
Kilman
squash
the
flower
all
in
a
bunch
,
and
have
n't
any
small
talk
,
and
what
interested
Miss
Kilman
bore
her
mother
,
and
Miss
Kilman
and
she
be
terrible
together
;
and
Miss
Kilman
swell
and
look
very
plain
.
but
then
Miss
Kilman
be
frightfully
clever
.
Elizabeth
have
never
think
about
the
poor
.
they
live
with
everything
they
wanted,--her
mother
have
breakfast
in
bed
every
day
;
Lucy
carry
it
up
;
and
she
like
old
woman
because
they
be
Duchesses
,
and
be
descend
from
some
Lord
.
but
Miss
Kilman
say
(
one
of
those
Tuesday
morning
when
the
lesson
be
over
)
,
"

large
hand
open

shut

a
little
flat
somehow
,
Elizabeth
feel
.
and
really
she
would
like
to

say
Miss
Kilman
,
"
I

"




of
course
,
then
,
Elizabeth
would
wait
.
but
it
be
rather
stuffy
in
here
.




"

a
soul
cut
out
of
immaterial
substance

but
Mr.

to
go
.
he
have
to
pass
she
,
and
be
himself
neat
as
a
new
pin
,
could
not
help
be
a
little
distressed
by
the
poor
lady
's
disorder
;
her
hair
down
;
her
parcel
on
the
floor
.
she
do
not
at
once
let
he
pass
.
but
,
as
he
stand
gaze
about
he
,
at
the
white
marble
,
grey
window
pane
,
and
accumulate
treasure
(
for
he
be
extremely
proud
of
the
Abbey
)
,
her
largeness
,
robustness
,
and
power
as
she
sit
there
shift
her
knee
from
time
to
time
(
it
be
so
rough
the
approach
to
her
God
--
so
tough
her
desire
)
impress
he
,
as
they
have
impress
Mrs.
Dalloway
(
she
could
not
get
the
thought
of
she
out
of
her
mind
that
afternoon
)
,
the
Rev.
Edward
Whittaker
,
and
Elizabeth
too
.




and
Elizabeth
wait
in
Victoria
Street
for
an
omnibus
.
it
be
so
nice
to
be
out
of
door
.
she
think
perhaps
she
need
not
go
home
just
yet
.
it
be
so
nice
to
be
out
in
the
air
.
so
she
would
get
on
to
an
omnibus
.
and
already
,
even
as
she
stand
there
,
in
she
very
well
cut
clothe
,
it
be
begin
.
.
.
.
People
be
begin
to
compare
she
to
poplar
tree
,
early
dawn
,
hyacinth
,
fawn
,
run
water
,
and
garden
lily
;
and
it
make
her
life
a
burden
to
she
,
for
she
so
much
preferred
be
leave
alone
to
do
what
she
like
in
the
country
,
but
they
would
compare
she
to
lily
,
and
she
have
to
go
to
party
,
and
London
be
so
dreary
compare
with
be
alone
in
the
country
with
her
father
and
the
dog
.




bus
swoop
,
settle
,
be
off
--
garish
caravan
,
glisten
with
red
and
yellow
varnish
.
but
which
should
she
get
on
to
?
she
have
no
preference
.
of
course
,
she
would
not
push
her
way
.
she
incline
to
be
passive
.
it
be
expression
she
need
,
but
her
eye
be
fine
,
chinese
,
oriental
,
and
,
as
her
mother
say
,
with
such
nice
shoulder
and
hold
herself
so
straight
,
she
be
always
charming
to
look
at
;
and
lately
,
in
the
evening
especially
,
when
she
be
interested
,
for
she
never
seem
excited
,
she
look
almost
beautiful
,
very
stately
,
very
serene
.
what
could
she
be
think
?
every
man
fall
in
love
with
she
,
and
she
be
really
awfully
bored
.
for
it
be
begin
.
her
mother
could
see
that
--
the
compliment
be
begin
.
that
she
do
not
care
more
about
it
--
for
instance
for
her
clothe
--
sometimes
worry
Clarissa
,
but
perhaps
it
be
as
well
with
all
those
puppy
and
guinea
pig
about
have
distemper
,
and
it
give
she
a
charm
.
and
now
there
be
this
odd
friendship
with
Miss
Kilman
.
well
,
think
Clarissa
about
three
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
read
Baron
Marbot
for
she
could
not
sleep
,
it
prove
she
have
a
heart
.




suddenly
Elizabeth
step
forward
and
most
competently
board
the
omnibus
,
in
front
of
everybody
.
she
take
a
seat
on
top
.
the
impetuous
creature
--
a
pirate
--
start
forward
,
spring
away
;
she
have
to
hold
the
rail
to
steady
herself
,
for
a
pirate
it
be
,
reckless
,
unscrupulous
,
bear
down
ruthlessly
,
circumvent
dangerously
,
boldly
snatch
a
passenger
,
or
ignore
a
passenger
,
squeeze
eel
-
like
and
arrogant
in
between
,
and
then
rush
insolently
all
sail
spread
up
Whitehall
.
and
do
Elizabeth
give
one
thought
to
poor
Miss
Kilman
who
love
she
without
jealousy
,
to
whom
she
have
be
a
fawn
in
the
open
,
a
moon
in
a
glade
?
she
be
delighted
to
be
free
.
the
fresh
air
be
so
delicious
.
it
have
be
so
stuffy
in
the
Army
and
Navy
Stores
.
and
now
it
be
like
ride
,
to
be
rush
up
Whitehall
;
and
to
each
movement
of
the
omnibus
the
beautiful
body
in
the
fawn
-
coloured
coat
respond
freely
like
a
rider
,
like
the
figure
-
head
of
a
ship
,
for
the
breeze
slightly
disarray
she
;
the
heat
give
her
cheek
the
pallor
of
white
paint
wood
;
and
her
fine
eye
,
have
no
eye
to
meet
,
gaze
ahead
,
blank
,
bright
,
with
the
stare
incredible
innocence
of
sculpture
.




it
be
always
talk
about
her
own
suffering
that
make
Miss
Kilman
so
difficult
.
and
be
she
right
?
if
it
be
be
on
committee
and
give
up
hour
and
hour
every
day
(
she
hardly
ever
see
he
in
London
)
that
help
the
poor
,
her
father
do
that
,
goodness
knows,--if
that
be
what
Miss
Kilman
mean
about
be
a
Christian
;
but
it
be
so
difficult
to
say
.
oh
,
she
would
like
to
go
a
little
far
.
another
penny
be
it
to
the
Strand
?
here
be
another
penny
then
.
she
would
go
up
the
Strand
.




she
like
people
who
be
ill
.
and
every
profession
be
open
to
the
woman
of
your
generation
,
say
Miss
Kilman
.
so
she
might
be
a
doctor
.
she
might
be
a
farmer
.
animal
be
often
ill
.
she
might
own
a
thousand
acre
and
have
people
under
she
.
she
would
go
and
see
they
in
their
cottage
.
this
be
Somerset
House
.
one
might
be
a
very
good
farmer
--
and
that
,
strangely
enough
though
Miss
Kilman
have
her
share
in
it
,
be
almost
entirely
due
to
Somerset
House
.
it
look
so
splendid
,
so
serious
,
that
great
grey
building
.
and
she
like
the
feeling
of
people
work
.
she
like
those
church
,
like
shape
of
grey
paper
,
breast
the
stream
of
the
Strand
.
it
be
quite
different
here
from
Westminster
,
she
think
,
get
off
at
Chancery
Lane
.
it
be
so
serious
;
it
be
so
busy
.
in
short
,
she
would
like
to
have
a
profession
.
she
would
become
a
doctor
,
a
farmer
,
possibly
go
into
Parliament
,
if
she
find
it
necessary
,
all
because
of
the
Strand
.




the
foot
of
those
people
busy
about
their
activity
,
hand
put
stone
to
stone
,
mind
eternally
occupy
not
with
trivial
chattering
(
compare
woman
to
poplar
--
which
be
rather
exciting
,
of
course
,
but
very
silly
)
,
but
with
thought
of
ship
,
of
business
,
of
law
,
of
administration
,
and
with
it
all
so
stately
(
she
be
in
the
Temple
)
,
gay
(
there
be
the
river
)
,
pious
(
there
be
the
Church
)
,
make
she
quite
determined
,
whatever
her
mother
might
say
,
to
become
either
a
farmer
or
a
doctor
.
but
she
be
,
of
course
,
rather
lazy
.




and
it
be
much
well
to
say
nothing
about
it
.
it
seem
so
silly
.
it
be
the
sort
of
thing
that
do
sometimes
happen
,
when
one
be
alone
--
building
without
architect
'
name
,
crowd
of
people
come
back
from
the
city
have
more
power
than
single
clergyman
in
Kensington
,
than
any
of
the
book
Miss
Kilman
have
lend
she
,
to
stimulate
what
lie
slumbrous
,
clumsy
,
and
shy
on
the
mind
's
sandy
floor
to
break
surface
,
as
a
child
suddenly
stretch
its
arm
;
it
be
just
that
,
perhaps
,
a
sigh
,
a
stretch
of
the
arm
,
an
impulse
,
a
revelation
,
which
have
its
effect
for
ever
,
and
then
down
again
it
go
to
the
sandy
floor
.
she
must
go
home
.
she
must
dress
for
dinner
.
but
what
be
the
time?--where
be
a
clock
?




she
look
up
Fleet
Street
.
she
walk
just
a
little
way
towards
St.
Paul
's
,
shyly
,
like
some
one
penetrate
on
tiptoe
,
explore
a
strange
house
by
night
with
a
candle
,
on
edge
lest
the
owner
should
suddenly
fling
wide
his
bedroom
door
and
ask
her
business
,
nor
do
she
dare
wander
off
into
queer
alley
,
tempt
bye
-
street
,
any
more
than
in
a
strange
house
open
door
which
might
be
bedroom
door
,
or
sitting
-
room
door
,
or
lead
straight
to
the
larder
.
for
no
Dalloways
come
down
the
Strand
daily
;
she
be
a
pioneer
,
a
stray
,
venture
,
trust
.




in
many
way
,
her
mother
feel
,
she
be
extremely
immature
,
like
a
child
still
,
attach
to
doll
,
to
old
slipper
;
a
perfect
baby
;
and
that
be
charming
.
but
then
,
of
course
,
there
be
in
the
Dalloway
family
the
tradition
of
public
service
.
abbess
,
principal
,
head
mistress
,
dignitary
,
in
the
republic
of
woman
--
without
be
brilliant
,
any
of
they
,
they
be
that
.
she
penetrate
a
little
far
in
the
direction
of
St.
Paul
's
.
she
like
the
geniality
,
sisterhood
,
motherhood
,
brotherhood
of
this
uproar
.
it
seem
to
her
good
.
the
noise
be
tremendous
;
and
suddenly
there
be
trumpet
(
the
unemployed
)
blaring
,
rattle
about
in
the
uproar
;
military
music
;
as
if
people
be
march
;
yet
have
they
be
die
--
have
some
woman
breathe
she
last
and
whoever
be
watch
,
open
the
window
of
the
room
where
she
have
just
bring
off
that
act
of
supreme
dignity
,
look
down
on
Fleet
Street
,
that
uproar
,
that
military
music
would
have
come
triumph
up
to
he
,
consolatory
,
indifferent
.




it
be
not
conscious
.
there
be
no
recognition
in
it
of
one
fortune
,
or
fate
,
and
for
that
very
reason
even
to
those
daze
with
watch
for
the
last
shiver
of
consciousness
on
the
face
of
the
dying
,
console
.
forgetfulness
in
people
might
wound
,
their
ingratitude
corrode
,
but
this
voice
,
pour
endlessly
,
year
in
year
out
,
would
take
whatever
it
might
be
;
this
vow
;
this
van
;
this
life
;
this
procession
,
would
wrap
they
all
about
and
carry
they
on
,
as
in
the
rough
stream
of
a
glaci
the
ice
hold
a
splinter
of
bone
,
a
blue
petal
,
some
oak
tree
,
and
roll
they
on
.




but
it
be
late
than
she
think
.
her
mother
would
not
like
she
to
be
wander
off
alone
like
this
.
she
turn
back
down
the
Strand
.




a
puff
of
wind
(
in
spite
of
the
heat
,
there
be
quite
a
wind
)
blow
a
thin
black
veil
over
the
sun
and
over
the
Strand
.
the
face
fade
;
the
omnibus
suddenly
lose
their
glow
.
for
although
the
cloud
be
of
mountainous
white
so
that
one
could
fancy
hack
hard
chip
off
with
a
hatchet
,
with
broad
golden
slope
,
lawn
of
celestial
pleasure
garden
,
on
their
flank
,
and
have
all
the
appearance
of
settle
habitation
assemble
for
the
conference
of
god
above
the
world
,
there
be
a
perpetual
movement
among
they
.
sign
be
interchanged
,
when
,
as
if
to
fulfil
some
scheme
arrange
already
,
now
a
summit
dwindle
,
now
a
whole
block
of
pyramidal
size
which
have
keep
its
station
inalterably
advanced
into
the
midst
or
gravely
lead
the
procession
to
fresh
anchorage
.
fix
though
they
seem
at
their
post
,
at
rest
in
perfect
unanimity
,
nothing
could
be
fresh
,
free
,
more
sensitive
superficially
than
the
snow
-
white
or
gold
-
kindle
surface
;
to
change
,
to
go
,
to
dismantle
the
solemn
assemblage
be
immediately
possible
;
and
in
spite
of
the
grave
fixity
,
the
accumulate
robustness
and
solidity
,
now
they
strike
light
to
the
earth
,
now
darkness
.




calmly
and
competently
,
Elizabeth
Dalloway
mount
the
Westminster
omnibus
.




go
and
come
,
beckon
,
signal
,
so
the
light
and
shadow
which
now
make
the
wall
grey
,
now
the
banana
bright
yellow
,
now
make
the
Strand
grey
,
now
make
the
omnibus
bright
yellow
,
seem
to
Septimus
Warren
Smith
lie
on
the
sofa
in
the
sitting
-
room
;
watch
the
watery
gold
glow
and
fade
with
the
astonishing
sensibility
of
some
live
creature
on
the
rose
,
on
the
wall
-
paper
.
outside
the
tree
drag
their
leave
like
net
through
the
depth
of
the
air
;
the
sound
of
water
be
in
the
room
and
through
the
wave
come
the
voice
of
bird
singe
.
every
power
pour
its
treasure
on
his
head
,
and
his
hand
lie
there
on
the
back
of
the
sofa
,
as
he
have
see
his
hand
lie
when
he
be
bathe
,
float
,
on
the
top
of
the
wave
,
while
far
away
on
shore
he
hear
dog
bark
and
bark
far
away
.
fear
no
more
,
say
the
heart
in
the
body
;
fear
no
more
.




he
be
not
afraid
.
at
every
moment
nature
signify
by
some
laugh
hint
like
that
gold
spot
which
go
round
the
wall
--
there
,
there
,
there
--
her
determination
to
show
,
by
brandish
her
plume
,
shake
her
tress
,
fling
her
mantle
this
way
and
that
,
beautifully
,
always
beautifully
,
and
stand
close
up
to
breathe
through
her
hollow
hand
Shakespeare
's
word
,
her
meaning
.




Rezia
,
sit
at
the
table
twist
a
hat
in
her
hand
,
watch
he
;
see
he
smile
.
he
be
happy
then
.
but
she
could
not
bear
to
see
he
smile
.
it
be
not
marriage
;
it
be
not
be
one
's
husband
to
look
strange
like
that
,
always
to
be
start
,
laugh
,
sit
hour
after
hour
silent
,
or
clutch
she
and
tell
she
to
write
.
the
table
drawer
be
full
of
those
writing
;
about
war
;
about
Shakespeare
;
about
great
discovery
;
how
there
be
no
death
.
lately
he
have
become
excited
suddenly
for
no
reason
(
and
both
Dr.
Holmes
and
Sir
William
Bradshaw
say
excitement
be
the
bad
thing
for
he
)
,
and
wave
his
hand
and
cry
out
that
he
know
the
truth
!
he
know
everything
!
that
man
,
his
friend
who
be
kill
,
Evans
,
have
come
,
he
say
.
he
be
singe
behind
the
screen
.
she
write
it
down
just
as
he
speak
it
.
some
thing
be
very
beautiful
;
other
sheer
nonsense
.
and
he
be
always
stop
in
the
middle
,
change
his
mind
;
want
to
add
something
;
hear
something
new
;
listen
with
his
hand
up
.




but
she
hear
nothing
.




and
once
they
find
the
girl
who
do
the
room
read
one
of

a
wonderful
eye
,
and
often
he
be
right
,
sometimes
absurd
,

sometimes
wonderfully
right
.

careful
,
he

,
to
keep
it
just
as

might
go
in

out
,
on
the
tassel
,
on

pocket
of
still
air
,

one
come
on
at
the
edge
of
a
wood
sometimes
in

it
be
wonderful
.
never

be
always
thin
;
but
he
have
a
beautiful
fresh
colour
;
and
with
his
big
nose
,
his
bright
eye
,
his
way
of

a
little
hunch

,
any
little
bother
with
her

,
anything
that
strike
she
to
say

,
and
always

he

they
be
;
who
mix
the
vision

;
see
nothing
clear
,

,
she
say
,
nothing

she
sit
down
beside
he
and
call
he
by
the
name
of
that
hawk

crow
which
be
malicious

a
great
destroyer

no

get
up
to
go
into

bedroom
to

bar
his

there

Bloomsbury

rather
melodramatic
business
of

,
the
caress
of
the
sea
,
as
it
seem
to
she
,
hollow
they
in
its
arched
shell
and
murmur
to
she
lay
on
shore
,
strew
she
feel
,
like
fly
flower
over
some
tomb
.




"
he
be
dead
,
"
she
say
,
smile
at
the
poor
old
woman
who
guard
she
with
her
honest
light
-
blue
eye
fix
on
the
door
.
(
they
would
n't
bring
he
in
here
,
would
they
?
)
but
Mrs.
Filmer
pooh
-
poohe
.
oh
no
,
oh
no
!
they
be
carry
he
away
now
.
Ought
she
not
to
be
tell
?
married
people
ought
to
be
together
,
Mrs.
Filmer
think
.
but
they
must
do
as
the
doctor
say
.




"
let
she
sleep
,
"
say
Dr.
Holmes
,
feel
her
pulse
.
she
see
the
large
outline
of
his
body
stand
dark
against
the
window
.
so
that
be
Dr.
Holmes
.




one
of
the
triumph
of
civilisation
,
Peter
Walsh
think
.
it
be
one
of
the
triumph
of
civilisation
,
as
the
light
high
bell
of
the
ambulance
sound
.
swiftly
,
cleanly
the
ambulance
speed
to
the
hospital
,
having
pick
up
instantly
,
humanely
,
some
poor
devil
;
some
one
hit
on
the
head
,
strike
down
by
disease
,
knock
over
perhaps
a
minute
or
so
ago
at
one
of
these
crossing
,
as
might
happen
to
oneself
.
that
be
civilisation
.
it
strike
he
come
back
from
the
East
--
the
efficiency
,
the
organisation
,
the
communal
spirit
of
London
.
every
cart
or
carriage
of
its
own
accord
draw
aside
to
let
the
ambulance
pass
.
perhaps
it
be
morbid
;
or
be
it
not
touch
rather
,
the
respect
which
they
show
this
ambulance
with
its
victim
inside
--
busy
man
hurry
home
yet
instantly
bethink
they
as
it
pass
of
some
wife
;
or
presumably
how
easily
it
might
have
be
they
there
,
stretch
on
a
shelf
with
a
doctor
and
a
nurse
.
.
.
.
ah
,
but
thinking
become
morbid
,
sentimental
,
directly
one
begin
conjure
up
doctor
,
dead
body
;
a
little
glow
of
pleasure
,
a
sort
of
lust
too
over
the
visual
impression
warn
one
not
to
go
on
with
that
sort
of
thing
any
more
--
fatal
to
art
,
fatal
to
friendship
.
true
.
and
yet
,
think
Peter
Walsh
,
as
the
ambulance
turn
the
corner
though
the
light
high
bell
could
be
hear
down
the
next
street
and
still
far
as
it
cross
the
Tottenham
Court
Road
,
chime
constantly
,
it
be
the
privilege
of
loneliness
;
in
privacy
one
may
do
as
one
choose
.
one
might
weep
if
no
one
see
.
it
have
be
his
undoing
--
this
susceptibility
--
in
anglo
-
indian
society
;
not
weep
at
the
right
time
,
or
laugh
either
.
I
have
that
in
I
,
he
think
stand
by
the
pillar
-
box
,
which
could
now
dissolve
in
tear
.
why
,
Heaven
know
.
beauty
of
some
sort
probably
,
and
the
weight
of
the
day
,
which
begin
with
that
visit
to
Clarissa
have
exhaust
he
with
its
heat
,
its
intensity
,
and
the
drip
,
drip
,
of
one
impression
after
another
down
into
that
cellar
where
they
stand
,
deep
,
dark
,
and
no
one
would
ever
know
.
partly
for
that
reason
,
its
secrecy
,
complete
and
inviolable
,
he
have
find
life
like
an
unknown
garden
,
full
of
turn
and
corner
,
surprising
,
yes
;
really
it
take
one
's
breath
away
,
these
moment
;
there
come
to
he
by
the
pillar
-
box
opposite
the
British
Museum
one
of
they
,
a
moment
,
in
which
thing
come
together
;
this
ambulance
;
and
life
and
death
.
it
be
as
if
he
be
suck
up
to
some
very
high
roof
by
that
rush
of
emotion
and
the
rest
of
he
,
like
a
white
shell
-
sprinkle
beach
,
leave
bare
.
it
have
be
his
undoing
in
anglo
-
indian
society
--
this
susceptibility
.




clarissa
once
,
go
on
top
of
an
omnibus
with
he
somewhere
,
Clarissa
superficially
at
least
,
so
easily
move
,
now
in
despair
,
now
in
the
good
of
spirit
,
all
aquiver
in
those
day
and
such
good
company
,
spot
queer
little
scene
,
name
,
people
from
the
top
of
a
bus
,
for
they
use
to
explore
London
and
bring
back
bag
full
of
treasure
from
the
caledonian
market
--
Clarissa
have
a
theory
in
those
day
--
they
have
heap
of
theory
,
always
theory
,
as
young
people
have
.
it
be
to
explain
the
feeling
they
have
of
dissatisfaction
;
not
know
people
;
not
be
know
.
for
how
could
they
know
each
other
?
you
meet
every
day
;
then
not
for
six
month
,
or
year
.
it
be
unsatisfactory
,
they
agree
,
how
little
one
know
people
.
but
she
say
,
sit
on
the
bus
go
up
Shaftesbury
Avenue
,
she
feel
herself
everywhere
;
not
"
here
,
here
,
here
"
;
and
she
tap
the
back
of
the
seat
;
but
everywhere
.
she
wave
her
hand
,
go
up
Shaftesbury
Avenue
.
she
be
all
that
.
so
that
to
know
she
,
or
any
one
,
one
must
seek
out
the
people
who
complete
they
;
even
the
place
.
Odd
affinity
she
have
with
people
she
have
never
speak
to
,
some
woman
in
the
street
,
some
man
behind
a
counter
--
even
tree
,
or
barn
.
it
end
in
a
transcendental
theory
which
,
with
her
horror
of
death
,
allow
she
to
believe
,
or
say
that
she
believe
(
for
all
her
scepticism
)
,
that
since
our
apparition
,
the
part
of
we
which
appear
,
be
so
momentary
compare
with
the
other
,
the
unseen
part
of
we
,
which
spread
wide
,
the
unseen
might
survive
,
be
recover
somehow
attach
to
this
person
or
that
,
or
even
haunt
certain
place
after
death
.
.
.
perhaps
--
perhaps
.




look
back
over
that
long
friendship
of
almost
thirty
year
her
theory
work
to
this
extent
.
brief
,
break
,
often
painful
as
their
actual
meeting
have
be
what
with
his
absence
and
interruption
(
this
morning
,
for
instance
,
in
come
Elizabeth
,
like
a
long
-
legged
colt
,
handsome
,
dumb
,
just
as
he
be
begin
to
talk
to
Clarissa
)
the
effect
of
they
on
his
life
be
immeasurable
.
there
be
a
mystery
about
it
.
you
be
give
a
sharp
,
acute
,
uncomfortable
grain
--
the
actual
meeting
;
horribly
painful
as
often
as
not
;
yet
in
absence
,
in
the
most
unlikely
place
,
it
would
flower
out
,
open
,
shed
its
scent
,
let
you
touch
,
taste
,
look
about
you
,
get
the
whole
feel
of
it
and
understanding
,
after
year
of
lie
lose
.
thus
she
have
come
to
he
;
on
board
ship
;
in
the
Himalayas
;
suggest
by
the
oddest
thing
(
so
Sally
Seton
,
generous
,
enthusiastic
goose
!
thought
of
he
when
she
see
blue
hydrangea
)
.
she
have
influence
he
more
than
any
person
he
have
ever
know
.
and
always
in
this
way
come
before
he
without
his
wish
it
,
cool
,
lady
-
like
,
critical
;
or
ravish
,
romantic
,
recall
some
field
or
english
harvest
.
he
see
she
most
often
in
the
country
,
not
in
London
.
one
scene
after
another
at
Bourton
.
.
.
.




he
have
reach
his
hotel
.
he
cross
the
hall
,
with
its
mound
of
reddish
chair
and
sofas
,
its
spike
-
leave
,
withered
-
look
plant
.
he
get
his
key
off
the
hook
.
the
young
lady
hand
he
some
letter
.
he
go
upstairs
--
he
see
she
most
often
at
Bourton
,
in
the
late
summer
,
when
he
stay
there
for
a
week
,
or
fortnight
even
,
as
people
do
in
those
day
.
first
on
top
of
some
hill
there
she
would
stand
,
hand
clap
to
her
hair
,
her
cloak
blow
out
,
point
,
cry
to
they
--
she
see
the
Severn
beneath
.
or
in
a
wood
,
make
the
kettle
boil
--
very
ineffective
with
her
finger
;
the
smoke
curtsey
,
blow
in
their
face
;
her
little
pink
face
show
through
;
beg
water
from
an
old
woman
in
a
cottage
,
who
come
to
the
door
to
watch
they
go
.
they
walk
always
;
the
other
drive
.
she
be
bored
driving
,
dislike
all
animal
,
except
that
dog
.
they
tramp
mile
along
road
.
she
would
break
off
to
get
her
bearing
,
pilot
he
back
across
country
;
and
all
the
time
they
argue
,
discuss
poetry
,
discuss
people
,
discuss
politic
(
she
be
a
Radical
then
)
;
never
notice
a
thing
except
when
she
stop
,
cry
out
at
a
view
or
a
tree
,
and
make
he
look
with
she
;
and
so
on
again
,
through
stubble
field
,
she
walk
ahead
,
with
a
flower
for
her
aunt
,
never
tired
of
walk
for
all
her
delicacy
;
to
drop
down
on
Bourton
in
the
dusk
.
then
,
after
dinner
,
old
Breitkopf
would
open
the
piano
and
sing
without
any
voice
,
and
they
would
lie
sink
in
arm
-
chair
,
try
not
to
laugh
,
but
always
break
down
and
laugh
,
laugh
--
laugh
at
nothing
.
Breitkopf
be
suppose
not
to
see
.
and
then
in
the
morning
,
flirt
up
and
down
like
a
wagtail
in
front
of
the
house
.
.
.
.




oh
it
be
a
letter
from
she
!
this
blue
envelope
;
that
be
her
hand
.
and
he
would
have
to
read
it
.
here
be
another
of
those
meeting
,
bind
to
be
painful
!
to
read
her
letter
need
the
devil
of
an
effort
.
"
how
heavenly
it
be
to
see
he
.
she
must
tell
he
that
.
"
that
be
all
.




but
it
upset
he
.
it
annoy
he
.
he
wish
she
have
n't
write
it
.
come
on
top
of
his
thought
,
it
be
like
a
nudge
in
the
rib
.
why
could
n't
she
let
he
be
?
after
all
,
she
have
marry
Dalloway
,
and
live
with
he
in
perfect
happiness
all
these
year
.




these
hotel
be
not
console
place
.
far
from
it
.
any
number
of
people
have
hang
up
their
hat
on
those
peg
.
even
the
fly
,
if
you
think
of
it
,
have
settle
on
other
people
's
nose
.
as
for
the
cleanliness
which
hit
he
in
the
face
,
it
be
n't
cleanliness
,
so
much
as
bareness
,
frigidity
;
a
thing
that
have
to
be
.
some
arid
matron
make
her
round
at
dawn
sniff
,
peer
,
cause
blue
-
nosed
maid
to
scour
,
for
all
the
world
as
if
the
next
visitor
be
a
joint
of
meat
to
be
serve
on
a
perfectly
clean
platter
.
for
sleep
,
one
bed
;
for
sit
in
,
one
armchair
;
for
clean
one
's
tooth
and
shave
one
's
chin
,
one
tumbler
,
one
look
-
glass
.
book
,
letter
,
dressing
-
gown
,
slip
about
on
the
impersonality
of
the
horsehair
like
incongruous
impertinence
.
and
it
be
Clarissa
's
letter
that
make
he
see
all
this
.
"
heavenly
to
see
you
.
she
must
say
so
!
"
he
fold
the
paper
;
push
it
away
;
nothing
would
induce
he
to
read
it
again
!




to
get
that
letter
to
he
by
six
o'clock
she
must
have
sit
down
and
write
it
directly
he
leave
she
;
stamp
it
;
send
somebody
to
the
post
.
it
be
,
as
people
say
,
very
like
she
.
she
be
upset
by
his
visit
.
she
have
feel
a
great
deal
;
have
for
a
moment
,
when
she
kiss
his
hand
,
regret
,
envy
he
even
,
remember
possibly
(
for
he
see
she
look
it
)
something
he
have
say
--
how
they
would
change
the
world
if
she
marry
he
perhaps
;
whereas
,
it
be
this
;
it
be
middle
age
;
it
be
mediocrity
;
then
force
herself
with
her
indomitable
vitality
to
put
all
that
aside
,
there
be
in
she
a
thread
of
life
which
for
toughness
,
endurance
,
power
to
overcome
obstacle
,
and
carry
she
triumphantly
through
he
have
never
know
the
like
of
.
yes
;
but
there
would
come
a
reaction
directly
he
leave
the
room
.
she
would
be
frightfully
sorry
for
he
;
she
would
think
what
in
the
world
she
could
do
to
give
he
pleasure
(
short
always
of
the
one
thing
)
and
he
could
see
she
with
the
tear
run
down
her
cheek
go
to
her
writing
-
table
and
dash
off
that
one
line
which
he
be
to
find
greet
he
.
.
.
.
"
heavenly
to
see
you
!
"
and
she
mean
it
.




Peter
Walsh
have
now
unlaced
his
boot
.




but
it
would
not
have
be
a
success
,
their
marriage
.
the
other
thing
,
after
all
,
come
so
much
more
naturally
.




it
be
odd
;
it
be
true
;
lot
of
people
feel
it
.
Peter
Walsh
,
who
have
do
just
respectably
,
fill
the
usual
post
adequately
,
be
like
,
but
think
a
little
cranky
,
give
himself
air
--
it
be
odd
that
he
should
have
have
,
especially
now
that
his
hair
be
grey
,
a
contented
look
;
a
look
of
have
reserve
.
it
be
this
that
make
he
attractive
to
woman
who
like
the
sense
that
he
be
not
altogether
manly
.
there
be
something
unusual
about
he
,
or
something
behind
he
.
it
might
be
that
he
be
bookish
--
never
come
to
see
you
without
take
up
the
book
on
the
table
(
he
be
now
read
,
with
his
bootlace
trail
on
the
floor
)
;
or
that
he
be
a
gentleman
,
which
show
itself
in
the
way
he
knock
the
ashe
out
of
his
pipe
,
and
in
his
manner
of
course
to
woman
.
for
it
be
very
charming
and
quite
ridiculous
how
easily
some
girl
without
a
grain
of
sense
could
twist
he
round
her
finger
.
but
at
her
own
risk
.
that
be
to
say
,
though
he
might
be
ever
so
easy
,
and
indeed
with
his
gaiety
and
good
-
breed
fascinating
to
be
with
,
it
be
only
up
to
a
point
.
she
say
something
--
no
,
no
;
he
see
through
that
.
he
would
n't
stand
that
--
no
,
no
.
then
he
could
shout
and
rock
and
hold
his
side
together
over
some
joke
with
man
.
he
be
the
good
judge
of
cooking
in
India
.
he
be
a
man
.
but
not
the
sort
of
man
one
have
to
respect
--
which
be
a
mercy
;
not
like
Major
Simmons
,
for
instance
;
not
in
the
least
like
that
,
Daisy
think
,
when
,
in
spite
of
her
two
small
child
,
she
use
to
compare
they
.




he
pull
off
his
boot
.
he
empty
his
pocket
.
out
come
with
his
pocket
-
knife
a
snapshot
of
Daisy
on
the
verandah
;
Daisy
all
in
white
,
with
a
fox
-
terrier
on
her
knee
;
very
charming
,
very
dark
;
the
good
he
have
ever
see
of
she
.
it
do
come
,
after
all
so
naturally
;
so
much
more
naturally
than
Clarissa
.
no
fuss
.
no
bother
.
no
finicking
and
fidgeting
.
all
plain
sailing
.
and
the
dark
,
adorably
pretty
girl
on
the
verandah
exclaim
(
he
could
hear
she
)
.
of
course
,
of
course
she
would
give
he
everything
!
she
cry
(
she
have
no
sense
of
discretion
)
everything
he
want
!
she
cry
,
run
to
meet
he
,
whoever
might
be
look
.
and
she
be
only
twenty
-
four
.
and
she
have
two
child
.
well
,
well
!




well
indeed
he
have
get
himself
into
a
mess
at
his
age
.
and
it
come
over
he
when
he
wake
in
the
night
pretty
forcibly
.
suppose
they
do
marry
?
for
he
it
would
be
all
very
well
,
but
what
about
she
?
Mrs.
Burgess
,
a
good
sort
and
no
chatterbox
,
in
whom
he
have
confide
,
think
this
absence
of
his
in
England
,
ostensibly
to
see
lawyer
might
serve
to
make
Daisy
reconsider
,
think
what
it
mean
.
it
be
a
question
of
her
position
,
Mrs.
Burgess
say
;
the
social
barrier
;
give
up
her
child
.
she
'd
be
a
widow
with
a
past
one
of
these
day
,
draggle
about
in
the
suburb
,
or
more
likely
,
indiscriminate
(
you
know
,
she
say
,
what
such
woman
get
like
,
with
too
much
paint
)
.
but
Peter
Walsh
pooh
-
poohe
all
that
.
he
do
n't
mean
to
die
yet
.
anyhow
she
must
settle
for
herself
;
judge
for
herself
,
he
think
,
pad
about
the
room
in
his
sock
,
smooth
out
his
dress
-
shirt
,
for
he
might
go
to
Clarissa
's
party
,
or
he
might
go
to
one
of
the
Halls
,
or
he
might
settle
in
and
read
an
absorb
book
write
by
a
man
he
use
to
know
at
Oxford
.
and
if
he
do
retire
,
that
be
what
he
'd
do
--
write
book
.
he
would
go
to
Oxford
and
poke
about
in
the
Bodleian
.
vainly
the
dark
,
adorably
pretty
girl
run
to
the
end
of
the
terrace
;
vainly
wave
her
hand
;
vainly
cry
she
do
n't
care
a
straw
what
people
say
.
there
he
be
,
the
man
she
think
the
world
of
,
the
perfect
gentleman
,
the
fascinating
,
the
distinguished
(
and
his
age
make
not
the
least
difference
to
she
)
,
pad
about
a
room
in
an
hotel
in
Bloomsbury
,
shaving
,
washing
,
continue
,
as
he
take
up
can
,
put
down
razor
,
to
poke
about
in
the
Bodleian
,
and
get
at
the
truth
about
one
or
two
little
matter
that
interest
he
.
and
he
would
have
a
chat
with
whoever
it
might
be
,
and
so
come
to
disregard
more
and
more
precise
hour
for
lunch
,
and
miss
engagement
,
and
when
Daisy
ask
he
,
as
she
would
,
for
a
kiss
,
a
scene
,
fail
to
come
up
to
the
scratch
(
though
he
be
genuinely
devoted
to
her)--in
short
it
might
be
happy
,
as
Mrs.
Burgess
say
,
that
she
should
forget
he
,
or
merely
remember
he
as
he
be
in
August
1922
,
like
a
figure
stand
at
the
cross
road
at
dusk
,
which
grow
more
and
more
remote
as
the
dog
-
cart
spin
away
,
carry
she
securely
fasten
to
the
back
seat
,
though
her
arm
be
outstretche
,
and
as
she
see
the
figure
dwindle
and
disappear
still
she
cry
out
how
she
would
do
anything
in
the
world
,
anything
,
anything
,
anything
.
.
.
.




he
never
know
what
people
think
.
it
become
more
and
more
difficult
for
he
to
concentrate
.
he
became
absorb
;
he
become
busy
with
his
own
concern
;
now
surly
,
now
gay
;
dependent
on
woman
,
absent
-
minded
,
moody
,
less
and
less
able
(
so
he
think
as
he
shave
)
to
understand
why
Clarissa
could
n't
simply
find
they
a
lodging
and
be
nice
to
Daisy
;
introduce
she
.
and
then
he
could
just
--
just
do
what
?
just
haunt
and
hover
(
he
be
at
the
moment
actually
engage
in
sort
out
various
key
,
paper
)
,
swoop
and
taste
,
be
alone
,
in
short
,
sufficient
to
himself
;
and
yet
nobody
of
course
be
more
dependent
upon
other
(
he
button
his
waistcoat
)
;
it
have
be
his
undoing
.
he
could
not
keep
out
of
smoking
-
room
,
like
colonel
,
like
golf
,
like
bridge
,
and
above
all
woman
's
society
,
and
the
fineness
of
their
companionship
,
and
their
faithfulness
and
audacity
and
greatness
in
love
which
though
it
have
its
drawback
seem
to
he
(
and
the
dark
,
adorably
pretty
face
be
on
top
of
the
envelope
)
so
wholly
admirable
,
so
splendid
a
flower
to
grow
on
the
crest
of
human
life
,
and
yet
he
could
not
come
up
to
the
scratch
,
be
always
apt
to
see
round
thing
(
Clarissa
have
sap
something
in
he
permanently
)
,
and
to
tire
very
easily
of
mute
devotion
and
to
want
variety
in
love
,
though
it
would
make
he
furious
if
Daisy
love
anybody
else
,
furious
!
for
he
be
jealous
,
uncontrollably
jealous
by
temperament
.
he
suffer
torture
!
but
where
be
his
knife
;
his
watch
;
his
seal
,
his
note
-
case
,
and
Clarissa
's
letter
which
he
would
not
read
again
but
like
to
think
of
,
and
Daisy
's
photograph
?
and
now
for
dinner
.




they
be
eat
.




sit
at
little
table
round
vase
,
dress
or
not
dress
,
with
their
shawl
and
bag
lay
beside
they
,
with
their
air
of
false
composure
,
for
they
be
not
use
to
so
many
course
at
dinner
,
and
confidence
,
for
they
be
able
to
pay
for
it
,
and
strain
,
for
they
have
be
run
about
London
all
day
shopping
,
sightseeing
;
and
their
natural
curiosity
,
for
they
look
round
and
up
as
the
nice
-
look
gentleman
in
horn
-
rim
spectacle
come
in
,
and
their
good
nature
,
for
they
would
have
be
glad
to
do
any
little
service
,
such
as
lend
a
time
-
table
or
impart
useful
information
,
and
their
desire
,
pulse
in
they
,
tug
at
they
subterraneously
,
somehow
to
establish
connection
if
it
be
only
a
birthplace
(
Liverpool
,
for
example
)
in
common
or
friend
of
the
same
name
;
with
their
furtive
glance
,
odd
silence
,
and
sudden
withdrawal
into
family
jocularity
and
isolation
;
there
they
sit
eat
dinner
when
Mr.
Walsh
come
in
and
take
his
seat
at
a
little
table
by
the
curtain
.




it
be
not
that
he
say
anything
,
for
be
solitary
he
could
only
address
himself
to
the
waiter
;
it
be
his
way
of
look
at
the
menu
,
of
point
his
forefinger
to
a
particular
wine
,
of
hitch
himself
up
to
the
table
,
of
address
himself
seriously
,
not
gluttonously
to
dinner
,
that
win
he
their
respect
;
which
,
have
to
remain
unexpressed
for
the
great
part
of
the
meal
,
flare
up
at
the
table
where
the
Morrises
sit
when
Mr.
Walsh
be
hear
to
say
at
the
end
of
the
meal
,
"
Bartlett
pear
.
"
why
he
should
have
speak
so
moderately
yet
firmly
,
with
the
air
of
a
disciplinarian
well
within
his
right
which
be
found
upon
justice
,
neither
young
Charles
Morris
,
nor
old
Charles
,
neither
Miss
Elaine
nor
Mrs.
Morris
know
.
but
when
he
say
,
"
Bartlett
pear
,
"
sit
alone
at
his
table
,
they
feel
that
he
count
on
their
support
in
some
lawful
demand
;
be
champion
of
a
cause
which
immediately
become
their
own
,
so
that
their
eye
meet
his
eye
sympathetically
,
and
when
they
all
reach
the
smoking
-
room
simultaneously
,
a
little
talk
between
they
become
inevitable
.




it
be
not
very
profound
--
only
to
the
effect
that
London
be
crowded
;
have
change
in
thirty
year
;
that
Mr.
Morris
prefer
Liverpool
;
that
Mrs.
Morris
have
be
to
the
Westminster
flower
-
show
,
and
that
they
have
all
see
the
Prince
of
Wales
.
yet
,
think
Peter
Walsh
,
no
family
in
the
world
can
compare
with
the
Morrises
;

;
but
they
would
meet
again
.
)
he
would
go
to
Clarissa

,
because

for
this
be
the
truth
about
our

there
.
one
might
fancy
that
day
,
the
London
day
,
be
just
begin
.
like
a
woman
who
have
slip
off
her

white
apron
to
array
herself
in

,
the
day
change
,
put
off
stuff
,
take
gauze
,
change
to
evening
,
and
with
the
same
sigh
of
exhilaration
that
a
woman
breathe
,
tumbling
petticoat
on
the
floor
,
it
too
shed
dust
,
heat
,
colour
;
the
traffic
thin
;
motor

,
tinkle
,
darting
,
succeed
the
lumber
of
van
;
and
here
and
there
among
the
thick
foliage
of
the
square
an
intense
light
hang
.
I
resign
,
the
evening
seem
to
say
,
as
it
pale
and
fade
above
the

prominence
,
mould
,

I
fade
,
she
be

,
I
disappear
,
but
London
would
have
none
of
it
,
and
rush
her
bayonet
into
the
sky
,
pinion
she
,
constrain
she
to
partnership
in
her
revelry
.




for
the
great
revolution
of
Mr.

's
summer
time
have
take
place
since
Peter

's
last
visit
to
England
.
the
prolong
evening
be
new
to
he
.
it
be
inspirit
,
rather
.
for
as
the
young
people
go
by
with
their
despatch
-
box
,
awfully
glad
to
be
free
,
proud
too
,
dumbly
,
of
step
this
famous
pavement
,
joy
of
a
kind
,
cheap
,
tinselly
,
if
you
like
,
but
all
the
same
rapture
,
flush
their
face
.
they
dress
well
too
;
pink
stocking
;
pretty
shoe
.
they
would
now
have
two
hour
at
the
picture
.
it
sharpen
,
it
refine
they
,
the
yellow
-
blue
evening
light
;
and
on
the
leave
in
the
square
shone
lurid
,
livid
--
they
look
as
if
dip
in
sea
water
--
the
foliage
of
a
submerged
city
.
he
be
astonish
by
the
beauty
;
it
be
encourage
too
,
for
where
the
return
Anglo

by
right
(
he

crowd
of
they
)
in
the
Oriental
Club
biliously
sum
up
the
ruin
of
the
world
,
here
be
he
,
as
young
as
ever
;
envy
young
people
their
summer
time
and
the
rest
of
it
,
and
more
than
suspect
from
the
word
of
a
girl
,
from
a
housemaid
's
laughter
--
intangible
thing
you
could
n't
lay
your
hand
on
--
that
shift
in
the
whole
pyramidal
accumulation
which
in
his
youth
have
seem
immovable
.
on
top
of
they
it
have
press
;
weigh
they
down
,
the
woman
especially
,
like
those
flower

Aunt
Helena
use
to
press
between
sheet
of
grey
blotting
-
paper
with
Littré
's
dictionary
on
top
,
sit
under
the
lamp
after
dinner
.
she
be
dead
now
.
he
have
hear
of
she
,
from
Clarissa
,
lose
the
sight
of
one
eye
.
it
seem
so
fitting
--
one
of
nature
's
masterpiece
--
that
old
Miss
Parry
should
turn
to
glass
.
she
would
die
like
some
bird
in
a
frost
grip
her
perch
.
she
belong
to
a
different
age
,
but
be
so
entire
,
so
complete
,
would
always
stand
up
on
the
horizon
,
stone
-
white
,
eminent
,
like
a
lighthouse
mark
some
past
stage
on
this
adventurous
,
long
,
long
voyage
,
this
interminable
(
he
feel
for
a
copper
to
buy
a
paper
and
read
about
Surrey
and
Yorkshire
--
he
have
hold
out
that
copper
million
of
time
.
Surrey
be
all
out
once
more)--this
interminable
life
.
but
cricket
be
no
mere
game
.
Cricket
be
important
.
he
could
never
help
read
about
cricket
.
he
read
the
score
in
the
stop
press
first
,
then
how
it
be
a
hot
day
;
then
about
a
murder
case
.
having
do
thing
million
of
time
enrich
they
,
though
it
might
be
say
to
take
the
surface
off
.
the
past
enrich
,
and
experience
,
and
having
care
for
one
or
two
people
,
and
so
having
acquire
the
power
which
the
young
lack
,
of
cut
short
,
do
what
one
like
,
not
care
a
rap
what
people
say
and
come
and
go
without
any
very
great
expectation
(
he
leave
his
paper
on
the
table
and
move
off
)
,
which
however
(
and
he
look
for
his
hat
and
coat
)
be
not
altogether
true
of
he
,
not
to

night
,
for
here
he
be
start
to
go
to
a
party
,
at
his
age
,
with
the
belief
upon
he
that
he
be
about
to
have
an
experience
.
but
what
?




Beauty
anyhow
.
not
the
crude
beauty
of
the
eye
.
it
be
not
beauty
pure
and
simple
--
Bedford
Place
lead
into
Russell
Square
.
it
be
straightness
and
emptiness
of
course
;
the
symmetry
of
a
corridor
;
but
it
be
also
window
light
up
,
a
piano
,
a
gramophone
sound
;
a
sense
of
pleasure

,

now
and
again
emerge
when

dry
on

,
a
parrot
,
a

.
absorbing
,
mysterious
,
of
infinite
richness
,
this
life
.
and
in
the
large
square
where
the
cab
shoot
and
swerve
so
quick
,
there
be
loitering
couple
,
dally
,
embrace
,
shrink
up
under
the
shower
of
a

;
that
be

so
silent
,
so
absorb
,

pass
,
discreetly
,
timidly
,
as
if
in
the
presence
of
some
sacred
ceremony
to
interrupt
which
would
have
be
impious
.
that
be
interesting
.
and
so
on
into
the
flare
and
glare
.




his
light
overcoat

indescribable
idiosyncrasy
,

,
with
his

Lord

there
apologise
for
his
wife
who
have
catch
cold
at
the
Buckingham
Palace
garden
party
.
she
could
see
Peter
out
of
the
tail
of
her
eye

criticise
she
,
there
,
in

why
,

burn
she

anything

brandish
one

dwindle
away

in
a
corner
.
he
make
she
see
herself
;
exaggerate
.
it
be
idiotic
.
but
why
do
he
come
,
then
,
merely
to
criticise
?
why
always
take
,

one
little
point

what
Lord

that
his
wife
would
not
wear
her
fur
at
the
garden
party

five

it
make
she
feel
quite
sick
to
know

anything
,
any

well
than
people
wander
aimlessly
,

in
a
bunch
at
a
corner

Ellie
Henderson
,
not
even
care
to

gently
the
yellow
curtain
with
all
the
bird
of
Paradise
blow
out

it
seem
as
if
there
be
a
flight
of
wing
into
the
room
,
right
out
,
then
suck
back
.

for
the
window

open
.

be
it
draughty
,
Ellie
Henderson
wonder
?
she
be
subject
to
chill
.
but
it
do
not
matter
that
she
should
come
down
sneeze
to

morrow
;
it
be
the
girl
with
their
naked
shoulder

think
of
,

train
to
think
of
other
by
an
old
father
,
an
invalid
,
late
vicar
of
Bourton
,
but
he
be
dead
now
;
and
her
chill
never
go
to
her
chest
,
never
.
it
be
the
girl
she
think
of
,
the
young
girl
with
their
bare
shoulder
,
she
herself
having
always
be
a
wisp
of
a
creature
,
with
her
thin
hair
and
meagre
profile
;
though
now
,
past
fifty
,
there
be
begin
to
shine
through
some
mild
beam
,
something
purify
into
distinction
by
year
of
self
-
abnegation
but
obscure
again
,
perpetually
,
by
her
distressing
gentility
,
her
panic
fear
,
which
arise
from
three
hundred
pound
'
income
,
and
her
weaponless
state
(
she
could
not
earn
a
penny
)
and
it
make
she
timid
,
and
more
and
more
disqualified
year
by
year
to
meet
well
-
dress
people
who
do
this
sort
of
thing
every
night
of
the
season
,
merely
tell
their
maid
"
I
'll
wear
so
and
so
,
"
whereas
Ellie
Henderson
run
out
nervously
and
buy
cheap
pink
flower
,
half
a
dozen
,
and
then
throw
a
shawl
over
her
old
black
dress
.
for
her
invitation
to
Clarissa
's
party
have
come
at
the
last
moment
.
she
be
not
quite
happy
about
it
.
she
have
a
sort
of
feeling
that
Clarissa
have
not
mean
to
ask
she
this
year
.




why
should
she
?
there
be
no
reason
really
,
except
that
they
have
always
know
each
other
.
indeed
,
they
be
cousin
.
but
naturally
they
have
rather
drift
apart
,
Clarissa
be
so
seek
after
.
it
be
an
event
to
she
,
go
to
a
party
.
it
be
quite
a
treat
just
to
see
the
lovely
clothe
.
be
n't
that
Elizabeth
,
grow
up
,
with
her
hair
do
in
the
fashionable
way
,
in
the
pink
dress
?
yet
she
could
not
be
more
than
seventeen
.
she
be
very
,
very
handsome
.
but
girl
when
they
first
come
out
do
n't
seem
to
wear
white
as
they
use
.
(
she
must
remember
everything
to
tell
Edith
.
)
girl
wear
straight
frock
,
perfectly
tight
,
with
skirt
well
above
the
ankle
.
it
be
not
become
,
she
think
.




so
,
with
her
weak
eyesight
,
Ellie
Henderson
crane
rather
forward
,
and
it
be
n't
so
much
she
who
mind
not
have
any
one
to
talk
to
(
she
hardly
know
anybody
there
)
,
for
she
feel
that
they
be
all
such
interesting
people
to
watch
;
politician
presumably
;
Richard
Dalloway
's
friend
;
but
it
be
Richard
himself
who
feel
that
he
could
not
let
the
poor
creature
go
on
stand
there
all
the
evening
by
herself
.




"
well
,
Ellie
,
and
how
be
the
world
treat
you
?
"
he
say
in
his
genial
way
,
and
Ellie
Henderson
,
get
nervous
and
flush
and
feel
that
it
be
extraordinarily
nice
of
he
to
come
and
talk
to
she
,
say
that
many
people
really
feel
the
heat
more
than
the
cold
.




"
yes
,
they
do
,
"
say
Richard
Dalloway
.
"
yes
.
"




but
what
more
do
one
say
?




"
Hullo
,
Richard
,
"
say
somebody
,
take
he
by
the
elbow

ever
so
pleased
to
see
he
!
he
have
n't
change
a
bit
.
and
off
they
go
together
walk
right
across
the
room
,
give
each
other
little
pat
,
as
if
they
have
n't
meet
for
a
long
time
,
Ellie
Henderson

dark
,
wear

,
with
a
look
of
John
Burrows
.
Edith
would
be
sure
to
know
.




the

out
again

Clarissa

she
see
Ralph

go
on
,
they
go
into
the
room
;
into
something
now
,
not
nothing
,
since
Ralph
Lyon
have
beat
back
the
curtain
.




and
yet
for
her
own
part
,
it
be
too
much
of
an
effort
.
she
be
not

it
be
too
much
like

a
little
admire

n't
help
feel
that

,
make
this
happen
,
that
it
mark
a
stage
,
this
post
that
she
feel
herself
to
have
become
,
for
oddly
enough
she
have
quite
forget
what
she
look
like
,
but
feel
herself
a
stake
drive
in
at
the
top
of
her
stair
.
every
time
she
give
a
party
she
have
this
feeling
of
be
something
not

and
that
every
one
be
unreal
in
one
way
;
much
more
real
in
another

,
partly
their

,
partly
be
take
out
of
their
ordinary
way
,
partly
the
background
,
it
be
possible
to
say
thing
you
could
n't
say
anyhow
else
,
thing
that
need
an
effort
;

go
much
deeply

it
be
perfectly
plain
that
they
all
know
,
feel
to
the
marrow
of
their
bone
,
this
majesty
passing
;
this
symbol
of
what
they
all
stand
for
,
english
society
.
Old
Lady
Bruton
,
and
she
look
very
fine
too
,
very
stalwart
in
her
lace

swam
up
,
and
they
withdraw
into
a
little
room

at
once
became
spy
upon
,
guard
,

a
sort
of
stir

rustle
ripple
through
every

openly
:

Lord
,
lord
,
the
snobbery
of
the
English
!
think
Peter
Walsh
,
stand
in
the
corner
.
how
they
love
dress
up
in
gold
lace
and
do
homage
!
there
!
that
must
be
,
by
Jove
it
be
,
Hugh
Whitbread
,
snuff
round
the
precinct
of
the
great
,
grow
rather
fatter
,
rather
whiter
,
the
admirable
Hugh
!




he
look
always
as
if
he
be
on
duty
,
think
Peter
,
a
privileged
,
but
secretive
being
,
hoard
secret
which
he
would
die
to
defend
,
though
it
be
only
some
little
piece
of
tittle
-
tattle
drop
by
a
court
footman
,
which
would
be
in
all
the
paper
tomorrow
.
such
be
his
rattle
,
his
bauble
,
in
play
with
which
he
have
grow
white
,
come
to
the
verge
of
old
age
,
enjoy
the
respect
and
affection
of
all
who
have
the
privilege
of
know
this
type
of
the
english
public
school
man
.
inevitably
one
make
up
thing
like
that
about
Hugh
;
that
be
his
style
;
the
style
of
those
admirable
letter
which
Peter
have
read
thousand
of
mile
across
the
sea
in
the
Times
,
and
have
thank
God
he
be
out
of
that
pernicious
hubble
-
bubble
if
it
be
only
to
hear
baboon
chatter
and
coolie
beat
their
wife
.
an
olive
-
skinned
youth
from
one
of
the
Universities

obsequiously
by
.
he
he
would
patronise
,
initiate
,
teach
how
to
get
on
.
for
he
like
nothing
well
than
do
kindness
,
make
the
heart
of
old
lady
palpitate
with
the
joy
of
be
think
of
in
their
age
,
their
affliction
,
think
themselves
quite
forget
,
yet
here
be
dear
Hugh
drive
up
and
spend
an
hour
talk
of
the
past
,
remember
trifle
,
praise
the
home
-
make
cake
,
though
Hugh
might
eat
cake
with
a
Duchess
any
day
of
his
life
,
and
,
to
look
at
he
,
probably
do
spend
a
good
deal
of
time
in
that
agreeable
occupation
.
the
all
-
judging
,
the
all
-
merciful
,
might
excuse
.
Peter
Walsh
have
no
mercy
.
villain
there
must
be
,
and
God
know
the
rascal
who
get
hang
for
batter
the
brain
of
a
girl
out
in
a
train
do
less
harm
on
the
whole
than
Hugh
Whitbread
and
his
kindness
.
look
at
he
now
,
on
tiptoe
,
dance
forward
,
bow
and
scrape
,
as
the
Prime
Minister
and
Lady
Bruton
emerge
,
intimate
for
all
the
world
to
see
that
he
be
privileged
to
say
something
,
something
private
,
to
Lady
Bruton
as
she
pass
.
she
stop
.
she
wag
her
fine
old

piece
of
servility
.

official
in
Government
office

and
now
Clarissa

down
the
room
,

,
sparkling
,
with
the
stateliness
of
her
grey
hair
.
she

,
and
a
silver

seem
,
have
that
gift
still
;
to
be
;
to
exist
;
to
sum
it
all
up
in
the
moment
as
she
pass
;
turn
,
catch
her
scarf
in
some
other
woman
's
dress
,
unhitch

,
all
with
the
most
perfect
ease
and
air
of
a

float
in
its
element
.
but
age
have
brush
she
;
even
as
a
mermaid
might
behold
in
her
glass
the
set
sun
on
some
very
clear
evening
over
the
wave
.
there
be
a
breath
of
tenderness
;
her
severity
,
her
prudery
,
her
woodenness
be
all
warm
through
now
,
and
she
have
about
she
as
she

and
good
luck
to

,
to
look
important
,
an
inexpressible
dignity
;
an
exquisite
cordiality
;
as
if
she
wish
the
whole
world
well
,
and
must
now
,
be
on
the
very
verge
and

pleased
,
with
all
those

rather
inclined
,
perhaps
,
to
envy

she
have
feel
that
intoxication
of
the
moment
,
that
dilatation
of
the
nerve
of
the
heart
itself
till
it
seem
to
quiver
,
steep
,
upright;--yes
,
but
after
all
it
be
what

that
;
for

there

Professor

lecture
on
Milton

Jim

could
see

for
Professor
Brierly
be
a
very
queer
fish
.
with
all
those
degree
,
honour
,
lectureship
between
he
and
the
scribbler
he
suspect
instantly
an
atmosphere
not
favourable
to
his
queer
compound
;
his
prodigious
learning
and
timidity
;
his
wintry
charm
without
cordiality
;
his
innocence
blent
with
snobbery
;
he
quiver
if
make
conscious
by
a
lady
's
unkempt
hair

a
youth

an
underworld

very
creditable
doubtless
,
of
rebel

of
ardent
young
people

and
intimate
with
a
little
toss
of
the
head

with
a
sniff
--
humph!--the
value

slight
training
in
the
classic

to
appreciate
Milton

Professor
Brierly

Hutton
.
that
be
the
bond
between
they
,
and
Hutton
(
a
very
bad
poet
)
always
feel
that
Mrs.
Dalloway
be
far
the
good
of
the
great
lady
who
take
an
interest
in

it
be
odd
how
strict
she
be
.
about

she
be
purely
impersonal
.
she
be
rather
a

she
make
her

she
must
leave

down
in
white
.

there
be
the
poet
and
thinker
.
suppose
he
have
have
that
passion
,
and
have
go
to
Sir
William
Bradshaw
,
a
great
doctor
yet
to
her
obscurely
evil
,
without
sex
or
lust
,
extremely
polite
to
woman
,
but
capable
of
some
indescribable
outrage

force
your
soul
,
that
be
it
--
if
this
young
man
have
go
to

his
power

indeed
she

it
now
)
,
Life
be
make
intolerable
;
they
make
life
intolerable
,
man
like
that
?




then
(
she
have
feel
it
only
this
morning
)
there
be
the
terror
;
the
overwhelming
incapacity
,
one
's
parent
give
it
into
one
's
hand
,
this
life
,
to
be
live
to
the
end
,
to
be
walk
with
serenely
;
there
be
in
the
depth
of
her
heart
an
awful
fear
.
even
now
,
quite
often
if
Richard
have
not
be
there
read
the
Times
,
so
that
she
could
crouch
like
a
bird
and
gradually
revive
,
send
roar
up
that
immeasurable
delight
,
rub
stick
to
stick
,
one
thing
with
another
,
she
must
have
perish
.
but
that
young
man
have
kill
himself
.




somehow
it
be
her
disaster
--
her
disgrace
.
it
be
her
punishment
to
see
sink
and
disappear
here
a
man
,
there
a
woman
,
in
this
profound
darkness
,
and
she
force
to
stand
here
in
her
evening
dress
.
she
have
scheme
;
she
have
pilfer
.
she
be
never
wholly
admirable
.
she
have
want
success
.
Lady
Bexborough
and
the
rest
of
it
.
and
once
she
have
walk
on
the
terrace
at
Bourton
.




it
be
due
to
Richard
;
she
have
never
be
so
happy
.
nothing
could
be
slow
enough
;
nothing
last
too
long
.
no
pleasure
could
equal
,
she
think
,
straighten
the
chair
,
push
in
one
book
on
the
shelf
,
this
having
do
with
the
triumph
of
youth
,
lose
herself
in
the
process
of
living
,
to
find
it
,
with
a
shock
of
delight
,
as
the
sun
rise
,
as
the
day
sink
.
many
a
time
have
she
go
,
at
Bourton
when
they
be
all
talk
,

he
,
thank
God

have
none

no
son
,
no

well
,
he
do
n't
seem
to
mind
,
say
Sally
.
he
look
young
,
she
think
,
than
any
of
they
.




but
it
have
be
a
silly
thing
to
do
,
in
many
way
,
Peter
say
,
to
marry
like
that
;
"
a
perfect
goose
she
be
,
"
he
say
,
but
,
he
say
,
"
we
have
a
splendid
time
of
it
,
"
but
how
could
that
be
?
Sally
wonder
;
what
do
he
mean
?
and
how
odd
it
be
to
know
he
and
yet
not
know
a
single
thing
that
have
happen
to
he
.
and
do
he
say
it
out
of
pride
?
very
likely
,
for
after
all
it
must
be
gall
for
he
(
though
he
be
an
oddity
,
a
sort
of
sprite
,
not
at
all
an
ordinary
man
)
,
it
must
be
lonely
at
his
age
to
have
no
home
,
nowhere
to
go
to
.
but
he
must
stay
with
they
for
week
and
week
.
of
course
he
would
;
he
would
love
to
stay
with
they
,
and
that
be
how
it
come
out
.
all
these
year
the
Dalloways
have
never
be
once
.
time
after
time
they
have
ask
they
.
Clarissa
(
for
it
be
Clarissa
of
course
)
would
not
come
.
for
,
say
Sally
,
Clarissa
be
at
heart
a
snob
--
one
have
to
admit
it
,
a
snob
.
and
it
be
that
that
be
between
they
,
she
be
convince
.
Clarissa
think
she
have
marry
beneath
she
,
her
husband
be
--
she
be
proud
of
it
--
a
miner
's
son
.
every
penny
they
have
he
have
earn
.
as
a
little
boy
(
her
voice
tremble
)
he
have
carry
great
sack
.




(
and
so
she
would
go
on
,
Peter
feel
,
hour
after

Peter
,
one
could

increase
,
he
say
,
alas
,
perhaps
,
but
one
should
be
glad
of
it
--
it
go
on
increase
in
his
experience
.
there
be
some
one
in
India
.
he
would
like
to
tell
Sally
about
she

Sally
,
watch
Elizabeth
go
to
her
father
,
one
can
see
they
be
devoted
to
each
other

she
could
feel
it
by
the
way
Elizabeth
go
to
her
father
.




for
her
father
have
be
look
at
she
,
as
he
stand

to
the
Bradshaws
,
and
he
have
think
to
himself
,
who
be
that
lovely
girl

and
suddenly
he
realise
that
it
be
his
Elizabeth

together
,
now

almost
over

speak
to

she
have
want
to
see
everything
,
to
tell
Edith

and
Richard
and
Elizabeth
be
rather
glad
it
be
over
,
but
Richard
be
proud
of
his
daughter
.
and
he
have
not
mean
to
tell
she
,

he
could
not

tell
she
.
he
have
look
at

,
and
he
have
wonder
,

sit
on
for
a
moment
.
what
be
this
terror

this
ecstasy
