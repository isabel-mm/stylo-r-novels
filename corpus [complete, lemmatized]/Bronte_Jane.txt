I






there
be
no
possibility
of
take
a
walk
that
day
.
we
have
be


wander
,
indeed
,
in
the
leafless
shrubbery
an
hour
in
the
morning
;


but
since
dinner
(
Mrs.
Reed
,
when
there
be
no
company
,
dine
early
)


the
cold
winter
wind
have
bring
with
it
cloud
so
sombre
,
and
a
rain


so
penetrate
,
that
further
outdoor
exercise
be
now
out
of
the


question
.




I
be
glad
of
it
:
I
never
like
long
walk
,
especially
on
chilly


afternoon
:
dreadful
to
I
be
the
come
home
in
the
raw
twilight
,


with
nip
finger
and
toe
,
and
a
heart
sadden
by
the
chiding
of


Bessie
,
the
nurse
,
and
humble
by
the
consciousness
of
my
physical


inferiority
to
Eliza
,
John
,
and
Georgiana
Reed
.




the
say
Eliza
,
John
,
and
Georgiana
be
now
cluster
round
their
mama


in
the
drawing
-
room
:
she
lie
recline
on
a
sofa
by
the
fireside
,
and


with
her
darling
about
she
(
for
the
time
neither
quarrel
nor


cry
)
look
perfectly
happy
.
I
,
she
have
dispense
from
join
the


group
;
say
,
"
she
regret
to
be
under
the
necessity
of
keep
I


at
a
distance
;
but
that
until
she
hear
from
Bessie
,
and
could
discover


by
her
own
observation
,
that
I
be
endeavour
in
good
earnest
to


acquire
a
more
sociable
and
childlike
disposition
,
a
more
attractive


and
sprightly
manner
—
something
light
,
franker
,
more
natural
,
as
it


be
—
she
really
must
exclude
I
from
privilege
intend
only
for


contented
,
happy
,
little
child
.
"




"
what
do
Bessie
say
I
have
do
?
"
I
ask
.




"
jane
,
I
do
n’t
like
caviller
or
questioner
;
besides
,
there
be


something
truly
forbid
in
a
child
take
up
her
elder
in
that


manner
.
be
seat
somewhere
;
and
until
you
can
speak
pleasantly
,
remain


silent
.
"




a
breakfast
-
room
adjoin
the
drawing
-
room
,
I
slip
in
there
.
it


contain
a
bookcase
:
I
soon
possess
myself
of
a
volume
,
take
care


that
it
should
be
one
store
with
picture
.
I
mount
into
the


window
-
seat
:
gather
up
my
foot
,
I
sit
cross
-
legged
,
like
a
Turk
;


and
,
having
draw
the
red
moreen
curtain
nearly
close
,
I
be
shrine
in


double
retirement
.




fold
of
scarlet
drapery
shut
in
my
view
to
the
right
hand
;
to
the
left


be
the
clear
pane
of
glass
,
protect
,
but
not
separate
I
from


the
drear
November
day
.
at
interval
,
while
turn
over
the
leave
of


my
book
,
I
study
the
aspect
of
that
winter
afternoon
.
afar
,
it


offer
a
pale
blank
of
mist
and
cloud
;
near
a
scene
of
wet
lawn
and


storm
-
beat
shrub
,
with
ceaseless
rain
sweep
away
wildly
before
a


long
and
lamentable
blast
.




I
return
to
my
book
—
Bewick
’s
history
of
british
Birds
:
the


letterpress
thereof
I
care
little
for
,
generally
speak
;
and
yet


there
be
certain
introductory
page
that
,
child
as
I
be
,
I
could
not


pass
quite
as
a
blank
.
they
be
those
which
treat
of
the
haunt
of


sea
-
fowl
;
of
"
the
solitary
rock
and
promontory
"
by
they
only


inhabit
;
of
the
coast
of
Norway
,
stud
with
isle
from
its
southern


extremity
,
the
Lindeness
,
or
Naze
,
to
the
North
Cape
—




"
where
the
Northern
Ocean
,
in
vast
whirl
,


Boils
round
the
naked
,
melancholy
isle


of
farth
Thule
;
and
the
Atlantic
surge


pour
in
among
the
stormy
Hebrides
.
"






nor
could
I
pass
unnoticed
the
suggestion
of
the
bleak
shore
of


Lapland
,
Siberia
,
Spitzbergen
,
Nova
Zembla
,
Iceland
,
Greenland
,
with


"
the
vast
sweep
of
the
Arctic
Zone
,
and
those
forlorn
region
of
dreary


space,—that
reservoir
of
frost
and
snow
,
where
firm
field
of
ice
,
the


accumulation
of
century
of
winter
,
glaze
in
Alpine
height
above


height
,
surround
the
pole
,
and
concentre
the
multiply
rigour
of


extreme
cold
.
"
of
these
death
-
white
realm
I
form
an
idea
of
my
own
:


shadowy
,
like
all
the
half
-
comprehend
notion
that
float
dim
through


child
’s
brain
,
but
strangely
impressive
.
the
word
in
these


introductory
page
connect
themselves
with
the
succeed
vignette
,


and
give
significance
to
the
rock
stand
up
alone
in
a
sea
of
billow


and
spray
;
to
the
break
boat
strand
on
a
desolate
coast
;
to
the
cold


and
ghastly
moon
glance
through
bar
of
cloud
at
a
wreck
just


sink
.




I
can
not
tell
what
sentiment
haunt
the
quite
solitary
churchyard
,


with
its
inscribe
headstone
;
its
gate
,
its
two
tree
,
its
low
horizon
,


girdle
by
a
broken
wall
,
and
its
newly
-
rise
crescent
,
attest
the


hour
of
eventide
.




the
two
ship
becalm
on
a
torpid
sea
,
I
believe
to
be
marine


phantom
.




the
fiend
pin
down
the
thief
’s
pack
behind
he
,
I
pass
over


quickly
:
it
be
an
object
of
terror
.




so
be
the
black
horn
thing
seat
aloof
on
a
rock
,
survey
a


distant
crowd
surround
a
gallow
.




each
picture
tell
a
story
;
mysterious
often
to
my
undeveloped


understanding
and
imperfect
feeling
,
yet
ever
profoundly
interesting
:


as
interesting
as
the
tale
Bessie
sometimes
narrate
on
winter


evening
,
when
she
chance
to
be
in
good
humour
;
and
when
,
have


bring
she
ironing
-
table
to
the
nursery
hearth
,
she
allow
we
to
sit


about
it
,
and
while
she
get
up
Mrs.
Reed
’s
lace
frill
,
and
crimp
she


nightcap
border
,
feed
our
eager
attention
with
passage
of
love
and


adventure
take
from
old
fairy
tale
and
other
ballad
;
or
(
as
at
a


later
period
I
discover
)
from
the
page
of
Pamela
,
and
Henry
,
Earl
of


Moreland
.




with
Bewick
on
my
knee
,
I
be
then
happy
:
happy
at
least
in
my
way
.
I


fear
nothing
but
interruption
,
and
that
come
too
soon

cry
the
voice
of
John
Reed
;
then

pause

fervently

John
Reed
have

not

John
Reed
be
a
schoolboy
of
fourteen
year
old
;
four
year
old
than


I
,
for
I
be
but
ten
:
large
and
stout
for
his
age
,
with
a
dingy
and


unwholesome
skin
;
thick
lineament
in
a
spacious
visage

heavy
limb

large
extremity

he
gorge
himself
habitually
at
table

which


make
he
bilious
,
and
give
he
a
dim
and
blear
eye
and
flabby
cheek
.


he
ought
now
to
have
be
at
school

but
his
mama
have
take
he
home


for
a
month
or
two
,
"
on
account
of
his
delicate
health

"
Mr.
Miles
,
the


master
,
affirm
that
he
would
do
very
well
if
he
have
few
cake
and


sweetmeat
send
he
from
home

the
mother
’s
heart
turn
from
an


opinion
so
harsh
,

incline
rather
to
the
more
refined
idea
that


John
’s
sallowness
be
owe
to
over

application

,
perhaps
,
to
pine


after

John
have
not
much
affection
for
his
mother

sister

an


antipathy

I

he
bully

punish
I

not
two
or
three
time
in


the
week
,
nor
once

twice
in
the
day

continually

every
nerve

fear

every
morsel
of
flesh
in
my
bone

when
he


come
near
.
there
be
moment
when
I
be
bewilder
by
the
terror
he


inspire
,
because
I
have
no
appeal
whatever
against
either
his
menace


or
his
infliction

the
servant

not
like
to
offend
their
young


master

my
part
against

Mrs.
Reed

blind

deaf


on
the
subject

never

abuse

he
do
both
now

then
in
her
very
presence
,
more
frequently
,


however
,
behind
she
back

habitually
obedient
to
John
,
I
come
up
to
his
chair

he
spend
some


three
minute
in
thrust
out
his
tongue
at
I
as
far
as
he
could


without
damage
the
root
:
I
know
he
would
soon
strike
,
and
while


dread
the
blow
,
I
muse
on
the
disgusting
and
ugly
appearance
of
he


who
would
presently
deal
it
.
I
wonder
if
he
read
that
notion
in
my


face
;
for
,
all
at
once
,
without
speak
,
he
strike
suddenly
and


strongly

I
totter
,

on
regain
my
equilibrium
retire
back

step

two

Accustomed
to
John
Reed

never

an
idea

to
it

up

mine

dreary
afternoon

could

ceaseless
inward
question—_why

thus
suffer
;
now
,
at


the
distance

I
will
not
say
how
many
year

I
see
it
clearly
.




I
be
a
discord
in
Gateshead
Hall
:
I
be
like
nobody
there
;
I
have


nothing
in
harmony
with
Mrs.
Reed
or
her
child
,

her
choose


vassalage
.
if
they
do
not
love
I
,
in
fact
,
as
little
do
I
love
they
.


they
be
not
bind
to
regard
with
affection
a
thing
that
could
not


sympathise
with
one
amongst
they
;
a
heterogeneous
thing
,
oppose
to


they
in
temperament
,
in
capacity
,
in
propensity
;
a
useless
thing
,


incapable
of

their
interest

add
to
their
pleasure
;
a


noxious

,
cherish
the
germ
of
indignation
at

of
contempt

child

though
equally


dependent
and
friendless
—
Mrs.
Reed
would
have
endure
my
presence
more


complacently
;
her
child
would
have
entertain
for
I
more
of
the


cordiality
of
fellow
-
feeling
;
the
servant
would
have
be
less
prone


to
make
I
the
scapegoat
of
the
nursery
.




Daylight
begin
to
forsake
the
red

room
;
it
be
past
four
o’clock
,
and


the
beclouded
afternoon
be
tend
to
drear
twilight
.
I
hear
the
rain


still
beat
continuously
on
the
staircase
window
,
and
the
wind


howl
in
the
grove
behind
the
hall
;
I
grow
by
degree
cold
as
a


stone
,
and
then
my
courage
sink
.
my
habitual
mood
of
humiliation
,


self
-
doubt
,
forlorn
depression
,
fall
damp
on
the
ember
of
my
decaying


ire
.
all
say
I
be
wicked
,
and
perhaps
I
might
be
so
;
what
think
have


I
been
but
just
conceive
of
starve
myself
to
death
?
that
certainly


be
a
crime
:
and
be
I
fit
to
die
?
or
be
the
vault
under
the
chancel


of
Gateshead
Church
an
invite
bourne
?
in
such
vault
I
have
be
tell


do
Mr.
Reed
lie
bury
;
and
lead
by
this
thought
to
recall
his
idea
,
I


dwell
on
it
with
gather
dread
.
I
could
not
remember
he
;
but
I
know


that
he
be
my
own
uncle
—
my
mother
’s
brother
—
that
he
have
take
I
when


a
parentless
infant
to
his
house
;
and
that
in
his
last
moment
he
have


require
a
promise
of
Mrs.
Reed
that
she
would
rear
and
maintain
I
as


one
of
her
own
child
.
Mrs.
Reed
probably
consider
she
have
keep


this
promise
;
and
so
she
have
,
I
dare
say
,
as
well
as
her
nature
would


permit
she
;
but
how
could
she
really
like
an
interloper
not
of
she


race
,
and
unconnected
with
she
,
after
her
husband
’s
death
,
by
any
tie
?


it
must
have
be
most
irksome
to
find
herself
bind
by
a
hard
-
wrung


pledge
to
stand
in
the
stead
of
a
parent
to
a
strange
child
she
could


not
love
,
and
to
see
an
uncongenial
alien
permanently
intrude
on
she


own
family
group
.




a
singular
notion
dawn
upon
I
.
I
doubt
not
—
never
doubted
—
that
if


Mr.
Reed
have
be
alive
he
would
have
treat
I
kindly
;
and
now
,
as
I


sat
look
at
the
white
bed
and
overshadow
wall
—
occasionally
also


turn
a
fascinated
eye
towards
the
dimly
gleam
mirror
—
I
begin
to


recall
what
I
have
hear
of
dead
man
,
trouble
in
their
grave
by
the


violation
of
their
last
wish
,
revisit
the
earth
to
punish
the


perjure
and
avenge
the
oppress
;
and
I
think
Mr.
Reed
’s
spirit
,


harass
by
the
wrong
of
his
sister
’s
child
,
might
quit
its


abode
—
whether
in
the
church
vault
or
in
the
unknown
world
of
the


depart
—
and
rise
before
I
in
this
chamber
.
I
wipe
my
tear
and


hush
my
sobs
,
fearful
lest
any
sign
of
violent
grief
might
waken
a


preternatural
voice
to
comfort
I
,
or
elicit
from
the
gloom
some
haloe


face
,
bend
over
I
with
strange
pity
.
this
idea
,
consolatory
in


theory
,
I
feel
would
be
terrible
if
realise
:
with
all
my
might
I


endeavour
to
stifle
it
—
I
endeavour
to
be
firm
.
shake
my
hair
from


my
eye
,
I
lift
my
head
and
try
to
look
boldly
round
the
dark
room
;


at
this
moment
a
light
gleam
on
the
wall
.
be
it
,
I
ask
myself
,
a


ray
from
the
moon
penetrate
some
aperture
in
the
blind
?
no
;
moonlight


be
still
,
and
this
stir
;
while
I
gaze
,
it
glide
up
to
the
ceiling


and
quiver
over
my
head
.
I
can
now
conjecture
readily
that
this


streak
of
light
be
,
in
all
likelihood
,
a
gleam
from
a
lantern
carry


by
some
one
across
the
lawn
:
but
then
,
prepare
as
my
mind
be
for


horror
,
shake
as
my
nerve
be
by
agitation
,
I
think
the
swift


dart
beam
be
a
herald
of
some
come
vision
from
another
world
.
my


heart
beat
thick
,
my
head
grow
hot
;
a
sound
fill
my
ear
,
which
I


deem
the
rushing
of
wing
;
something
seem
near
I
;
I
be
oppress
,


suffocate
:
endurance
break
down
;
I
rush
to
the
door
and
shake
the


lock
in
desperate
effort

come

along
the
outer
passage

speak
with
a


hollow
sound
,
and
as
if
muffle
by
a
rush
of
wind
or
water
:
agitation
,


uncertainty
,
and
an
all
-
predominate
sense
of
terror
confuse
my


faculty
.
Ere
long
,
I
become
aware
that
some
one
be
handle
I
;


lift
I
up
and
support
I
in
a
sit
posture
,
and
that
more


tenderly
than
I
have
ever
be
raise
or
uphold
before
.
I
rest
my
head


against
a
pillow
or
an
arm
,
and
feel
easy
.




in
five
minute
more
the
cloud
of
bewilderment
dissolve
:
I
know
quite


well
that
I
be
in
my
own
bed
,
and
that
the
red
glare
be
the
nursery


fire
.
it
be
night
:
a
candle
burn
on
the
table
;
Bessie
stand
at
the


bed
-
foot
with
a
basin
in
her
hand
,
and
a
gentleman
sit
in
a
chair
near


my
pillow
,
lean
over
I
.




I
feel
an
inexpressible
relief
,
a
soothe
conviction
of
protection
and


security
,
when
I
know
that
there
be
a
stranger
in
the
room
,
an


individual
not
belong
to
Gateshead
,
and
not
relate
to
Mrs.
Reed
.


turn
from
Bessie
(
though
her
presence
be
far
less
obnoxious
to
I


than
that
of
Abbot
,
for
instance
,
would
have
be
)
,
I
scrutinise
the


face
of
the
gentleman
:
I
know
he
;
it
be
Mr.
Lloyd
,
an
apothecary
,


sometimes
call
in
by
Mrs.
Reed
when
the
servant
be
ail
:
for


herself
and
the
child
she
employ
a
physician
.




"
well
,
who
be
I
?
"
he
ask
.




I
pronounce
his
name
,
offer
he
at
the
same
time
my
hand
:
he
take


it
,
smile
and
say
,
"
we
shall
do
very
well
by
-
and
-
by
.
"
then
he
lay


I
down
,
and
address
Bessie
,
charge
she
to
be
very
careful
that
I


be
not
disturb
during
the
night
.
having
give
some
further


direction
,
and
intimate
that
he
should
call
again
the
next
day
,
he


depart
;
to
my
grief
:
I
feel
so
sheltered
and
befriended
while
he
sit


in
the
chair
near
my
pillow
;
and
as
he
close
the
door
after
he
,
all


the
room
darken
and
my
heart
again
sink
:
inexpressible
sadness


weigh
it
down
.




"
do
you
feel
as
if
you
should
sleep
,
Miss
?
"
ask
Bessie
,
rather


softly
.




scarcely
dare
I
answer
she
;
for
I
fear
the
next
sentence
might
be


rough
.
"
I
will
try
.
"




"
would
you
like
to
drink
,
or
could
you
eat
anything
?
"




"
no
,
thank
you
,
Bessie
.
"




"
then
I
think
I
shall
go
to
bed
,
for
it
be
past
twelve
o’clock
;
but
you


may
call
I
if
you
want
anything
in
the
night
.
"




wonderful
civility
this
!
it
embolden
I
to
ask
a
question
.




"
Bessie
,
what

the
matter
with
I

I
ill

"

be


well
soon

"




Bessie
go
into
the
housemaid
’s
apartment
,
which
be
near
.
I
hear
she


say
—




"
Sarah
,
come
and
sleep
with
I
in
the
nursery
;
I
dare
n’t
for
my
life
be


alone
with
that
poor
child
to
-
night
:
she
might
die
;
it
’
such
a
strange


thing
she
should
have
that
fit

I
wonder

she

anything

rather
too
hard

"




Sarah
come
back
with
she
;
they
both
go
to
bed
;
they
be
whisper


together
for
half
-
an
-
hour
before
they
fall
asleep
.
I
catch
scrap
of


their
conversation
,
from
which
I
be
able
only
too
distinctly
to
infer


the
main
subject
discuss
.




"

all
dress
in
white

c.
,

c.




at
last
both
sleep
:
the
fire
and
the
candle
go
out
.
for
I
,
the


watch
of
that
long
night
pass
in
ghastly
wakefulness
;
ear
,
eye
,
and


mind
be
alike
strain
by
dread
:
such
dread
as
child
only
can


feel
.




no
severe
or
prolong
bodily
illness
follow
this
incident
of
the


red
-
room
;
it
only
give
my
nerve
a
shock
of
which
I
feel
the


reverberation
to
this
day
.
yes
,
Mrs.
Reed
,
to
you
I
owe
some
fearful


pang
of
mental
suffering
,
but
I
ought
to
forgive
you
,
for
you
know
not


what
you
do
:
while
rend
my
heart
-
string
,
you
think
you
be
only


uproot
my
bad
propensity
.




next
day
,
by
noon
,
I
be
up
and
dress
,
and
sat
wrap
in
a
shawl
by


the
nursery
hearth
.
I
feel
physically
weak
and
break
down
:
but
my


bad
ailment
be
an
unutterable
wretchedness
of
mind
:
a
wretchedness


which
keep
draw
from
I
silent
tear
;
no
soon
have
I
wipe
one
salt


drop
from
my
cheek
than
another
follow
.
yet
,
I
think
,
I
ought
to


have
be
happy
,
for
none
of
the
Reeds
be
there
,
they
be
all
go


out
in
the
carriage
with
their
mama
.
Abbot
,
too
,
be
sew
in
another


room
,
and
Bessie
,
as
she
move
hither
and
thither
,
put
away
toy


and
arrange
drawer
,
address
to
I
every
now
and
then
a
word
of


unwonted
kindness
.
this
state
of
thing
should
have
be
to
I
a


paradise
of
peace
,
accustom
as
I
be
to
a
life
of
ceaseless
reprimand


and
thankless
fagging
;
but
,
in
fact
,
my
rack
nerve
be
now
in
such


a
state
that
no
calm
could
soothe
,
and
no
pleasure
excite
they


agreeably
.




Bessie
have
be
down
into
the
kitchen
,
and
she
bring
up
with
she
a


tart
on
a
certain
brightly
paint
china
plate
,
whose
bird
of
paradise
,


nestle
in
a
wreath
of
convolvuli
and
rosebud
,
have
be
wo
nt
to
stir


in
I
a
most
enthusiastic
sense
of
admiration
;
and
which
plate
I
have


often
petition
to
be
allow
to
take
in
my
hand
in
order
to
examine


it
more
closely
,
but
have
always
hitherto
be
deem
unworthy
of
such
a


privilege
.
this
precious
vessel
be
now
place
on
my
knee
,
and
I
be


cordially
invite
to
eat
the
circlet
of
delicate
pastry
upon
it
.
Vain


favour
!
come
,
like
most
other
favour
long
defer
and
often
wish


for
,
too
late
!
I
could
not
eat
the
tart
;
and
the
plumage
of
the
bird
,


the
tint
of
the
flower
,
seem
strangely
fade
:
I
put
both
plate
and


tart
away
.
Bessie
ask
if
I
would
have
a
book
:
the
word
_
book
_
act


as
a
transient
stimulus
,
and
I
beg
she
to
fetch
Gulliver
’s
travel


from
the
library
.
this
book
I
have
again
and
again
peruse
with
delight
.


I
consider
it
a
narrative
of
fact
,
and
discover
in
it
a
vein
of


interest
deep
than
what
I
find
in
fairy
tale
:
for
as
to
the
elf
,


having
seek
they
in
vain
among
foxglove
leave
and
bell
,
under


mushroom
and
beneath
the
ground
-
ivy
mantling
old
wall
-
nook
,
I
have
at


length
make
up
my
mind
to
the
sad
truth
,
that
they
be
all
go
out
of


england
to
some
savage
country
where
the
wood
be
wilder
and
thick
,


and
the
population
more
scant
;
whereas
,
Lilliput
and
Brobdignag
be
,


in
my
creed
,
solid
part
of
the
earth
’s
surface
,
I
doubt
not
that
I


might
one
day
,
by
take
a
long
voyage
,
see
with
my
own
eye
the
little


field
,
house
,
and
tree
,
the
diminutive
people
,
the
tiny
cow
,
sheep
,


and
bird
of
the
one
realm
;
and
the
corn
-
field
forest
-
high
,
the
mighty


mastiff
,
the
monster
cat
,
the
tower
-
like
man
and
woman
,
of
the
other
.


yet
,
when
this
cherish
volume
be
now
place
in
my
hand
—
when
I
turn


over
its
leave
,
and
seek
in
its
marvellous
picture
the
charm
I
have
,


till
now
,
never
fail
to
find
—
all
be
eerie
and
dreary
;
the
giant


be
gaunt
goblin
,
the
pigmy
malevolent
and
fearful
imp
,
Gulliver
a


most
desolate
wanderer
in
most
dread
and
dangerous
region
.
I
close


the
book
,
which
I
dare
no
long
peruse
,
and
put
it
on
the
table
,


beside
the
untasted
tart
.




Bessie
have
now
finish
dust
and
tidy
the
room
,
and
having
wash


her
hand
,
she
open
a
certain
little
drawer
,
full
of
splendid
shred


of
silk
and
satin
,
and
begin
make
a
new
bonnet
for
Georgiana
’s
doll
.


meantime
she
sing
:
her
song
be
—




"
in
the
day
when
we
went
gipsye
,


    
a
long
time
ago
.
"






I
have
often
hear
the
song
before
,
and
always
with
lively
delight
;
for


Bessie
have
a
sweet
voice,—at
least
,
I
think
so
.
but
now
,
though
she


voice
be
still
sweet
,
I
find
in
its
melody
an
indescribable
sadness
.


sometimes
,
preoccupy
with
her
work
,
she
sing
the
refrain
very
low
,


very
lingeringly
;
"
a
long
time
ago
"
come
out
like
the
sad
cadence


of
a
funeral
hymn
.
she
pass
into
another
ballad
,
this
time
a
really


doleful
one
.




"
my
foot
they
be
sore
,
and
my
limb
they
be
weary
;


    
Long
be
the
way
,
and
the
mountain
be
wild
;


soon
will
the
twilight
close
moonless
and
dreary


    
over
the
path
of
the
poor
orphan
child
.




why
do
they
send
I
so
far
and
so
lonely
,


    
up
where
the
moor
spread
and
grey
rock

distant

soft

night

o’er
the
broken
bridge

,


    
or
stray
in
the
marsh

by
false
light

my
Father
,

at
her
disobedience

she
off

chapter
IV






from
my
discourse
with
Mr.
Lloyd
,
and
from
the
above
report


conference
between
Bessie
and
Abbot
,
I
gather
enough
of
hope
to


suffice
as
a
motive
for
wish
to
get
well
:
a
change
seem
near,—I


desire
and
wait
it
in
silence
.
it
tarry
,
however
:
day
and
week


pass
:
I
have
regain
my
normal
state
of
health
,
but
no
new
allusion


be
make
to
the
subject
over
which
I
brood
.
Mrs.
Reed
survey
I
at


time
with
a
severe
eye
,
but
seldom
address
I
:
since
my
illness
,
she


have
draw
a
more
marked
line
of
separation
than
ever
between
I
and
she


own
child
;
appoint
I
a
small
closet
to
sleep
in
by
myself
,


condemn
I
to
take
my
meal
alone
,
and
pass
all
my
time
in
the


nursery
,
while
my
cousin
be
constantly
in
the
drawing
-
room
.
not
a


hint
,
however
,
do
she
drop
about
send
I
to
school
:
still
I
feel
an


instinctive
certainty
that
she
would
not
long
endure
I
under
the
same


roof
with
she
;
for
her
glance
,
now
more
than
ever
,
when
turn
on
I
,


express
an
insuperable
and
rooted
aversion
.




Eliza
and
Georgiana
,
evidently
act
accord
to
order
,
speak
to
I


as
little
as
possible
:
John
thrust
his
tongue
in
his
cheek
whenever
he


see
I
,
and
once
attempt
chastisement
;
but
as
I
instantly
turn


against
he
,
rouse
by
the
same
sentiment
of
deep
ire
and
desperate


revolt
which
have
stir
my
corruption
before
,
he
think
it
well
to


desist
,
and
run
from
I
utter
execration
,
and
vow
I
have
burst


his
nose
.
I
have
indeed
level
at
that
prominent
feature
as
hard
a


blow
as
my
knuckle
could
inflict
;
and
when
I
see
that
either
that
or


my
look
daunt
he
,
I
have
the
great
inclination
to
follow
up
my


advantage
to
purpose
;
but
he
be
already
with
his
mama
.
I
hear
he
in


a
blubbering
tone
commence
the
tale
of
how
"
that
nasty
Jane
Eyre
"
have


fly
at
he
like
a
mad
cat
:
he
be
stop
rather
harshly
—




"
do
n’t
talk
to
I
about
she
,
John
:
I
tell
you
not
to
go
near
she
;
she


be
not
worthy
of
notice
;
I
do
not
choose
that
either
you
or
your


sister
should
associate
with
she
.
"




here
,
lean
over
the
banister
,
I
cry
out
suddenly
,
and
without
at


all
deliberate
on
my
word
—




"
they
be
not
fit

Mrs.
Reed
be
rather
a
stout
woman
;
but
,
on
hear
this
strange
and


audacious
declaration
,
she
run
nimbly
up
the
stair
,
sweep
I
like
a


whirlwind
into
the
nursery
,
and
crush
I
down
on
the
edge
of
my


crib
,
dare
I
in
an
emphatic
voice
to
rise
from
that
place
,
or
utter


one
syllable
during
the
remainder
of
the
day
.




"
what
would
Uncle
Reed
say
to
you
,
if
he
be
alive
?
"
be
my
scarcely


voluntary
demand
.
I
say
scarcely
voluntary
,
for
it
seem
as
if
my


tongue
pronounce
word
without
my
will
consent
to
their
utterance
:


something
speak
out
of
I
over
which
I
have
no
control
.




"
what
?
"
say
Mrs.
Reed
under
her
breath
:
her
usually
cold
compose
grey


eye
become
troubled
with
a
look
like
fear
;
she
take
her
hand
from
my


arm
,
and
gaze
at
I
as
if
she
really
do
not
know
whether
I
be
child


or
fiend
.
I
be
now
in
for
it
.




"
my
Uncle
Reed
be
in
heaven
,
and
can
see
all
you
do
and
think
;
and
so


can
papa
and
mama
:
they
know
how
you
shut
I
up
all
day
long
,
and
how


you
wish
I
dead
.
"




Mrs.
Reed
soon
rally
her
spirit
:
she
shake
I
most
soundly
,
she


box
both
my
ear
,
and
then
leave
I
without
a
word
.
Bessie
supply


the
hiatus
by
a
homily
of
an
hour
’s
length
,
in
which
she
prove
beyond


a
doubt
that
I
be
the
most
wicked
and
abandon
child
ever
rear


under
a
roof
.
I
half
believe
she
;
for
I
feel
indeed
only
bad
feeling


surge
in
my
breast
.




November
,
December
,
and
half
of
January
pass
away
.
Christmas
and
the


New
Year
have
be
celebrate
at
Gateshead
with
the
usual
festive
cheer
;


present
have
be
interchange
,
dinner
and
evening
party
give
.
from


every
enjoyment
I
be
,
of
course
,
exclude
:
my
share
of
the
gaiety


consist
in
witness
the
daily
apparelling
of
Eliza
and
Georgiana
,


and
see
they
descend
to
the
drawing
-
room
,
dress
out
in
thin
muslin


frock
and
scarlet
sash
,
with
hair
elaborately
ringlette
;
and


afterwards
,
in
listen
to
the
sound
of
the
piano
or
the
harp
play


below
,
to
the
passing
to
and
fro
of
the
butler
and
footman
,
to
the


jingle
of
glass
and
china
as
refreshment
be
hand
,
to
the
break


hum
of
conversation
as
the
drawing
-
room
door
open
and
close
.
when


tired
of
this
occupation
,
I
would
retire
from
the
stairhead
to
the


solitary
and
silent
nursery
:
there
,
though
somewhat
sad
,
I
be
not


miserable
.
to
speak
truth
,
I
have
not
the
least
wish
to
go
into
company
,


for
in
company
I
be
very
rarely
notice
;
and
if
Bessie
have
but
be


kind
and
companionable
,
I
should
have
deem
it
a
treat
to
spend
the


evening
quietly
with
she
,
instead
of
pass
they
under
the
formidable


eye
of
Mrs.
Reed
,
in
a
room
full
of
lady
and
gentleman
.
but
Bessie
,


as
soon
as
she
have
dress
her
young
lady
,
use
to
take
herself
off


to
the
lively
region
of
the
kitchen
and
housekeeper
’s
room
,
generally


bear
the
candle
along
with
she
.
I
then
sit
with
my
doll
on
my
knee


till
the
fire
get
low
,
glance
round
occasionally
to
make
sure
that


nothing
bad
than
myself
haunt
the
shadowy
room
;
and
when
the
ember


sink
to
a
dull
red
,
I
undress
hastily
,
tug
at
knot
and
string


as
I
well
might
,
and
seek
shelter
from
cold
and
darkness
in
my
crib
.


to
this
crib
I
always
take
my
doll
;
human
being
must
love
something
,


and
,
in
the
dearth
of
worthy
object
of
affection
,
I
contrive
to


find
a
pleasure
in
love
and
cherish
a
faded
graven
image
,
shabby


as
a
miniature
scarecrow
.
it
puzzle
I
now
to
remember
with
what


absurd
sincerity
I
doate
on
this
little
toy
,
half
fancy
it
alive


and
capable
of
sensation
.
I
could
not
sleep
unless
it
be
fold
in
my


night
-
gown
;
and
when
it
lie
there
safe
and
warm
,
I
be
comparatively


happy
,
believe
it
to
be
happy
likewise
.




long
do
the
hour
seem
while
I
wait
the
departure
of
the
company
,


and
listen
for
the
sound
of
Bessie
’s
step
on
the
stair
:
sometimes


she
would
come
up
in
the
interval
to
seek
she
thimble
or
her
scissor
,


or
perhaps
to
bring
I
something
by
way
of
supper
—
a
bun
or
a


cheese
-
cake
—
then
she
would
sit
on
the
bed
while
I
eat
it
,
and
when
I


have
finish
,
she
would
tuck
the
clothe
round
I
,
and
twice
she
kiss


I
,
and
say
,
"
good
night
,
Miss
Jane
.
"
when
thus
gentle
,
Bessie
seem


to
I
the
good
,
prettiest
,
kind
being
in
the
world
;
and
I
wish


most
intensely
that
she
would
always
be
so
pleasant
and
amiable
,
and


never
push
I
about
,
or
scold
,
or
task
I
unreasonably
,
as
she
be
too


often
wo
nt
to
do
.
Bessie
Lee
must
,
I
think
,
have
be
a
girl
of
good


natural
capacity
,
for
she
be
smart
in
all
she
do
,
and
have
a


remarkable
knack
of
narrative
;
so
,
at
least
,
I
judge
from
the


impression
make
on
I
by
her
nursery
tale
.
she
be
pretty
too
,
if
my


recollection
of
her
face
and
person
be
correct
.
I
remember
she
as
a


slim
young
woman
,
with
black
hair
,
dark
eye
,
very
nice
feature
,
and


good
,
clear
complexion
;
but
she
have
a
capricious
and
hasty
temper
,
and


indifferent
idea
of
principle
or
justice
:
still
,
such
as
she
be
,
I


prefer
she
to
any
one
else
at
Gateshead
Hall
.




it
be
the
fifteenth
of
January
,
about
nine
o’clock
in
the
morning
:


Bessie

down
to
breakfast
;
my
cousin
have
not

Eliza

put
on
her
bonnet
and
warm
garden
-
coat
to


go
and
feed
her
poultry
,
an
occupation
of
which
she
be
fond
:
and
not


less
so
of
sell
the
egg
to
the
housekeeper
and
hoard
up
the


money
she
thus
obtain
.
she
have
a
turn
for
traffic
,
and
a
marked


propensity
for
saving
;
show
not
only
in
the
vending
of
egg
and


chicken
,
but
also
in
drive
hard
bargain
with
the
gardener
about


flower
-
root
,
seed
,
and
slip
of
plant
;
that
functionary
have


order
from
Mrs.
Reed
to
buy
of
his
young
lady
all
the
product
of
she


parterre
she
wish
to
sell
:
and
Eliza
would
have
sell
the
hair
off
she


head
if
she
could
have
make
a
handsome
profit
thereby
.
as
to
her
money
,


she
first
secrete
it
in
odd
corner
,
wrap
in
a
rag
or
an
old


curl

paper
;
but
some
of
these
hoard
having
be
discover
by
the


housemaid
,
Eliza
,
fearful
of
one
day
lose
her
value
treasure
,


consent
to
intrust
it
to
her
mother
,
at
a
usurious
rate
of


interest
—
fifty
or
sixty
per
cent
.
;
which
interest
she
exact
every


quarter
,
keep
her
account
in
a
little
book
with
anxious
accuracy
.

sit
on
a

stool
,
dress
her

at
the

strict
order
from

to
get

abruptly
quit

I
be
leave
there
alone
—
winner
of
the
field

it
be
the
hard
battle
I


have
fight
,
and
the
first
victory
I
have
gain
:
I
stand
awhile
on
the


rug
,
where
Mr.
Brocklehurst
have
stand
,
and
I
enjoy
my
conqueror
’s


solitude
.
first
,
I
smile
to
myself
and
feel
elate
;
but
this
fierce


pleasure
subside
in
I
as
fast
as
do
the
accelerated
throb
of
my


pulse
.
a
child
can
not
quarrel
with
its
elder
,
as
I
have
do
;
can
not


give
its
furious
feeling
uncontrolle
play
,
as
I
have
give
mine
,


without
experience
afterwards
the
pang
of
remorse
and
the
chill
of


reaction
.
a
ridge
of
light
heath
,
alive
,
glancing
,
devouring
,
would


have
be
a
meet
emblem
of
my
mind
when
I
accuse
and
menace
Mrs.


reed
:
the
same
ridge
,
black
and
blast
after
the
flame
be
dead
,


would
have
represent
as
meetly
my
subsequent
condition
,
when


half
-
an
-
hour
’s
silence
and
reflection
have
show
I
the
madness
of
my


conduct
,
and
the
dreariness
of
my
hated
and
hate
position
.




something
of
vengeance
I
have
taste
for
the
first
time
;
as
aromatic


wine
it
seem
,
on
swallow
,
warm
and
racy
:
its
after
-
flavour
,


metallic
and
corroding
,
give
I
a
sensation
as
if
I
have
be
poison
.


willingly
would
I
now
have
go
and
ask
Mrs.
Reed
’s
pardon
;
but
I


know
,
partly
from
experience
and
partly
from
instinct
,
that
be
the
way


to
make
she
repulse
I
with
double
scorn
,
thereby
re
-
exciting
every


turbulent
impulse
of
my
nature
.




I
would
fain
exercise
some
well
faculty
than
that
of
fierce
speaking
;


fain
find
nourishment
for
some
less
fiendish
feeling
than
that
of


sombre
indignation
.
I
take
a
book
—
some
arabian
tale
;
I
sit
down
and


endeavour
to
read
.
I
could
make
no
sense
of
the
subject
;
my
own


thought
swam
always
between
I
and
the
page
I
have
usually
find


fascinating
.
I
open
the
glass
-
door
in
the
breakfast
-
room
:
the


shrubbery
be
quite
still
:
the
black
frost
reign
,
unbroken
by
sun
or


breeze
,
through
the
ground
.
I
cover
my
head
and
arm
with
the
skirt


of
my
frock
,
and
go
out
to
walk
in
a
part
of
the
plantation
which
be


quite
sequestrated
;
but
I
find
no
pleasure
in
the
silent
tree
,
the


fall
fir
-
cone
,
the
congealed
relic
of
autumn
,
russet
leave
,
sweep


by
past
wind
in
heap
,
and
now
stiffen
together
.
I
lean
against
a


gate
,
and
look
into
an
empty
field
where
no
sheep
be
feed
,
where


the
short
grass
be
nip
and
blanch
.
it
be
a
very
grey
day

a
most


opaque
sky
,

fall

,

settle
on
the
hard
path

on
the
hoary
lea
without


melt

I
stand
,
a
wretched
child
enough
,
whisper
to
myself
over


and
over
again
,

"




all
at
once
I
hear
a
clear
voice
call
,
"

sever
from
Bessie

Gateshead
;
thus
whirl
away
to
unknown
,
and
,
as
I
then
deem
,
remote


and
mysterious
region
.




I
remember
but
little
of
the
journey
;
I
only
know
that
the
day
seem


to
I
of
a
preternatural
length
,
and
that
we
appear
to
travel
over


hundred
of
mile
of
road
.
we
pass
through
several
town
,
and
in
one
,


a
very
large
one
,
the
coach
stop
;

horse
be
take
out

and
the


passenger
alight
to
dine
.
I
be
carry
into
an
inn
,
where
the
guard


want
I
to
have
some
dinner
;
but
,
as
I
have
no
appetite
,
he
leave
I
in


an
immense
room
with
a
fireplace
at
each
end
,
a
chandelier
pendent
from


the
ceiling
,
and
a
little
red
gallery
high
up
against
the
wall
fill


with
musical
instrument
.
here
I
walk
about
for
a
long
time
,
feel


very
strange
,
and
mortally
apprehensive
of
some
one
come
in
and


kidnap
I
;
for
I
believe
in
kidnapper
,
their
exploit
have


frequently
figure
in
Bessie
’s
fireside
chronicle
.
at
last
the
guard


return
;
once
more
I
be
stow
away
in
the
coach
,
my
protector


mount
his
own
seat
,
sound
his
hollow
horn
,
and
away
we
rattle
over


the
"
stony
street
"
of
l——.




the
afternoon
come
on
wet
and
somewhat
misty
:
as
it
wane
into
dusk
,
I


begin
to
feel
that
we
be
get
very
far
indeed
from
Gateshead
:
we


cease
to
pass
through
town
;
the
country
change
;
great
grey
hill


heave
up
round
the
horizon
:
as
twilight
deepen
,
we
descend
a


valley
,
dark
with
wood
,
and
long
after
night
have
overcloud
the


prospect
,
I
hear
a
wild
wind
rush
amongst
tree
.




lull
by
the
sound
,
I
at
last
drop
asleep
;
I
have
not
long
slumber


when
the
sudden
cessation
of
motion
awake
I
;
the
coach
-
door
be
open
,


and
a
person
like
a
servant
be
stand
at
it
:
I
see
her
face
and


dress
by
the
light
of
the
lamp
.




"
be
there
a
little
girl
call
Jane
Eyre
here
?
"
she
ask
.
I
answer


"
yes
,
"
and
be
then
lift
out
;
my
trunk
be
hand
down
,
and
the
coach


instantly
drive
away
.




I
be
stiff
with
long
sitting
,
and
bewilder
with
the
noise
and
motion


of
the
coach
:
gather
my
faculty
,
I
look
about
I
.
rain
,
wind
,


and
darkness
fill
the
air
;
nevertheless
,
I
dimly
discern
a
wall


before
I
and
a
door
open
in
it
;
through
this
door
I
pass
with
my
new


guide
:
she
shut
and
lock
it
behind
she
.
there
be
now
visible
a
house


or
house
—
for
the
building
spread
far
—
with
many
window
,
and
light


burn
in
some
;
we
go
up
a
broad
pebbly
path
,
splash
wet
,
and


be
admit
at
a
door
;
then
the
servant
lead
I
through
a
passage
into


a
room
with
a
fire
,
where
she
leave
I
alone
.




I
stand
and
warm
my
numb
finger
over
the
blaze
,
then
I
look


round
;
there
be
no
candle
,
but
the
uncertain
light
from
the
hearth


show
,
by
interval
,
paper
wall
,
carpet
,
curtain
,
shine
mahogany


furniture
:
it
be
a
parlour
,
not
so
spacious
or
splendid
as
the


drawing
-
room
at
Gateshead
,
but
comfortable
enough
.
I
be
puzzle
to


make
out
the
subject
of
a
picture
on
the
wall
,
when
the
door
open
,


and
an
individual
carry
a
light
enter
;
another

;

say
she
,
put
she


candle
down
on
the
table
.
she
consider
I
attentively
for
a
minute
or


two
,
then
far
add
—




"

"


she
ask
,
place
her

.




"

and

,
no

,
Miss
Miller
.

the
first
time

leave
your
parent
to


come
to

little
girl
?
"




I
explain
to
she
that
I
have
no
parent
.
she
inquire
how
long
they


have
be
dead
:
then
how
old
I
be
,
what

my
name
,
whether
I
could


read
,
write
,
and
sew
a
little
:
then
she
touch
my
cheek
gently
with


her
forefinger
,
and
say
,
"

should
be
a
good

"


dismiss
I
along
with
Miss

.




the
lady

have
leave
might
be
about
twenty
-
nine
;
the
one
who
go
with


I
appear
some
year
young

the
first
impress
I
by
her
voice
,


look
,
and
air
.
Miss
Miller
be
more
ordinary
;
ruddy
in
complexion
,


though
of
a
careworn
countenance
;
hurry
in
gait
and
action
,
like
one


who
have
always
a
multiplicity
of
task
on
hand
:

I
afterwards
find
she
really

lead
by

,
I


pass
from

a


large
and
irregular

from

that
portion
of
the

to
twenty

see
by


the
dim
light
of
the

overpower
by

to
hear
the

rave
in
furious
gust

the
rain
fall
in


torrent

take
her

how
glad

be
to

something

I
be
now
nearly
sick
from
inanition

something
hot

,
however
,
to
my
dismay
,
send


forth
an
odour
far
from

I
see
a
universal
manifestation
of


discontent
when
the
fume
of
the
repast
meet
the
nostril
of
those


destine
to
swallow
it

from
the
van
of
the
procession
,
the
tall
girl


of
the
first
class

the
whispered
word
—

"

a
voice
;
not
that
of
Miss
Miller
,

one
of
the


upper
teacher
,
a
little
and
dark
personage
,
smartly
dressed
,
but
of


somewhat
morose
aspect
,
who
instal
herself
at
the
top
of
one
table
,

a
more
buxom
lady
preside
at
the
other

I
look
in
vain
for
she


I
have
first
see
the
night
before
;
she
be
not
visible
:
Miss
Miller


occupy
the
foot
of
the
table
where
I
sit
,
and
a
strange
,


foreign
-
look
,
elderly
lady
,
the
french
teacher
,
as
I
afterwards


find
,
take
the
corresponding
seat
at
the
other
board
.
a
long
grace
be

and
a
hymn
sing
;

a
servant
bring
in
some
tea
for
the


teacher

the
meal
begin
.




ravenous
,

now
very
faint

I
devour
a
spoonful
or
two
of
my


portion
without
think
of
its
taste
;
but
the
first
edge
of
hunger


blunt
,
I
perceive
I
have
get
in
hand
a
nauseous
mess
;
burn
porridge


be
almost
as
bad
as
rotten
potato
;
famine
itself
soon
sicken
over


it

the
spoon
be
move
slowly

I
see
each
girl
taste
her
food
and


try
to
swallow
it
;

in
most
case
the
effort
be
soon
relinquish

breakfast
be
over

none
have
breakfast

thank
be
return
for


what
we
have

a
second
hymn
chant

refectory

I
be
one
of
the
last
to
go
out

in

the

one
teacher
take
a
basin
of
the
porridge

taste
it

she
look
at
the
other

all
their
countenance
express


displeasure
,
and
one
of
they
,
the
stout
one
,
whisper
—




"
abominable

how
shameful

a
quarter

the
schoolroom

in
a
glorious
tumult

of
time
it


seem
to
be
permit
to
talk
loud

privilege

serious

hear
the
name
of
Mr.
Brocklehurst
pronounce
by
some
lip
;
at
which


Miss
Miller
shake
her
head
disapprovingly
;
but
she
make
no
great
effort


to
check
the
general
wrath
;
doubtless
she
share
in
it
.




a
clock
in
the
schoolroom
strike
nine
;
Miss

leave
her

grey
frieze

similarly


equip

wide
inclosure

high

stand
lonely
enough
:
but
to
that
feeling
of
isolation
I
be


accustomed
;
it
do
not
oppress
I
much
.
I
leant
against
a
pillar
of
the


verandah
,
draw
my
grey
mantle
close
about
I
,
and
,
try
to
forget
the


cold
which
nip
I
without
,
and
the
unsatisfied
hunger
which
gnaw


I
within
,
deliver
myself
up
to
the
employment
of
watching
and


think
.
my
reflection
be
too
undefined
and
fragmentary
to
merit


record
:
I
hardly
yet
know
where
I
be
;
Gateshead
and
my
past
life


seem
float
away
to
an
immeasurable
distance
;
the
present
be
vague


and
strange
,
and
of
the
future
I
could
form
no
conjecture
.
I
look


round
the
convent
-
like
garden
,
and
then
up
at
the
house
—
a
large


building
,
half
of
which
seem
grey
and
old
,
the
other
half
quite
new

the
new
part

contain
the
schoolroom
and
dormitory
,

light
by


mullione
and
lattice
window
,
which
give
it
a
church
-
like
aspect
;
a


stone
tablet
over
the
door
bore
this
inscription
:

read

over

over

feel
that
an
explanation


belong
to

be
unable
fully
to
penetrate
their

be


still
ponder
the
signification

endeavour
to


make
out
a
connection
between
the
first
word

the
verse
of


scripture
,
when
the
sound
of
a
cough
close
behind
I
make
I
turn
my


head
.
I
see
a
girl
sit
on
a
stone
bench
near

she
be
bent
over
a


book
,
on
the
perusal
of
which
she
seem
intent
:
from
where
I
stand
I


could
see
the
title

it
be

a
name

strike
I
as


strange

attractive

to


look
up

to

directly

contrary

touch
a

I

so
;
a
brief
examination

to
I
in

ignominious

great
a

thirteen

great
distress

surprise
she
neither

grave

she
stand

central
mark

down


into

some
inattention
to


stop

suddenly

even
in

make
she
an
object

constant


notice

be
just

the
trace
of
a
tear
glisten
on
her
thin
cheek
.




the
play
-
hour
in
the
evening
I
think
the
pleasantest
fraction
of
the


day
at
Lowood
:
the
bit
of
bread
,
the
draught
of
coffee
swallow
at


five
o’clock
have
revive
vitality
,
if
it
have
not
satisfy
hunger

the


long
restraint
of
the
day
be
slacken
;
the
schoolroom
feel
warm


than
in
the
morning
—
its
fire
be
allow
to
burn
a
little
more


brightly

to
supply
,
in
some
measure
,
the
place
of
candle

the
ruddy
gloaming

the
licensed
uproar

the
confusion
of


many

one
a
welcome
sense
of
liberty

the
evening

the
day

Miss

flog

pupil

usual

the
form

laugh
group
without

not

lonely

I

lift
a

distinguish
from

gleeful
tumult
within

the
disconsolate
moan
of
the
wind
outside

probably
,
if
I
have
lately
leave
a
good
home
and
kind
parent
,
this
would


have
be
the
hour
when
I
should
most
keenly
have
regret
the


separation

that
wind

then
have
sadden
my
heart

my
peace

it
be

I
derive
from
both
a


strange
excitement
,

reckless

feverish

wish
the
wind
to


howl
more
wildly

the
gloom
to
deepen
to
darkness

confusion

rise
to

could

during
January

there

our
ungloved
hand

numb

cover
with
chilblain
,

be
our
foot

I
remember
well


the
distracting
irritation
I
endure
from
this
cause
every
evening

my

the
keen
appetite

have
scarcely
sufficient

keep
alive

delicate
invalid

this


deficiency
of
nourishment
result
an
abuse

press
hardly

the
young
pupil

whenever
the
famished
great

coax

menace
the
little
one
out

portion

half

accompaniment

the
skin
from
our
face
.




I
can
remember
Miss
Temple
walk
lightly
and
rapidly
along
our


droop
line
,
her
plaid
cloak
,
which
the
frosty
wind
flutter
,


gather
close
about
she
,
and
encourage
we
,
by
precept
and
example
,


to
keep
up
our
spirit
,
and
march
forward
,
as
she
say
,
"
like
stalwart


soldier
.
"
the
other
teacher
,
poor
thing
,
be
generally
themselves


too
much
deject
to
attempt
the
task
of
cheer
other
.




how
we
long
for
the
light
and
heat
of
a
blaze
fire
when
we
get


back
!
but
,
to
the
little
one
at
least
,
this
be
deny
:
each
hearth
in


the
schoolroom
be
immediately
surround
by
a
double
row
of
great


girl
,
and
behind
they
the
young
child
crouch
in
group
,


wrap
their
starve
arm
in
their
pinafore
.




a
little
solace
come
at
tea
-
time
,
in
the
shape
of
a
double
ration
of


bread
—
a
whole
,
instead
of
a
half
,
slice
—
with
the
delicious
addition
of


a
thin
scrape
of
butter
:
it
be
the
hebdomadal
treat
to
which
we
all


look
forward
from
Sabbath
to
Sabbath
.
I
generally
contrive
to


reserve
a
moiety
of
this
bounteous
repast
for
myself
;
but
the
remainder


I
be
invariably
oblige
to
part
with
.




the
Sunday
evening
be
spend
in
repeat
,
by
heart
,
the
Church


catechism
,
and
the
fifth
,
sixth
,
and
seventh
chapter
of
St.
Matthew
;


and
in
listen
to
a
long
sermon
,
read
by
Miss
Miller
,
whose


irrepressible
yawn
attest
she
weariness
.
a
frequent
interlude
of


these
performance
be
the
enactment
of
the
part
of
Eutychus
by
some


half
-
dozen
of
little
girl
,
who
,
overpower
with
sleep
,
would
fall


down
,
if
not
out
of
the
third
loft
,
yet
off
the
fourth
form
,
and
be


take
up
half
dead
.
the
remedy
be
,
to
thrust
they
forward
into
the


centre
of
the
schoolroom
,
and
oblige
they
to
stand
there
till
the


sermon
be
finish
.
sometimes
their
foot
fail
they
,
and
they
sink


together
in
a
heap
;
they
be
then
prop
up
with
the
monitor
'
high


stool
.




I
have
not
yet
allude
to
the
visit
of
Mr.
Brocklehurst
;
and
indeed


that
gentleman
be
from
home
during
the
great
part
of
the
first
month


after
my
arrival
;
perhaps
prolong
his
stay
with
his
friend
the


archdeacon
:
his
absence
be
a
relief
to
I
.
I
need
not
say
that
I
have


my
own
reason
for
dread
his
coming
:
but
come
he
do
at
last
.




one
afternoon
(
I
have
then
be
three
week
at
Lowood
)
,
as
I
be
sit


with
a
slate
in
my
hand
,
puzzle
over
a
sum
in
long
division
,
my
eye
,


raise
in
abstraction
to
the
window
,
catch
sight
of
a
figure
just


pass
:
I
recognise
almost
instinctively
that
gaunt
outline
;
and


when
,
two
minute
after
,
all
the
school
,
teacher
include
,
rise
_
en


masse
_
,
it
be
not
necessary
for
I
to
look
up
in
order
to
ascertain


whose
entrance
they
thus
greet
.
a
long
stride
measure
the


schoolroom
,
and
presently
beside
Miss
Temple
,
who
herself
have
rise
,


stand
the
same
black
column
which
have
frown
on
I
so
ominously
from


the
hearthrug
of
Gateshead
.
I
now
glance
sideways
at
this
piece
of


architecture
.
yes
,
I
be
right
:
it
be
Mr.
Brocklehurst
,
button
up
in


a
surtout
,
and
look
long
,
narrow
,
and
more
rigid
than
ever
.




I
have
my
own
reason
for
be
dismay
at
this
apparition
;
too
well
I


remember
the
perfidious
hint
give
by
Mrs.
Reed
about
my


disposition
,
&
c.
;
the
promise
pledge
by
Mr.
Brocklehurst
to
apprise


Miss
Temple
and
the
teacher
of
my
vicious
nature
.
all
along
I
have
be


dread
the
fulfilment
of
this
promise,—I
have
be
look
out
daily


for
the
"
coming
man
,
"
whose
information
respect
my
past
life
and


conversation
be
to
brand
I
as
a
bad
child
for
ever
:
now
there
he
be
.




he
stand
at
Miss
Temple
’s
side
;
he
be
speak
low
in
her
ear
:
I
do


not
doubt
he
be
make
disclosure
of
my
villainy
;
and
I
watch
she


eye
with
painful
anxiety
,
expect
every
moment
to
see
its
dark
orb


turn
on
I
a
glance
of
repugnance
and
contempt
.
I
listen
too
;
and
as


I
happen
to
be
seat
quite
at
the
top
of
the
room
,
I
catch
most
of


what
he
say
:
its
import
relieve
I
from
immediate
apprehension
.




"
I
suppose
,
Miss
Temple
,
the
thread
I
buy
at
Lowton
will
do
;
it


strike
I
that
it
would
be
just
of
the
quality
for
the
calico
chemise
,


and
I
sort
the
needle
to
match
.
you
may
tell
Miss
Smith
that
I


forget
to
make
a
memorandum
of
the
darn
needle
,
but
she
shall
have


some
paper
send
in
next
week
;
and
she
be
not
,
on
any
account
,
to
give


out
more
than
one
at
a
time
to
each
pupil
:
if
they
have
more
,
they
be


apt
to
be
careless
and
lose
they
.
and
,
o
ma’am
!
I
wish
the
woollen


stocking

to!—when
I

go
into
the


kitchen

examine
the
clothe
dry
on
the
line
;
there
be
a


quantity
of
black
hose

a
very
bad
state
of
repair

the

down

Hitherto

to
be
busy
with
my
sum

hold
my
slate

such

manner

to
conceal
my
face

I
might
have
escape
notice

not
my


treacherous
slate

an
obtrusive
crash

draw
every
eye

I
know

be
all
over

,

I
stoop

up

I
rally
my
force
for
the
bad

it
come

Mr.

immediately
after—“it

aloud

of
my
own
accord
I
could
not
have

I
be
paralysed

but
the
two


great
girl
who
sit
on

side

I

set
I
on
my

push
I


towards
the
dread
judge

then
Miss
Temple
gently
assist
I
to
his

I
catch

whispered

I

an
impulse
of
fury
against
Reed

pulse

it


be
deep
dusk
;
I
retire
into
a
corner
and
sit
down
on
the
floor
.
the


spell
by
which
I
have
be
so
far
support
begin
to
dissolve

reaction


take
place
,

soon
,
so
overwhelming
be
the
grief
that
seize
I
,
I


sink
prostrate
with
my
face
to
the
ground
.
now
I
weep
:
Helen
Burns
be


not
here
;
nothing
sustain
I
;
leave
to
myself
I
abandon
myself
,
and


my
tear
water
the
board
.
I
have
mean
to
be
so
good
,
and
to
do
so


much
at
Lowood
:
to
make
so
many
friend
,
to
earn
respect
and
win


affection
.
already
I
have
make
visible
progress
:
that
very
morning
I
have


reach
the
head
of
my
class
;
Miss
Miller
have
praise
I
warmly
;
Miss


Temple
have
smile
approbation
;
she
have
promise
to
teach
I
draw
,


and
to
let
I
learn
French
,
if
I
continue
to
make
similar
improvement


two
month
long
:
and
then
I
be
well
receive
by
my
fellow
-
pupil
;


treat
as
an
equal
by
those
of
my
own
age
,
and
not
molest
by
any
;


now
,
here
I
lie
again
crush
and
trodden
on
;
and
could
I
ever
rise


more
?




"
never
,
"
I
think
;
and
ardently
I
wish
to
die
.
while
sob
out


this
wish
in
broken
accent
,
some
one
approach

up

I
put
both

my


agitation

try
hard

aloud

her
knee
with

arm

Miss

always
something
of
serenity
in
her
air
,
of
state
in


her
mien
,
of
refined
propriety
in
her
language
,
which
preclude


deviation
into
the
ardent
,
the
excited
,
the
eager
:
something
which


chasten
the
pleasure
of
those
who
look
on
she
and
listen
to
she
,


by
a
controlling
sense
of
awe
;
and
such
be
my
feeling
now
:
but
as
to


Helen
Burns
,
I
be
strike
with
wonder
.




the
refreshing
meal
,
the
brilliant
fire
,
the
presence
and
kindness
of


her
beloved
instructress
,
or
,
perhaps
,
more
than
all
these
,
something


in
her
own
unique
mind
,
have
rouse
her
power
within
she
.
they
wake
,


they
kindle
:
first
,
they
glow
in
the
bright
tint
of
her
cheek
,
which


till
this
hour
I
have
never
see
but
pale
and
bloodless
;
then
they
shine


in
the
liquid
lustre
of
her
eye
,
which
have
suddenly
acquire
a
beauty


more
singular
than
that
of
Miss
Temple’s
—
a
beauty
neither
of
fine


colour
nor
long
eyelash
,
nor
pencil
brow
,
but
of
meaning
,
of


movement
,
of
radiance
.
then
her
soul
sit
on
her
lip
,
and
language


flow
,
from
what
source
I
can
not
tell
.
have
a
girl
of
fourteen
a
heart


large
enough
,
vigorous
enough
,
to
hold
the
swell
spring
of
pure
,


full
,
fervid
eloquence
?
such
be
the
characteristic
of
Helen
’s


discourse
on
that
,
to
I
,
memorable
evening
;
her
spirit
seem


hasten
to
live
within
a
very
brief
span
as
much
as
many
live
during


a
protract
existence
.




they
converse
of
thing
I
have
never
hear
of
;
of
nation
and
time


past
;
of
country
far
away
;
of
secret
of
nature
discover
or
guess


at
:
they
speak
of
book
:
how
many
they
have
read
!
what
store
of


knowledge
they
possess
!
then
they
seem
so
familiar
with
French


name
and
french
author
:
but
my
amazement
reach
its
climax
when
Miss


Temple
ask
Helen
if
she
sometimes
snatch
a
moment
to
recall
the


latin
her
father
have
teach
she
,
and
take
a
book
from
a
shelf
,
bade


her
read
and
construe
a
page
of
Virgil
;
and
Helen
obey
,
my
organ
of


veneration
expand
at
every
sound
line
.
she
have
scarcely
finish


ere
the
bell
announce
bedtime
!
no
delay
could
be
admit
;
Miss
Temple


embrace
we
both
,
say
,
as
she
draw
we
to
her
heart
—




"

Helen

hold
a
little

I

she
let
she
go
more


reluctantly
;
it
be
Helen
her
eye
follow
to
the
door
;
it
be
for
she


she
a
second
time
breathe
a
sad
sigh
;
for
she
she
wipe
a
tear
from


her
cheek
.




on
reach
the
bedroom
,
we
hear
the
voice
of
Miss
Scatcherd

sharp
reprimand

tell
that


to

a

dozen

"

disorder

murmur
Helen
to
I
,
in


a
low
voice
:
"

"




next
morning

piece


of

word

the
moment

after
afternoon

I
run
to
Helen
,
tear
it
off
,
and
thrust
it
into
the
fire
:
the
fury
of


which
she
be
incapable

be

in
my
soul
all
day

tear
,


hot

continually
be
scald

the


spectacle

sad
resignation

I
an
intolerable
pain

the


heart

about
a
week
subsequently
to
the
incident
above
narrate
,
Miss
Temple

who
have
write
to
Mr.

receive
his
answer

appear
that


what
he
say
go
to
corroborate
my
account

Miss
Temple

murmur

pleasure

from
that
hour
set

work
afresh

resolve
to
pioneer
my
way
through
every
difficulty

hard

success

feast
instead
on
the
spectacle

I
see
in
the


dark

bright


beck
,
full
of
dark
stone
and
sparkling
eddy
.
how
different
have
this


scene
look
when
I
view
it
lay
out
beneath
the
iron
sky
of
winter
,


stiffen
in
frost
,
shroud
with
snow!—when
mist
as
chill
as
death


wander
to
the
impulse
of
east
wind
along
those
purple
peak
,
and


roll
down
"
ing
"
and
holm
till
they
blend
with
the
frozen
fog
of
the


beck
!
that
beck
itself
be
then
a
torrent
,
turbid
and
curbless
:
it
tear


asunder
the
wood
,
and
send
a
rave
sound
through
the
air
,
often


thicken
with
wild
rain
or
whirl
sleet
;
and
for
the
forest
on
its


bank
,
_
that
_
show
only
rank
of
skeleton
.




April
advance
to
May
:
a
bright
serene
may
it
be
;
day
of
blue
sky
,


placid
sunshine
,
and
soft
western
or
southern
gale
fill
up
its


duration
.
and
now
vegetation
mature
with
vigour
;
Lowood
shake
loose


its
tress
;
it
become
all
green
,
all
flowery
;
its
great
elm
,
ash
,
and


oak
skeleton
be
restore
to
majestic
life
;
woodland
plant
spring
up


profusely
in
its
recess
;
unnumbered
variety
of
moss
fill
its


hollow
,
and
it
make
a
strange
ground
-
sunshine
out
of
the
wealth
of
its


wild
primrose
plant
:
I
have
see
their
pale
gold
gleam
in
overshadow


spot
like
scattering
of
the
sweetest
lustre
.
all
this
I
enjoy
often


and
fully
,
free
,
unwatched
,
and
almost
alone
:
for
this
unwonted
liberty


and
pleasure
there
be
a
cause
,
to
which
it
now
become
my
task
to


advert
.




have
I
not
describe
a
pleasant
site
for
a
dwelling
,
when
I
speak
of
it


as
bosom
in
hill
and
wood
,
and
rise
from
the
verge
of
a
stream
?


assuredly
,
pleasant
enough
:
but
whether
healthy
or
not
be
another


question
.




that
forest
-
dell
,
where
Lowood
lie
,
be
the
cradle
of
fog
and
fog
-
breed


pestilence
;
which
,
quicken
with
the
quickening
spring
,
creep
into


the
Orphan
Asylum
,
breathe
typhus
through
its
crowded
schoolroom
and


dormitory
,
and
,
ere
May
arrive
,
transform
the
seminary
into
an


hospital
.




semi
-
starvation
and
neglect
cold
have
predispose
most
of
the
pupil


to
receive
infection
:
forty
-
five
out
of
the
eighty
girl
lie
ill
at
one


time
.
class
be
break
up
,
rule
relax
.
the
few
who
continue
well


be
allow
almost
unlimited
license
;
because
the
medical
attendant


insist
on
the
necessity
of
frequent
exercise
to
keep
they
in
health
:


and
have
it
be
otherwise
,
no
one
have
leisure
to
watch
or
restrain


they
.
Miss
Temple
’s
whole
attention
be
absorb
by
the
patient
:
she


live
in
the
sick
-
room
,
never
quit
it
except
to
snatch
a
few
hour
'


rest
at
night
.
the
teacher
be
fully
occupy
with
pack
up
and


make
other
necessary
preparation
for
the
departure
of
those
girl


who
be
fortunate
enough
to
have
friend
and
relation
able
and


willing
to
remove
they
from
the
seat
of
contagion
.
many
,
already


smitten
,
go
home
only
to
die
:
some
die
at
the
school
,
and
be


bury
quietly
and
quickly
,
the
nature
of
the
malady
forbid
delay
.




while
disease
have
thus
become
an
inhabitant
of
Lowood
,
and
death
its


frequent
visitor
;
while
there
be
gloom
and
fear
within
its
wall
;


while
its
room
and
passage
steam
with
hospital
smell
,
the
drug
and


the
pastille
strive
vainly
to
overcome
the
effluvia
of
mortality
,


that
bright
may
shine
unclouded
over
the
bold
hill
and
beautiful


woodland
out
of
door
.
its
garden
,
too
,
glow
with
flower
:
hollyhock


have
spring
up
tall
as
tree
,
lily
have
open
,
tulip
and
rose
be


in
bloom
;
the
border
of
the
little
bed
be
gay
with
pink
thrift
and


crimson
double
daisy
;
the
sweetbriar
give
out
,
morning
and
evening
,


their
scent
of
spice
and
apple
;
and
these
fragrant
treasure
be
all


useless
for
most
of
the
inmate
of
Lowood
,
except
to
furnish
now
and


then
a
handful
of
herb
and
blossom
to
put
in
a
coffin
.




but
I
,
and
the
rest
who
continue
well
,
enjoy
fully
the
beauty
of


the
scene
and
season
;
they
let
we
ramble
in
the
wood
,
like
gipsy
,


from
morning
till
night
;
we
do
what
we
like
,
go
where
we
like
:
we


live
well
too
.
Mr.
Brocklehurst
and
his
family
never
come
near


lowood
now
:
household
matter
be
not
scrutinise
into
;
the
cross


housekeeper
be
go
,
drive
away
by
the
fear
of
infection
;
she


successor
,
who
have
be
matron
at
the
Lowton
Dispensary
,
unused
to
the


way
of
her
new
abode
,
provide
with
comparative
liberality
.
besides
,


there
be
few
to
feed
;
the
sick
could
eat
little
;
our


breakfast
-
basin
be
well
fill
;
when
there
be
no
time
to
prepare


a
regular
dinner
,
which
often
happen
,
she
would
give
we
a
large
piece


of
cold
pie
,
or
a
thick
slice
of
bread
and
cheese
,
and
this
we
carry


away
with
we
to
the
wood
,
where
we
each
choose
the
spot
we
like
well
,


and
dine
sumptuously
.




my
favourite
seat
be
a
smooth
and
broad
stone
,
rise
white
and
dry


from
the
very
middle
of
the
beck
,
and
only
to
be
get
at
by
wade


through
the
water
;
a
feat
I
accomplish
barefoot
.
the
stone
be
just


broad
enough
to
accommodate
,
comfortably
,
another
girl
and
I
,
at
that


time
my
choose
comrade
—
one
Mary
Ann
Wilson
;
a
shrewd
,
observant


personage
,
whose
society
I
take
pleasure
in
,
partly
because
she
be


witty
and
original
,
and
partly
because
she
have
a
manner
which
set
I
at


my
ease
.
some
year
old
than
I
,
she
know
more
of
the
world
,
and
could


tell
I
many
thing
I
like
to
hear
:
with
she
my
curiosity
find


gratification
:
to
my
fault
also
she
give
ample
indulgence
,
never


impose
curb
or
rein
on
anything
I
say
.
she
have
a
turn
for
narrative
,


I
for
analysis
;
she
like
to
inform
,
I
to
question
;
so
we
get
on


swimmingly
together
,
derive
much
entertainment
,
if
not
much


improvement
,
from
our
mutual
intercourse
.




and
where
,
meantime
,
be
Helen
Burns
?
why
do
I
not
spend
these
sweet


day
of
liberty
with
she
?
have
I
forget
she
?
or
be
I
so
worthless
as


to
have
grow
tired
of
her
pure
society
?
surely
the
Mary
Ann
Wilson
I


have
mention
be
inferior
to
my
first
acquaintance
:
she
could
only


tell
I
amusing
story
,
and
reciprocate
any
racy
and
pungent
gossip
I


choose
to
indulge
in
;
while
,
if
I
have
speak
truth
of
Helen
,
she
be


qualified
to
give
those
who
enjoy
the
privilege
of
her
converse
a


taste
of
far
high
thing
.




true
,
reader
;
and
I
know
and
feel
this
:
and
though
I
be
a
defective


be
,
with
many
fault
and
few
redeem
point
,
yet
I
never
tired
of


Helen
Burns
;
nor
ever
cease
to
cherish
for
she
a
sentiment
of


attachment
,
as
strong
,
tender
,
and
respectful
as
any
that
ever
animate


my
heart
.
how
could
it
be
otherwise
,
when
Helen
,
at
all
time
and
under


all
circumstance
,
evince
for
I
a
quiet
and
faithful
friendship
,


which
ill
-
humour
never
sour
,
nor
irritation
never
trouble
?
but
Helen


be
ill
at
present
:
for
some
week
she
have
be
remove
from
my
sight


to
I
know
not
what
room
upstairs
.
she
be
not
,
I
be
tell
,
in
the


hospital
portion
of
the
house
with
the
fever
patient
;
for
she


complaint
be
consumption
,
not
typhus
:
and
by
consumption
I
,
in
my


ignorance
,
understand
something
mild
,
which
time
and
care
would
be
sure


to
alleviate
.




I
be
confirm
in
this
idea
by
the
fact
of
she
once
or
twice
come


downstairs
on
very
warm
sunny
afternoon
,
and
be
take
by
Miss


Temple
into
the
garden
;
but
,
on
these
occasion
,
I
be
not
allow
to


go
and
speak
to
she
;
I
only
see
she
from
the
schoolroom
window
,
and


then
not
distinctly
;
for
she
be
much
wrap
up
,
and
sit
at
a
distance


under
the
verandah
.




one
evening
,
in
the
beginning
of
June
,
I
have
stay
out
very
late
with


Mary
Ann
in
the
wood
;
we
have
,
as
usual
,
separate
ourselves
from
the


other
,
and
have
wander
far
;
so
far
that
we
lose
our
way
,
and
have
to


ask
it
at
a
lonely
cottage
,
where
a
man
and
woman
live
,
who
look


after
a
herd
of
half
-
wild
swine
that
feed
on
the
mast
in
the
wood
.
when


we
get
back
,
it
be
after
moonrise
:
a
pony
,
which
we
know
to
be
the


surgeon
’s
,
be
stand
at
the
garden
door
.
Mary
Ann
remark
that
she


suppose
some
one
must
be
very
ill
,
as
Mr.
Bates
have
be
send
for
at


that
time
of
the
evening
.
she
go
into
the
house
;
I
stay
behind
a


few
minute
to
plant
in
my
garden
a
handful
of
root
I
have
dig
up
in


the
forest
,
and
which
I
fear
would
wither
if
I
leave
they
till
the


morning
.
this
do
,
I
linger
yet
a
little
long
:
the
flower
smell


so
sweet
as
the
dew
fall
;
it
be
such
a
pleasant
evening
,
so
serene
,
so


warm
;
the
still
glow
west
promise
so
fairly
another
fine
day
on
the


morrow
;
the
moon
rise
with
such
majesty
in
the
grave
east
.
I
be
note


these
thing
and
enjoy
they
as
a
child
might
,
when
it
enter
my


mind
as
it
have
never
do
before
:
—




"
how
sad
to
be
lie
now
on
a
sick
bed
,
and
to
be
in
danger
of
die
!


this
world
be
pleasant
—
it
would
be
dreary
to
be
call
from
it
,
and
to


have
to
go
who
know
where
?
"




and
then
my
mind
make
its
first
earnest
effort
to
comprehend
what
have


be
infuse
into
it
concern
heaven
and
hell
;
and
for
the
first
time


it
recoil
,
baffle
;
and
for
the
first
time
glance
behind
,
on
each


side
,
and
before
it
,
it
see
all
round
an
unfathomed
gulf
:
it
feel
the


one
point
where
it
stand
—
the
present
;
all
the
rest
be
formless
cloud


and
vacant
depth
;
and
it
shudder
at
the
thought
of
tottering
,
and


plunge
amid
that
chaos
.
while
ponder
this
new
idea
,
I
hear
the


front
door
open
;
Mr.
Bates
come
out
,
and
with
he
be
a
nurse
.
after


she
have
see
he
mount
his
horse
and
depart
,
she
be
about
to
close
the


door
,
but
I
run
up
to
she

"




this
phrase
,
utter
in
my
hearing
yesterday
,
would
have
only
convey


the
notion
that
she

about
to

remove
to
Northumberland
,
to

own
home

I
should
not

she
be
die
;
but


I
know
instantly
now
!
it
open
clear
on
my
comprehension
that
Helen


Burns
be
number
she
last
day
in

that
she

of
spirit

if
such
region
there

I


experience
a
shock
of
horror
,
then
a
strong
thrill
of
grief
,
then
a


desire
—
a
necessity
to
see
she
;
and
I
ask
in
what
room
she
lie
.




"

Miss
Temple

room

"
oh
no

it
be
not
likely

now
it
be
time
for
you
to
come
in
;


you
’ll
catch
the
fever
if
you
stop
out
when
the

fall

nurse
close
the
front
door
;
I
go
in
by
the
side
entrance
which


lead
to
the
schoolroom
:
I
be
just
in
time
;
it
be
nine
o’clock
,
and


Miss
Miller
be
call
the
pupil
to
go
to
bed
.




it
might
be
two
hour
later
,
probably
near
eleven
,
when
I
—
not
have


be
able
to
fall
asleep
,
and
deeming
,
from
the
perfect
silence
of
the


dormitory
,
that
my
companion

all
wrapt
in
profound
repose

softly

on
my
frock
over
my
night

dress

creep


from
the
apartment
,
and
set
off
in
quest
of
Miss
Temple
’s
room
.
it
be


quite
at
the
other
end
of
the
house
;
but
I
know
my
way
;
and
the
light


of
the
unclouded
summer
moon
,
enter
here
and
there
at
passage


window
,

I
to

it
without
difficulty
.
an
odour
of
camphor


and
burn
vinegar
warn
I
when
I
come
near
the
fever
room
:
and
I


pass
its
door
quickly
,
fearful
lest
the
nurse
who
sit
up
all
night


should
hear
I
.
I
dread
be
discover
and
send
back
;
for
I
_
must
_


see
helen,—i
must
embrace
she
before
she
died,—I
must
give
she
one
last


kiss
,
exchange
with
her
one
last
word

a

a
portion

I


reach
another
flight

these
I
mount
,

just


opposite
to
I
be
Miss

room

a
light
shine
through
the


keyhole
and
from
under
the
door
;
a
profound
stillness
pervade
the


vicinity
.
come
near
,
I
find
the
door
slightly
ajar
;
probably
to


admit
some
fresh
air
into
the
close
abode
of
sickness
.
indispose
to


hesitate
,

full
of
impatient
impulse
—
soul
and
sense
quiver
with


keen
throe

I
put
it
back

Helen

fear

find
death

close
by
Miss
Temple
’s
bed
,
and
half
cover
with
its
white
curtain
,


there
stand
a
little
crib
.
I
see
the
outline
of
a
form
under
the


clothe
,
but
the
face
be
hide
by
the
hanging

nurse
I
have
speak


to
in
the
garden
sit
in
an
easy

chair
asleep
;
an
unsnuffed
candle
burn


dimly
on
the
table
.
Miss

not

afterwards


that

be
call
to
a
delirious
patient
in
the
fever

room

I


advanced
;
then
pause
by
the
crib
side
:
my
hand
be
on
the
curtain
,
but


I
prefer
speak
before
I
withdraw
it
.
I
still
recoil
at
the


dread
of
see
a
corpse
.




"

I
whisper
softly

stir
herself
,
put
back

curtain
,
and
I
see
her
face
,
pale
,


waste
,
but
quite
composed
:
she
look
so
little
change
that
my

instantly
dissipate

learn
that

marble


tablet

spot

chapter
x






Hitherto
I
have
record
in
detail
the
event
of
my
insignificant


existence
:
to
the
first
ten
year
of
my
life
I
have
give
almost
as


many
chapter
.
but
this
be
not
to
be
a
regular
autobiography
:
I
be
only


bind
to
invoke
memory
where
I
know
her
response
will
possess
some


degree
of
interest
;
therefore
I
now
pass
a
space
of
eight
year
almost


in
silence

a
few
line
only
be
necessary

up
the
link
of


connection

when
the
typhus
fever
have
fulfil
its
mission
of
devastation
at


lowood

it
gradually
disappear
from
thence
;
but
not
till
its


virulence
and
the
number
of
its
victim
have
draw
public
attention
on


the
school
.
Inquiry
be
make
into
the
origin
of
the
scourge
,
and
by


degree
various
fact
come
out
which
excite
public
indignation
in
a


high
degree
.
the
unhealthy
nature
of
the
site
;
the
quantity
and
quality


of
the
child
’s
food

the
brackish

,
from

connection
,
could
not
be
overlook

still
retain
the

of
his
duty
by
gentleman


of
rather
more

,
be
share

who
know
how
to
combine

school
,
thus
improve
,
become
in
time
a
truly
useful
and
noble


institution
.
I
remain
an
inmate
of
its
wall
,
after
its
regeneration
,


for
eight
year
:
six
as
pupil
,
and
two
as
teacher
;
and
in
both


capacity
I
bear
my
testimony
to
its
value
and
importance
.




during
these
eight
year
my
life
be
uniform
:
but
not
unhappy
,
because


it
be
not
inactive
.
I
have
the
mean
of
an
excellent
education
place


within
my
reach
;
a
fondness
for
some
of
my
study
,
and
a
desire
to


excel
in
all
,
together
with
a
great
delight
in
please
my
teacher
,


especially
such
as
I
love
,
urge
I
on
:
I
avail
myself
fully
of
the


advantage
offer
I
.
in
time
I
rise
to
be
the
first
girl
of
the
first


class
;
then
I
be
invest
with
the
office
of
teacher
;
which
I


discharge
with
zeal
for
two
year
:
but
at
the
end
of
that
time
I


alter
.




Miss
Temple
,
through
all
change
,
have
thus
far
continue
superintendent


of
the
seminary
:
to
her
instruction
I
owe
the
good
part
of
my


acquirement
;
her
friendship
and
society
have
be
my
continual
solace
;


she
have
stand
I
in
the
stead
of
mother
,
governess
,
and
,
latterly
,


companion
.
at
this
period
she
marry
,
remove
with
her
husband
(
a


clergyman
,
an
excellent
man
,
almost
worthy
of
such
a
wife
)
to
a
distant


county
,
and
consequently
be
lose
to
I
.




from
the
day
she
leave
I
be
no
long
the
same
:
with
she
be
go
every


settle
feeling
,
every
association
that
have
make
Lowood
in
some
degree


a
home
to
I
.
I
have
imbibe
from
she
something
of
her
nature
and
much


of
her
habit
:
more
harmonious
thought
:
what
seem
well
regulate


feeling
have
become
the
inmate
of
my
mind
.
I
have
give
in
allegiance


to
duty
and
order
;
I
be
quiet
;
I
believe
I
be
content
:
to
the
eye


of
other
,
usually
even
to
my
own
,
I
appear
a
disciplined
and
subdue


character
.




but
destiny
,
in
the
shape
of
the
Rev.
Mr.
Nasmyth
,
come
between
I
and


Miss
Temple
:
I
see
she
in
her
travel
dress
step
into
a
post
-
chaise
,


shortly
after
the
marriage
ceremony
;
I
watch
the
chaise
mount
the


hill
and
disappear
beyond
its
brow
;
and
then
retire
to
my
own
room
,


and
there
spend
in
solitude
the
great
part
of
the
half
-
holiday


grant
in
honour
of
the
occasion
.




I
walk
about
the
chamber
most
of
the
time
.
I
imagine
myself
only
to


be
regret
my
loss
,
and
think
how
to
repair
it
;
but
when
my


reflection
be
conclude
,
and
I
look
up
and
find
that
the


afternoon
be
go
,
and
evening
far
advanced
,
another
discovery
dawn


on
I
,
namely
,
that
in
the
interval
I
have
undergo
a
transforming


process
;
that
my
mind
have
put
off
all
it
have
borrow
of
Miss
Temple
—
or


rather
that
she
have
take
with
she
the
serene
atmosphere
I
have
be


breathe
in
her
vicinity
—
and
that
now
I
be
leave
in
my
natural


element
,
and
begin
to
feel
the
stirring
of
old
emotion
.
it
do
not


seem
as
if
a
prop
be
withdraw
,
but
rather
as
if
a
motive
be
go
:


it
be
not
the
power
to
be
tranquil
which
have
fail
I
,
but
the
reason


for
tranquillity
be
no
more
.
my
world
have
for
some
year
be
in


lowood
:
my
experience
have
be
of
its
rule
and
system
;
now
I


remember
that
the
real
world
be
wide
,
and
that
a
varied
field
of


hope
and
fear
,
of
sensation
and
excitement
,
await
those
who
have


courage
to
go
forth
into
its
expanse
,
to
seek
real
knowledge
of
life


amidst
its
peril
.




I
go
to
my
window
,
open
it
,
and
look
out
.
there
be
the
two


wing
of
the
building
;
there
be
the
garden
;
there
be
the
skirt
of


lowood
;
there
be
the
hilly
horizon
.
my
eye
pass
all
other
object
to


rest
on
those
most
remote
,
the
blue
peak
;
it
be
those
I
long
to


surmount
;
all
within
their
boundary
of
rock
and
heath
seem


prison
-
ground
,
exile
limit
.
I
trace
the
white
road
wind
round
the


base
of
one
mountain
,
and
vanish
in
a
gorge
between
two
;
how
I


long
to
follow
it
far
!
I
recall
the
time
when
I
have
travel


that
very
road
in
a
coach
;
I
remember
descend
that
hill
at


twilight
;
an
age
seem
to
have
elapse
since
the
day
which
bring
I


first
to
Lowood
,
and
I
have
never
quit
it
since
.
my
vacation
have
all


be
spend
at
school
:
Mrs.
Reed
have
never
send
for
I
to
Gateshead
;


neither
she
nor
any
of
her
family
have
ever
be
to
visit
I
.
I
have
have


no
communication
by
letter
or
message
with
the
outer
world
:


school
-
rule
,
school
-
duty
,
school
-
habit
and
notion
,
and
voice
,
and


face
,
and
phrase
,
and
costume
,
and
preference
,
and
antipathy
—
such


be
what
I
know
of
existence
.
and
now
I
feel
that
it
be
not
enough
;
I


tired
of
the
routine
of
eight
year
in
one
afternoon
.
I
desire


liberty
;
for
liberty
I
gasp
;
for
liberty
I
utter
a
prayer
;
it


seem
scatter
on
the
wind
then
faintly
blow
.
I
abandon
it
and


frame
a
humble
supplication
;
for
change
,
stimulus
:
that
petition
,


too
,
seemed
sweep
off
into
vague
space
:
"
then
,
"
I
cry
,
half


desperate
,
"
grant
I
at
least
a
new
servitude
!
"




here
a
bell
,
ring
the
hour
of
supper
,
call
I
downstairs
.




I
be
not
free
to
resume
the
interrupted
chain
of
my
reflection
till


bedtime
:
even
then
a
teacher
who
occupy
the
same
room
with
I
keep
I


from
the
subject
to
which
I
long
to
recur
,
by
a
prolong
effusion
of


small
talk
.
how
I
wish
sleep
would
silence
she
.
it
seem
as
if
,


could
I
but
go
back
to
the
idea
which
have
last
enter
my
mind
as
I


stand
at
the
window
,
some
inventive
suggestion
would
rise
for
my


relief
.




Miss
Gryce
snore
at
last
;
she
be
a
heavy
Welshwoman
,
and
till
now
she


habitual
nasal
strain
have
never
be
regard
by
I
in
any
other
light


than
as
a
nuisance
;
to
-
night
I
hail
the
first
deep
note
with


satisfaction
;
I
be
debarrasse
of
interruption
;
my
half
-
efface


think
instantly
revive
.




"
a
new
servitude
!
there
be
something
in
that
,
"
I
soliloquise


(
mentally
,
be
it
understand
;
I
do
not
talk
aloud
)
,
"
I
know
there
be
,


because
it
do
not
sound
too
sweet
;
it
be
not
like
such
word
as


Liberty
,
Excitement
,
Enjoyment
:
delightful
sound
truly
;
but
no
more


than
sound
for
I
;
and
so
hollow
and
fleeting
that
it
be
mere
waste
of


time
to
listen
to
they
.
but
Servitude
!
that
must
be
matter
of
fact
.
any


one
may
serve
:
I
have
serve
here
eight
year
;
now
all
I
want
be
to


serve
elsewhere
.
can
I
not
get
so
much
of
my
own
will
?
be
not
the
thing


feasible
?
yes
—
yes
—
the
end
be
not
so
difficult
;
if
I
have
only
a
brain


active
enough
to
ferret
out
the
mean
of
attain
it
.
"




I
sit
up
in
bed
by
way
of
arouse
this
say
brain
:
it
be
a
chilly


night
;
I
cover
my
shoulder
with
a
shawl
,
and
then
I
proceed
_
to


think
_
again
with
all
my
might
.




"
what
do
I
want
?
a
new
place
,
in
a
new
house
,
amongst
new
face
,
under


new
circumstance
:
I
want
this
because
it
be
of
no
use
want
anything


well
.
how
do
people
do
to
get
a
new
place
?
they
apply
to
friend
,
I


suppose
:
I
have
no
friend
.
there
be
many
other
who
have
no
friend
,


who
must
look
about
for
themselves
and
be
their
own
helper
;
and
what


be
their
resource
?
"




I
could
not
tell
:
nothing
answer
I
;
I
then
order
my
brain
to
find


a
response
,
and
quickly
.
it
work
and
work
fast
:
I
feel
the
pulse


throb
in
my
head
and
temple
;
but
for
nearly
an
hour
it
work
in


chaos
;
and
no
result
come
of
its
effort
.
feverish
with
vain
labour
,
I


get
up
and
take
a
turn
in
the
room
;
undrew
the
curtain
,
note
a
star
or


two
,
shiver
with
cold
,
and
again
creep
to
bed
.




a
kind
fairy
,
in
my
absence
,
have
surely
drop
the
require
suggestion


on
my
pillow
;
for
as
I
lie
down
,
it
come
quietly
and
naturally
to
my


mind:—“Those
who
want
situation
advertise

you
must
advertise
in
the

"
how
?
I
know
nothing
about
advertising
.
"




reply
rise
smooth
and
prompt
now
:
—




"
you
must
enclose
the

and
the
money
to
pay
for
it
under
a


cover
direct
to
the
editor
of
the

;
you
must
put
it
,
the


first
opportunity
you

act


accordingly

"




this
scheme
I
go
over
twice
,
thrice
;
it
be
then
digest
in
my
mind
;


I
have
it
in
a
clear
practical
form
:
I
feel
satisfied
,
and
fall
asleep
.




with
early
day

I
be
up

bell
ring

after

I
ask

of

to

to

,

to

go
.
it
be
a
walk
of
two
mile
,
and


the
evening
be
wet
,
but
the
day
be
still
long
;
I
visit
a
shop
or


two
,
slip
the
letter
into
the
post

office
,
and
come
back
through


heavy
rain
,
with
streaming
garment
,
but
with
a
relieved
heart
.




the
succeed
week
seem
long
:
it
come
to
an
end
at
last
,
however
,


like
all
sublunary
thing
,
and
once
more
,
towards
the
close
of
a


pleasant
autumn
day
,
I
find
myself
afoot
on
the
road
to
Lowton
.
a


picturesque
track
it
be
,
by
the
way
;
lie
along
the
side
of
the
beck


and
through
the
sweetest
curve
of
the
dale
:
but
that
day
I
think


more
of
the
letter
,
that
might
or
might
not
be

I
at
the


little
burgh
whither
I
be
bind

of
the
charm
of
lea
and
water

my
ostensible
errand
on
this
occasion
be
to
get
measure
for
a
pair
of


shoe
;
so
I
discharge
that
business
first
,
and
when
it
be
do
,
I


step
across
the
clean
and
quiet
little
street
from
the
shoemaker
’s


to
the
post

by
an
old

wear
horn

nose

mitten

"
I
ask
.




she
peer
at
I
over
her
spectacle
,
and
then
she
open
a
drawer
and


fumble
among
its
content
for
a
long
time
,
so
long
that
my
hope
begin


to
falter
.
at
last
,
having
hold
a
document
before
her
glass
for


nearly
five
minute
,
she
present
it
across
the
counter
,
accompany


the
act
by
another
inquisitive
and
mistrustful
glance
—
it
be
for
J.E.




"
be
there
only
one

"
I
demand
.




"
there
be
no
more

"
say
she
;
and
I
put
it
in
my
pocket
and
turn
my


face
homeward
:
I
could
not
open
it
then
;
rule
oblige
I
to
be
back
by


eight
,

it
be
already
half

past
seven
.




various
duty
await
I
on
my
arrival
:
I
have
to
sit
with
the
girl


during
their
hour
of
study
;
then
it
be
my
turn
to
read
prayer
;
to
see


they
to
bed
:
afterwards
I
sup
with
the
other
teacher
.
even
when
we


finally
retire
for
the
night
,
the
inevitable
Miss
Gryce
be
still
my


companion
:
we
have
only
a
short
end
of
candle
in
our
candlestick
,
and
I


dread
lest
she
should
talk
till
it
be
all
burn
out
;
fortunately
,


however
,
the
heavy
supper
she
have
eat
produce
a
soporific
effect
:


she
be
already
snore
before
I
have
finish
undressing
.
there
still


remain
an
inch
of
candle
:
I
now
take
out
my
letter

the
seal

I
examine
the
document
long

the
writing
be
old

fashioned
and
rather


uncertain
,
like
that
of
an
elderly
lady

this
circumstance
be


satisfactory
:
a
private
fear
have
haunt
I
,
that
in
thus
act
for


myself
,

by
my
own
guidance

I
run
the
risk
of

into
some


scrape

,
above

no

I
see


she
in
a
black
gown
and
widow

cap
;
frigid
,
perhaps
,
but
not
uncivil

a
model
of
elderly
english
respectability

the

neat
orderly
spot

I
be
sure
;

I


fail
in
my

thornfield

a
good

I

a
prospect

outside
,
and
we
set


off
.
our
progress
be
leisurely
,
and
give
I
ample
time
to
reflect
;
I


be
content
to
be
at
length
so
near
the
end
of
my
journey
;
and
as
I


lean
back
in
the
comfortable
though
not
elegant
conveyance
,
I


meditate
much
at
my
ease
.




"
I
suppose
,
"
think
I
,
"
judge
from
the
plainness
of
the
servant
and


carriage
,
Mrs.
Fairfax
be
not
a
very
dashing
person
:
so
much
the


well
;
I
never
live
amongst
fine
people
but
once
,
and
I
be
very


miserable
with
they
.
I
wonder
if
she
live
alone
except
this
little


girl
;
if
so
,
and
if
she
be
in
any
degree
amiable
,
I
shall
surely
be


able
to
get
on
with
she
;
I
will
do
my
good
;
it
be
a
pity
that
do


one
’s
good
do
not
always
answer
.
at
Lowood
,
indeed
,
I
take
that


resolution
,
keep
it
,
and
succeed
in
pleasing
;
but
with
Mrs.
Reed
,
I


remember
my
good
be
always
spurn
with
scorn
.
I
pray
God
Mrs.
Fairfax


may
not
turn
out
a
second
Mrs.
Reed
;
but
if
she
do
,
I
be
not
bind
to


stay
with
she
!
let
the
bad
come
to
the
bad
,
I
can
advertise
again
.


how
far
be
we
on
our
road
now
,
I
wonder
?
"




I
let
down
the
window
and
look
out
;
Millcote
be
behind
we
;
judge


by
the
number
of
its
light
,
it
seem
a
place
of
considerable


magnitude
,
much
large
than
Lowton
.
we
be
now
,
as
far
as
I
could
see
,


on
a
sort
of
common
;
but
there
be
house
scatter
all
over
the


district
;
I
feel
we
be
in
a
different
region
to
Lowood
,
more


populous
,
less
picturesque
;
more
stirring
,
less
romantic
.




the
road
be
heavy
,
the
night
misty
;
my
conductor
let
his
horse
walk


all
the
way
,
and
the
hour
and
a
half
extended
,
I
verily
believe
,
to
two


hour
;
at
last
he
turn
in
his
seat
and
say
—




"
you
’re
noan
so
far
fro
'
Thornfield
now
.
"




again
I
look
out
:
we
be
pass
a
church
;
I
see
its
low
broad
tower


against
the
sky
,
and
its
bell
be
toll
a
quarter
;
I
see
a
narrow


galaxy
of
light
too
,
on
a
hillside
,
mark
a
village
or
hamlet
.
about


ten
minute
after
,
the
driver
get
down
and
open
a
pair
of
gate
:
we


pass
through
,
and
they
clash
to
behind
we
.
we
now
slowly
ascend
a


drive
,
and
come
upon
the
long
front
of
a
house
:
candlelight
gleam


from
one
curtained
bow
-
window
;
all
the
rest
be
dark
.
the
car
stop


at
the
front
door
;
it
be
open
by
a
maid
-
servant
;
I
alight
and
go


in
.




"
will
you
walk
this
way
,
ma’am
?
"
say
the
girl
;
and
I
follow
she


across
a
square
hall
with
high
door
all
round
:
she
usher
I
into
a


room
whose
double
illumination
of
fire
and
candle
at
first
dazzle
I
,


contrast
as
it
do
with
the
darkness
to
which
my
eye
have
be
for


two
hour
inure
;
when
I
could
see
,
however
,
a
cosy
and
agreeable


picture
present
itself
to
my
view
.




a
snug
small
room
;
a
round
table
by
a
cheerful
fire
;
an
arm
-
chair


high
-
back
and
old
-
fashioned
,
wherein
sit
the
neat
imaginable


little
elderly
lady
,
in
widow
’s
cap
,
black
silk
gown
,
and
snowy
muslin


apron
;
exactly
like
what
I
have
fancy
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
only
less
stately


and
milder
look
.
she
be
occupy
in
knitting
;
a
large
cat
sit


demurely
at
her
foot
;
nothing
in
short
be
want
to
complete
the


beau
-
ideal
of
domestic
comfort
.
a
more
reassuring
introduction
for
a


new
governess
could
scarcely
be
conceive
;
there
be
no
grandeur
to


overwhelm
,
no
stateliness
to
embarrass
;
and
then
,
as
I
enter
,
the
old


lady
get
up
and
promptly
and
kindly
come
forward
to
meet
I
.




"
how
do
you
do
,
my
dear
?
I
be
afraid
you
have
have
a
tedious
ride
;
John


drive
so
slowly
;
you
must
be
cold
,
come
to
the
fire
.
"




"
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
I
suppose
?
"
say
i.




"
yes
,
you
be
right
:
do
sit
down
.
"




she
conduct
I
to
her
own
chair
,
and
then
begin
to
remove
my
shawl


and
untie
my
bonnet
-
string
;
I
beg
she
would
not
give
herself
so


much
trouble
.




"
oh
,
it
be
no
trouble
;
I
dare
say
your
own
hand
be
almost
numb
with


cold
.
leah
,
make
a
little
hot
negus
and
cut
a
sandwich
or
two
:
here
be


the
key
of
the
storeroom
.
"




and
she
produce
from
her
pocket
a
most
housewifely
bunch
of
key
,
and


deliver
they
to
the
servant
.




"
now
,
then
,
draw
nearer
to
the
fire
,
"
she
continue
.
"
you
’ve
bring


your
luggage
with
you
,
have
n’t
you
,
my
dear
?
"




"
yes
,
ma’am
.
"




"
I
’ll
see
it
carry
into
your
room
,
"
she
say
,
and
bustle
out
.




"
she
treat
I
like
a
visitor
,
"
think
I.
"
I
little
expect
such
a


reception
;
I
anticipate
only
coldness
and
stiffness
:
this
be
not
like


what
I
have
hear
of
the
treatment
of
governess
;
but
I
must
not
exult


too
soon
.
"




she
return
;
with
her
own
hand
clear
her
knitting
apparatus
and
a


book
or
two
from
the
table
,
to
make
room
for
the
tray
which
Leah
now


bring
,
and
then
herself
hand
I
the
refreshment
.
I
feel
rather


confused
at
be
the
object
of
more
attention
than
I
have
ever
before


receive
,
and
,
that
too
,
show
by
my
employer
and
superior
;
but
as
she


do
not
herself
seem
to
consider
she
be
do
anything
out
of
she


place
,
I
think
it
well
to
take
her
civility
quietly
.




"
shall
I
have
the
pleasure
of
see
Miss
Fairfax
to
-
night
?
"
I
ask
,


when
I
have
partake
of
what
she
offer
I
.




"
what
do
you
say
,
my
dear
?
I
be
a
little
deaf
,
"
return
the
good


lady
,
approach
her
ear
to
my
mouth
.




I
repeat
the
question
more
distinctly
.




"
Miss
Fairfax
?
oh
,
you
mean
Miss
Varens
!
Varens
be
the
name
of
your


future
pupil
.
"




"
indeed
!
then
she
be
not
your
daughter
?
"




"
no,—i
have
no
family
.
"




I
should
have
follow
up
my
first
inquiry
,
by
ask
in
what
way
Miss


Varens
be
connect
with
she
;
but
I
recollect
it
be
not
polite
to


ask
too
many
question
:
besides
,
I
be
sure
to
hear
in
time
.




"
I
be
so
glad
,
"
she
continue
,
as
she
sit
down
opposite
to
I
,
and
take


the
cat
on
her
knee
;
"
I
be
so
glad
you
be
come
;
it
will
be
quite


pleasant
living
here
now
with
a
companion
.
to
be
sure
it
be
pleasant
at


any
time
;
for
Thornfield
be
a
fine
old
hall
,
rather
neglect
of
late


year
perhaps
,
but
still
it
be
a
respectable
place
;
yet
you
know
in


winter
-
time
one
feel
dreary
quite
alone
in
the
good
quarter
.
I
say


alone
—
Leah
be
a
nice
girl
to
be
sure
,
and
John
and
his
wife
be
very


decent
people
;
but
then
you
see
they
be
only
servant
,
and
one
ca
n’t


converse
with
they
on
term
of
equality
:
one
must
keep
they
at
due


distance
,
for
fear
of
lose
one
’s
authority
.
I
’m
sure
last
winter
(
it


be
a
very
severe
one
,
if
you
recollect
,
and
when
it
do
not
snow
,
it


rain
and
blow
)
,
not
a
creature
but
the
butcher
and
postman
come
to


the
house
,
from
November
till
February
;
and
I
really
get
quite


melancholy
with
sit
night
after
night
alone
;
I
have
Leah
in
to
read


to
I
sometimes
;
but
I
do
n’t
think
the
poor
girl
like
the
task
much
:


she
feel
it
confine
.
in
spring
and
summer
one
get
on
well
:
sunshine


and
long
day
make
such
a
difference
;
and
then
,
just
at
the


commencement
of
this
autumn
,
little
Adela
Varens
come
and
her
nurse
:
a


child
make
a
house
alive
all
at
once
;
and
now
you
be
here
I
shall
be


quite
gay
.
"




my
heart
really
warm
to
the
worthy
lady
as
I
hear
her
talk
;
and
I


draw
my
chair
a
little
nearer
to
she
,
and
express
my
sincere
wish


that
she
might
find
my
company
as
agreeable
as
she
anticipate
.




"
but
I
’ll
not
keep
you
sit
up
late
to
-
night
,
"
say
she
;
"
it
be
on


the
stroke
of
twelve
now
,
and
you
have
be
travel
all
day
:
you


must
feel
tired
.
if
you
have
get
your
foot
well
warm
,
I
’ll
show
you


your
bedroom
.
I
’ve
have
the
room
next
to
mine
prepare
for
you
;
it
be


only
a
small
apartment
,
but
I
think
you
would
like
it
well
than
one


of
the
large
front
chamber
:
to
be
sure
they
have
fine
furniture
,
but


they
be
so
dreary
and
solitary
,
I
never
sleep
in
they
myself
.
"




I
thank
she
for
her
considerate
choice
,
and
as
I
really
feel
fatigued


with
my
long
journey
,
express
my
readiness
to
retire
.
she
take
she


candle
,
and
I
follow
she
from
the
room
.
first
she
go
to
see
if
the


hall
-
door
be
fasten
;
having
take
the
key
from
the
lock
,
she
lead
the


way
upstairs
.
the
step
and
banister
be
of
oak
;
the
staircase
window


be
high
and
lattice
;
both
it
and
the
long
gallery
into
which
the


bedroom
door
open
look
as
if
they
belong
to
a
church
rather
than


a
house
.
a
very
chill
and
vault
-
like
air
pervade
the
stair
and


gallery
,
suggest
cheerless
idea
of
space
and
solitude
;
and
I
be


glad
,
when
finally
usher
into
my
chamber
,
to
find
it
of
small


dimension
,
and
furnish
in
ordinary
,
modern
style
.




when
Mrs.
Fairfax
have
bid
I
a
kind
good
-
night
,
and
I
have
fasten


my
door
,
gaze
leisurely
round
,
and
in
some
measure
efface
the
eerie


impression
make
by
that
wide
hall
,
that
dark
and
spacious
staircase
,


and
that
long
,
cold
gallery
,
by
the
lively
aspect
of
my
little
room
,


I
remember
that
,
after
a
day
of
bodily
fatigue
and
mental
anxiety
,
I


be
now
at
last
in
safe
haven
.
the
impulse
of
gratitude
swell
my


heart
,
and
I
knelt
down
at
the
bedside
,
and
offer
up
thank
where


thank
be
due
;
not
forget
,
ere
I
rise
,
to
implore
aid
on
my


further
path
,
and
the
power
of
merit
the
kindness
which
seem
so


frankly
offer
I
before
it
be
earn
.
my
couch
have
no
thorn
in
it


that
night
;
my
solitary
room
no
fear
.
at
once
weary
and
content
,
I


sleep
soon
and
soundly
:
when
I
awake
it
be
broad
day
.




the
chamber
look
such
a
bright
little
place
to
I
as
the
sun
shine
in


between
the
gay
blue
chintz
window
curtain
,
show
paper
wall
and


a
carpeted
floor
,
so
unlike
the
bare
plank
and
stained
plaster
of


lowood
,
that
my
spirit
rise
at
the
view
.
external
have
a
great
effect


on
the
young
:
I
think
that
a
fair
era
of
life
be
begin
for
I
,


one
that
be
to
have
its
flower
and
pleasure
,
as
well
as
its
thorn


and
toil
.
my
faculty
,
rouse
by
the
change
of
scene
,
the
new
field


offer
to
hope
,
seem
all
astir
.
I
can
not
precisely
define
what
they


expect
,
but
it
be
something
pleasant
:
not
perhaps
that
day
or
that


month
,
but
at
an
indefinite
future
period
.




I
rise
;
I
dress
myself
with
care
:
oblige
to
be
plain
—
for
I
have
no


article
of
attire
that
be
not
make
with
extreme
simplicity
—
I
be
still


by
nature
solicitous
to
be
neat
.
it
be
not
my
habit
to
be
disregardful


of
appearance
or
careless
of
the
impression
I
make
:
on
the
contrary
,
I


ever
wish
to
look
as
well
as
I
could
,
and
to
please
as
much
as
my


want
of
beauty
would
permit
.
I
sometimes
regret
that
I
be
not


handsomer
;
I
sometimes
wish
to
have
rosy
cheek
,
a
straight
nose
,
and


small
cherry
mouth
;
I
desire
to
be
tall
,
stately
,
and
finely
develop


in
figure
;
I
feel
it
a
misfortune
that
I
be
so
little
,
so
pale
,
and


have
feature
so
irregular
and
so
marked
.
and
why
have
I
these


aspiration
and
these
regret
?
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
:
I
could


not
then
distinctly
say
it
to
myself
;
yet
I
have
a
reason
,
and
a


logical
,
natural
reason
too
.
however
,
when
I
have
brush
my
hair
very


smooth
,
and
put
on
my
black
frock
—
which
,
Quakerlike
as
it
be
,
at
least


have
the
merit
of
fitting
to
a
nicety
—
and
adjust
my
clean
white


tucker
,
I
think
I
should
do
respectably
enough
to
appear
before
Mrs.


fairfax
,
and
that
my
new
pupil
would
not
at
least
recoil
from
I
with


antipathy
.
having
open
my
chamber
window
,
and
see
that
I
leave
all


thing
straight
and
neat
on
the
toilet
table
,
I
venture
forth
.




traverse
the
long
and
matted
gallery
,
I
descend
the
slippery
step


of
oak
;
then
I
gain
the
hall
:
I
halt
there
a
minute
;
I
look
at


some
picture
on
the
wall
(
one
,
I
remember
,
represent
a
grim
man
in


a
cuirass
,
and
one
a
lady
with
powdered
hair
and
a
pearl
necklace
)
,
at


a
bronze
lamp
pendent
from
the
ceiling
,
at
a
great
clock
whose
case
be


of
oak
curiously
carve
,
and
ebon
black
with
time
and
rub
.


everything
appear
very
stately
and
impose
to
I
;
but
then
I
be
so


little
accustomed
to
grandeur
.
the
hall
-
door
,
which
be
half
of
glass
,


stand
open
;
I
step
over
the
threshold
.
it
be
a
fine
autumn
morning
;


the
early
sun
shine
serenely
on
embrown
grove
and
still
green


field
;
advance
on
to
the
lawn
,
I
look
up
and
survey
the
front
of


the
mansion
.
it
be
three
storey
high
,
of
proportion
not
vast
,
though


considerable
:
a
gentleman
’s
manor
-
house
,
not
a
nobleman
’s
seat
:


battlement
round
the
top
give
it
a
picturesque
look
.
its
grey
front


stand
out
well
from
the
background
of
a
rookery
,
whose
cawing
tenant


be
now
on
the
wing
:
they
fly
over
the
lawn
and
ground
to
alight
in


a
great
meadow
,
from
which
these
be
separate
by
a
sunk
fence
,
and


where
an
array
of
mighty
old
thorn
tree
,
strong
,
knotty
,
and
broad
as


oak
,
at
once
explain
the
etymology
of
the
mansion
’s
designation
.


far
off
be
hill
:
not
so
lofty
as
those
round
Lowood
,
nor
so


craggy
,
nor
so
like
barrier
of
separation
from
the
live
world
;
but


yet
quiet
and
lonely
hill
enough
,
and
seem
to
embrace
Thornfield


with
a
seclusion
I
have
not
expect
to
find
existent
so
near
the


stir
locality
of
Millcote
.
a
little
hamlet
,
whose
roof
be
blent


with
tree
,
straggle
up
the
side
of
one
of
these
hill
;
the
church
of


the
district
stand
nearer
Thornfield
:
its
old
tower
-
top
look
over
a


knoll
between
the
house
and
gate
.




I
be
yet
enjoy
the
calm
prospect
and
pleasant
fresh
air
,
yet


listen
with
delight
to
the
cawing
of
the
rook
,
yet
survey
the


wide
,
hoary
front
of
the
hall
,
and
think
what
a
great
place
it
be


for
one
lonely
little
dame
like
Mrs.
Fairfax
to
inhabit
,
when
that
lady


appear
at
the
door
.




"
what
!
out
already
?
"
say
she
.
"
I
see
you
be
an
early
riser
.
"
I
go


up
to
she
,
and
be
receive
with
an
affable
kiss
and
shake
of
the
hand
.




"
how
do
you
like
Thornfield
?
"
she
ask
.
I
tell
she
I
like
it
very


much
.




"
yes
,
"
she
say
,
"
it
be
a
pretty
place
;
but
I
fear
it
will
be
get


out
of
order
,
unless
Mr.
Rochester
should
take
it
into
his
head
to
come


and
reside
here
permanently
;
or
,
at
least
,
visit
it
rather
oftener
:


great
house
and
fine
ground
require
the
presence
of
the
proprietor
.
"




"
Mr.
Rochester
!
"
I
exclaim
.
"
who
be
he
?
"




"
the
owner
of
Thornfield
,
"
she
respond
quietly
.
"
do
you
not
know
he


be
call
Rochester
?
"




of
course
I
do
not
—
I
have
never
hear
of
he
before
;
but
the
old
lady


seem
to
regard
his
existence
as
a
universally
understand
fact
,
with


which
everybody
must
be
acquaint
by
instinct
.




"
I
think
,
"
I
continue
,
"
Thornfield
belong
to
you
.
"




"
to
I
?
bless
you
,
child
;
what
an
idea
!
to
I
!
I
be
only
the


housekeeper
—
the
manager
.
to
be
sure
I
be
distantly
relate
to
the


rochester
by
the
mother
’s
side
,
or
at
least
my
husband
be
;
he
be
a


clergyman
,
incumbent
of
Hay
—
that
little
village
yonder
on
the
hill
—
and


that
church
near
the
gate
be
his
.
the
present
Mr.
Rochester
’s
mother


be
a
fairfax
,
and
second
cousin
to
my
husband
:
but
I
never
presume
on


the
connection
—
in
fact
,
it
be
nothing
to
I
;
I
consider
myself
quite
in


the
light
of
an
ordinary
housekeeper
:
my
employer
be
always
civil
,
and


I
expect
nothing
more
.
"




"
and
the
little
girl
—
my
pupil
!
"




"
she
be
Mr.
Rochester
’s
ward
;
he
commission
I
to
find
a
governess


for
she
.
he
intend
to
have
she
bring
up
in
—
—
shire
,
I
believe
.
here


she
come
,
with
she
'
bonne
,
'
as
she
call
her
nurse
.
"
the
enigma
then


be
explain
:
this
affable
and
kind
little
widow
be
no
great
dame
;


but
a
dependent
like
myself
.
I
do
not
like
she
the
bad
for
that
;
on


the
contrary
,
I
feel
well
pleased
than
ever
.
the
equality
between
she


and
I
be
real
;
not
the
mere
result
of
condescension
on
her
part
:
so


much
the
well
—
my
position
be
all
the
free
.




as
I
be
meditate
on
this
discovery
,
a
little
girl
,
follow
by
she


attendant
,
came
run
up
the
lawn
.
I
look
at
my
pupil
,
who
do
not


at
first
appear
to
notice
I
:
she
be
quite
a
child
,
perhaps
seven
or


eight
year
old
,
slightly
build
,
with
a
pale
,
small
-
feature
face
,
and


a
redundancy
of
hair
fall
in
curl
to
her
waist
.




"
good
morning
,
Miss
Adela
,
"
say
Mrs.
Fairfax
.
"
come
and
speak
to
the


lady
who
be
to
teach
you
,
and
to
make
you
a
clever
woman
some
day
.
"
she


approach
.




"
c’est
là
ma
gouvernante
!
"
say
she
,
point
to
I
,
and
address
she


nurse
;
who
answer
—




"
mais
oui
,
certainement
.
"




"
be
they
foreigner
?
"
I
inquire
,
amazed
at
hear
the
french


language
.




"
the
nurse
be
a
foreigner
,
and
Adela
be
bear
on
the
continent
;
and
,
I


believe
,
never
leave
it
till
within
six
month
ago
.
when
she
first
come


here
she
could
speak
no
English
;
now
she
can
make
shift
to
talk
it
a


little
:
I
do
n’t
understand
she
,
she
mix
it
so
with
French
;
but
you


will
make
out
her
meaning
very
well
,
I
dare
say
.
"




fortunately
I
have
have
the
advantage
of
be
teach
French
by
a
french


lady
;
and
as
I
have
always
make
a
point
of
conversing
with
Madame


Pierrot
as
often
as
I
could
,
and
have
besides
,
during
the
last
seven


year
,
learn
a
portion
of
French
by
heart
daily
—
apply
myself
to


take
pain
with
my
accent
,
and
imitate
as
closely
as
possible
the


pronunciation
of
my
teacher
,
I
have
acquire
a
certain
degree
of


readiness
and
correctness
in
the
language
,
and
be
not
likely
to
be


much
at
a
loss
with
Mademoiselle
Adela
.
she
come
and
shake
hand
with


I
when
she
hear
that
I
be
her
governess
;
and
as
I
lead
she
in
to


breakfast
,
I
address
some
phrase
to
she
in
her
own
tongue
:
she


reply
briefly
at
first
,
but
after
we
be
seat
at
the
table
,
and


she
have
examine
I
some
ten
minute
with
her
large
hazel
eye
,
she


suddenly
commence
chatter
fluently
.




"
ah
!
"
cry
she
,
in
French
,
"
you
speak
my
language
as
well
as
Mr.


Rochester
do
:
I
can
talk
to
you
as
I
can
to
he
,
and
so
can
Sophie
.


she
will
be
glad
:
nobody
here
understand
she
:
Madame
Fairfax
be
all


english
.
Sophie
be
my
nurse
;
she
come
with
I
over
the
sea
in
a
great


ship
with
a
chimney
that
smoke

Mrs.
Fairfax
of
her
employer
and


mine
.
there
be
people
who
seem
to
have
no
notion
of
sketch
a


character
,
or
observe
and
describe
salient
point
,
either
in


person
or
thing
:
the
good
lady
evidently
belong
to
this
class
;
my


query
puzzle
,
but
do
not
draw
she
out
.
Mr.
Rochester
be
Mr.


rochester
in
her
eye
;
a
gentleman
,
a
land
proprietor
—
nothing
more
:


she
inquire
and
search
no
far
,
and
evidently
wonder
at
my
wish


to
gain
a
more
definite
notion
of
his
identity
.




when
we
leave
the
dining
-
room
,
she
propose
to
show
I
over
the
rest
of


the
house
;
and
I
follow
her
upstairs
and
downstairs
,
admire
as
I


go
;
for
all
be
well
arranged
and
handsome
.
the
large
front
chamber


I
think
especially
grand
:
and
some
of
the
third
-
storey
room
,
though


dark
and
low
,
be
interesting
from
their
air
of
antiquity
.
the


furniture
once
appropriate
to
the
low
apartment
have
from
time
to


time
be
remove
here
,
as
fashion
change
:
and
the
imperfect
light


enter
by
their
narrow
casement
show
bedstead
of
a
hundred
year


old
;
chest
in
oak
or
walnut
,
look
,
with
their
strange
carving
of


palm
branch
and
cherub
'
head
,
like
type
of
the
hebrew
ark
;
row
of


venerable
chair
,
high
-
back
and
narrow
;
stool
still
more
antiquated
,


on
whose
cushioned
top
be
yet
apparent
trace
of
half
-
efface


embroidery
,
work
by
finger
that
for
two
generation
have
be


coffin
-
dust
.
all
these
relic
give
to
the
third
storey
of
Thornfield


hall
the
aspect
of
a
home
of
the
past
:
a
shrine
of
memory
.
I
like
the


hush
,
the
gloom
,
the
quaintness
of
these
retreat
in
the
day
;
but
I
by


no
mean
covet
a
night
’s
repose
on
one
of
those
wide
and
heavy
bed
:


shut
in
,
some
of
they
,
with
door
of
oak
;
shade
,
other
,
with
wrought


old
english
hanging
crust
with
thick
work
,
portray
effigy
of


strange
flower
,
and
strange
bird
,
and
strange
human
beings,—all


which
would
have
look
strange
,
indeed
,
by
the
pallid
gleam
of


moonlight
.




"
do
the
servant
sleep
in
these
room
?
"
I
ask
.




"
no
;
they
occupy
a
range
of
small
apartment
to
the
back
;
no
one
ever


sleep
here
:
one
would
almost
say
that
,
if
there
be
a
ghost
at


Thornfield
Hall
,
this
would
be
its
haunt
.
"




"
so
I
think
:
you
have
no
ghost
,
then
?
"




"
none
that
I
ever
hear
of
,
"
return
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
smile
.




"
nor
any
tradition
of
one
?
no
legend
or
ghost
story
?
"




"
I
believe
not
.
and
yet
it
be
say
the
Rochesters
have
be
rather
a


violent
than
a
quiet
race
in
their
time
:
perhaps
,
though
,
that
be
the


reason
they
rest
tranquilly
in
their
grave
now
.
"




"
Yes—‘after
life
’s
fitful
fever
they
sleep
well

"
I
mutter
.
"
where


be
you
go
now
,
Mrs.

"
for
she
be
move

"
on
to
the
lead
;
will
you
come
and
see
the
view
from
thence
?
"
I


follow
still
,
up
a
very
narrow
staircase
to
the
attic
,
and
thence
by


a
ladder
and
through
a
trap
-
door
to
the
roof
of
the
hall
.
I
be
now
on


a
level
with
the
crow
colony
,
and
could
see
into
their
nest
.
lean


over
the
battlement
and
look
far
down
,
I
survey
the
ground
lay


out
like
a
map
:
the
bright
and
velvet
lawn
closely
girdle
the
grey


base
of
the
mansion
;
the
field
,
wide
as
a
park
,
dot
with
its
ancient


timber
;
the
wood
,
dun
and
sere
,
divide
by
a
path
visibly
overgrown
,


greener
with
moss
than
the
tree
be
with
foliage
;
the
church
at
the


gate
,
the
road
,
the
tranquil
hill
,
all
repose
in
the
autumn
day
’s


sun
;
the
horizon
bound
by
a
propitious
sky
,
azure
,
marble
with


pearly
white
.
no
feature
in
the
scene
be
extraordinary
,
but
all
be


pleasing
.
when
I
turn
from
it
and
repasse
the
trap
-
door
,
I
could


scarcely
see
my
way
down
the
ladder
;
the
attic
seem
black
as
a
vault


compare
with
that
arch
of
blue
air
to
which
I
have
be
look
up
,
and


to
that
sunlit
scene
of
grove
,
pasture
,
and
green
hill
,
of
which
the


hall
be
the
centre
,
and
over
which
I
have
be
gaze
with
delight
.




Mrs.
Fairfax
stay
behind
a
moment
to
fasten
the
trap
-
door
;
I
,
by
dint


of
groping
,
find
the
outlet
from
the
attic
,
and
proceed
to
descend


the
narrow
garret
staircase
.
I
linger
in
the
long
passage
to
which


this
lead
,
separate
the
front
and
back
room
of
the
third
storey
:


narrow
,
low
,
and
dim
,
with
only
one
little
window
at
the
far
end
,
and


look
,
with
its
two
row
of
small
black
door
all
shut
,
like
a


corridor
in
some
Bluebeard
’s
castle
.




while
I
pace
softly
on
,
the
last
sound
I
expect
to
hear
in
so
still


a
region
,
a
laugh
,
strike
my
ear
.
it
be
a
curious
laugh
;
distinct
,


formal
,
mirthless
.
I
stop
:
the
sound
cease
,
only
for
an
instant
;
it


begin
again
,
louder
:
for
at
first
,
though
distinct
,
it
be
very
low
.
it


pass
off
in
a
clamorous
peal
that
seem
to
wake
an
echo
in
every


lonely
chamber
;
though
it
originate
but
in
one
,
and
I
could
have


point
out
the
door
whence
the
accent
issue
.




"
Mrs.
Fairfax
!
"
I
call
out
:
for
I
now
hear
she
descend
the
great


stair
.
"
do
you
hear
that
loud
laugh
?
who
be
it
?
"




"
some
of
the
servant
,
very
likely
,

she
answer
:
"
perhaps
Grace


poole
.
"




"
do
you
hear
it
?
"
I
again
inquire
.




"
yes
,
plainly
:
I
often
hear
she

sometimes
Leah
be
with
she

they
be
frequently
noisy
together

"




the
laugh
be
repeat
in
its
low
,
syllabic
tone
,
and
terminate
in
an


odd
murmur
.




"
grace
!
"
exclaim
Mrs.
Fairfax
.




I
really
do
not
expect
any
grace
to
answer
;
for
the
laugh
be
as


tragic
,
as
preternatural
a
laugh
as
any
I
ever
hear
;
and
,
but
that
it


be
high
noon
,
and
that
no
circumstance
of
ghostliness
accompany
the


curious
cachinnation
;
but
that
neither
scene
nor
season
favour
fear

I
should
have
be
superstitiously
afraid

a

open

out,—a

thirty
and
forty

with
a


hard

romantic

less
ghostly

chapter

the
promise
of
a
smooth
career
,
which
my
first
calm
introduction
to


Thornfield
Hall
seem
to
pledge
,
be
not

on
a
long


acquaintance

Mrs.

out
to

what
she
appear

a
placid

temper

kind

natured
woman
,
of


competent
education

average
intelligence

pupil

a
lively


child

who
have
be
spoil
and
indulge
,
and
therefore
be
sometimes


wayward
;
but
as
she
be
commit
entirely
to
my
care
,
and
no


injudicious
interference
from
any
quarter
ever
thwart
my
plan
for


her
improvement
,
she
soon
forget
her
little
freak
,
and
become
obedient


and
teachable
.
she
have
no
great
talent
,
no
marked
trait
of
character
,


no
peculiar
development
of
feeling
or
taste
which
raise
her
one
inch


above
the
ordinary
level
of
childhood
;
but
neither
have
she
any


deficiency
or

below
it

she
make
reasonable


progress

entertain
for
I
a
vivacious

perhaps
not
very


profound
,
affection
;
and
by
her
simplicity
,
gay
prattle
,
and
effort
to


please
,
inspire
I
,
in
return

a
degree
of
attachment

this

be
think
cool
language
by
person
who


entertain
solemn
doctrine
about
the
angelic
nature
of
child
,
and


the
duty
of
those
charge
with
their
education
to
conceive
for
they
an


idolatrous
devotion
:

I
be
not
write
to
flatter
parental
egotism
,


to
echo
ca
nt
,
or
prop
up
humbug
;
I
be
merely
tell
the
truth
.
I
feel


a
conscientious
solicitude
for
Adèle
’s
welfare
and
progress
,
and
a


quiet
like
for
her
little
self
:
just
as
I
cherish
towards
Mrs.


fairfax
a
thankfulness
for
her
kindness
,
and
a
pleasure
in
her
society


proportionate
to
the
tranquil
regard
she
have
for
I
,
and
the
moderation


of
her
mind
and
character
.




anybody
may
blame
I
who
like
,
when
I
add
far
,
that
,
now
and
then
,


when
I
take
a
walk
by
myself
in
the
ground
;
when
I
go
down
to
the


gate
and
look
through
they
along
the
road
;
or
when
,
while
Adèle


play
with
her
nurse
,
and
Mrs.
Fairfax
make
jelly
in
the
storeroom
,


I
climb
the
three
staircase
,
raise
the
trap

door
of
the
attic
,
and


having
reach
the
lead
,
look
out
afar
over
sequester
field
and


hill
,
and
along
dim
sky
-
line
—
that
then
I
long
for
a
power
of
vision


which
might
overpass
that
limit
;
which
might
reach
the
busy
world
,


town
,
region
full
of
life
I
have
hear
of
but
never
see
—
that
then
I


desire
more
of
practical
experience
than
I
possess
;
more
of


intercourse
with
my
kind
,
of
acquaintance
with
variety
of
character
,


than
be
here
within
my
reach
.
I
value
what
be
good
in
Mrs.
Fairfax
,


and
what
be
good
in
Adèle
;
but
I
believe
in
the
existence
of
other


and
more
vivid
kind
of
goodness
,
and
what
I
believe
in
I
wish
to


behold
.




who
blame
I
?
many
,
no
doubt
;
and
I
shall
be
call
discontent
.
I


could
not
help
it
:
the
restlessness
be
in
my
nature
;
it
agitate
I
to


pain
sometimes
.
then
my
sole
relief
be
to
walk
along
the
corridor
of


the
third
storey
,
backwards
and
forwards
,
safe
in
the
silence
and


solitude
of
the
spot
,
and
allow
my
mind
’s
eye
to
dwell
on
whatever


bright
vision
rise
before
it
—
and
,
certainly
,
they
be
many
and


glow
;
to
let
my
heart
be
heave
by
the
exultant
movement
,
which
,


while
it
swell
it
in
trouble
,
expand
it
with
life
;
and
,
good
of


all
,
to
open
my
inward
ear
to
a
tale
that
be
never
end
—
a
tale
my


imagination
create
,
and
narrate
continuously
;
quicken
with
all
of


incident
,
life
,
fire
,
feeling
,
that
I
desire
and
have
not
in
my
actual


existence
.




it
be
in
vain
to
say
human
being
ought
to
be
satisfied
with


tranquillity
:
they
must
have
action
;
and
they
will
make
it
if
they


can
not
find
it
.
million
be
condemn
to
a
still
doom
than
mine
,
and


million
be
in
silent
revolt
against
their
lot
.
nobody
know
how
many


rebellion
besides
political
rebellion
ferment
in
the
masse
of
life


which
people
earth
.
woman
be
suppose
to
be
very
calm
generally
:
but


woman
feel
just
as
man
feel
;
they
need
exercise
for
their
faculty
,


and
a
field
for
their
effort
,
as
much
as
their
brother
do
;
they


suffer
from
too
rigid
a
restraint
,
too
absolute
a
stagnation
,
precisely


as
man
would
suffer
;
and
it
be
narrow
-
minded
in
their
more
privileged


fellow
-
creature
to
say
that
they
ought
to
confine
themselves
to
make


pudding
and
knitting
stocking
,
to
play
on
the
piano
and


embroider
bag
.
it
be
thoughtless
to
condemn
they
,
or
laugh
at
they
,


if
they
seek
to
do
more
or
learn
more
than
custom
have
pronounce


necessary
for
their
sex
.




when
thus
alone
,
I
not
unfrequently
hear
Grace
Poole
’s
laugh
:
the
same


peal
,
the
same
low
,
slow
ha
!
ha
!
which
,
when
first
hear
,
have
thrill


I
:
I
hear
,
too
,
her
eccentric
murmur
;
strange
than
her
laugh
.
there


be
day
when
she
be
quite
silent
;
but
there
be
other
when
I
could


not
account
for
the
sound
she
make
.
sometimes
I
see
she
:
she
would


come
out
of
her
room
with
a
basin
,
or
a
plate
,
or
a
tray
in
her
hand
,


go
down
to
the
kitchen
and
shortly
return
,
generally
(
oh
,
romantic


reader
,
forgive
I
for
tell
the
plain
truth
!
)
bear
a
pot
of


porter
.
her
appearance
always
act
as
a
damper
to
the
curiosity
raise


by
her
oral
oddity
:
hard
-
feature
and
staid
,
she
have
no
point
to


which
interest
could
attach
.
I
make
some
attempt
to
draw
she
into


conversation
,
but
she
seem
a
person
of
few
word
:
a
monosyllabic


reply
usually
cut
short
every
effort
of
that
sort
.




the
other
member
of
the
household
,
viz
.
,
John
and
his
wife
,
Leah
the


housemaid
,
and
Sophie
the
french
nurse
,
be
decent
people
;
but
in
no


respect
remarkable
;
with
Sophie
I
use
to
talk
French
,
and
sometimes
I


ask
her
question
about
her
native
country
;
but
she
be
not
of
a


descriptive
or
narrative
turn
,
and
generally
give
such
vapid
and


confused
answer
as
be
calculate
rather
to
check
than
encourage


inquiry
.




October
,
November
,
December
pass
away
.
one
afternoon
in
January
,
Mrs.


fairfax
have
beg
a
holiday
for
Adèle
,
because
she
have
a
cold
;
and
,
as


Adèle
second
the
request
with
an
ardour
that
remind
I
how
precious


occasional
holiday
have
be
to
I
in
my
own
childhood
,
I
accord
it
,


deem
that
I
do
well
in
show
pliability
on
the
point
.
it
be
a


fine
,
calm
day
,
though
very
cold
;
I
be
tired
of
sit
still
in
the


library
through
a
whole
long
morning
:
Mrs.
Fairfax
have
just
write
a


letter
which
be
wait
to
be
post
,
so
I
put
on
my
bonnet
and
cloak


and
volunteer
to
carry
it
to
Hay
;
the
distance
,
two
mile
,
would
be
a


pleasant
winter
afternoon
walk
.
having
see
Adèle
comfortably
seat
in


her
little
chair
by
Mrs.
Fairfax
’s
parlour
fireside
,
and
give
she
she


good
wax
doll
(
which
I
usually
keep
envelop
in
silver
paper
in
a


drawer
)
to
play
with
,
and
a
story
-
book
for
change
of
amusement
;
and


having
reply
to
her
"
revenez
bientôt
,
ma
bonne
amie
,
ma
chère
Mdlle
.


jeannette
,
"
with
a
kiss
I
set
out
.




the
ground
be
hard
,
the
air
be
still
,
my
road
be
lonely
;
I
walk


fast
till
I
get
warm
,
and
then
I
walk
slowly
to
enjoy
and
analyse
the


specie
of
pleasure
brood
for
I
in
the
hour
and
situation
.
it
be


three
o’clock
;
the
church
bell
toll
as
I
pass
under
the
belfry
:
the


charm
of
the
hour
lie
in
its
approach
dimness
,
in
the
low
-
glide


and
pale
-
beam
sun
.
I
be
a
mile
from
Thornfield
,
in
a
lane
note
for


wild
rose
in
summer
,
for
nut
and
blackberry
in
autumn
,
and
even
now


possess
a
few
coral
treasure
in
hip
and
haw
,
but
whose
good


winter
delight
lie
in
its
utter
solitude
and
leafless
repose
.
if
a


breath
of
air
stir
,
it
make
no
sound
here
;
for
there
be
not
a


holly
,
not
an
evergreen
to
rustle
,
and
the
strip
hawthorn
and
hazel


bush
be
as
still
as
the
white
,
wear
stone
which
causeway
the


middle
of
the
path
.
far
and
wide
,
on
each
side
,
there
be
only
field
,


where
no
cattle
now
browse
;
and
the
little
brown
bird
,
which
stir


occasionally
in
the
hedge
,
look
like
single
russet
leave
that
have


forget
to
drop
.




this
lane
incline
up
-
hill
all
the
way
to
Hay
;
having
reach
the


middle
,
I
sit
down
on
a
stile
which
lead
thence
into
a
field
.
gather


my
mantle
about
I
,
and
shelter
my
hand
in
my
muff
,
I
do
not
feel


the
cold
,
though
it
freeze
keenly
;
as
be
attest
by
a
sheet
of
ice


cover
the
causeway
,
where
a
little
brooklet
,
now
congeal
,
have


overflow
after
a
rapid
thaw
some
day
since
.
from
my
seat
I
could


look
down
on
Thornfield
:
the
grey
and
battlemented
hall
be
the


principal
object
in
the
vale
below
I
;
its
wood
and
dark
rookery
rise


against
the
west
.
I
linger
till
the
sun
go
down
amongst
the
tree
,


and
sink
crimson
and
clear
behind
they
.
I
then
turn
eastward
.




on
the
hill
-
top
above
I
sit
the
rise
moon
;
pale
yet
as
a
cloud
,
but


brighten
momentarily
,
she
look
over
Hay
,
which
,
half
lose
in


tree
,
send
up
a
blue
smoke
from
its
few
chimney
:
it
be
yet
a
mile


distant
,
but
in
the
absolute
hush
I
could
hear
plainly
its
thin
murmur


of
life
.
my
ear
,
too
,
feel
the
flow
of
current
;
in
what
dale
and


depth
I
could
not
tell
:
but
there
be
many
hill
beyond
Hay
,
and


doubtless
many
beck
thread
their
pass
.
that
evening
calm
betray


alike
the
tinkle
of
the
near
stream
,
the
sough
of
the
most
remote
.




a
rude
noise
break
on
these
fine
rippling
and
whispering
,
at
once
so


far
away
and
so
clear
:
a
positive
tramp
,
tramp
,
a
metallic
clatter
,


which
efface
the
soft
wave
-
wandering
;
as
,
in
a
picture
,
the
solid


mass
of
a
crag
,
or
the
rough
bole
of
a
great
oak
,
draw
in
dark
and


strong
on
the
foreground
,
efface
the
aërial
distance
of
azure
hill
,


sunny
horizon
,
and
blend
cloud
where
tint
melt
into
tint
.




the
din
be
on
the
causeway
:
a
horse
be
come
;
the
winding
of
the


lane
yet
hide
it
,
but
it
approach
.
I
be
just
leave
the
stile
;
yet
,


as
the
path
be
narrow
,
I
sit
still
to
let
it
go
by
.
in
those
day
I


be
young
,
and
all
sort
of
fancy
bright
and
dark
tenant
my
mind
:


the
memory
of
nursery
story
be
there
amongst
other
rubbish
;
and


when
they
recur
,
mature
youth
add
to
they
a
vigour
and
vividness


beyond
what
childhood
could
give
.
as
this
horse
approach
,
and
as
I


watch
for
it
to
appear
through
the
dusk
,
I
remember
certain
of


Bessie
’s
tale
,
wherein
figure
a
North
-
of
-
england
spirit
call
a


"
Gytrash
,
"
which
,
in
the
form
of
horse
,
mule
,
or
large
dog
,
haunt


solitary
way
,
and
sometimes
come
upon
belate
traveller
,
as
this


horse
be
now
come
upon
I
.




it
be
very
near
,
but
not
yet
in
sight
;
when
,
in
addition
to
the
tramp
,


tramp
,
I
hear
a
rush
under
the
hedge
,
and
close
down
by
the
hazel


stem
glide
a
great
dog
,
whose
black
and
white
colour
make
he
a


distinct
object
against
the
tree
.
it
be
exactly
one
form
of
Bessie
’s


Gytrash
—
a
lion
-
like
creature
with
long
hair
and
a
huge
head
:
it
pass


I
,
however
,
quietly
enough
;
not
stay
to
look
up
,
with
strange


pretercanine
eye
,
in
my
face
,
as
I
half
expect
it
would
.
the
horse


followed,—a
tall
steed
,
and
on
its
back
a
rider
.
the
man
,
the
human


be
,
break
the
spell
at
once
.
nothing
ever
ride
the
Gytrash
:
it
be


always
alone
;
and
goblin
,
to
my
notion
,
though
they
might
tenant
the


dumb
carcass
of
beast
,
could
scarce
covet
shelter
in
the
commonplace


human
form
.
no
Gytrash
be
this,—only
a
traveller
take
the
short
cut


to
Millcote
.
he
pass
,
and
I
go
on
;
a
few
step
,
and
I
turn
:
a


slide
sound
and
an
exclamation
of
"
what
the
deuce
be
to
do
now
?
"
and


a
clattering
tumble
,
arrest
my
attention
.
man
and
horse
be
down
;


they
have
slip
on
the
sheet
of
ice
which
glaze
the
causeway
.
the
dog


came
bound
back
,
and
see
his
master
in
a
predicament
,
and
hear


the
horse
groan
,
bark
till
the
evening
hill
echo

round

all

no


other

at

I
obey
he

walk
down
to
the


traveller

this
time

himself
free
of
his
steed

effort

so
vigorous

I
think
he
could
not
be
much
hurt
;
but
I


ask
he
the
question
—




"

"




I
think
he
be

,

be
not
certain
;
however
,
he
be


pronounce
some
formula

prevent
he
from

directly

"

I

I
ask
again
.




"

he
answer
as
he
rise
,
first
to
his


knee
,
and
then
to
his
foot

I
do
;
whereupon
begin
a
heaving
,


stamp
,
clattering
process
,
accompany
by
a
barking
and
baying

remove

effectually

distance
;

I
would
not

quite
away

I
see

this
be
finally
fortunate
;
the

be

established

he
halt
to
the

again

up

extort
an


involuntary

Ugh
!

something

daylight
still
linger
,
and
the
moon

wax
bright

I


could
see
he
plainly

his
figure
be
envelop
in
a
ride
cloak
,
fur


collared
and
steel
clasped
;
its
detail
be
not
apparent
,
but
I
trace


the
general
point
of
middle
height
and
considerable
breadth
of
chest
.


he
have
a
dark
face
,
with
stern
feature
and
a
heavy
brow
;
his
eye
and


gather
eyebrow
look
ireful
and
thwart
just
now
;
he
be
past


youth
,

have
not
reach
middle

age
;
perhaps
he
might
be
thirty
-
five

I
feel
no
fear
of
he
,

little
shyness

he
be
a

young
gentleman

I
should
not

to

thus


question
he
against
his

offer
my
service
unasked

I


have
hardly
ever
see
a
handsome
youth
;
never
in
my
life
speak
to
one

I
have
a
theoretical
reverence
and
homage
for
beauty
,
elegance
,


gallantry
,
fascination
;
but
have
I
meet
those
quality
incarnate
in


masculine
shape
,
I
should
have
know
instinctively
that
they
neither


have
nor
could
have
sympathy
with
anything
in
I
,
and
should
have


shun
they
as
one
would
fire
,
lightning
,

anything
else
that
be


bright

antipathetic

humoured

I

I

he

he
have
put
off
my
offer
of
assistance
gaily

with


thank

I
should
have
go
on
my
way
and
not
feel
any
vocation
to
renew


inquiry
:
but
the
frown
,
the
roughness
of
the

I

my

one

a
monotonous
life

need

something

trivial

the
deed

be


yet
an
active
thing

weary

an
existence
all
passive

new
face

,
be
like
a
new
picture

to
the
gallery
of


memory

it

dissimilar
to
all
the
other
hang
there

masculine

dark

strong

it
still
before

the

the

office

it

I
walk
fast
down

hill
all


the
way
home

when
I
come
to
the
stile

I
stop
a
minute
,
look


round
and
listen
,
with
an
idea
that
a
horse
’s
hoofs
might
ring
on
the


causeway
again
,
and
that
a
rider
in
a
cloak
,
and
a
Gytrash
-
like


Newfoundland
dog
,
might
be
again
apparent

see
only
the
hedge
and
a


pollard
willow
before
I
,
rise
up
still
and
straight
to
meet
the


moonbeam
;
I
hear
only
the
faint
waft
of
wind
roam
fitful
among


the
tree
round
Thornfield
,
a
mile
distant
;
and
when
I
glance
down
in


the
direction
of
the
murmur
,
my
eye
,
traverse
the
hall
-
front
,
catch


a
light
kindling
in
a
window
:
it
remind
I
that
I
be
late
,
and
I


hurry
on
.




I
do
not
like
re

enter
Thornfield
.
to
pass
its
threshold
be
to


return
to
stagnation
;
to
cross
the
silent
hall
,
to
ascend
the
darksome


staircase
,
to
seek
my
own
lonely
little
room
,
and
then
to
meet
tranquil


Mrs.
Fairfax
,
and
spend
the
long
winter
evening
with
she
,
and
her
only
,


be
to
quell
wholly
the
faint
excitement
waken
by
my
walk,—to
slip


again
over
my
faculty
the
viewless
fetter
of
an
uniform
and
too


still
existence
;
of
an
existence
whose
very
privilege
of
security
and


ease
I
be
become
incapable
of
appreciate
.
what
good
it
would
have


do
I
at
that
time
to
have
be
toss
in
the
storm
of
an
uncertain


struggle
life
,

to
have
be
teach
by
rough
and
bitter
experience


to
long
for
the
calm
amidst
which
I
now
repine
!
yes
,
just
as
much
good


as
it
would
do
a
man
tired
of
sit
still
in
a
"
too
easy
chair
"
to


take
a
long
walk
:
and
just
as
natural
be
the
wish
to
stir
,
under
my


circumstance
,
as
it
would
be
under
his
.




I
linger
at
the
gate
;
I
linger
on
the
lawn
;
I
pace
backwards
and


forwards
on
the
pavement
;
the
shutter
of
the
glass
door
be
close
;
I


could
not
see
into
the
interior
;
and
both
my
eye
and
spirit
seem


draw
from
the
gloomy
house
—
from
the
grey
hollow
fill
with
rayless


cell
,
as
it
appear
to
I
—
to
that
sky
expand
before
me,—a
blue
sea


absolve
from
taint
of
cloud
;
the
moon
ascend
it
in
solemn
march
;


her
orb
seem
to
look
up
as
she
leave
the
hill
-
top
,
from
behind
which


she
have
come
,
far
and
far
below
she
,
and
aspire
to
the
zenith
,


midnight
dark
in
its
fathomless
depth
and
measureless
distance
;
and
for


those
tremble
star
that
follow
her
course
;
they
make
my
heart


tremble
,
my
vein
glow
when
I
view
they
.
little
thing
recall
we
to


earth
;
the
clock
strike
in
the
hall
;
that
suffice
;
I
turn
from
moon


and
star
,
open
a
side
-
door
,
and
go
in
.




the
hall
be
not
dark
,
nor
yet
be
it
light
,
only
by
the
high
-
hung
bronze


lamp
;
a
warm
glow
suffuse
both
it
and
the
low
step
of
the
oak


staircase
.
this
ruddy
shine
issue
from
the
great
dining
-
room
,
whose


two

leave

stand
open
,
and
show
a
genial
fire
in
the
grate
,


glance
on
marble
hearth
and
brass
fire

iron
,
and
reveal
purple


drapery
and
polished
furniture
,
in
the
most
pleasant
radiance
.
it


reveal
,
too
,
a
group
near
the
mantelpiece
:
I
have
scarcely
catch
it
,


and
scarcely
become
aware
of
a
cheerful
mingling
of
voice
,
amongst


which
I
seem
to
distinguish
the
tone
of
Adèle
,
when
the
door
close
.




I
hasten
to
Mrs.
Fairfax

be
a
fire
there
too
,

no


candle

no
Mrs.
Fairfax

instead
,
all
alone
,
sit
upright
on
the


rug
,
and
gaze
with
gravity
at
the
blaze
,
I
beheld
a
great
black
and


white
long
-
haired
dog
,
just
like
the
Gytrash
of
the
lane

it
be
so


like

I
go

his
great


tail

he
look
an
eerie
creature
to
be
alone
with
,
and
I
could
not


tell
whence
he
have
come
.
I
ring
the
bell
,
for
I
want
a
candle
;
and
I


want
,

chapter
xiii






Mr.
Rochester
,
it
seem
,
by
the
surgeon
’s
order
,
go
to
bed
early


that
night
;
nor
do
he
rise
soon
next
morning
.
when
he
do
come
down
,


it
be
to
attend
to
business
:
his
agent
and
some
of
his
tenant
be


arrive
,
and
wait
to
speak
with
he
.




Adèle
and
I
have
now
to
vacate
the
library
:
it
would
be
in
daily


requisition
as
a
reception
-
room
for
caller
.
a
fire
be
light
in
an


apartment
upstairs
,
and
there
I
carry
our
book
,
and
arrange
it
for


the
future
schoolroom
.
I
discern
in
the
course
of
the
morning
that


Thornfield
Hall
be
a
changed
place
:
no
long
silent
as
a
church
,
it


echo
every
hour
or
two
to
a
knock
at
the
door
,
or
a
clang
of
the


bell
;
step
,
too
,
often
traverse
the
hall
,
and
new
voice
speak
in


different
key
below
;
a
rill
from
the
outer
world
be
flow
through


it
;
it
have
a
master
:
for
my
part
,
I
like
it
well
.




Adèle
be
not
easy
to
teach
that
day
;
she
could
not
apply
:
she
keep


run
to
the
door
and
look
over
the
banister
to
see
if
she
could


get
a
glimpse
of
Mr.
Rochester
;
then
she
coin
pretext
to
go


downstairs
,
in
order
,
as
I
shrewdly
suspect
,
to
visit
the
library
,


where
I
know
she
be
not
want
;
then
,
when
I
get
a
little
angry
,
and


make
she
sit
still
,
she
continue
to
talk
incessantly
of
her
"
ami
,


Monsieur
Edouard
Fairfax
_
de
_
Rochester
,
"
as
she
dub
he
(
I
have
not


before
hear
his
prenomen
)
,
and
to
conjecture
what
present
he
have


bring
she
:
for
it
appear
he
have
intimate
the
night
before
,
that


when
his
luggage
come
from
Millcote
,
there
would
be
find
amongst
it
a


little
box
in
whose
content
she
have
an
interest
.




"
et
cela
doit
signifier

say
she
,
"

"




I
and
my
pupil
dine
as
usual
in
Mrs.
Fairfax
’s
parlour
;
the
afternoon


be
wild
and
snowy
,
and
we
pass
it
in
the
schoolroom
.
at
dark
I


allow
Adèle
to
put
away
book
and
work
,
and
to
run
downstairs
;
for
,


from
the
comparative
silence
below
,
and
from
the
cessation
of
appeal


to
the
door
-
bell
,
I
conjecture
that
Mr.
Rochester
be
now
at
liberty
.


leave
alone
,
I
walk
to
the
window
;
but
nothing
be
to
be
see
thence
:


twilight
and
snowflake
together
thicken
the
air
,
and
hide
the
very


shrub
on
the
lawn
.
I
let
down
the
curtain
and
go
back
to
the


fireside
.




in
the
clear
ember
I
be
trace
a
view
,
not
unlike
a
picture
I


remember
to
have
see
of
the
castle
of
Heidelberg
,
on
the
Rhine
,
when


Mrs.
Fairfax
come
in
,
break
up
by
her
entrance
the
fiery
mosaic
I


have
be
pierce
together
,
and
scatter
too
some
heavy
unwelcome


thought
that
be
begin
to

my
solitude

this
additional
ceremony

stately

I
repair


to
my
room

,
with
Mrs.
Fairfax
’s
aid
,
replace
my
black
stuff
dress


by
one
of
black
silk
;
the
good
and
the
only
additional
one
I
have
,


except
one
of
light
grey
,
which
,
in
my
Lowood
notion
of
the
toilette
,


I
think
too
fine
to
be
wear
,

on
first

rate
occasion

"

Mrs.

a
single
little
pearl


ornament
which
Miss
Temple
give
I
as
a
part
keepsake

I
put
it
on
,


and
then
we
go
downstairs
.
unuse
as
I
be
to
stranger
,
it
be


rather
a
trial
to
appear
thus
formally
summon
in
Mr.
Rochester
’s


presence
.
I
let
Mrs.
Fairfax
precede
I
into
the
dining

room
,
and
keep


in
her
shade
as
we
cross
that
apartment
;
and
,
pass
the
arch
,
whose


curtain
be
now
drop
,
enter
the
elegant
recess
beyond

two
wax

of
a
superb
fire

Pilot
—
Adèle
knelt


near
he
.
half
recline
on
a
couch
appear
Mr.
Rochester
,
his
foot


support
by
the
cushion
;
he
be
look
at
Adèle
and
the
dog
:
the
fire


shine
full
on
his
face
.
I
know
my
traveller
with
his
broad
and
jetty


eyebrow
;
his
square
forehead
,
make
square
by
the
horizontal
sweep
of


his
black
hair
.
I
recognise
his
decisive
nose
,
more
remarkable
for


character
than
beauty
;
his
full
nostril
,
denote
,
I
think
,
choler
;


his
grim
mouth
,
chin
,
and
jaw
—
yes
,
all
three
be
very
grim
,
and
no


mistake
.
his
shape
,
now
divest
of
cloak
,
I
perceive
harmonise
in


squareness
with
his
physiognomy
:
I
suppose
it
be
a
good
figure
in
the


athletic
sense
of
the
term
—
broad
cheste
and
thin
flank
,
though


neither
tall
nor
graceful
.




Mr.
Rochester
must
have
be
aware
of
the
entrance
of
Mrs.
Fairfax
and


myself
;
but
it
appear
he
be
not
in
the
mood
to
notice
we
,
for
he


never
lift
his
head
as
we
approach
.




"
here
be
Miss
Eyre
,
sir
,

say
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
in
her
quiet
way
.
he


bow
,
still
not
take
his
eye
from
the
group
of
the
dog
and
child
.




"
let
Miss
Eyre
be
seat
,
"
say
he
:
and
there
be
something
in
the


force
stiff
bow
,
in
the
impatient
yet
formal
tone
,
which
seem


far
to
express
,
"
what
the
deuce
be
it
to
I
whether
Miss
Eyre
be


there
or
not

mystery
to
herself
,
and
that
what
she
know
be


chiefly
from
conjecture
.
it
be
evident
,
indeed
,
that
she

the

chapter
XIV






for
several
subsequent
day
I
see
little
of
Mr.
Rochester
.
in
the


morning
he
seem
much
engage
with
business
,
and
,
in
the
afternoon
,


gentleman
from
Millcote
or
the
neighbourhood
call
,
and
sometimes


stay
to
dine
with
he
.
when
his
sprain
be
well
enough
to
admit
of


horse
exercise
,
he
ride
out
a
good
deal
;
probably
to
return
these


visit
,
as
he
generally
do
not
come
back
till
late
at
night
.




during
this
interval
,
even
Adèle
be
seldom
send
for
to
his
presence
,


and
all
my
acquaintance
with
he
be
confine
to
an
occasional


rencontre
in
the
hall
,
on
the
stair
,
or
in
the
gallery
,
when
he
would


sometimes
pass
I
haughtily
and
coldly
,
just
acknowledge
my
presence


by
a
distant
nod
or
a
cool
glance
,
and
sometimes
bow
and
smile
with


gentlemanlike
affability
.
his
change
of
mood
do
not
offend
I
,


because
I
see
that
I
have
nothing
to
do
with
their
alternation
;
the
ebb


and
flow
depend
on
cause
quite
disconnected
with
I
.




one
day
he
have
have
company
to
dinner
,
and
have
send
for
my
portfolio
;
in


order
,
doubtless
,
to
exhibit
its
content
:
the
gentleman
go
away


early
,
to
attend
a
public
meeting
at
Millcote
,
as
Mrs.
Fairfax
inform


I
;
but
the
night
be
wet
and
inclement
,
Mr.
Rochester
do
not


accompany
they
.
soon
after
they
be
go
he
ring
the
bell
:
a
message


come
that
I
and
Adèle
be
to
go
downstairs
.
I
brush
Adèle
’s
hair
and


make
she
neat
,

ascertain
that
I

myself

my
usual


quaker
trim

where
there
be
nothing
to
retouch

all
be
too
close
and


plain
,
braid
lock
include
,
to
admit
of
disarrangement

we
descend

whether

little
carton

instinct

"

the


deep
and
rather
sarcastic
voice
of
Mr.
Rochester

from
the


depth
of
an
immense
easy

chair

the
fireside

so
stern

much
less


gloomy

be
a
smile
on
his
lip
,

his
eye
sparkle
,
whether


with
wine
or
not

I
be
not
sure
;
but
I
think
it
very
probable

be
,


in
short
,
in
his
after

dinner
mood

more
expanded

genial

also


more
self

indulgent
than
the
frigid
and
rigid
temper
of
the
morning

preciously
grim

his
massive
head

light
of
the
fire

his
granite

hewn

his
great

dark
eye

he

great

dark
eye

very
fine
eye

not
without
a
certain
change


in
their
depth
sometimes
,

it

not
softness

you

feeling

hiss

the
green
snake


of
jealousy

on
undulate
coil
from
the
moonlit
balcony

within
my
waistcoat

its
way

my

strange
!

he
exclaim
,
suddenly
start
again
from
the


point
.
"
strange
that
I
should
choose
you
for
the
confidant
of
all
this
,


young
lady
;
pass
strange
that
you
should
listen
to
I
quietly
,
as
if


it
be
the
most
usual
thing
in
the
world
for
a
man
like
I
to
tell


story
of
his
opera
-
mistress
to
a
quaint
,
inexperienced
girl
like


you
!
but
the
last
singularity
explain
the
first
,
as
I
intimate
once


before
:
you
,
with
your
gravity
,
considerateness
,
and
caution
be
make


to
be
the
recipient
of
secret
.
besides
,
I
know
what
sort
of
a
mind
I


have
place
in
communication
with
my
own
:
I
know
it
be
one
not
liable


to
take
infection
:
it
be
a
peculiar
mind
:
it
be
a
unique
one
.
happily
I


do
not
mean
to
harm
it
:
but
,
if
I
do
,
it
would
not
take
harm
from
I
.


the
more
you
and
I
converse
,
the
well

while
I
can
not
blight
you

put

the
curtain
over
it

a

vicious
youth

neither

energy

soundly
,

they
insult
I
as
coarsely


as

make

Bois
de
Boulogne

next

I
have
the
pleasure
of
encounter
he
;
leave
a
bullet
in


one
of
his
poor
etiolate
arm
,
feeble
as
the
wing
of
a
chicken
in
the


pip
,

then
think
I
have
do
with
the
whole
crew
.
but
unluckily
the


Varens
,
six
month
before

have
give
I
this
filette
Adèle

who
,
she


affirm
,
be
my
daughter

and
perhaps
she
may
be
,

I
see
no


proof
of
such
grim
paternity
write
in
her
countenance

abandon
her
child
,
and
run
away
to
Italy
with
a
musician

I


acknowledge
no
natural
claim
on
Adèle
’s
part
to
be
support
by
I
,


nor
do
I
now
acknowledge
any
,

I
be
not
her
father

hear
that


she
be
quite
destitute

e’en
take
the
poor
thing
out
of
the
slime


and
mud
of
Paris

transplant
it
here

grow
up
clean
in

wholesome
soil

english

you
to

illegitimate
offspring
of
a


french
opera

you
will
perhaps
think
differently
of
your
post
and


protégée

you
will
be
come
to
I
some
day
with
notice
that
you
have


find
another
place

that
you
beg
I
to
look
out
for
a
new
governess

c.—Eh

"
no

Adèle
be
not
answerable
for
either
her
mother
’s
fault
or
your

I


have
a
regard
for
she
;
and
now
that
I
know
she
be
,
in
a
sense
,


parentless
—
forsake
by
her
mother
and
disown
by
you
,
sir
—
I
shall


cle
close
to
she
than
before
.
how
could
I
possibly
prefer
the
spoilt


pet
of
a
wealthy
family
,
who
would
hate
her
governess
as
a
nuisance

a
lonely
little
orphan

lean
towards

"
oh
,
that
be
the
light
in
which
you
view
it

well
,
I
must
go
in
now
;


and
you
too
:
it
darken
.
"




but
I
stay
out
a
few
minute
long
with
Adèle
and
Pilot
—
run
a
race


with
she
,
and
play
a
game
of
battledore
and
shuttlecock
.
when
we
go


in
,
and
I
have
remove
her
bonnet
and
coat
,
I
take
she
on
my
knee
;
keep


her
there
an
hour
,
allow
she
to
prattle
as
she
like
:
not
rebuke


even
some
little
freedom
and
triviality
into
which
she
be
apt
to


stray
when
much
notice
,
and
which
betray
in
she
a
superficiality
of


character
,
inherit
probably
from
her
mother
,
hardly
congenial
to
an


english
mind
.
still
she
have
her
merit
;
and
I
be
disposed
to


appreciate
all
that
be
good
in
she
to
the
utmost
.
I
seek
in
she


countenance
and
feature
a
likeness
to
Mr.
Rochester
,
but
find
none
:


no
trait
,
no
turn
of
expression
announce
relationship
.
it
be
a
pity
:


if
she
could
but
have
be
prove
to
resemble
he
,
he
would
have


think
more
of
she
.




it
be
not
till
after
I
have
withdraw
to
my
own
chamber
for
the
night
,


that
I
steadily
review
the
tale
Mr.
Rochester
have
tell
I
.
as
he
have


say
,
there
be
probably
nothing
at
all
extraordinary
in
the
substance


of
the
narrative
itself
:
a
wealthy
Englishman
’s
passion
for
a
french


dancer
,
and
her
treachery
to
he
,
be
every
-
day
matter
enough
,
no


doubt
,
in
society
;
but
there
be
something
decidedly
strange
in
the


paroxysm
of
emotion
which
have
suddenly
seize
he
when
he
be
in
the


act
of
express
the
present
contentment
of
his
mood
,
and
his
newly


revive
pleasure
in
the
old
hall
and
its
environ
.
I
meditate


wonderingly
on
this
incident
;
but
gradually
quit
it
,
as
I
find
it


for
the
present
inexplicable
,
I
turn
to
the
consideration
of
my


master
’s
manner
to
myself
.
the
confidence
he
have
think
fit
to
repose


in
I
seem
a
tribute
to
my
discretion
:
I
regard
and
accept
it
as


such
.
his
deportment
have
now
for
some
week
be
more
uniform
towards


I
than
at
the
first
.
I
never
seem
in
his
way
;
he
do
not
take
fit


of
chilling
hauteur
:
when
he
meet
I
unexpectedly
,
the
encounter
seem


welcome
;
he
have
always
a
word
and
sometimes
a
smile
for
I
:
when


summon
by
formal
invitation
to
his
presence
,
I
be
honour
by
a


cordiality
of
reception
that
make
I
feel
I
really
possess
the
power


to
amuse
he
,
and
that
these
evening
conference
be
seek
as
much


for
his
pleasure
as
for
my
benefit
.




I
,
indeed
,
talk
comparatively
little
,
but
I
hear
he
talk
with


relish
.
it
be
his
nature
to
be
communicative
;
he
like
to
open
to
a


mind
unacquainted
with
the
world
glimpse
of
its
scene
and
way
(
I
do


not
mean
its
corrupt
scene
and
wicked
way
,
but
such
as
derive
their


interest
from
the
great
scale
on
which
they
be
act
,
the
strange


novelty
by
which
they
be
characterise
)
;
and
I
have
a
keen
delight
in


receive
the
new
idea
he
offer
,
in
imagine
the
new
picture
he


portray
,
and
follow
he
in
thought
through
the
new
region
he


disclose
,
never
startled
or
trouble
by
one
noxious
allusion
.




the
ease
of
his
manner
free
I
from
painful
restraint
:
the
friendly


frankness
,
as
correct
as
cordial
,
with
which
he
treat
I
,
draw
I
to


he
.
I
feel
at
time
as
if
he
be
my
relation
rather
than
my
master
:


yet
he
be
imperious
sometimes
still
;
but
I
do
not
mind
that
;
I
see
it


be
his
way
.
so
happy
,
so
gratified
do
I
become
with
this
new
interest


add
to
life
,
that
I
cease
to
pine
after
kindre
:
my
thin


crescent
-
destiny
seem
to
enlarge
;
the
blank
of
existence
be
fill


up
;
my
bodily
health
improve
;
I
gather
flesh
and
strength
.




and
be
Mr.
Rochester
now
ugly
in
my
eye
?
no
,
reader
:
gratitude
,
and


many
association
,
all
pleasurable
and
genial
,
make
his
face
the
object


I
well
like
to
see
;
his
presence
in
a
room
be
more
cheering
than
the


bright
fire
.
yet
I
have
not
forget
his
fault
;
indeed
,
I
could


not
,
for
he
bring
they
frequently
before
I
.
he
be
proud
,
sardonic
,


harsh
to
inferiority
of
every
description
:
in
my
secret
soul
I
know


that
his
great
kindness
to
I
be
balance
by
unjust
severity
to
many


other
.
he
be
moody
,
too
;
unaccountably
so
;
I
more
than
once
,
when


send
for
to
read
to
he
,
find
he
sit
in
his
library
alone
,
with


his
head
bent
on
his
fold
arm
;
and
,
when
he
look
up
,
a
morose
,


almost
a
malignant
,
scowl
blacken
his
feature
.
but
I
believe
that


his
moodiness
,
his
harshness
,
and
his
former
fault
of
morality
(
I
say


_
former
_
,
for
now
he
seem
correct
of
they
)
have
their
source
in
some


cruel
cross
of
fate
.
I
believe
he
be
naturally
a
man
of
well


tendency
,
high
principle
,
and
purer
taste
than
such
as


circumstance
have
develop
,
education
instill
,
or
destiny


encourage
.
I
think
there
be
excellent
material
in
he
;
though
for


the
present
they
hang
together
somewhat
spoiled
and
tangle
.
I
can
not


deny
that
I
grieve
for
his
grief
,
whatever
that
be
,
and
would
have


give
much
to
assuage
it
.




though
I
have
now
extinguish
my
candle
and
be
lay
down
in
bed
,
I


could
not
sleep
for
thinking
of
his
look
when
he
pause
in
the
avenue
,


and
tell
how
his
destiny
have
rise
up
before
he
,
and
dare
he
to
be


happy
at
Thornfield
.




"
why
not
?
"
I
ask
myself
.
"
what
alienate
he
from
the
house
?
will
he


leave
it
again
soon
?
Mrs.
Fairfax
say
he
seldom
stay
here
long


than
a
fortnight
at
a
time
;
and
he
have
now
be
resident
eight
week
.


if
he
do
go
,
the
change
will
be
doleful
.
suppose
he
should
be
absent


spring
,
summer
,
and
autumn
:
how
joyless
sunshine
and
fine
day
will


seem
!
"




I
hardly
know
whether
I
have
sleep
or
not
after
this
musing
;
at
any


rate
,
I
start
wide
awake
on
hear
a
vague
murmur
,
peculiar
and


lugubrious
,
which
sound
,
I
think
,
just
above
I
.
I
wish
I
have


keep
my
candle
burning
:
the
night
be
drearily
dark
;
my
spirit
be


depressed
.
I
rise
and
sit
up
in
bed
,
listen
.
the
sound
be
hush
.




I
try
again
to
sleep
;
but
my
heart
beat
anxiously
:
my
inward


tranquillity
be
break
.
the
clock
,
far
down
in
the
hall
,
strike
two
.


just
then
it
seem
my
chamber
-
door
be
touch
;
as
if
finger
have


sweep
the
panel
in
grope
a
way
along
the
dark
gallery
outside
.
I


say
,
"
who
be
there
?
"
nothing
answer
.
I
be
chill
with
fear
.




all
at
once
I
remember
that
it
might
be
Pilot
,
who
,
when
the


kitchen
-
door
chance
to
be
leave
open
,
not
unfrequently
find
his
way
up


to
the
threshold
of
Mr.
Rochester
’s
chamber
:
I
have
see
he
lie
there


myself
in
the
morning
.
the
idea
calm
I
somewhat
:
I
lie
down
.


silence
compose
the
nerve
;
and
as
an
unbroken
hush
now
reign
again


through
the
whole
house
,
I
begin
to
feel
the
return
of
slumber
.
but
it


be
not
fate
that
I
should
sleep
that
night
.
a
dream
have
scarcely


approach
my
ear
,
when
it
flee
affright
,
scare
by
a
marrow
-
freeze


incident
enough
.




this
be
a
demoniac
laugh
—
low
,
suppress
,
and
deep
—
utter
,
as
it


seem
,
at
the
very
keyhole
of
my
chamber
door
.
the
head
of
my
bed
be


near
the
door
,
and
I
think
at
first
the
goblin
-
laugher
stand
at
my


bedside
—
or
rather
,
crouch
by
my
pillow
:
but
I
rise
,
look
round
,
and


could
see
nothing
;
while
,
as
I
still
gaze
,
the
unnatural
sound
be


reiterate
:
and
I
know
it
come
from
behind
the
panel
.
my
first
impulse


be
to
rise
and
fasten
the
bolt
;
my
next
,
again
to
cry
out
,
"
who
be


there
?
"




something
gurgle
and
moan
.
ere
long
,
step
retreat
up
the
gallery


towards
the
third
-
storey
staircase
:
a
door
have
lately
be
make
to
shut


in
that
staircase
;
I
hear
it
open
and
close
,
and
all
be
still
.




"
be
that
Grace
Poole
?
and
be
she
possess
with
a
devil

"
think
i.


impossible
now
to
remain
long
by
myself
:
I
must
go
to
Mrs.
Fairfax
.
I


hurry
on
my
frock
and
a
shawl
;
I
withdraw
the
bolt
and
open
the


door
with
a
tremble
hand
.
there
be
a
candle
burning
just
outside
,


and
on
the
matting
in
the
gallery
.
I
be
surprised
at
this


circumstance
:
but
still
more
be
I
amazed
to
perceive
the
air
quite


dim
,
as
if
fill
with
smoke
;
and
,
while
look
to
the
right
hand
and


leave
,
to
find
whence
these
blue
wreath
issue
,
I
become
far
aware


of
a
strong
smell
of
burning
.




something
creak
:
it
be
a
door
ajar
;
and
that
door
be
Mr.


Rochester
’s
,
and
the
smoke
rush
in
a
cloud
from
thence
.
I
think
no


more
of
Mrs.
Fairfax
;
I
think
no
more
of
Grace
Poole
,
or
the
laugh
:


in
an
instant
,
I
be
within
the
chamber
.
tongue
of
flame
dart
round


the
bed
:
the
curtain
be
on
fire
.
in
the
midst
of
blaze
and
vapour

Mr.

motionless

deep
sleep
.




"

I
cry
.
I
shake
he
,
but
he
only
murmur
and
turn
:


the
smoke
have
stupefy
he
.
not
a
moment
could
be
lose
:
the
very


sheet
be

I
rush
to
his
basin

ewer

fortunately
,
one


be
wide
and
the
other
deep

both
be

with
water

I
heave


they
up
,
deluge
the
bed

its
occupant

fly
back
to
my

water

baptize
the
couch
afresh

God

aid

succeed

the
flame

it

the
hiss

breakage
of
a
pitcher

I


fling
from
my

I
both
wish
and
fear
to
see
Mr.
Rochester
on
the
day
which
follow


this
sleepless
night
:
I
want
to
hear
his
voice
again
,
yet
fear
to


meet
his
eye
.
during
the
early
part
of
the
morning
,
I
momentarily


expect
his
coming
;
he
be
not
in
the
frequent
habit
of
enter
the


schoolroom
,
but
he
do
step
in
for
a
few
minute
sometimes
,
and
I
have


the
impression
that
he
be
sure
to
visit
it
that
day
.




but
the
morning
pass
just
as
usual
:
nothing
happen
to
interrupt
the


quiet
course
of
Adèle
’s
study
;
only
soon
after
breakfast
,
I
hear


some
bustle
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Mr.
Rochester
’s
chamber
,
Mrs.


fairfax
’s
voice
,
and
Leah
’s
,
and
the
cook’s
—
that
is
,
John
’s
wife
—
and


even
John
’s
own
gruff
tone
.
there
be
exclamation
of
"
what
a
mercy


master

the
room

go
downstairs

dinner

I


see
through
the
open
door

all
be
again
restore
to
complete


order

the

of
its

up
in
the


window

smoke

I
wish
to
know
what
account
have
be
give
of
the


affair
:
but
,
on
advance
,
I
see
a
second
person
in
the
chamber
—
a
woman


sit
on
a
chair
by
the
bedside
,
and
sewing
ring
to
new
curtain
.


that
woman
be
no
other
than
Grace
Poole
.




there
she
sit
,
staid
and
taciturn
-
look
,
as
usual
,
in
her
brown
stuff


gown
,
her
check
apron
,
white
handkerchief
,
and
cap
.
she
be
intent
on


her
work
,
in
which
her
whole
thought
seemed
absorb
:
on
her
hard


forehead
,
and
in
her
commonplace
feature
,
be
nothing
either
of
the


paleness
or
desperation
one
would
have
expect
to
see
mark
the


countenance
of
a
woman
who
have
attempt
murder
,
and
whose
intend


victim
have
follow
she
last
night
to
her
lair
,
and
(
as
I
believe
)
,


charge
she
with
the
crime
she
wish
to
perpetrate
.
I
be


amazed
—
confounded
.
she
look
up
,
while
I
still
gaze
at
she
:
no
start
,


no
increase
or
failure
of
colour
betray
emotion
,
consciousness
of


guilt
,
or
fear
of
detection
.
she
say
"

she


usual
phlegmatic
and
brief
manner

take
up
another
ring

go
on
with
her
sewing

I

low

something

consciousness

to

I
warily

in

"

I

mark
stress
on

you

such
a
large

wait
on

I
always

it
well
to
err
on
the
safe


side

I

my

the


enigmatical
character

still
more
in
ponder
the


problem
of
her
position
at
Thornfield

question
why
she
have
not

give
into
custody
that
morning
,

,
at
the
very
least
,
dismiss


from
her
master
’s

.
he
have
almost
as
much
as
declare
his


conviction
of
her
criminality
last
night
:
what
mysterious
cause


withhold
he
from
accuse
she
?
why
have
he
enjoin
I
,
too
,
to


secrecy
?
it
be
strange
:
a
bold
,
vindictive
,
and
haughty
gentleman


seem
somehow
in
the
power
of
one
of
the
mean
of
his
dependent
;
so


much
in
her
power
,
that
even
when
she
lift
her
hand
against
his
life
,


he
dared
not
openly
charge
she
with
the
attempt
,
much
less
punish
she


for
it
.




have
Grace
be
young
and
handsome
,
I
should
have
be
tempt
to
think


that
tenderer
feeling
than
prudence
or
fear
influence
Mr.
Rochester


in
her
behalf
;
but
,
hard
-
favour
and
matronly
as
she
be

the
idea


could
not
be
admit

"
yet
,
"
I
reflect
,
"
she
have
be
young
once
;


her
youth
would
be
contemporary
with
her
master
’s

Mrs.

tell
I


once
,
she
have
live
here
many
year

do
n’t
think
she
can
ever
have


be
pretty
;
but
,
for
aught
I
know
,
she
may
possess
originality
and


strength
of
character
to
compensate
for
the
want
of
personal


advantage
.
Mr.
Rochester
be
an
amateur
of
the
decide
and
eccentric

grace
be
eccentric
at
least
.
what
if

former
caprice
(
a
freak
very


possible
to
a
nature
so
sudden

headstrong
as
his
)
have
deliver
he


into
her
power
,
and
she
now
exercise
over
his
action
a
secret


influence
,
the
result
of
his
own
indiscretion
,

he
can
not
shake


off
,

dare
not
disregard
?

reach
this
point

conjecture

square

far

a
week
pass

news
arrive
of
Mr.

ten
day
,

still
he
do
not

Mrs.

she
should
not
be
surprised
if


he
be
to
go
straight
from
the
Leas
to
London
,

thence
to
the


continent
,
and
not
show
his
face
again
at
Thornfield
for
a
year
to


come
;
he
have
not
unfrequently
quit
it
in
a
manner
quite
as
abrupt

unexpected
.
when

begin
to
feel
a
strange


chill

fail
at
the
heart

be
actually
permit
myself
to


experience
a
sickening
sense
of
disappointment

rally
my
wit

recollect
my
principle

I
at
once
call
my
sensation

it
be
wonderful
how
I
get
over
the
temporary
blunder

how
I


clear
up
the
mistake

he


the
object
of
your
fine
feeling

your
rapture
,
agony
,

so
forth
.

be
not

your
order

your
caste

respect


to
lavish
the
love

the
whole
heart

soul
,

such
a

suggestion

across

and

Mr.
Rochester
have
be
absent
upwards
of
a
fortnight
,
when
the
post


bring
Mrs.
Fairfax
a
letter
.




"
it
be
from
the
master
,
"
say
she
,
as
she
look
at
the
direction
.
"
now


I
suppose
we
shall
know
whether
we
be
to
expect
his
return
or
not
.
"




and
while
she
break
the
seal
and
peruse
the
document
,
I
go
on
take


my
coffee
(
we
be
at
breakfast
):
it
be
hot
,
and
I
attribute
to
that


circumstance
a
fiery
glow
which
suddenly
rise
to
my
face
.
why
my
hand


shake
,
and
why
I
involuntarily
spilt
half
the
content
of
my
cup
into


my
saucer
,
I
do
not
choose
to
consider
.




"
well
,
I
sometimes
think
we
be
too
quiet
;
but
we
run
a
chance
of
be


busy
enough
now
:
for
a
little
while
at
least
,
"
say
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
still


hold
the
note
before
her
spectacle
.




Ere
I
permit
myself
to
request
an
explanation
,
I
tie
the
string
of


Adèle
’s
pinafore
,
which
happen
to
be
loose
:
having
help
she
also
to


another
bun
and
refill
her
mug
with
milk
,
I
say
,
nonchalantly
—




"
Mr.
Rochester
be
not
likely
to
return
soon
,
I
suppose
?
"




"
indeed
he
be
—
in
three
day
,
he
say
:
that
will
be
next
Thursday
;
and


not
alone
either
.
I
do
n’t
know
how
many
of
the
fine
people
at
the
Leas


be
come
with
he
:
he
send
direction
for
all
the
good
bedroom
to


be
prepare
;
and
the
library
and
drawing
-
room
be
to
be
clean
out
;
I


be
to
get
more
kitchen
hand
from
the
George
Inn
,
at
Millcote
,
and
from


wherever
else
I
can
;
and
the
lady
will
bring
their
maid
and
the


gentleman
their
valet
:
so
we
shall
have
a
full
house
of
it
.
"
and
Mrs.


fairfax
swallow
her
breakfast
and
hasten
away
to
commence


operation
.




the
three
day
be
,
as
she
have
foretell
,
busy
enough
.
I
have
think


all
the
room
at
Thornfield
beautifully
clean
and
well
arranged
;
but
it


appear
I
be
mistaken
.
three
woman
be
get
to
help
;
and
such


scrub
,
such
brushing
,
such
washing
of
paint
and
beating
of
carpet
,


such
take
down
and
put
up
of
picture
,
such
polishing
of
mirror


and
lustre
,
such
lighting
of
fire
in
bedroom
,
such
airing
of
sheet


and
feather
-
bed
on
hearth
,
I
never
beheld
,
either
before
or
since
.


Adèle
run
quite
wild
in
the
midst
of
it
:
the
preparation
for
company


and
the
prospect
of
their
arrival
,
seem
to
throw
she
into
ecstasy
.


she
would
have
Sophie
to
look
over
all
her
"
toilette
,
"
as
she
call


frock
;
to
furbish
up
any
that
be
"
_
passées
_
,
"
and
to
air
and
arrange


the
new
.
for
herself
,
she
do
nothing
but
caper
about
in
the
front


chamber
,
jump
on
and
off
the
bedstead
,
and
lie
on
the
mattress
and


pile
-
up
bolster
and
pillow
before
the
enormous
fire
roar
in
the


chimney
.
from
school
duty
she
be
exonerate
:
Mrs.
Fairfax
have


press
I
into
her
service
,
and
I
be
all
day
in
the
storeroom
,


help
(
or
hinder
)
she
and
the
cook
;
learn
to
make
custard
and


cheese
-
cake
and
french
pastry
,
to
truss
game
and
garnish


desert
-
dish
.




the
party
be
expect
to
arrive
on
Thursday
afternoon
,
in
time
for


dinner
at
six
.
during
the
intervene
period
I
have
no
time
to
nurse


chimera
;
and
I
believe
I
be
as
active
and
gay
as
anybody
—
Adèle


except
.
still
,
now
and
then
,
I
receive
a
damp
check
to
my


cheerfulness
;
and
be
,
in
spite
of
myself
,
throw
back
on
the
region
of


doubt
and
portent
,
and
dark
conjecture
.
this
be
when
I
chance
to


see
the
third
-
storey
staircase
door
(
which
of
late
have
always
be
keep


locked
)
open
slowly
,
and
give
passage
to
the
form
of
Grace
Poole
,
in


prim
cap
,
white
apron
,
and
handkerchief
;
when
I
watch
her
glide
along


the
gallery
,
her
quiet
tread
muffle
in
a
list
slipper
;
when
I
see
she


look
into
the
bustling
,
topsy
-
turvy
bedrooms,—just
say
a
word
,
perhaps
,


to
the
charwoman
about
the
proper
way
to
polish
a
grate
,
or
clean
a


marble
mantelpiece
,
or
take
stain
from
papered
wall
,
and
then
pass


on
.
she
would
thus
descend
to
the
kitchen
once
a
day
,
eat
her
dinner
,


smoke
a
moderate
pipe
on
the
hearth
,
and
go
back
,
carry
her
pot
of


porter
with
she
,
for
her
private
solace
,
in
her
own
gloomy
,
upper


haunt
.
only
one
hour
in
the
twenty
-
four
do
she
pass
with
she


fellow
-
servant
below
;
all
the
rest
of
her
time
be
spend
in
some


low
-
ceiled
,
oaken
chamber
of
the
second
storey
:
there
she
sit
and


sew
—
and
probably
laugh
drearily
to
herself,—as
companionless
as
a


prisoner
in
his
dungeon
.




the
strange
thing
of
all
be
,
that
not
a
soul
in
the
house
,
except


I
,
notice
her
habit
,
or
seem
to
marvel
at
they
:
no
one
discuss


her
position
or
employment
;
no
one
pity
her
solitude
or
isolation
.
I


once
,
indeed
,
overhear
part
of
a
dialogue
between
Leah
and
one
of
the


charwoman
,
of
which
Grace
form
the
subject
.
Leah
have
be
say


something
I
have
not
catch
,
and
the
charwoman
remark
—




"
she
get
good
wage
,
I
guess
?
"




"
yes
,
"
say
Leah
;
"
I
wish
I
have
as
good
;
not
that
mine
be
to
complain


of,—there
’
no
stinginess
at
Thornfield
;
but
they
’re
not
one
fifth
of


the
sum
Mrs.
Poole
receive
.
and
she
be
lay
by
:
she
go
every


quarter
to
the
bank
at
Millcote
.
I
should
not
wonder
but
she
have
save


enough
to
keep
she
independent
if
she
like
to
leave
;
but
I
suppose


she
’s
got
use
to
the
place
;
and
then
she
’
not
forty
yet
,
and
strong


and
able
for
anything
.
it
be
too
soon
for
she
to
give
up
business
.
"




"
she
be
a
good
hand
,
I
daresay
,
"
say
the
charwoman
.




"
ah!—she
understand
what
she
have
to
do,—nobody
well
,
"
rejoin
Leah


significantly
;
"
and
it
be
not
every
one
could
fill
her
shoe
—
not
for


all
the
money
she
get
.
"




"
that
it
be
not
!
"
be
the
reply
.
"
I
wonder
whether
the
master
—
"




the
charwoman
be
go
on
;
but
here
Leah
turn
and
perceive
I
,
and


she
instantly
give
her
companion
a
nudge
.




"
do
n’t
she
know
?
"
I
hear
the
woman
whisper
.




leah
shake
her
head
,
and
the
conversation
be
of
course
drop
.
all
I


have
gather
from
it
amount
to
this,—that
there
be
a
mystery
at


Thornfield
;
and
that
from
participation
in
that
mystery
I
be
purposely


exclude
.




Thursday

brightness
of

Afternoon

assume
her
good
black
satin
gown
,
she


glove

for
it
be
her
part
to

the


company,—to
conduct
the

to
their
room
,
&
c.
Adèle
,

,
would
be

day
at
least
.

Sophie

full
muslin
frock

for
myself

I


have
no

I
should
not
be
call
upon
to
quit
my


sanctum
of
the

;
for
a
sanctum
it
be
now
become
to
me,—“a


very
pleasant
refuge
in
time
of
trouble
.
"




it
have
be
a
mild
,
serene
spring
day

one

at

the

a
cold
chicken

I
make
a
hasty
retreat

I


have
regain
the
gallery

be
just
shut
the
back

door
behind


I
,
when
an
accelerated
hum
warn
I
that
the
lady
be
about
to


issue
from
their
chamber

I
could
not
proceed
to
the
schoolroom


without
pass
some
of
their
door
,
and
run
the
risk
of
be


surprised
with
my
cargo
of
victualage

so
I
stand
still
at
this
end

,
be
windowless

dark

quite
dark
now

the
sun

set

twilight
gathering

presently
the
chamber
give
up
their
fair
tenant
one
after
another

come
out
gaily

airily
,
with
dress
that
gleam
lustrous


through
the
dusk

for
a
moment
they
stood
group
together
at
the
other


extremity
of
the
gallery
,
converse
in
a
key
of
sweet
subdue


vivacity
:
they
then
descend
the
staircase
almost
as
noiselessly
as
a


bright
mist
roll
down
a
hill
.
their
collective
appearance
have
leave
on


I
an
impression
of
high

bear
elegance
,
such
as
I
have
never

I
find
Adèle
peep
through
the
schoolroom
door
,

she
hold
ajar
.


"

she
be
really
hungry

the
chicken

tart
serve
to
divert
she


attention
for
a
time

be
well

secure
this
forage

I

Sophie
,
to
whom
I
convey
a
share
of
our
repast

would
have
run


a
chance
of
get
no
dinner
at
all

every
one
downstairs
be

much


engage

footman

still
run
to
and
fro
with
tray
and


coffee

cup
.
I
allow
Adèle
to
sit
up
much
later
than
usual
;
for
she


declare
she
could
not
possibly
go
to
sleep
while
the
door
keep


open
and
shut
below
,
and
people
bustle
about
.
besides
,
she


add
,
a
message
might
possibly
come
from
Mr.
Rochester
when
she
be


undress
;
"
et
alor
quel
dommage

"




I
tell
her
story
as
long
as
she
would
listen
to
they
;
and
then
for
a


change
I
take
she
out
into
the
gallery
.
the
hall
lamp
be
now
light
,
and


it
amuse
she
to
look
over
the
balustrade
and
watch
the
servant


pass
backwards
and
forwards
.
when
the
evening
be
far
advanced
,
a


sound
of
music
issue
from
the
drawing
-
room
,
whither
the
piano
have
be


remove
;
Adèle
and
I
sit
down
on
the
top
step
of
the
stair
to
listen
.


presently
a
voice
blent
with
the
rich
tone
of
the
instrument
;
it
be
a


lady
who
sing
,
and
very
sweet
her
note
be
.
the
solo
over
,
a
duet


follow
,
and
then
a
glee
:
a
joyous
conversational
murmur
fill
up
the


interval
.
I
listen
long
:
suddenly
I
discover
that
my
ear
be


wholly
intent
on
analyse
the
mingle
sound
,
and
try
to


discriminate
amidst
the
confusion
of
accent
those
of
Mr.
Rochester
;


and
when
it
catch
they
,
which
it
soon
do
,
it
find
a
further
task
in


frame
the
tone
,
render
by
distance
inarticulate
,
into
word
.




the
clock
strike
eleven
.
I
look
at
Adèle
,
whose
head
leant
against
my


shoulder
;
her
eye
be
wax
heavy
,
so
I
take
she
up
in
my
arm
and


carry
she
off
to
bed
.
it
be
near
one
before
the
gentleman
and
lady


seek
their
chamber
.




the
next
day
be
as
fine
as
its
predecessor
:
it
be
devote
by
the


party
to
an
excursion
to
some
site
in
the
neighbourhood
.
they
set
out


early
in
the
forenoon
,
some
on
horseback
,
the
rest
in
carriage
;
I


witness
both
the
departure
and
the
return
.
Miss
Ingram
,
as
before
,


be
the
only
lady
equestrian
;
and
,
as
before
,
Mr.
Rochester
gallop
at


her
side
;
the
two
ride
a
little
apart
from
the
rest
.
I
point
out
this


circumstance
to
Mrs.
Fairfax

be

at
the
window

say


I
,

down

and
I
take
a
rose
from
a
vase

fasten
it
in
her
sash

sigh
a
sigh
of
ineffable
satisfaction
,

if
her
cup
of
happiness

full
.
I
turn
my
face
away
to
conceal
a
smile
I
could
not


suppress
:
there
be
something
ludicrous
as
well
as
painful
in
the


little
Parisienne
’s
earnest
and
innate
devotion
to
matter
of
dress
.




a
soft
sound
of
rise
now
become
audible
;
the
curtain
be
sweep
back


from
the
arch

through
it
appear
the
dining

room
,
with
its
light
lustre

down

the
silver
and
glass
of
a
magnificent


dessert

a
long
table

a
band
of
lady
stand
in
the


opening

they
enter
,
and
the
curtain
fall
behind
they
.




there
be
but
eight
;
yet
,
somehow
,
as
they
flock
in
,
they
give
the


impression
of
a
much
large
number
.
some
of
they
be
very
tall
;
many


be
dress
in
white
;
and
all
have
a
sweeping
amplitude
of
array
that


seem
to
magnify
their
person
as
a
mist
magnify
the
moon
.
I
rise


and
curtsey
to
they
:
one
or
two
bend
their
head
in
return
,
the


other
only
stare
at
I
.




they
disperse
about
the
room
,
remind
I
,
by
the
lightness
and


buoyancy
of
their
movement
,
of
a
flock
of
white
plumy
bird
.
some
of


they
throw
themselves
in
half
-
recline
position
on
the
sofas
and


othman
:
some
bent
over
the
table
and
examine
the
flower
and
book
:


the
rest
gather
in
a
group
round
the
fire
:
all
talk
in
a
low
but


clear
tone
which
seem
habitual
to
they
.
I
know
their
name


afterwards
,
and
may
as
well
mention
they
now
.




first
,
there
be
Mrs.
Eshton
and
two
of
her
daughter
.
she
have


evidently
be
a
handsome
woman
,
and
be
well
preserve
still
.
of
she


daughter
,
the
eld
,
Amy
,
be
rather
little
:
naïve
,
and
child
-
like
in


face
and
manner
,
and
piquant
in
form
;
her
white
muslin
dress
and
blue


sash
become
she
well
.
the
second
,
Louisa
,
be
tall
and
more
elegant


in
figure
;
with
a
very
pretty
face
,
of
that
order
the
french
term


_
minoi
chiffoné
_
:
both
sister
be
fair
as
lily
.




Lady
Lynn
be
a
large
and
stout
personage
of
about
forty
,
very
erect
,


very
haughty
-
look
,
richly
dress
in
a
satin
robe
of
changeful


sheen
:
her
dark
hair
shine
glossily
under
the
shade
of
an
azure
plume
,


and
within
the
circlet
of
a
band
of
gem
.




Mrs.
Colonel
Dent
be
less
showy
;
but
,
I
think
,
more
lady
-
like
.
she


have
a
slight
figure
,
a
pale
,
gentle
face
,
and
fair
hair
.
her
black


satin
dress
,
her
scarf
of
rich
foreign
lace
,
and
her
pearl
ornament
,


please
I
well
than
the
rainbow
radiance
of
the
title
dame
.




but
the
three
most
distinguished
—
partly
,
perhaps
,
because
the
tall


figure
of
the
band
—
be
the
Dowager
Lady
Ingram
and
her
daughter
,


Blanche
and
Mary
.
they
be
all
three
of
the
lofty
stature
of
woman
.


the
Dowager
might
be
between
forty
and
fifty
:
her
shape
be
still
fine
;


her
hair
(
by
candle
-
light
at
least
)
still
black
;
her
tooth
,
too
,
be


still
apparently
perfect
.
Most
people
would
have
term
she
a
splendid


woman
of
her
age
:
and
so
she
be
,
no
doubt
,
physically
speak
;
but


then
there
be
an
expression
of
almost
insupportable
haughtiness
in
she


bearing
and
countenance
.
she
have
roman
feature
and
a
double
chin
,


disappear
into
a
throat
like
a
pillar
:
these
feature
appear
to
I


not
only
inflated
and
darken
,
but
even
furrow
with
pride
;
and
the


chin
be
sustain
by
the
same
principle
,
in
a
position
of
almost


preternatural
erectness
.
she
have
,
likewise
,
a
fierce
and
a
hard
eye
:
it


remind
I
of
Mrs.
Reed
’s
;
she
mouth
her
word
in
speak
;
she


voice
be
deep
,
its
inflection
very
pompous
,
very
dogmatical,—very


intolerable
,
in
short
.
a
crimson
velvet
robe
,
and
a
shawl
turban
of


some
gold
-
wrought
indian
fabric
,
invest
she
(
I
suppose
she
think
)


with
a
truly
imperial
dignity
.




Blanche
and
Mary
be
of
equal
stature,—straight
and
tall
as
poplar
.


Mary
be
too
slim
for
her
height
,
but
Blanche
be
mould
like
a
Dian
.


I
regard
she
,
of
course
,
with
special
interest
.
first
,
I
wish
to


see
whether
her
appearance
accord
with
Mrs.
Fairfax
’s
description
;


secondly
,
whether
it
at
all
resemble
the
fancy
miniature
I
have
paint


of
she
;
and
thirdly
—
it
will
out!—whether
it
be
such
as
I
should
fancy


likely
to
suit
Mr.
Rochester
’s
taste
.




as
far
as
person
go
,
she
answer
point
for
point
,
both
to
my
picture


and
Mrs.
Fairfax
’s
description
.
the
noble
bust
,
the
slope
shoulder
,


the
graceful
neck
,
the
dark
eye
and
black
ringlet
be
all
there;—but


her
face
?
her
face
be
like
her
mother
’s
;
a
youthful
unfurrowed


likeness
:
the
same
low
brow
,
the
same
high
feature
,
the
same
pride
.
it


be
not
,
however
,
so
saturnine
a
pride
!
she
laugh
continually
;
she


laugh
be
satirical
,
and
so
be
the
habitual
expression
of
her
arched


and
haughty
lip
.




Genius
be
say
to
be
self
-
conscious
.
I
can
not
tell
whether
Miss
Ingram


be
a
genius
,
but
she
be
self
-
conscious
—
remarkably
self
-
conscious


indeed
.
she
enter
into
a
discourse
on
botany
with
the
gentle
Mrs.


Dent
.
it
seem
Mrs.
Dent
have
not
study
that
science
:
though
,
as
she


say
,
she
like
flower
,
"
especially
wild
one
;
"
Miss
Ingram
have
,
and


she
run
over
its
vocabulary
with
an
air
.
I
presently
perceive
she
be


(
what
be
vernacularly
term
)
_
trail
_
Mrs.
Dent
;
that
is
,
play
on


her
ignorance
;
she
_
trail
_
might
be
clever
,
but
it
be
decidedly
not


good
-
natured
.
she
play
:
her
execution
be
brilliant
;
she
sing
:
she


voice
be
fine
;
she
talk
French
apart
to
her
mamma
;
and
she
talk
it


well
,
with
fluency
and
with
a
good
accent
.




Mary
have
a
milder
and
more
open
countenance
than
Blanche
;
soft


feature
too
,
and
a
skin
some
shade
fair
(
Miss
Ingram
be
dark
as
a


Spaniard)—but
Mary
be
deficient
in
life
:
her
face
lack
expression
,


her
eye
lustre
;
she
have
nothing
to
say
,
and
having
once
take
her
seat
,


remained
fix
like
a
statue
in
its
niche
.
the
sister
be
both


attire
in
spotless
white
.




and
do
I
now
think
Miss
Ingram
such
a
choice
as
Mr.
Rochester
would
be


likely
to
make
?
I
could
not
tell
—
I
do
not
know
his
taste
in
female


beauty
.
if
he
like
the
majestic
,
she
be
the
very
type
of
majesty
:


then
she
be
accomplish
,
sprightly
.
Most
gentleman
would
admire
she
,


I
think
;
and
that
he
_
do
_
admire
she
,
I
already
seem
to
have


obtain
proof
:
to
remove
the
last
shade
of
doubt
,
it
remain
but
to


see
they
together
.




you
be
not
to
suppose
,
reader
,
that
Adèle
have
all
this
time

motionless

at
my
foot

no

when
the
lady


enter

she
rise
,
advance
to
meet

make
a
stately
reverence

say
with
gravity

a
mocking
air

not
look
at
the
arch
,
yet
I
see
he
enter
.
I


try
to
concentrate
my
attention
on
those
net
-
needle
,
on
the
mesh


of
the
purse
I
be
form
—
I
wish
to
think
only
of
the
work
I
have
in
my


hand
,
to
see
only
the
silver
bead
and
silk
thread
that
lie
in
my


lap
;
whereas
,
I
distinctly
behold
his
figure
,
and
I
inevitably
recall


the
moment
when
I
last
see
it
;
just
after
I
have
render
he
,
what
he


deem
,
an
essential
service
,
and
he
,
hold
my
hand
,
and
look
down


on
my
face
,
survey
I
with
eye
that
reveal
a
heart
full
and
eager


to
overflow
;
in
whose
emotion
I
have
a
part
.
how
near
have
I
approach


he
at
that
moment
!
what
have
occur
since
,
calculate
to
change
his


and
my
relative
position
?
yet
now
,
how
distant
,
how
far
estrange
we


be
!
so
far
estranged
,
that
I
do
not
expect
he
to
come
and
speak
to


I
.
I
do
not
wonder
,
when
,
without
look
at
I
,
he
take
a
seat
at


the
other
side
of
the
room
,
and
begin
converse
with
some
of
the


lady
.




no
soon
do
I
see
that
his
attention
be
rivet
on
they
,
and
that
I


might
gaze
without
be
observe
,
than
my
eye
be
draw


involuntarily
to
his
face
;
I
could
not
keep
their
lid
under
control
:


they
would
rise
,
and
the
irid
would
fix
on
he
.
I
look
,
and
have
an


acute
pleasure
in
looking,—a
precious
yet
poignant
pleasure
;
pure
gold
,


with
a
steely
point
of
agony
:
a
pleasure
like
what
the
thirst
-
perish


man
might
feel
who
know
the
well
to
which
he
have
creep
be
poison
,


yet
stoop
and
drink
divine
draught
nevertheless
.




most
true
be
it
that
"
beauty
be
in
the
eye
of
the
gazer
.
"
my
master
’s


colourless
,
olive
face
,
square
,
massive
brow
,
broad
and
jetty
eyebrow
,


deep
eye
,
strong
feature
,
firm
,
grim
mouth,—all
energy
,
decision
,


will,—were
not
beautiful
,
accord
to
rule
;
but
they
be
more
than


beautiful
to
I
;
they
be
full
of
an
interest
,
an
influence
that
quite


master
me,—that
take
my
feeling
from
my
own
power
and
fetter
they


in
his
.
I
have
not
intend
to
love
he
;
the
reader
know
I
have
work


hard
to
extirpate
from
my
soul
the
germ
of
love
there
detect
;
and


now
,
at
the
first
renew
view
of
he
,
they
spontaneously
arrive
,


green
and
strong
!
he
make
I
love
he
without
look
at
I
.




I
compare
he
with
his
guest
.
what
be
the
gallant
grace
of
the


Lynns
,
the
languid
elegance
of
Lord
ingram,—even
the
military


distinction
of
Colonel
Dent
,
contrast
with
his
look
of
native
pith


and
genuine
power
?
I
have
no
sympathy
in
their
appearance
,
their


expression
:
yet
I
could
imagine
that
most
observer
would
call
they


attractive
,
handsome
,
impose
;
while
they
would
pronounce
Mr.


rochester
at
once
harsh
-
featured
and
melancholy
-
look
.
I
see
they


smile
,
laugh
—
it
be
nothing
;
the
light
of
the
candle
have
as
much
soul


in
it
as
their
smile
;
the
tinkle
of
the
bell
as
much
significance
as


their
laugh
.
I
see
Mr.
Rochester
smile:—his
stern
feature
soften
;


his
eye
grow
both
brilliant
and
gentle
,
its
ray
both
search
and


sweet
.
he
be
talk
,
at
the
moment
,
to
Louisa
and
Amy
Eshton
.
I


wonder
to
see
they
receive
with
calm
that
look
which
seem
to
I
so


penetrate
:
I
expect
their
eye
to
fall
,
their
colour
to
rise
under


it
;
yet
I
be
glad
when
I
find
they
be
in
no
sense
move
.
"

mine;—I
be
sure
he
be
—
I
feel
akin
to
he
—
I
understand


the
language
of
his
countenance
and
movement
:
though
rank
and
wealth


sever
we
widely
,
I
have
something
in
my
brain
and
heart
,
in
my
blood


and
nerve
,
that
assimilate
I
mentally
to
he

I
say
,
a
few
day


since
,
that
I
have
nothing
to
do
with
he

to
receive
my
salary
at


his
hand
?
do
I
forbid
myself
to
think
of
he
in
any
other
light
than


as
a
paymaster

blasphemy
against
nature
!
every
good
,
true
,
vigorous


feel
I

impulsively
round

I
know
I
must
conceal
my


sentiment
:
I
must
smother
hope
;
I
must
remember
that
he
can
not
care


much
for
I
.
for
when
I
say
that
I
be
of
his
kind
,
I
do
not
mean
that
I


have
his
force
to
influence
,
and
his
spell
to
attract
;
I
mean
only
that


I
have
certain
taste
and
feeling
in
common
with
he
.
I
must
,

repeat
continually
that

be
for
ever
sundered:—and

a
large
marble
basin

I

as
an
ornament
of
the
conservatory

where
it

transport
with
some
trouble

of
its
size

weight

on
the
carpet

the

his
dark
eye


and
swarthy
skin
and
Paynim
feature
suit
the
costume
exactly
:
he


look
the
very
model
of
an
Eastern
emir
,
an
agent
or
a
victim
of
the


bowstre
.
presently
advanced
into

Miss

oriental
fashion

both
her
cast
of


form
and
feature
,
her
complexion
and
her
general
air
,
suggest
the


idea
of
some
israelitish
princess
of
the
patriarchal
day
;
and
such
be


doubtless
the
character
she
intend
to
represent
.




she
approach
the
basin
,

bend
over
it
as
if
to
fill
her
pitcher

it

the
personage
on
the
well

some
request:—“she

how
they
acquit
themselves

I
no
long
remember
;
but
I
still
see


the
consultation
which
follow
each
scene
:
I
see
Mr.
Rochester
turn
to


Miss
Ingram
,

Miss
Ingram
to
he
;
I
see
her
incline
her
head
towards


he
,
till
the
jetty
curl
almost
touch
his
shoulder

wave
against


his
cheek

I
hear
their
mutual
whispering
;
I
recall
their
interchanged


glance
;
and
something
even
of
the
feeling
rouse
by
the
spectacle


return
in
memory
at
this
moment
.




I
have
tell
you
,
reader
,
that
I
have
learn
to
love
Mr.
Rochester
:
I


could
not
unlove
he
now
,
merely
because
I
find
that
he
have
cease
to


notice
I
—
because
I
might
pass
hour
in
his
presence
,
and
he
would


never
once
turn
his
eye
in
my
direction
—
because
I
see
all
his


attention
appropriate
by
a
great
lady
,
who
scorn
to
touch
I
with


the
hem
of
her
robe
as
she
pass
;
who
,
if
ever
her
dark
and
imperious


eye
fall
on
I
by
chance
,
would
withdraw
it
instantly
as
from
an
object


too
mean
to
merit
observation
.
I
could
not
unlove
he
,
because
I
feel


sure
he
would
soon
marry
this
very
lady
—
because
I
read
daily
in
she
a


proud
security
in
his
intention
respect
she
—
because
I
witness


hourly
in
he
a
style
of
courtship
which
,
if
careless
and
choose


rather
to
be
seek
than
to
seek
,
be
yet
,
in
its
very
carelessness
,


captivate
,
and
in
its
very
pride
,
irresistible
.




there
be
nothing
to
cool
or
banish
love
in
these
circumstance
,
though


much
to
create
despair
.
much
too
,
you
will
think
,
reader
,
to
engender


jealousy
:
if
a
woman
,
in
my
position
,
could
presume
to
be
jealous
of
a


woman
in
Miss
Ingram
’s
.
but
I
be
not
jealous
:
or
very
rarely;—the


nature
of
the
pain
I
suffer
could
not
be
explain
by
that
word
.
Miss


Ingram
be
a
mark
beneath
jealousy
:
she
be
too
inferior
to
excite
the


feeling
.
pardon
the
seeming
paradox
;
I
mean
what
I
say
.
she
be
very


showy
,
but
she
be
not
genuine
:
she
have
a
fine
person
,
many
brilliant


attainment
;
but
her
mind
be
poor
,
her
heart
barren
by
nature
:
nothing


bloom
spontaneously
on
that
soil
;
no
unforced
natural
fruit
delight


by
its
freshness
.
she
be
not
good
;
she
be
not
original
:
she
use
to


repeat
sound
phrase
from
book
:
she
never
offer
,
nor
have
,
an


opinion
of
her
own
.
she
advocate
a
high
tone
of
sentiment
;
but
she
do


not
know
the
sensation
of
sympathy
and
pity
;
tenderness
and
truth
be


not
in
she
.
too
often
she
betray
this
,
by
the
undue
vent
she
give
to


a
spiteful
antipathy
she
have
conceive
against
little
Adèle
:
push


she
away
with
some
contumelious
epithet
if
she
happen
to
approach


she
;
sometimes
order
she
from
the
room
,
and
always
treat
she
with


coldness
and
acrimony
.
other
eye
besides
mine
watch
these


manifestation
of
character
—
watch
they
closely
,
keenly
,
shrewdly
.


yes
;
the
future
bridegroom
,
Mr.
Rochester
himself
,
exercise
over
his


intend
a
ceaseless
surveillance
;
and
it
be
from
this
sagacity
—
this


guardedness
of
his
—
this
perfect
,
clear
consciousness
of
his
fair
one
’s


defect
—
this
obvious
absence
of
passion
in
his
sentiment
towards
she
,


that
my
ever
-
torture
pain
arise
.




I
see
he
be
go
to
marry
she
,
for
family
,
perhaps
political
reason
,


because
her
rank
and
connection
suit
he
;
I
feel
he
have
not
give


her
his
love
,
and
that
her
qualification
be
ill
adapt
to
win
from


he
that
treasure
.
this
be
the
point
—
this
be
where
the
nerve
be


touch
and
tease
—
this
be
where
the
fever
be
sustain
and
feed
:
_
she


could
not
charm
he
_
.




if
she
have
manage
the
victory
at
once
,
and
he
have
yield
and


sincerely
lay
his
heart
at
her
foot
,
I
should
have
cover
my
face
,


turn
to
the
wall
,
and
(
figuratively
)
have
die
to
they
.
if
Miss


Ingram
have
be
a
good
and
noble
woman
,
endow
with
force
,
fervour
,


kindness
,
sense
,
I
should
have
have
one
vital
struggle
with
two


tiger
—
jealousy
and
despair
:
then
,
my
heart
tear
out
and
devour
,
I


should
have
admire
she
—
acknowledge
her
excellence
,
and
be
quiet
for


the
rest
of
my
day
:
and
the
more
absolute
her
superiority
,
the
deep


would
have
be
my
admiration
—
the
more
truly
tranquil
my
quiescence
.


but
as
matter
really
stand
,
to
watch
Miss
Ingram
’s
effort
at


fascinating
Mr.
Rochester
,
to
witness
their
repeat
failure
—
herself


unconscious
that
they
do
fail
;
vainly
fancy
that
each
shaft


launch
hit
the
mark
,
and
infatuatedly
plume
herself
on
success
,


when
her
pride
and
self
-
complacency
repel
far
and
far
what


she
wish
to
allure

to
witness

at

under


ceaseless
excitation
and
ruthless
restraint

that
continually
glance
off
from
Mr.
Rochester
’s
breast

fall


harmless
at
his
foot
,
might
,
I
know
,
if
shoot
by
a
surer
hand
,
have


quiver
keen
in
his
proud
heart
—
have
call
love
into
his
stern
eye
,


and
softness
into
his
sardonic
face
;
or
,
well
still
,
without
weapon


a
silent
conquest
might
have
be
win
.




"
why
can
she
not
influence
he
more
,
when
she
be
privileged
to
draw
so


near
to
he
?
"
I
ask
myself
.
"
surely
she
can
not
truly
like
he
,
or
not


like
he
with
true
affection
!
if
she
do
,
she
need
not
coin
her
smile


so
lavishly
,
flash
her
glance
so
unremittingly
,
manufacture
air
so


elaborate
,
grace
so
multitudinous
.
it
seem
to
I
that
she
might
,
by


merely
sit
quietly
at
his
side
,
say
little
and
look
less
,
get


nigher
his
heart
.
I
have
see
in
his
face
a
far
different
expression


from
that
which
harden
it
now
while
she
be
so
vivaciously
accost


he
;
but
then
it
come
of
itself
:
it
be
not
elicit
by
meretricious


art
and
calculate
manoeuvre
;
and
one
have
but
to
accept
it
—
to
answer


what
he
ask
without
pretension
,
to
address
he
when
needful
without


grimace
—
and
it
increase
and
grow
kind
and
more
genial
,
and
warm


one
like
a
foster
sunbeam
.
how
will
she
manage
to
please
he
when


they
be
married
?
I
do
not
think
she
will
manage
it
;
and
yet
it
might


be
manage
;
and
his
wife
might
,
I
verily
believe
,
be
the
very
happy


woman
the
sun
shine
on
.
"




I
have
not
yet
say
anything
condemnatory
of
Mr.
Rochester
’s
project
of


marry
for
interest
and
connection
.
it
surprise
I
when
I
first


discover
that
such
be
his
intention
:
I
have
think
he
a
man


unlikely
to
be
influence
by
motive
so
commonplace
in
his
choice
of
a


wife
;
but
the
long
I
consider
the
position
,
education
,
&
c.
,
of
the


party
,
the
less
I
feel
justified
in
judge
and
blame
either
he
or


Miss
Ingram
for
act
in
conformity
to
idea
and
principle
instill


into
they
,
doubtless
,
from
their
childhood
.
all
their
class
hold
these


principle
:
I
suppose
,
then
,
they
have
reason
for
hold
they
such
as


I
could
not
fathom
.
it
seem
to
I
that
,
be
I
a
gentleman
like
he
,


I
would
take
to
my
bosom
only
such
a
wife
as
I
could
love
;
but
the
very


obviousness
of
the
advantage
to
the
husband
’s
own
happiness
offer
by


this
plan
convince
I
that
there
must
be
argument
against
its
general


adoption
of
which
I
be
quite
ignorant
:
otherwise
I
feel
sure
all
the


world
would
act
as
I
wish
to
act
.




but
in
other
point
,
as
well
as
this
,
I
be
grow
very
lenient
to
my


master
:
I
be
forget
all
his
fault
,
for
which
I
have
once
keep
a


sharp
look
-
out
.
it
have
formerly
be
my
endeavour
to
study
all
side
of


his
character
:
to
take
the
bad
with
the
good
;
and
from
the
just


weigh
of
both
,
to
form
an
equitable
judgment
.
now
I
see
no
bad
.
the


sarcasm
that
have
repel
,
the
harshness
that
have
startle
I
once
,


be
only
like
keen
condiment
in
a
choice
dish
:
their
presence
be


pungent
,
but
their
absence
would
be
feel
as
comparatively
insipid
.
and


as
for
the
vague
something
—
be
it
a
sinister
or
a
sorrowful
,
a


design
or
a
desponding
expression?—that
open
upon
a
careful


observer
,
now
and
then
,
in
his
eye
,
and
close
again
before
one
could


fathom
the
strange
depth
partially
disclose
;
that
something
which
use


to
make
I
fear
and
shrink
,
as
if
I
have
be
wander
amongst


volcanic
-
look
hill
,
and
have
suddenly
feel
the
ground
quiver
and


see
it
gape
:
that
something
,
I
,
at
interval
,
beheld
still
;
and
with


throbbing
heart
,
but
not
with
palsied
nerve
.
instead
of
wish
to


shun
,
I
long
only
to
dare
—
to
divine
it
;
and
I
think
Miss
Ingram


happy
,
because
one
day
she
might
look
into
the
abyss
at
her
leisure
,


explore
its
secret
and
analyse
their
nature
.




meantime
,
while
I
think
only
of
my
master
and
his
future
bride
—
see


only
they
,
hear
only
their
discourse
,

consider
only
their


movement
of
importance

the
rest
of
the
party

with
their


own

pleasure

give
warning
of
the


hour
to
dress
for
dinner
,
when
little
Adèle
,
who
knelt
by
I
in
the


drawing
-
room
window
-
seat
,
suddenly
exclaim
—




"
Voilà
Monsieur
Rochester
,
qui
revient
!
"




I
turn
,
and
Miss
Ingram
dart
forwards
from
her
sofa
:
the
other
,


too
,
look
up
from
their
several
occupation
;
for
at
the
same
time
a


crunch
of
wheel
and
a
splashing
tramp
of
horse
-
hoofs
become
audible


on
the
wet
gravel
.
a
post
-
chaise
be
approach
.




"
what
can
possess
he
to
come
home
in
that
style
?
"
say
Miss
Ingram
.


"
he
ride
Mesrour
(
the
black
horse
)
,
do
he
not
,
when
he
go
out
?
and


pilot
be
with
him:—what
have
he
do
with
the
animal
?
"




as
she
say
this
,
she
approach
her
tall
person
and
ample
garment
so


near
the
window
,
that
I
be
oblige
to
bend
back
almost
to
the
breaking


of
my
spine
:
in
her
eagerness
she
do
not
observe
I
at
first
,
but
when


she
do
,
she
curl
her
lip
and
move
to
another
casement
.
the


post
-
chaise
stop
;
the
driver
ring
the
door
-
bell
,
and
a
gentleman


alight
attire
in
travel
garb
;
but
it
be
not
Mr.
Rochester
;
it


be
a
tall
,
fashionable
-
look
man
,
a
stranger
.




"
how
provoking
!
"
exclaim
Miss
Ingram
:
"
you
tiresome
monkey
!
"


(
apostrophise
Adèle
)
,
"
who
perch
you
up
in
the
window
to
give
false


intelligence
?
"
and
she
cast
on
I
an
angry
glance
,
as
if
I
be
in


fault
.




some
parleying
be
audible
in
the
hall
,
and
soon
the
new
-
comer
enter
.


he
bow
to
Lady
Ingram
,
as
deem
she
the
eld
lady
present
.




"
it
appear
I
come
at
an
inopportune
time
,
madam
,
"
say
he
,
"
when
my


friend
,
Mr.
Rochester
,
be
from
home
;
but
I
arrive
from
a
very
long


journey
,
and
I
think
I
may
presume
so
far
on
old
and
intimate


acquaintance
as
to
instal
myself
here
till
he
return
.
"




his
manner
be
polite
;
his
accent
,
in
speaking
,
strike
I
as
be


somewhat
unusual,—not
precisely
foreign
,
but
still
not
altogether


English
:
his
age
might
be
about
Mr.
Rochester’s,—between
thirty
and


forty
;
his
complexion
be
singularly
sallow
:
otherwise
he
be
a


fine
-
look
man
,
at
first
sight
especially
.
on
close
examination
,
you


detect
something
in
his
face
that
displeased
,
or
rather
that
fail


to
please
.
his
feature
be
regular
,
but
too
relaxed
:
his
eye
be


large
and
well
cut
,
but
the
life
look
out
of
it
be
a
tame
,
vacant


life
—
at
least
so
I
think
.




the
sound
of
the
dressing
-
bell
disperse
the
party
.
it
be
not
till


after
dinner
that
I
see
he
again
:
he
then
seem
quite
at
his
ease
.


but
I
like
his
physiognomy
even
less
than
before
:
it
strike
I
as


be
at
the
same
time
unsettle
and
inanimate
.
his
eye
wander
,
and


have
no
meaning
in
its
wandering
:
this
give
he
an
odd
look
,
such
as
I


never
remember
to
have
see
.
for
a
handsome
and
not
an


unamiable
-
look
man
,
he
repel
I
exceedingly
:
there
be
no
power


in
that
smooth
-
skinned
face
of
a
full
oval
shape
:
no
firmness
in
that


aquiline
nose
and
small
cherry
mouth
;
there
be
no
thought
on
the
low
,


even
forehead
;
no
command
in
that
blank
,
brown
eye
.




as
I
sit
in
my
usual
nook
,
and
look
at
he
with
the
light
of
the


girandole
on
the
mantelpiece
beam
full
over
he
—
for
he
occupy
an


arm
-
chair
draw
close
to
the
fire
,
and
keep
shrink
still
near
,
as


if
he
be
cold
,
I
compare
he
with
Mr.
Rochester
.
I
think
(
with


deference
be
it
speak
)
the
contrast
could
not
be
much
great
between


a
sleek
gander
and
a
fierce
falcon
:
between
a
meek
sheep
and
the


rough
-
coated
keen
-
eyed
dog
,
its
guardian
.




he
have
speak
of
Mr.
Rochester
as
an
old
friend
.
a
curious
friendship


theirs
must
have
be
:
a
pointed
illustration
,
indeed
,
of
the
old
adage


that
"
extreme
meet
.
"




two
or
three
of
the
gentleman
sit
near
he
,
and
I
catch
at
time


scrap
of
their
conversation
across
the
room
.
at
first
I
could
not
make


much
sense
of
what
I
hear
;
for
the
discourse
of
Louisa
Eshton
and
Mary


Ingram
,
who
sit
near
to
I
,
confuse
the
fragmentary
sentence
that


reach
I
at
interval
.
these
last
be
discuss
the
stranger
;
they


both
call
he
"
a
beautiful
man
.
"
Louisa
say
he
be
"
a
love
of
a


creature
,
"
and
she
"
adore
he
;
"
and
Mary
instance
his
"
pretty
little


mouth
,
and
nice
nose
,
"
as
her
ideal
of
the
charming
.




"
and
what
a
sweet
-
temper
forehead
he
have
!
"
cry
Louisa,—“so


smooth
—
none
of
those
frown
irregularity
I
dislike
so
much
;
and


such
a
placid
eye
and
smile
!
"




and
then
,
to
my
great
relief
,
Mr.
Henry
Lynn
summon
they
to
the
other


side
of
the
room
,
to
settle
some
point
about
the
deferred
excursion
to


Hay
Common
.




I
be
now
able
to
concentrate
my
attention
on
the
group
by
the
fire
,


and
I
presently
gather
that
the
new
-
comer
be
call
Mr.
Mason
;
then


I
learn
that
he
be
but
just
arrive
in
England
,
and
that
he
come


from
some
hot
country
:
which
be
the
reason
,
doubtless
,
his
face
be
so


sallow
,
and
that
he
sit
so
near
the
hearth
,
and
wear
a
surtout
in
the


house
.
presently
the
word
Jamaica
,
Kingston
,
Spanish
Town
,
indicate


the
West
Indies
as
his
residence
;
and
it
be
with
no
little
surprise
I


gather
,
ere
long
,
that
he
have
there
first
see
and
become
acquaint


with
Mr.
Rochester
.
he
speak
of
his
friend
’s
dislike
of
the
burning


heat
,
the
hurricane
,
and
rainy
season
of
that
region
.
I
know
Mr.


Rochester
have
be
a
traveller
:
Mrs.
Fairfax
have
say
so
;
but
I
think


the
continent
of
Europe
have
bound
his
wandering
;
till
now
I
have


never
hear
a
hint
give
of
visit
to
more
distant
shore
.




I
be
ponder
these
thing
,
when
an
incident
,
and
a
somewhat


unexpected
one
,
break
the
thread
of
my
musing
.
Mr.
Mason
,
shiver
as


some
one
chance
to
open
the
door
,
ask
for
more
coal
to
be
put
on
the


fire
,
which
have
burn
out
its
flame
,
though
its
mass
of
cinder
still


shine
hot
and
red
.
the
footman
who
bring
the
coal
,
in
go
out
,


stop
near
Mr.
Eshton
’s
chair
,
and
say
something
to
he
in
a
low


voice
,
of
which
I
hear
only
the
word
,
"
old
woman,”—“quite


troublesome
.
"




"
tell
she

reply
the
magistrate
.




"

interrupt
Colonel
Dent
.
"

the
thing
to
account

well

the
lady

"
and


speak
aloud
,
he
continued—“ladie

I
have
forget
to
draw
my
curtain
,
which
I
usually
do
,
and
also
to


let
down
my
window

blind
.
the
consequence
be
,
that
when
the
moon
,


which
be
full
and
bright
(
for
the
night
be
fine
)
,
come
in
her
course


to
that
space
in
the
sky
opposite
my
casement

in
at

the
unveiled
pane

glorious
gaze

I
.
awake
in
the


dead
of
night

I
open
my
eye
on
her
disk
—
silver
-
white
and
crystal


clear
.
it
be
beautiful
,
but
too
solemn
:
I
half
rise
,
and
stretch
my


arm
to
draw
the
curtain
.




good
God
!
what
a
cry
!




the
night
—
its
silence
—
its
rest
,
be
rent
in
twain
by
a
savage
,
a
sharp
,


a
shrilly
sound
that
run
from
end
to
end
of
Thornfield
Hall

my
pulse
stop

my
heart
stand
still
;

stretch
arm

paralysed
.

cry
die
,

be
not
renew
.
indeed
,
whatever
be
utter
that


fearful
shriek
could
not
soon
repeat
it
:
not
the
widest
-
wing
condor


on
the
Andes
could
,
twice
in
succession
,

out
such
a
yell
from

cloud

eyrie

the
thing
deliver
such
utterance
must


rest

I
now
hear
a


struggle

deadly
one

the
noise
;

a
half

staggering

stamp
go

strike

:
"
it
will
not
do
to
risk
a
fainting


fit
.
"




I
put
my
finger
into
his
.
"
warm
and
steady
,
"
be
his
remark
:
he
turn


the
key
and
open
the
door
.




I
see
a
room
I
remember
to
have
see
before
,
the
day
Mrs.
Fairfax


show
I
over
the
house
:
it
be
hang
with
tapestry
;
but
the
tapestry


be
now
loop
up
in
one
part
,
and
there
be
a
door
apparent
,
which
have


then
be
conceal
.
this
door
be
open
;
a
light
shine
out
of
the
room


within
:
I
hear
thence
a
snarling
,
snatch
sound
,
almost
like
a
dog


quarrel
.
Mr.
Rochester
,
put
down
his
candle
,
say
to
I
,
"
wait


a
minute
,
"
and
he
go
forward
to
the
inner
apartment
.
a
shout
of


laughter
greet
his
entrance
;
noisy
at
first
,
and
terminate
in
Grace


Poole
’s
own
goblin
ha
!
ha
!
_
she
_
then
be
there
.
he
make
some
sort
of


arrangement
without
speak
,
though
I
hear
a
low
voice
address
he
:


he
come
out
and
close
the
door
behind
he
.




"
here
,
Jane
!
"
he
say
;
and
I
walk
round
to
the
other
side
of
a
large


bed
,
which
with
its
draw
curtain
conceal
a
considerable
portion
of


the
chamber
.
an
easy
-
chair
be
near
the
bed
-
head
:
a
man
sit
in
it
,


dress
with
the
exception
of
his
coat
;
he
be
still
;
his
head
leant


back
;
his
eye
be
closed
.
Mr.
Rochester
hold
the
candle
over
he
;
I


recognise
in
his
pale
and
seemingly
lifeless
face
—
the
stranger
,
Mason
:


I
see
too
that
his
linen
on
one
side
,
and
one
arm
,
be
almost
soak
in


blood
.




"
hold
the
candle
,
"
say
Mr.
Rochester
,
and
I
take
it
:
he
fetch
a


basin
of
water
from
the
washstand
:
"
hold
that
,
"
say
he
.
I
obey
.
he


take
the
sponge
,
dip
it
in
,
and
moisten
the
corpse
-
like
face
;
he


ask
for
my
smell
-
bottle
,
and
apply
it
to
the
nostril
.
Mr.
Mason


shortly
unclosed
his
eye
;
he
groan
.
Mr.
Rochester
open
the
shirt


of
the
wound
man
,
whose
arm
and
shoulder
be
bandaged
:
he
sponge


away
blood
,
trickle
fast
down
.




"
be
there
immediate
danger
?
"
murmur
Mr.
Mason
.




"
pooh
!
no
—
a
mere
scratch
.
do
n’t
be
so
overcome
,
man
:
bear
up
!
I
’ll


fetch
a
surgeon
for
you
now
,
myself
:
you
’ll
be
able
to
be
remove
by


morning
,
I
hope
.
Jane
,
"
he
continue
.




"
Sir
?
"




"
I
shall
have
to
leave
you
in
this
room
with
this
gentleman
,
for
an


hour
,
or
perhaps
two
hour
:
you
will
sponge
the
blood
as
I
do
when
it


return
:
if
he
feel
faint
,
you
will
put
the
glass
of
water
on
that


stand
to
his
lip
,
and
your
salt
to
his
nose
.
you
will
not
speak
to


he
on
any
pretext
—
and
—
Richard
,
it
will
be
at
the
peril
of
your
life
if


you
speak
to
she
:
open
your
lip
—
agitate
yourself
—
and
I
’ll
not
answer


for
the
consequence
.
"




again
the
poor
man
groan
;
he
look
as
if
he
dared
not
move
;
fear
,


either
of
death
or
of
something
else
,
appear
almost
to
paralyse
he
.


Mr.
Rochester
put
the
now
bloody
sponge
into
my
hand
,
and
I
proceed


to
use
it
as
he
have
do
.
he
watch
I
a
second
,
then
say
,


"
remember!—no
conversation
,
"
he
leave
the
room
.
I
experience
a
strange


feel
as
the
key
grate
in
the
lock
,
and
the
sound
of
his
retreating


step
cease
to
be
hear
.




here
then
I
be
in
the
third
storey
,
fasten
into
one
of
its
mystic


cell
;
night
around
I
;
a
pale
and
bloody
spectacle
under
my
eye
and


hand
;
a
murderess
hardly
separate
from
I
by
a
single
door
:
yes
—
that


be
appalling
—
the
rest
I
could
bear
;
but
I
shudder
at
the
thought
of


Grace
Poole
burst
out
upon
I
.




I
must
keep
to
my
post
,
however
.
I
must
watch
this
ghastly


countenance
—
these
blue
,
still
lip
forbid
to
unclose
—
these
eye
now


shut
,
now
open
,
now
wander
through
the
room
,
now
fix
on
I
,


and
ever
glaze
with
the
dulness
of
horror
.
I
must
dip
my
hand
again


and
again
in
the
basin
of
blood
and
water
,
and
wipe
away
the
trickling


gore
.
I
must
see
the
light
of
the
unsnuffed
candle
wane
on
my


employment
;
the
shadow
darken
on
the
wrought
,
antique
tapestry
round


I
,
and
grow
black
under
the
hanging
of
the
vast
old
bed
,
and
quiver


strangely
over
the
door
of
a
great
cabinet
opposite
—
whose
front
,


divide
into
twelve
panel
,
bore
,
in
grim
design
,
the
head
of
the


twelve
apostle
,
each
enclose
in
its
separate
panel
as
in
a
frame
;


while
above
they
at
the
top
rise
an
ebon
crucifix
and
a
die
Christ
.




accord
as
the
shift
obscurity
and
flicker
gleam
hover
here


or
glance
there
,
it
be
now
the
bearded
physician
,
Luke
,
that
bend
his


brow
;
now
St.
John
’s
long
hair
that
wave
;
and
anon
the
devilish
face


of
Judas
,
that
grow
out
of
the
panel
,
and
seem
gather
life
and


threaten
a
revelation
of
the
arch
-
traitor
—
of
Satan
himself
—
in
his


subordinate
’s
form
.




amidst
all
this
,
I
have
to
listen
as
well
as
watch
:
to
listen
for
the


movement
of
the
wild
beast
or
the
fiend
in
yonder
side
den
.
but
since


Mr.
Rochester
’s
visit
it
seem
spellbound
:
all
the
night
I
hear
but


three
sound
at
three
long
intervals,—a
step
creak
,
a
momentary
renewal


of
the
snarling
,
canine
noise
,
and
a
deep
human
groan
.




then
my
own
thought
worry
I
.
what
crime
be
this
,
that
live


incarnate
in
this
sequester
mansion
,
and
could
neither
be
expel


nor
subdue
by
the
owner?—what
mystery
,
that
break
out
now
in
fire
and


now
in
blood
,
at
the
dead
hour
of
night
?
what
creature
be
it
,


that
,
mask
in
an
ordinary
woman
’s
face
and
shape
,
utter
the
voice
,


now
of
a
mocking
demon
,
and
anon
of
a
carrion
-
seek
bird
of
prey
?




and
this
man
I
bend
over
—
this
commonplace
,
quiet
stranger
—
how
have
he


become
involved
in
the
web
of
horror
?
and
why
have
the
fury
fly
at


he
?
what
make
he
seek
this
quarter
of
the
house
at
an
untimely


season
,
when
he
should
have
be
asleep
in
bed
?
I
have
hear
Mr.


Rochester
assign
he
an
apartment
below
—
what
bring
he
here
!
and
why
,


now
,
be
he
so
tame
under
the
violence
or
treachery
do
he
?
why
do


he
so
quietly
submit
to
the
concealment
Mr.
Rochester
enforce
?
why


_
do
_
Mr.
Rochester
enforce
this
concealment
?
his
guest
have
be


outraged
,
his
own
life
on
a
former
occasion
have
be
hideously
plot


against
;
and
both
attempt
he
smother
in
secrecy
and
sink
in


oblivion
!
lastly
,
I
see
Mr.
Mason
be
submissive
to
Mr.
Rochester
;
that


the
impetuous
will
of
the
latter
hold
complete
sway
over
the
inertness


of
the
former
:
the
few
word
which
have
pass
between
they
assure
I


of
this
.
it
be
evident
that
in
their
former
intercourse
,
the
passive


disposition
of
the
one
have
be
habitually
influence
by
the
active


energy
of
the
other
:
whence
then
have
arise
Mr.
Rochester
’s
dismay
when


he
hear
of
Mr.
Mason
’s
arrival
?
why
have
the
mere
name
of
this


unresiste
individual
—
whom
his
word
now
suffice
to
control
like
a


child
—
fall
on
he
,
a
few
hour
since
,
as
a
thunderbolt
might
fall
on


an
oak
?




oh
!
I
could
not
forget
his
look
and
his
paleness
when
he
whisper
:


"
Jane
,
I
have
get
a
blow
—
I
have
get
a
blow
,
Jane
.
"
I
could
not
forget


how
the
arm
have
tremble
which
he
rest
on
my
shoulder
:
and
it
be
no


light
matter
which
could
thus
bow
the
resolute
spirit
and
thrill
the


vigorous
frame
of
Fairfax
Rochester
.




"
when
will
he
come
?
when
will
he
come
?
"
I
cry
inwardly
,
as
the
night


linger
and
linger
—
as
my
bleed
patient
droop
,
moan
,
sickened
:


and
neither
day
nor
aid
arrive
.
I
have
,
again
and
again
,
hold
the
water


to
Mason
’s
white
lip
;
again
and
again
offer
he
the
stimulate


salt
:
my
effort
seem
ineffectual
:
either
bodily
or
mental


suffering
,
or
loss
of
blood
,
or
all
three
combine
,
be
fast


prostrate
his
strength
.
he
moan
so
,
and
look
so
weak
,
wild
,
and


lose
,
I
fear
he
be
die
;
and
I
might
not
even
speak
to
he
.




the
candle
,
waste
at
last
,
go
out
;
as
it
expire
,
I
perceive


streak
of
grey
light
edge
the
window
curtain
:
dawn
be
then


approach
.
presently
I
hear
Pilot
bark
far
below
,
out
of
his
distant


kennel
in
the
courtyard
:
hope
revive
.
nor
be
it
unwarranted
:
in
five


minute
more
the
grating
key
,
the
yield
lock
,
warn
I
my
watch
be


relieved
.
it
could
not
have
last
more
than
two
hour
:
many
a
week
have


seem
short
.




Mr.
Rochester
enter
,
and
with
he
the
surgeon
he
have
be
to
fetch
.




"
now
,
Carter
,
be
on
the
alert
,
"
he
say
to
this
last
:
"
I
give
you
but


half
-
an
-
hour
for
dress
the
wound
,
fasten
the
bandage
,
get


the
patient
downstairs
and
all
.
"




"
but
be
he
fit
to
move
,
sir
?
"




"
no
doubt
of
it
;
it
be
nothing
serious
;
he
be
nervous
,
his
spirit
must


be
keep
up
.
come
,
set
to
work
.
"




Mr.
Rochester
draw
back
the
thick
curtain
,
draw
up
the
holland
blind
,


let
in
all
the
daylight
he
could
;
and
I
be
surprised
and
cheer
to


see
how
far
dawn
be
advanced
:
what
rosy
streak
be
begin
to


brighten
the
east
.
then
he
approach
Mason
,
whom
the
surgeon
be


already
handle
.




"
now
,
my
good
fellow
,
how
be
you
?
"
he
ask
.




"
she
’s
do
for
I
,
I
fear
,
"
be
the
faint
reply
.




"
not
a
whit!—courage
!
this
day
fortnight
you
’ll
hardly
be
a
pin
the


bad
of
it
:
you
’ve
lose
a

I
never

the
sympathy


of
Nature

.




when
I
be
a
little
girl
,
only
six
year
old
,
I
one
night
hear
Bessie


Leaven
say
to
Martha
Abbot
that
she
have
be
dream
about
a
little


child

a
sure
sign
of
trouble

either


to
one
’s
self

the
saying
might
have
wear
out

my


memory
,

not
a
circumstance
immediately
follow
which
serve


indelibly
to
fix
it
there

next
day
Bessie
be
send
for
home
to
the


deathbed
of
her
little
sister
.




of
late
I
have
often
recall
this
saying
and
this
incident
;
for
during


the
past
week
scarcely
a
night
have
go
over
my
couch
that
have
not


bring
with
it
a
dream
of
an
infant
,
which
I
sometimes
hush
in
my


arm
,
sometimes
dandle
on
my
knee
,
sometimes
watch
play
with


daisy
on
a
lawn
,
or
again
,
dabble
its
hand
in
run
water
.
it


be
a
wail
child
this
night
,
and
a
laugh
one
the
next
:
now
it


nestle
close
to
I
,
and
now
it
run
from
I
;

whatever
mood
the


apparition
evince

aspect
it
wear

the

enter
the
land
of
slumber

I
do
not
like
this
iteration
of
one
idea
—
this
strange
recurrence
of


one
image
,
and
I
grow
nervous
as
bedtime
approach
and
the
hour
of
the


vision
draw
near
.

from

smile


and
obey
she
as
in
bygone
day
.




she
want
to
know
if
I
be
happy
at
Thornfield
Hall
,
and
what
sort
of


a
person
the
mistress
be
;
and
when
I
tell
she
there
be
only
a
master
,


whether
he
be
a
nice
gentleman
,
and
if
I
like
he
.
I
tell
she
he
be


rather
an
ugly
man
,
but
quite
a
gentleman
;
and
that
he
treat
I


kindly
,
and
I
be
content
.
then
I
go
on
to
describe
to
she
the
gay


company
that
have
lately
be
stay
at
the
house
;
and
to
these
detail


Bessie
listen
with
interest
:
they
be
precisely
of
the
kind
she


relish
.




in
such
conversation
an
hour
be
soon
go
:
Bessie
restore
to
I
my


bonnet
,
&
c.
,
and
,
accompany
by
she
,
I
quit
the
lodge
for
the
hall
.


it
be
also
accompany
by
she
that
I
have
,
nearly
nine
year
ago
,


walk
down
the
path
I
be
now
ascend
.
on
a
dark
,
misty
,
raw
morning


in
January
,
I
have
leave
a
hostile
roof
with
a
desperate
and
embittered


heart
—
a
sense
of
outlawry
and
almost
of
reprobation
—
to
seek
the
chilly


harbourage
of
lowood
:
that
bourne
so
far
away
and
unexplored
.
the
same


hostile
roof
now
again
rise
before
I
:
my
prospect
be
doubtful
yet
;


and
I
have
yet
an
aching
heart
.
I
still
feel
as
a
wanderer
on
the
face


of
the
earth
;
but
I
experience
firm
trust
in
myself
and
my
own


power
,
and
less
wither
dread
of
oppression
.
the
gape
wound
of
my


wrong
,
too
,
be
now
quite
heal
;
and
the
flame
of
resentment


extinguish
.




"
you
shall
go
into
the
breakfast
-
room
first
,
"
say
Bessie
,
as
she


precede
I
through
the
hall
;
"
the
young
lady
will
be
there
.
"




in
another
moment
I
be
within
that
apartment
.
there
be
every
article


of
furniture
look
just
as
it
do
on
the
morning
I
be
first


introduce
to
Mr.
Brocklehurst
:
the
very
rug
he
have
stand
upon
still


cover
the
hearth
.
glancing
at
the
bookcase
,
I
think
I
could


distinguish
the
two
volume
of
Bewick
’s
British
bird
occupy
their


old
place
on
the
third
shelf
,
and
Gulliver
’s
travel
and
the
arabian


night
range
just
above
.
the
inanimate
object
be
not
change
;
but


the
live
thing
have
alter
past
recognition
.




two
young
lady
appear
before
I
;
one
very
tall
,
almost
as
tall
as


Miss
Ingram
—
very
thin
too
,
with
a
sallow
face
and
severe
mien
.
there


be
something
ascetic
in
her
look
,
which
be
augment
by
the
extreme


plainness
of
a
straight
-
skirt
,
black
,
stuff
dress
,
a
starched
linen


collar
,
hair
comb
away
from
the
temple
,
and
the
nun
-
like
ornament
of


a
string
of
ebony
bead
and
a
crucifix
.
this
I
feel
sure
be
Eliza
,


though
I
could
trace
little
resemblance
to
her
former
self
in
that


elongate
and
colourless
visage
.




the
other
be
as
certainly
Georgiana
:
but
not
the
Georgiana
I


remember
—
the
slim
and
fairy
-
like
girl
of
eleven
.
this
be
a


full
-
blown
,
very
plump
damsel
,
fair
as
waxwork
,
with
handsome
and


regular
feature
,
languish
blue
eye
,
and
ringlete
yellow
hair
.
the


hue
of
her
dress
be
black
too
;
but
its
fashion
be
so
different
from


her
sister’s
—
so
much
more
flow
and
become
—
it
look
as
stylish
as


the
other
’s
look
puritanical
.




in
each
of
the
sister
there
be
one
trait
of
the
mother
—
and
only
one
;


the
thin
and
pallid
eld
daughter
have
her
parent
’s
cairngorm
eye
:
the


bloom
and
luxuriant
young
girl
have
her
contour
of
jaw
and


chin
—
perhaps
a
little
softened
,
but
still
impart
an
indescribable


hardness
to
the
countenance
otherwise
so
voluptuous
and
buxom
.




both
lady
,
as
I
advance
,
rise
to
welcome
I
,
and
both
address
I


by
the
name
of
"
Miss
Eyre
.
"
Eliza
’s
greeting
be
deliver
in
a
short
,


abrupt
voice
,
without
a
smile
;
and
then
she
sit
down
again
,
fix
she


eye
on
the
fire
,
and
seem
to
forget
I
.
Georgiana
add
to
she
"
how


d’ye
do
?
"
several
commonplace
about
my
journey
,
the
weather
,
and
so


on
,
utter
in
rather
a
drawling
tone
:
and
accompany
by
sundry


side
-
glance
that
measure
I
from
head
to
foot
—
now
traverse
the


fold
of
my
drab
merino
pelisse
,
and
now
linger
on
the
plain


trim
of
my
cottage
bonnet
.
young
lady
have
a
remarkable
way
of


let
you
know
that
they
think
you
a
"
quiz
"
without
actually
say


the
word
.
a
certain
superciliousness
of
look
,
coolness
of
manner
,


nonchalance
of
tone
,
express
fully
their
sentiment
on
the
point
,


without
commit
they
by
any
positive
rudeness
in
word
or
deed
.




a
sneer
,
however
,
whether
covert
or
open
,
have
now
no
long
that
power


over
I
it
once
possess
:
as
I
sit
between
my
cousin
,
I
be
surprised


to
find
how
easy
I
feel
under
the
total
neglect
of
the
one
and
the


semi
-
sarcastic
attention
of
the
other
—
Eliza
do
not
mortify
,
nor


Georgiana
ruffle
I
.
the
fact
be
,
I
have
other
thing
to
think
about
;


within
the
last
few
month
feeling
have
be
stir
in
I
so
much
more


potent
than
any
they
could
raise
—
pain
and
pleasure
so
much
more
acute


and
exquisite
have
be
excited
than
any
it
be
in
their
power
to


inflict
or
bestow
—
that
their
air
give
I
no
concern
either
for
good
or


bad
.




"
how
be
Mrs.
Reed
?
"
I
ask
soon
,
look
calmly
at
Georgiana
,
who


think
fit
to
bridle
at
the
direct
address
,
as
if
it
be
an


unexpected
liberty
.




"
Mrs.
Reed
?
ah
!
mama
,
you
mean
;
she
be
extremely
poorly
:
I
doubt
if
you


can
see
she
to
-
night
.
"




"
if
,
"
say
I
,
"
you
would
just
step
upstairs
and
tell
she
I
be
come
,
I


should
be
much
oblige
to
you
.
"




Georgiana
almost
start
,
and
she
open
her
blue
eye
wild
and
wide
.


"
I
know
she
have
a
particular
wish
to
see
I
,
"
I
add
,
"
and
I
would
not


defer
attend
to
her
desire
long
than
be
absolutely
necessary
.
"




"
Mama
dislike
be
disturb
in
an
evening
,
"
remark
Eliza
.
I
soon


rise
,
quietly
take
off
my
bonnet
and
glove
,
uninvited
,
and
say
I


would
just
step
out
to
Bessie
—
who
be
,
I
dare
say
,
in
the
kitchen
—
and


ask
she
to
ascertain
whether
Mrs.
Reed
be
disposed
to
receive
I
or


not
to
-
night
.
I
go
,
and
having
find
Bessie
and
despatch
she
on
my


errand
,
I
proceed
to
take
further
measure
.
it
have
heretofore
be
my


habit
always
to
shrink
from
arrogance
:
receive
as
I
have
be
to
-
day
,
I


should
,
a
year
ago
,
have
resolve
to
quit
Gateshead
the
very
next


morning
;
now
,
it
be
disclose
to
I
all
at
once
that
that
would
be
a


foolish
plan
.
I
have
take
a
journey
of
a
hundred
mile
to
see
my
aunt
,


and
I
must
stay
with
she
till
she
be
well
—
or
dead
:
as
to
she


daughter
’
pride
or
folly
,
I
must
put
it
on
one
side
,
make
myself


independent
of
it
.
so
I
address
the
housekeeper
;
ask
she
to
show
I


a
room
,
tell
she
I
should
probably
be
a
visitor
here
for
a
week
or
two
,


have
my
trunk
convey
to
my
chamber
,
and
follow
it
thither
myself
:
I


meet
Bessie
on
the
landing
.




"
missis
be
awake
,
"
say
she
;
"
I
have
tell
she
you
be
here
:
come
and


let
we
see
if
she
will
know
you
.
"




I
do
not
need
to
be
guide
to
the
well
-
know
room
,
to
which
I
have
so


often
be
summon
for
chastisement
or
reprimand
in
former
day
.
I


hasten
before
Bessie
;
I
softly
open
the
door
:
a
shaded
light
stand


on
the
table
,
for
it
be
now
get
dark
.
there
be
the
great


four
-
post
bed
with
amber
hanging
as
of
old
;
there
the
toilet
-
table
,


the
armchair
,
and
the
footstool
,
at
which
I
have
a
hundred
time
be


sentence
to
kneel
,
to
ask
pardon
for
offence
by
I
uncommitted
.
I


look
into
a
certain
corner
near
,
half
-
expecting
to
see
the
slim


outline
of
a
once
dread
switch
which
use
to
lurk
there
,
wait
to


leap
out
imp
-
like
and
lace
my
quiver
palm
or
shrink
neck
.
I


approach
the
bed
;
I
open
the
curtain
and
leant
over
the
high
-
pile


pillow
.




well
do
I
remember
Mrs.
Reed
’s
face
,
and
I
eagerly
seek
the
familiar


image
.
it
be
a
happy
thing
that
time
quell
the
longing
of
vengeance


and
hush
the
prompting
of
rage
and
aversion
.
I
have
leave
this
woman


in
bitterness
and
hate
,
and
I
come
back
to
she
now
with
no
other


emotion
than
a
sort
of
ruth
for
her
great
suffering
,
and
a
strong


yearn
to
forget
and
forgive
all
injury
—
to
be
reconcile
and
clasp


hand
in
amity
.




the
well
-
know
face
be
there
:
stern
,
relentless
as
ever
—
there
be
that


peculiar
eye
which
nothing
could
melt
,
and
the
somewhat
raise
,


imperious
,
despotic
eyebrow
.
how
often
have
it
lower
on
I
menace
and


hate
!
and
how
the
recollection
of
childhood
’s
terror
and
sorrow


revive
as
I
trace
its
harsh
line
now
!
and
yet
I
stoop
down
and


kiss
she
:
she
look
at
I
.




"
be
this
Jane
Eyre
?
"
she
say
.




"
yes
,
Aunt
Reed
.
how
be
you
,
dear
aunt
?
"




I
have
once
vow
that
I
would
never
call
her
aunt
again
:
I
think
it


no
sin
to
forget
and
break
that
vow
now
.
my
finger
have
fasten
on
she


hand
which
lie
outside
the
sheet
:
have
she
press
mine
kindly
,
I
should


at
that
moment
have
experience
true
pleasure
.
but
unimpressionable


nature
be
not
so
soon
soften
,
nor
be
natural
antipathy
so


readily
eradicate
.
Mrs.
Reed
take
her
hand
away
,
and
,
turn
her
face


rather
from
I
,
she
remark
that
the
night
be
warm
.
again
she


regard
I
so
icily
,
I
feel
at
once
that
her
opinion
of
I
—
her
feeling


towards
I
—
be
unchanged
and
unchangeable
.
I
know
by
her
stony


eye
—
opaque
to
tenderness
,
indissoluble
to

I
have
a
dislike
to

mother

she

my
husband

only


sister

a
great
favourite
with

oppose
the

disown
she
when
she
make
her
low
marriage
;

when
news

death

weep
like

would

I


entreat
he
rather
to
put
it
out
to
nurse

pay
for
its


maintenance

I
hate
it
the
first
time
I
set
my
eye
on
it

a
sickly
,


whine

pine
thing

wail
in
its
cradle
all
night
long

scream
heartily

any
other
child

whimpering

moaning

pity
it

use
to
nurse
it

it
as
if
it

be


his
own

more
,
indeed

than
he
ever
notice
his
own
at
that
age
.
he


would
try
to
make
my
child
friendly
to
the
little
beggar
:
the


darling
could
not
bear
it

he
be
angry
with
they
when
they
show


their
dislike

in
his
last
illness

have
it
bring
continually
to


his
bedside

an
hour
before
he
die

he
bind
I

vow

the

John

not

take
a
sedative
draught

succeed
with
difficulty

soon
after
,
Mrs.

grow
more
composed

sink
into
a
doze
state

I
then

More
than
ten
day
elapse
before
I
have
again
any
conversation
with


she
.
she
continue
either
delirious
or
lethargic
;
and
the
doctor


forbid
everything
which
could
painfully
excite
she
.
meantime
,
I
get
on


as
well
as
I
could
with
Georgiana
and
Eliza
.
they
be
very
cold
,


indeed
,
at
first
.
eliza
would
sit
half
the
day
sewing
,
reading
,
or


write
,
and
scarcely
utter
a
word
either
to
I
or
her
sister
.


Georgiana
would
chatter
nonsense
to
her
canary
bird
by
the
hour
,
and


take
no
notice
of
I
.
but
I
be
determined
not
to
seem
at
a
loss
for


occupation
or
amusement
:
I
have
bring
my
drawing
material
with
I
,


and
they
serve
I
for
both
.




provide
with
a
case
of
pencil
,
and
some
sheet
of
paper
,
I
use
to


take
a
seat
apart
from
they
,
near
the
window
,
and
busy
myself
in


sketch
fancy
vignette
,
represent
any
scene
that
happen


momentarily
to
shape
itself
in
the
ever
-
shift
kaleidoscope
of


imagination
:
a
glimpse
of
sea
between
two
rock
;
the
rise
moon
,
and
a


ship
cross
its
disk
;
a
group
of
reed
and
water
-
flag
,
and
a
naiad
’s


head
,
crown
with
lotus
-
flower
,
rise
out
of
they
;
an
elf
sit
in


a
hedge
-
sparrow
’s
nest
,
under
a
wreath
of
hawthorn
-
bloom
.




one
morning
I
fall
to
sketch
a
face
:
what
sort
of
a
face
it
be
to


be
,
I
do
not
care
or
know
.
I
take
a
soft
black
pencil
,
give
it
a
broad


point
,
and
work
away
.
soon
I
have
trace
on
the
paper
a
broad
and


prominent
forehead
and
a
square
low
outline
of
visage
:
that
contour


give
I
pleasure
;
my
finger
proceed
actively
to
fill
it
with


feature
.
strongly
-
mark
horizontal
eyebrow
must
be
trace
under
that


brow
;
then
follow
,
naturally
,
a
well
-
define
nose
,
with
a
straight


ridge
and
full
nostril
;
then
a
flexible
-
look
mouth
,
by
no
mean


narrow
;
then
a
firm
chin
,
with
a
decide
cleft
down
the
middle
of
it
:


of
course
,
some
black
whisker
be
want
,
and
some
jetty
hair
,
tufte


on
the
temple
,
and
wave
above
the
forehead
.
now
for
the
eye
:
I
have


leave
they
to
the
last
,
because
they
require
the
most
careful
working
.


I
draw
they
large
;
I
shape
they
well
:
the
eyelash
I
trace
long
and


sombre
;
the
irid
lustrous
and
large
.
"
good
!
but
not
quite
the
thing
,
"


I
think
,
as
I
survey
the
effect
:
"
they
want
more
force
and
spirit
;
"


and
I
work
the
shade
blacker
,
that
the
light
might
flash
more


brilliantly
—
a
happy
touch
or
two
secured
success
.
there
,
I
have
a


friend
’s
face
under
my
gaze
;
and
what
do
it
signify
that
those
young


lady
turn
their
back
on
I
?
I
look
at
it
;
I
smile
at
the


speak
likeness
:
I
be
absorb
and
content
.




"
be
that
a
portrait
of
some
one
you
know
?
"
ask
Eliza
,
who
have


approach
I
unnoticed
.
I
respond
that
it
be
merely
a
fancy
head
,


and
hurry
it
beneath
the
other
sheet
.
of
course
,
I
lie
:
it
be
,
in


fact
,
a
very
faithful
representation
of
Mr.
Rochester
.
but
what
be


that
to
she
,
or
to
any
one
but
myself
?
Georgiana
also
advance
to
look
.


the
other
drawing
please
she
much
,
but
she
call
that
"
an
ugly
man
.
"


they
both
seem
surprised
at
my
skill
.
I
offer
to
sketch
their


portrait
;
and
each
,
in
turn
,
sit
for
a
pencil
outline
.
then
Georgiana


produce
her
album
.
I
promise
to
contribute
a
water
-
colour
drawing
:


this
put
she
at
once
into
good
humour
.
she
propose
a
walk
in
the


ground
.
before
we
have
be
out
two
hour
,
we
be
deep
in
a


confidential
conversation
:
she
have
favour
I
with
a
description
of


the
brilliant
winter
she
have
spend
in
London
two
season
ago
—
of
the


admiration
she
have
there
excite
—
the
attention
she
have
receive
;
and
I


even
get
hint
of
the
title
conquest
she
have
make
.
in
the
course
of


the
afternoon
and
evening
these
hint
be
enlarge
on
:
various
soft


conversation
be
report
,
and
sentimental
scene
represent
;
and
,


in
short
,
a
volume
of
a
novel
of
fashionable
life
be
that
day


improvise
by
she
for
my
benefit
.
the
communication
be
renew
from


day
to
day
:
they
always
run
on
the
same
theme
—
herself
,
her
love
,
and


woe
.
it
be
strange
she
never
once
advert
either
to
her
mother
’s


illness
,
or
her
brother
’s
death
,
or
the
present
gloomy
state
of
the


family
prospect
.
her
mind
seem
wholly
take
up
with
reminiscence
of


past
gaiety
,
and
aspiration
after
dissipation
to
come
.
she
pass


about
five
minute
each
day
in
her
mother
’s
sick
-
room
,
and
no
more
.




Eliza
still
speak
little
:
she
have

I
never


see
a
busy
person
than
she
seem
to
be

yet
it
be
difficult
to
say


what
she
do
:
or
rather
,
to
discover
any
result
of
her
diligence

an
alarm
to
call
she
up
early

I
know
not
how
she
occupy
herself


before
breakfast
,
but
after
that
meal
she
divide
her
time
into
regular


portion
,
and
each
hour
have
its
allotted
task

three

a
day

a
little
book

I
find
,
on
inspection

be
a
Common


Prayer
Book

I
ask
she
once
what
be
the
great
attraction
of
that


volume
,

she
say
,

of

crimson
cloth

answer
to
my
inquiry
after
the
use
of

devote

herself
in
the
kitchen

garden

one
to
the


regulation
of
her
account

she
seem
to
want
no
company
;
no


conversation

I
believe
she
be
happy
in
her
way

this
routine
suffice


for
she

nothing
annoy
she
so
much
as
the
occurrence
of
any


incident
which
force
she
to
vary
its
clockwork
regularity

she
tell
I
one
evening
,

more
disposed
to
be
communicative
than


usual

that
John
’s
conduct
,

the
threaten
ruin
of
the
family

be
a
source
of
profound
affliction
to
she

she
have
now
,
she
say

settle
her
mind

form
her
resolution

her
own
fortune
she
have


take
care
to
secure
;
and
when
her
mother
die
—
and
it
be
wholly


improbable
,
she
tranquilly
remark
,

she
should
either
recover
or


linger
long

she
would
execute
a
long

cherish
project

seek
a


retirement
where
punctual
habit
would
be
permanently
secure
from


disturbance
,

place
safe
barrier

herself

frivolous

ask

about

you
!
"




when
we
part
,
she
say
:
"
good
-
bye
,
cousin
Jane
Eyre
;
I
wish
you
well
:


you
have
some
sense
.
"




I
then
return
:
"
you
be
not
without
sense
,
cousin
Eliza
;
but
what
you


have
,
I
suppose
,
in
another
year
will
be
wall
up
alive
in
a
french


convent
.
however
,
it
be
not
my
business
,
and
so
it
suit
you
,
I
do
n’t


much
care
.
"




"
you
be
in
the
right
,
"
say
she
;
and
with
these
word
we
each
go
our


separate
way
.
as
I
shall
not
have
occasion
to
refer
either
to
she
or


her
sister
again
,
I
may
as
well
mention
here
,
that
Georgiana
make
an


advantageous
match
with
a
wealthy
wear
-
out
man
of
fashion
,
and
that


Eliza
actually
take
the
veil
,
and
be
at
this
day
superior
of
the


convent
where
she
pass
the
period
of
her
novitiate
,
and
which
she


endow
with
her
fortune
.




how
people
feel
when
they
be
return
home
from
an
absence
,
long
or


short
,
I
do
not
know
:
I
have
never
experience
the
sensation
.
I
have


know
what
it
be
to
come
back
to
Gateshead
when
a
child
after
a
long


walk
,
to
be
scold
for
look
cold
or
gloomy
;
and
later
,
what
it
be


to
come
back
from
church
to
Lowood
,
to
long
for
a
plenteous
meal
and
a


good
fire
,
and
to
be
unable
to
get
either
.
neither
of
these
returning


be
very
pleasant
or
desirable
:
no
magnet
draw
I
to
a
give
point
,


increase
in
its
strength
of
attraction
the
nearer
I
come
.
the
return


to
Thornfield
be
yet
to
be
try
.




my
journey
seem
tedious
—
very
tedious
:
fifty
mile
one
day
,
a
night


spend
at
an
inn
;
fifty
mile
the
next
day
.
during
the
first
twelve


hour
I
think
of
Mrs.
Reed
in
her
last
moment
;
I
see
she
disfigure


and
discolour
face
,
and
hear
she
strangely
altered
voice
.
I
muse
on


the
funeral
day
,
the
coffin
,
the
hearse
,
the
black
train
of
tenant
and


servant
—
few
be
the
number
of
relative
—
the
gape
vault
,
the
silent


church
,
the
solemn
service
.
then
I
think
of
Eliza
and
Georgiana
;
I


beheld
one
the
cynosure
of
a
ball
-
room
,
the
other
the
inmate
of
a


convent
cell
;
and
I
dwell
on
and
analyse
their
separate
peculiarity


of
person
and
character
.
the
evening
arrival
at
the
great
town
of
—
—


scatter
these
thought
;
night
give
they
quite
another
turn
:
lay
down


on
my
traveller
’s
bed
,
I
leave
reminiscence
for
anticipation
.




I
be
go
back
to
Thornfield
:
but
how
long
be
I
to
stay
there
?
not


long
;
of
that
I
be
sure
.
I
have
hear
from
Mrs.
Fairfax
in
the
interim


of
my
absence
:
the
party
at
the
hall
be
disperse
;
Mr.
Rochester
have


leave
for
London
three
week
ago
,
but
he
be
then
expect
to
return
in


a
fortnight
.
Mrs.
Fairfax
surmise
that
he
be
go
to
make


arrangement
for
his
wedding
,
as
he
have
talk
of
purchase
a
new


carriage
:
she
say
the
idea
of
his
marrying
Miss
Ingram
still
seem


strange
to
she
;
but
from
what
everybody
say
,
and
from
what
she
have


herself
see
,
she
could
no
long
doubt
that
the
event
would
shortly


take
place
.
"
you
would
be
strangely
incredulous
if
you
do
doubt
it
,
"


be
my
mental
comment
.
"
I
do
n’t
doubt
it
.
"




the
question
follow
,
"
where
be
I
to
go
?
"
I
dream
of
Miss
Ingram
all


the
night
:
in
a
vivid
morning
dream
I
see
her
close
the
gate
of


thornfield
against
I
and
point
I
out
another
road
;
and
Mr.


Rochester
look
on
with
his
arm
fold
—
smile
sardonically
,
as
it


seem
,
at
both
she
and
I
.




I
have
not
notify
to
Mrs.
Fairfax
the
exact
day
of
my
return
;
for
I


do
not
wish
either
car
or
carriage
to
meet
I
at
Millcote
.
I
propose


to
walk
the
distance
quietly
by
myself
;
and
very
quietly
,
after
leave


my
box
in
the
ostler
’s
care
,
do
I
slip
away
from
the
George
Inn
,
about


six
o’clock
of
a
June
evening
,
and
take
the
old
road
to
Thornfield
:
a


road
which
lie
chiefly
through
field
,
and
be
now
little
frequented
.




it
be
not
a
bright
or
splendid
summer
evening
,
though
fair
and
soft
:


the
haymaker
be
at
work
all
along
the
road
;
and
the
sky
,
though
far


from
cloudless
,
be
such
as
promise
well
for
the
future
:
its


blue
—
where
blue
be
visible
—
be
mild
and
settle
,
and
its
cloud
strata


high
and
thin
.
the
west
,
too
,
be
warm
:
no
watery
gleam
chill
it
—
it


seem
as
if
there
be
a
fire
light
,
an
altar
burn
behind
its
screen


of
marbled
vapour
,
and
out
of
aperture
shine
a
golden
redness
.




I
feel
glad
as
the
road
shorten
before
I
:
so
glad
that
I
stop


once
to
ask
myself
what
that
joy
mean
:
and
to
remind
reason
that
it


be
not
to
my
home
I
be
go
,
or
to
a
permanent
resting
-
place
,
or
to


a
place
where
fond
friend
look
out
for
I
and
wait
my
arrival
.


"
Mrs.
Fairfax
will
smile
you
a
calm
welcome
,
to
be
sure
,
"
say
I
;
"
and


little
Adèle
will
clap
her
hand
and
jump
to
see
you
:
but
you
know
very


well
you
be
think
of
another
than
they
,
and
that
he
be
not
think


of
you
.
"




but
what
be
so
headstrong
as
youth
?
what
so
blind
as
inexperience
?


these
affirm
that
it
be
pleasure
enough
to
have
the
privilege
of


again
look
on
Mr.
Rochester
,
whether
he
look
on
I
or
not
;
and


they
added—“Hasten
!
hasten
!
be
with
he
while
you
may
:
but
a
few
more


day
or
week
,
at
most
,
and
you
be
parted
from
he
for
ever
!
"
and
then


I
strangle
a
new
-
bear
agony
—
a
deform
thing
which
I
could
not


persuade
myself
to
own
and
rear
—
and
run
on
.




they
be
make
hay
,
too
,
in
Thornfield
meadow
:
or
rather
,
the


labourer
be
just
quit
their
work
,
and
return
home
with
their


rake
on
their
shoulder
,
now
,
at
the
hour
I
arrive
.
I
have
but
a
field


or
two
to
traverse
,
and
then
I
shall
cross
the
road
and
reach
the


gate
.
how
full
the
hedge
be
of
rose
!
but
I
have
no
time
to
gather


any
;
I
want
to
be
at
the
house
.
I
pass
a
tall
briar
,
shoot
leafy


and
flowery
branch
across
the
path
;
I
see
the
narrow
stile
with
stone


step
;
and
I
see
—
Mr.
Rochester
sit
there
,
a
book
and
a
pencil
in


his
hand
;
he
be
write
.




well
,
he
be
not
a
ghost
;
yet
every
nerve
I
have
be
unstrung
:
for
a


moment
I
be
beyond
my
own
mastery
.
what
do
it
mean
?
I
do
not
think
I


should
tremble
in
this
way
when
I
see
he
,
or
lose
my
voice
or
the


power
of
motion
in
his
presence
.
I
will
go
back
as
soon
as
I
can
stir
:


I
need
not
make
an
absolute
fool
of
myself
.
I
know
another
way
to
the


house
.
it
do
not
signify
if
I
know
twenty
way
;
for
he
have
see
I
.




"
hillo
!
"
he
cry
;
and
he
put
up
his
book
and
his
pencil
.
"
there
you


be
!
come
on
,
if
you
please
.
"




I
suppose
I
do
come
on
;
though
in
what
fashion
I
know
not
;
be


scarcely
cognisant
of
my
movement
,
and
solicitous
only
to
appear
calm
;


and
,
above
all
,
to
control
the
work
muscle
of
my
face
—
which
I
feel


rebel
insolently
against
my
will
,
and
struggle
to
express
what
I
have


resolve
to
conceal
.
but
I
have
a
veil
—
it
be
down
:
I
may
make
shift
yet


to
behave
with
decent
composure

Jane
Eyre

come
from
Millcote
,
and
on
foot

yes

just
one
of
your
trick
:
not
to
send
for
a
carriage
,
and
come


clatter
over
street
and
road
like
a
common
mortal
,
but
to
steal
into


the
vicinage
of
your
home
along
with
twilight
,
just
as
if
you

a


dream

a
shade

there
would
be
pleasure
in

master

break
by
the
fear

he
be
so
soon

cease
to
be
my
master

by


the
knowledge

nothing

there
be
ever
in
Mr.


Rochester

so
at

I
think

such
a
wealth

the
power

communicate
happiness

Mr.
Rochester
have
sometimes
read
my
unspoken
thought
with
an
acuman
to


I
incomprehensible
:
in
the
present
instance
he
take
no
notice
of
my


abrupt
vocal
response
;
but
he
smile
at
I
with
a
certain
smile
he
have


of
his
own
,
and
which
he
use
but
on
rare
occasion
.
he
seem
to
think


it
too
good
for
common
purpose
:
it
be
the
real
sunshine
of
feeling
—
he


shed
it
over
I
now
.




"

little

"




all
I
have
now
to
do
be
to
obey
he
in
silence

no
need
for
I
to


colloquise
far
.
I
get
over
the
stile
without
a
word
,

mean
to


leave
he
calmly
.

impulse

I
fast

a
force

I
round

no

that

their

I
that
evening
shut
my
eye
resolutely
against
the
future

I
stop
my


ear
against
the
voice
that
keep
warn
I
of
near
separation
and


come
grief
.

tea
be
over
and
Mrs.
Fairfax
have
take
she


knitting
,

I
have
assume
a
low
seat
near

on


the
carpet

nestle
close
up

a
sense
of
mutual
affection


seem
to
surround
we
with
a
ring
of
golden
peace
,
I
utter
a
silent


prayer
that
we
might
not
be
part
far
or
soon
;
but
when
,
as
we
thus


sit
,
Mr.
Rochester
enter
,
unannounced
,
and
look
at
we
,
seem
to


take
pleasure
in
the
spectacle
of
a
group
so
amicable
—
when
he
say
he


suppose
the
old
lady
be
all
right
now
that
she
have
get
she
adopt


daughter
back
again
,
and
add
that
he
see
Adèle
be
"
prête

petite
maman

half
venture
to
hope
that
he
would
,
even


after
his
marriage
,
keep
we
together
somewhere
under
the
shelter
of
his


protection
,
and
not
quite
exile
from
the
sunshine
of
his
presence
.




a
fortnight
of
dubious
calm
succeed
my
return
to
Thornfield
Hall
.


nothing
be
say
of
the
master
’s
marriage
,
and
I
see
no
preparation


go
on
for
such
an
event
.
almost
every
day
I
ask
Mrs.
Fairfax
if


she
have
yet
hear
anything
decide
:
her
answer
be
always
in
the


negative
.
once
she
say
she
have
actually
put
the
question
to
Mr.


rochester
as
to
when
he
be
go
to
bring
his
bride
home
;
but
he
have


answer
she
only
by
a
joke
and
one
of
his
queer
look
,
and
she
could


not
tell
what
to
make
of
he
.




one
thing
specially
surprise
I
,
and
that
be
,
there
be
no


journeying
backward
and
forward
,
no
visit
to
Ingram
Park
:
to
be
sure


it
be
twenty
mile
off
,
on
the
border
of
another
county
;
but
what
be


that
distance
to
an
ardent
lover
?
to
so
practise
and
indefatigable
a


horseman
as
Mr.
Rochester
,
it
would
be
but
a
morning
’s
ride
.
I
begin
to


cherish
hope
I
have
no
right
to
conceive
:
that
the
match
be
break


off
;
that
rumour
have
be
mistaken
;
that
one
or
both
party
have


change
their
mind
.
I
use
to
look
at
my
master
’s
face
to
see
if
it


be
sad
or
fierce
;
but
I
could
not
remember
the
time
when
it
have
be


so
uniformly
clear
of
cloud
or
evil
feeling
.
if
,
in
the
moment
I
and


my
pupil
spend
with
he
,
I
lack
spirit
and
sink
into
inevitable


dejection
,
he
become
even
gay
.
never
have
he
call
I
more
frequently


to
his
presence
;
never
be
kind
to
I
when
there
—
and
,
alas
!
never


have
I
love
he
so
well
.

XXIII






a
splendid
Midsummer
shine
over
England
:
sky
so
pure
,
sun
so
radiant


as
be
then
see
in
long
succession
,
seldom
favour
even
singly
,
our


wave
-
girt
land
.
it
be
as
if
a
band
of
italian
day
have
come
from
the


south
,
like
a
flock
of
glorious
passenger
bird
,
and
light
to
rest


they
on
the
cliff
of
Albion
.
the
hay
be
all
get
in
;
the
field
round


Thornfield
be
green
and
shorn
;
the
road
white
and
baked
;
the
tree


be
in
their
dark
prime
;
hedge
and
wood
,
full
-
leaved
and
deeply


tint
,
contrast
well
with
the
sunny
hue
of
the
clear
meadow


between
.




on
Midsummer
-
eve
,
Adèle
,
weary
with
gather
wild
strawberry
in
Hay


lane
half
the
day
,
have
go
to
bed
with
the
sun
.
I
watch
her
drop


asleep
,
and
when
I
leave
she
,
I
seek
the
garden
.




it
be
now
the
sweetest
hour
of
the
twenty
-
four:—“Day
its
fervid
fire


have
waste
,
"
and
dew
fall
cool
on
pant
plain
and
scorch
summit
.


where
the
sun
have
go
down
in
simple
state
—
pure
of
the
pomp
of


cloud
—
spread
a
solemn
purple
,
burn
with
the
light
of
red
jewel
and


furnace
flame
at
one
point
,
on
one
hill
-
peak
,
and
extend
high
and


wide
,
soft
and
still
soft
,
over
half
heaven
.
the
east
have
its
own


charm
or
fine
deep
blue
,
and
its
own
modest
gem
,
a
rise
and
solitary


star
:
soon
it
would
boast
the
moon
;
but
she
be
yet
beneath
the


horizon
.




I
walk
a
while
on
the
pavement
;
but
a
subtle
,
well
-
know
scent
—
that


of
a
cigar
—
steal
from
some
window
;
I
see
the
library
casement
open
a


handbreadth
;
I
know
I
might
be
watch
thence
;
so
I
go
apart
into
the


orchard
.
no
nook
in
the
ground
more
sheltered
and
more
Eden
-
like
;
it


be
full
of
tree
,
it
bloom
with
flower
:
a
very
high
wall
shut
it


out
from
the
court
,
on
one
side
;
on
the
other
,
a
beech
avenue
screen


it
from
the
lawn
.
at
the
bottom
be
a
sunk
fence
;
its
sole
separation


from
lonely
field
:
a
winding
walk
,
border
with
laurel
and


terminate
in
a
giant
horse
-
chestnut
,
circle
at
the
base
by
a
seat
,


lead
down
to
the
fence
.
here
one
could
wander
unseen
.
while
such


honey
-
dew
fall
,
such
silence
reign
,
such
gloaming
gather
,
I
feel
as


if
I
could
haunt
such
shade
for
ever
;
but
in
thread
the
flower
and


fruit
parterre
at
the
upper
part
of
the
enclosure
,
entice
there
by


the
light
the
now
rise
moon
cast
on
this
more
open
quarter
,
my
step


be
stay
—
not
by
sound
,
not
by
sight
,
but
once
more
by
a
warning


fragrance
.




sweet
-
briar
and
southernwood
,
jasmine
,
pink
,
and
rise
have
long
be


yield
their
evening
sacrifice
of
incense
:
this
new
scent
be
neither


of
shrub
nor
flower
;
it
be
—
I
know
it
well
—
it
be
Mr.
Rochester
’s
cigar
.


I
look
round
and
I
listen
.
I
see
tree
laden
with
ripen
fruit
.
I


hear
a
nightingale
warbling
in
a
wood
half
a
mile
off
;
no
move
form


be
visible
,
no
come
step
audible
;
but
that
perfume
increase
:
I
must


flee
.
I
make
for
the
wicket
lead
to
the
shrubbery
,
and
I
see
Mr.


Rochester
entering
.
I
step
aside
into
the
ivy
recess
;
he
will
not
stay


long
:
he
will
soon
return
whence
he
come
,
and
if
I
sit
still
he
will


never
see
I
.




but
no
—
eventide
be
as
pleasant
to
he
as
to
I
,
and
this
antique
garden


as
attractive
;
and
he
stroll
on
,
now
lift
the
gooseberry
-
tree


branch
to
look
at
the
fruit
,
large
as
plum
,
with
which
they
be


laden
;
now
take
a
ripe
cherry
from
the
wall
;
now
stoop
towards
a


knot
of
flower
,
either
to
inhale
their
fragrance
or
to
admire
the


dew
-
bead
on
their
petal
.
a
great
moth
go
hum
by
I
;
it
alight


on
a
plant
at
Mr.
Rochester
’s
foot
:
he
see
it
,
and
bend
to
examine


it
.




"
now
,
he
have
his
back
towards
I
,
"
think
I
,
"
and
he
be
occupy
too
;


perhaps
,
if
I
walk
softly
,
I
can
slip
away
unnoticed
.
"




I
trode
on
an
edging
of
turf
that
the
crackle
of
the
pebbly
gravel


might
not
betray
I
:
he
be
stand
among
the
bed
at
a
yard
or
two


distant
from
where
I
have
to
pass
;
the
moth
apparently
engage
he
.
"
I


shall
get
by
very
well
,
"
I
meditate
.
as
I
cross
his
shadow
,
throw


long
over
the
garden
by
the
moon
,
not
yet
rise
high
,
he
say
quietly
,


without
turn
—




"
jane
,
come
and
look
at
this
fellow
.
"




I
have
make
no
noise
:
he
have
not
eye
behind
—
could
his
shadow
feel
?
I


start
at
first
,
and
then
I
approach
he
.




"
look
at
his
wing
,
"
say
he
,
"
he
remind
I
rather
of
a
West
indian


insect
;
one
do
not
often
see
so
large
and
gay
a
night
-
rover
in


England
;
there
!
he
be
fly
.
"




the
moth
roam
away
.
I
be
sheepishly
retreat
also
;
but
Mr.


Rochester
follow
I
,
and
when
we
reach
the
wicket
,
he

still
,

I
reach
my

at
the

should
even


temporarily
misconstrue
what
she
have

joy
soon
efface

loud

deep
as

fierce

Mr.

come
thrice
to
my
door
in
the
course


of
it
,
to
ask
if
I
be
safe
and
tranquil

that
be
comfort
,

be

for

before
I
leave
my
bed
in
the
morning
,
little
Adèle
came
run
in
to


tell
I
that

great
horse

chestnut

the
bottom
of

XXIV






as
I
rise
and
dress
,
I
think
over
what
have
happen
,
and
wonder


if
it
be
a
dream
.
I
could
not
be
certain
of
the
reality
till
I
have


see
Mr.
Rochester
again
,
and
hear
he
renew
his
word
of
love
and


promise
.




while
arrange
my
hair
,
I
look
at
my
face
in
the
glass
,
and
feel
it


be
no
long
plain
:
there
be
hope
in
its
aspect
and
life
in
its


colour
;
and
my
eye
seem
as
if
they
have
behold
the
fount
of
fruition
,


and
borrow
beam
from
the
lustrous
ripple
.
I
have
often
be
unwilling


to
look
at
my
master
,
because
I
fear
he
could
not
be
pleased
at
my


look
;
but
I
be
sure
I
might
lift
my
face
to
his
now
,
and
not
cool
his


affection
by
its
expression
.
I
take
a
plain
but
clean
and
light
summer


dress
from
my
drawer
and
put
it
on
:
it
seem
no
attire

ever
so


well
become
I
,
because
none
have
I
ever
wear
in
so
blissful
a
mood
.




I
be
not
surprised
,
when
I
run
down
into
the
hall
,
to
see
that
a


brilliant
June
morning
have
succeed
to
the
temp
of
the
night
;
and


to
feel
,
through
the
open
glass
door
,
the
breathing
of
a
fresh
and


fragrant
breeze

must
be
gladsome

I

happy

down

excited
mood
which
hurry
I


forth
at
this
late
hour
into
the
darkening
ground
:
but
a
third
cause


influence
my
mind
more
than
they
.




I
have
at
heart
a
strange
and
anxious
thought
.
something
have
happen


which
I
could
not
comprehend
;
no
one
know
of
or
have
see
the
event
but


myself
:
it
have
take
place
the
precede
night
.
Mr.
Rochester
that


night
be
absent
from
home
;
nor
be
he
yet
return
:
business
have


call
he
to
a
small
estate
of
two
or
three
farm
he
possess
thirty


mile
off
—
business
it
be
requisite
he
should
settle
in
person
,


previous
to
his
meditate
departure
from
England
.
I
wait
now
his


return
;
eager
to
disburthen
my
mind
,
and
to
seek
of
he
the
solution
of


the
enigma
that
perplex
I
.
stay
till
he
come
,
reader
;
and
,
when
I


disclose
my
secret
to
he
,
you
shall
share
the
confidence
.




I
seek
the
orchard
,
drive
to
its
shelter
by
the
wind
,
which
all
day


have
blow
strong
and
full
from
the
south
,
without
,
however
,
bring
a


speck
of
rain
.
instead
of
subsiding
as
night
draw
on
,
it
seem
to


augment
its
rush
and
deepen
its
roar
:
the
tree
blow
steadfastly
one


way
,
never
writhe
round
,
and
scarcely
toss
back
their
bough
once


in
an
hour
;
so
continuous
be
the
strain
bend
their
branchy
head


northward
—
the
cloud
drift
from
pole
to
pole
,
fast
following
,
mass
on


mass
:
no
glimpse
of
blue
sky
have
be
visible
that
July
day
.




it
be
not
without
a
certain
wild
pleasure
I
run
before
the
wind
,


deliver
my
trouble
of
mind
to
the
measureless
air
-
torrent
thunder


through
space
.
descend
the
laurel
walk
,
I
face
the
wreck
of
the


chestnut
-
tree
;
it
stand
up
black
and
riven
:
the
trunk
,
split
down
the


centre
,
gasp
ghastly
.
the
cloven
half
be
not
break
from
each


other
,
for
the
firm
base
and
strong
root
keep
they
unsundered
below
;


though
community
of
vitality
be
destroy
—
the
sap
could
flow
no
more
:


their
great
bough
on
each
side
be
dead
,
and
next
winter
’s
tempest


would
be
sure
to
fell
one
or
both
to
earth
:
as
yet
,
however
,
they
might


be
say
to
form
one
tree
—
a
ruin
,
but
an
entire
ruin
.




"
you
do
right
to
hold
fast
to
each
other
,
"
I
say
:
as
if
the


monster
-
splinter
be
live
thing
,
and
could
hear
I
.
"
I
think
,


scathe
as
you
look
,
and
char
and
scorch
,
there
must
be
a
little


sense
of
life
in
you
yet
,
rise
out
of
that
adhesion
at
the
faithful
,


honest
root
:
you
will
never
have
green
leave
more
—
never
more
see


bird
make
nest
and
singing
idyls
in
your
bough
;
the
time
of


pleasure
and
love
be
over
with
you
:
but
you
be
not
desolate
:
each
of


you
have
a
comrade
to
sympathise
with
he
in
his
decay
.
"
as
I
look
up


at
they
,
the
moon
appear
momentarily
in
that
part
of
the
sky
which


fill
their
fissure
;
her
disk
be
blood
-
red
and
half
overcast
;
she


seem
to
throw
on
I
one
bewildered
,
dreary
glance
,
and
bury
herself


again
instantly
in
the
deep
drift
of
cloud
.
the
wind
fall
,
for
a


second
,
round
Thornfield
;
but
far
away
over
wood
and
water
,
pour
a


wild
,
melancholy
wail
:
it
be
sad
to
listen
to
,
and
I
run
off
again
.




here
and
there
I
stray
through
the
orchard
,
gather
up
the
apple


with
which
the
grass
round
the
tree
root
be
thickly
strew
;
then
I


employ
myself
in
divide
the
ripe
from
the
unripe
;
I
carry
they


into
the
house
and
put
they
away
in
the
store
-
room
.
then
I
repair
to


the
library
to
ascertain
whether
the
fire
be
light
,
for
,
though
summer
,


I
know
on
such
a
gloomy
evening
Mr.
Rochester
would
like
to
see
a


cheerful
hearth
when
he
come
in
:
yes
,
the
fire
have
be
kindle
some


time
,
and
burn
well
.
I
place
his
arm
-
chair
by
the
chimney
-
corner
:
I


wheel
the
table
near
it
:
I
let
down
the
curtain
,
and
have
the
candle


bring
in
ready
for
lighting
.
More
restless
than
ever
,
when
I
have


complete
these
arrangement
I
could
not
sit
still
,
nor
even
remain
in


the
house
:
a
little
time
-
piece
in
the
room
and
the
old
clock
in
the


hall
simultaneously
strike
ten
.




"
how
late
it
grow
!
"
I
say
.
"
I
will
run
down
to
the
gate
:
it
be


moonlight
at
interval
;
I
can
see
a
good
way
on
the
road
.
he
may
be


come
now
,
and
to
meet
he
will
save
some
minute
of
suspense
.
"




the
wind
roar
high
in
the
great
tree
which
embower
the
gate
;
but


the
road
as
far
as
I
could
see
,
to
the
right
hand
and
the
left
,
be
all


still
and
solitary
:
save
for
the
shadow
of
cloud
cross
it
at


interval
as
the
moon
look
out
,
it
be
but
a
long
pale
line
,
unvaried


by
one
move
speck
.




a
puerile
tear
dim
my
eye
while
I
look
—
a
tear
of
disappointment


and
impatience
;
ashamed
of
it
,
I
wipe
it
away
.
I
linger
;
the
moon


shut
herself
wholly
within
her
chamber
,
and
drew
close
her
curtain
of


dense
cloud
:
the
night
grow
dark
;
rain
came
drive
fast
on
the
gale
.




"
I
wish
he
would
come
!
I

he
would
come
!
"
I
exclaim
,
seize
with


hypochondriac
forebode
.
I
have
expect
his
arrival
before
tea
;
now
it


be
dark
:
what
could
keep
he
?
have
an
accident
happen
?
the
event
of


last
night
again
recur
to
I
.
I
interpret
it
as
a
warning
of


disaster
.
I
fear
my
hope
be
too
bright
to
be
realise
;
and
I
have


enjoy
so
much
bliss
lately
that
I
imagine
my
fortune
have
pass
its


meridian
,
and
must
now
decline
.




"

set
out

fast
,

not
far

ere
I
have
measure
a
quarter
of


a
mile
,
I
hear
the
tramp
of
hoofs

horseman
come
on

full
gallop
;
a


dog
run
by

evil
presentiment

open

field

watery
bright

take


his
hat
off
,

wave
it
round
his
head
.
I
now
run
to
meet
he
.




"

exclaim
,

stretch
out
his

bend
from

life

an
existence
more
expansive

stirring

much
more
so

the
depth
of

sea

which
the
brook
run


be
than
the
shallow
of
its
own
strait
channel

wonder

moralist
call
this
world
a
dreary
wilderness

I
it

cloudy

upstairs

at
my

dress

they

just
bring

under
it

box
I
find
your

,

princely
extravagance

you
send
for

I
would
not

jewel

cheat
I
into


accept
something
as
costly
.
I
smile
as
I
unfold
it
,

devise


how
I
would
tease
you
about
your
aristocratic
taste
,

your
effort


to
masque
your
plebeian
bride

the

down

myself

kiss
she
as
I
loosen
her
little
hand
from
my
neck
;
and
I
cry


over
she
with
strange
emotion
,
and
quit
she
because
I
fear
my
sobs


would
break
she
still
sound
repose
.
she
seem
the
emblem
of
my
past


life
;
and
he
,
I
be
now
to
array
myself
to
meet
,
the
dread
,

adore
,


type
of
my
unknown
future
day

Sophie
come
at
seven
to
dress
I
:
she
be
very
long
indeed
in


accomplish
her
task
;
so
long
that
Mr.
Rochester
,
grow
,
I
suppose
,


impatient
of
my
delay
,
send
up
to
ask
why
I
do
not
come
.
she
be
just


fasten
my
veil
(
the
plain
square
of
blond
after
all
)
to
my
hair
with


a
brooch
;
I
hurry
from
under
her
hand
as
soon
as
I
could

"




so
I
turn
at
the
door
:
I
see
a
robed
and
veiled
figure
,
so
unlike
my


usual
self
that
it
seem
almost
the
image
of
a
stranger
.
"

a
voice
,
and
I
hasten
down

I
be

"

he
say
,

none
but
Mr.
Rochester
and
I.
Mrs.
Fairfax
stand
in
the


hall
as
we
pass
.
I
would
fain
have
speak
to
she
,
but
my
hand
be


hold
by
a
grasp
of
iron
:
I
be
hurry
along
by
a
stride
I
could
hardly


follow
;
and
to
look
at
Mr.
Rochester
’s
face
be
to
feel
that
not
a


second
of
delay
would
be
tolerate
for
any
purpose
.
I
wonder
what
other


bridegroom
ever
look
as
he
do
—
so
bent
up
to
a
purpose
,
so
grimly


resolute
:
or
who
,
under
such
steadfast
brow
,
ever
reveal
such


flame
and
flash
eye
.




I
know
not
whether
the
day
be
fair
or
foul
;
in
descend
the
drive
,
I


gaze
neither
on
sky
nor
earth
:
my
heart
be
with
my
eye
;
and
both


seemed
migrate
into
Mr.
Rochester
’s
frame
.
I
want
to
see
the


invisible
thing
on
which
,
as
we
go
along
,
he
appear
to
fasten
a


glance
fierce
and
fall
.
I
want
to
feel
the
thought
whose
force
he


seem
breast
and
resist
.




at
the
churchyard
wicket
he
stop
:
he
discover
I
be
quite
out
of


breath
.
"
be
I
cruel
in
my
love

"
he
say
.
"
delay
an
instant
:
lean
on


I
,
Jane
.
"




and
now
I
can
recall
the
picture
of
the
grey
old
house
of
God
rise


calm
before
I
,
of
a
rook
wheel
round
the
steeple
,
of
a
ruddy


morning
sky
beyond
.
I
remember
something
,
too
,
of
the
green


grave
-
mound
;
and
I
have
not
forget
,
either
,
two
figure
of


stranger
stray
amongst
the
low
hillock
and
read
the
memento


graven
on
the
few
mossy
head
-
stone
.
I
notice
they
,
because
,
as
they


see
we
,
they
pass
round
to
the
back
of
the
church
;
and
I
doubt
not


they
be
go
to
enter
by
the
side
-
aisle
door
and
witness
the


ceremony
.
by
Mr.
Rochester
they
be
not
observe
;
he
be
earnestly


look
at
my
face
,
from
which
the
blood
have
,
I
daresay
,
momentarily


flee
:
for
I
feel
my
forehead
dewy
,
and
my
cheek
and
lip
cold
.
when
I


rally
,
which
I
soon
do
,
he
walk
gently
with
I
up
the
path
to
the


porch
.




we
enter
the
quiet
and
humble
temple
;
the
priest
wait
in
his
white


surplice
at
the
lowly
altar
,
the
clerk
beside
he
.
all
be
still
:
two


shadow
only
move
in
a
remote
corner
.
my
conjecture
have
be
correct
:


the
stranger
have
slip
in
before
we
,
and
they
now
stand
by
the
vault


of
the
Rochesters
,
their
back
towards
we
,
view
through
the
rail


the
old
time

a
cautious
step


behind

I
glance
over
my
shoulder

stranger

through
;
and
then


the
clergyman
come
a
step
far
forward
,
and
,
bend
slightly


towards
Mr.
Rochester
,
go
on
.




"

your

be
sorry
to

,
be
now
on
a
sick
bed
;
from
which
,
consider
the
nature
of
his


disease
—
decline
—
and
the
stage
it
have
reach
,

ever

would


advise
you
to

back

as
it
be

think
you
have


well
remain
in
England
till
you
can
hear
far
,

from

they
make
their
exit
at
the
hall

the


clergyman
stay
to
exchange
a
few
sentence

either
of
admonition

reproof

his
haughty
parishioner

duty
do
,
he

depart

I
hear
he
go

I
stand
at
the
half

I

now
withdraw

shut
myself
in

fasten
the
bolt

not

calm

off

drop
on

be
a
quiet
morning
enough

the
brief
scene


with
the
lunatic
:
the
transaction
in
the
church
have
not

noisy
;


there
be
no
explosion
of

,
no
loud
altercation
,
no
dispute
,
no


defiance
or
challenge
,
no
tear
,
no

:
a
few
word
have
be
speak
,


a
calmly
pronounce
objection
to
the
marriage
make

by

proof

intruder

all


be
over

I
be
in
my
own
room
as
usual
—
just
myself
,
without
obvious
change
:


nothing
have
smite
I
,

scathe
I
,

pale

full
of
flower
,

wood

wave
leafy

fragrant
as

between
the
tropic
,
now
spread
,
waste
,
wild
,
and


white
as
pine
-
forest
in
wintry
Norway
.
my
hope
be
all
dead
—
strike


with
a
subtle
doom
,
such
as
,
in
one
night
,
fall
on
all
the

in
the

my
cherish

so


bloom
and
glow
;
they
lie
stark
,
chill
,
livid
corpse
that
could


never
revive
.
I
look
at
my
love
:
that
feeling
which
be
my


master’s
—
which
he
have
create
;
it
shiver
in
my
heart

like
a


suffer
child
in
a
cold
cradle
;
sickness
and
anguish
have
seize
it
;

not
seek
Mr.
Rochester
’s
arm
—
it
could
not
derive
warmth
from


his
breast
.
oh
,
never
more
could
it
turn
to
he
;
for
faith
be


blight
—
confidence
destroy
!
Mr.
Rochester
be
not
to
I
what
he
have


be
;
for
he
be
not
what
I
have
think
he
.
I
would
not
ascribe
vice


to
he
;
I
would
not
say
he
have
betray
I
;
but
the
attribute
of


stainless
truth
be
go
from
his
idea
,
and
from
his
presence

must


go

perceive
well
.
when
—
how
—

,
I
could
not
yet
discern

he
himself
,

not

hurry
I
from

only
fitful

would
want

no

fear
even


to

his

something
that

no

some
time
in
the
afternoon
I
raise
my
head
,
and
look
round
and


see
the
western
sun

the

its

the
answer

gave—“leave

so
prompt
,


so
dread
,
that
I
stop
my

a
horror

that

voice
within
I
aver
that
I
could
do
it

foretold


that
I
should
do
it

I
wrestle
with
my
own
resolution
:
I
want
to
be


weak
that
I
might
avoid
the
awful
passage

further
suffering

slough

unsounded
depth

up

at
the
solitude

out

stumble
over
an
obstacle

still


dizzy

my
sight
be
dim

feeble

could
not
soon


recover
myself

I
fall
,

not
on

outstretched

look
up

atom
of
your
flesh

to
I

in
pain

sickness
it
would
still
be


dear
.
your
mind

my
treasure

if

you

a


strait
waistcoat

your
grasp

in
fury
,

have
a
charm
for

this

receive
you
in
an
embrace
,
at

as
fond
as
it
would
be
restrictive
.


I
should
not
shrink
from
you
with
disgust
as
I
do
from
she

in
your


quiet
moment
you
should
have
no
watcher
and
no
nurse
but
I
;
and
I


could
hang
over
you
with
untiring
tenderness
,
though
you
give
I
no


smile
in
return
;
and
never
weary
of
gaze
into
your
eye
,
though
they


have
no
long
a
ray
of
recognition
for
me.—But

be
a

dissent

influence

support


I

crisis
be
perilous
;

not
without
its
charm

such

the


indian
,
perhaps
,
feel
when
he
slip
over
the
rapid

take
hold

the

to
he

soothingly
—

tell
I
Miss

the
boast


of
Spanish
Town
for
her
beauty

a

no

,

,

,
and
the


air
grow
pure
.
I
then
frame
and
fix
a
resolution
.
while
I
walk


under
the
dripping
orange
-
tree
of
my
wet
garden
,
and
amongst
its


drench
pomegranate
and
pine
-
apple
,
and
while
the
refulgent
dawn
of


the
tropic
kindle
round
I
—
I
reason
thus
,
Jane
—
and
now
listen
;
for


it
be
true
wisdom
that
console
I
in
that
hour
,
and
show
I
the


right
path
to
follow
.




"
the
sweet
wind
from
Europe
be
still
whisper
in
the
refresh


leave
,
and
the
Atlantic
be
thunder
in
glorious
liberty
;
my
heart
,


dry
up
and
scorch
for
a
long
time
,
swell
to
the
tone
,
and
fill


with
live
blood
—
my
be
long
for
renewal
—
my
soul
thirst
for
a


pure
draught
.
I
see
hope
revive
—
and
feel
regeneration
possible
.
from
a


flowery
arch
at
the
bottom
of
my
garden
I
gaze
over
the
sea
—
bluer
than


the
sky
:
the
old
world
be
beyond
;
clear
prospect
open
thus
:
—




"
'
go
,

Hope
,
'
and
live
again
in
Europe
:
there
it
be
not
know
what


a
sullied
name
you
bear
,
nor
what
a
filthy
burden
be
bind
to
you
.
you


may
take
the
maniac
with
you
to
England
;
confine
she
with
due


attendance
and
precaution
at
Thornfield
:
then
travel
yourself
to
what


clime
you
will
,
and
form
what
new
tie
you
like
.
that
woman
,
who
have
so


abuse
your
long

suffering
,
so
sully
your
name
,
so

your

,
so
blight
your
youth
,
be
not
your

nor
be
you
she


husband
.
see
that
she
be
care
for
as
her
condition
demand
,
and
you


have
do
all
that
God
and
humanity
require
of
you
.
let
her
identity
,


her
connection
with
yourself
,
be
bury
in
oblivion
:
you
be
bind
to


impart
they

no

place
she
in
safety
and
comfort

shelter
her
degradation
with
secrecy
,
and
leave
she
.
'




"
I
act
precisely
on
this
suggestion
.
my
father
and
brother
have
not


make
my
marriage
know
to
their
acquaintance
;
because
,
in
the
very


first
letter
I
write
to
apprise
they
of
the
union
—
having
already
begin


to
experience
extreme
disgust
of
its
consequence
,
and
,
from
the
family


character
and
constitution
,
see
a
hideous
future
opening
to
I
—
I


add
an
urgent
charge
to
keep
it
secret
:
and
very
soon
the
infamous


conduct
of
the
wife
my
father
have
select
for
I
be
such
as
to
make


he
blush
to
own
she
as
his
daughter
-
in
-
law
.
far
from
desire
to


publish
the
connection
,
he
become
as
anxious
to
conceal
it
as
myself
.




"
to
England
,
then
,
I
convey
she
;
a
fearful
voyage
I
have
with
such
a


monster
in
the
vessel
.
Glad
be
I
when
I
at
last
get
she
to
Thornfield
,


and
see
she
safely
lodge
in
that
third
-
storey
room
,
of
whose
secret


inner
cabinet
she
have
now
for
ten
year
make
a
wild
beast
’s
den
—
a


goblin
’s
cell
.
I
have
some
trouble
in
find
an
attendant
for
she
,
as


it
be
necessary
to
select
one
on
whose
fidelity
dependence
could
be


place
;
for
her
raving
would
inevitably
betray
my
secret
:
besides
,
she


have
lucid
interval
of
day
—
sometimes
week
—
which
she
fill
up
with


abuse
of
I
.
at
last
I
hire
Grace
Poole
from
the
Grimbsy
Retreat
.
she


and
the
surgeon
,
Carter
(
who
dress
Mason
’s
wound
that
night
he
be


stab
and
worried
)
,
be
the
only
two
I
have
ever
admit
to
my


confidence
.
Mrs.
Fairfax
may
indeed
have
suspect
something
,
but
she


could
have
gain
no
precise
knowledge
as
to
fact
.
grace
have
,
on
the


whole
,
prove
a
good
keeper
;
though
,
owe
partly
to
a
fault
of
she


own
,
of
which
it
appear
nothing
can
cure
she
,
and
which
be
incident
to


her
harass
profession
,
her
vigilance
have
be
more
than
once
lull


and
baffle
.
the
lunatic
be
both
cunning
and
malignant
;
she
have
never


fail
to
take
advantage
of
her
guardian
’s
temporary
lapse
;
once
to


secrete
the
knife
with
which
she
stab
her
brother
,
and
twice
to


possess
herself
of
the
key
of
her
cell
,
and
issue
therefrom
in
the


night
-
time
.
on
the
first
of
these
occasion
,
she
perpetrate
the


attempt
to
burn
I
in
my
bed
;
on
the
second
,
she
pay
that
ghastly


visit
to
you
.
I
thank
Providence
,
who
watch
over
you
,
that
she
then


spend
her
fury
on
your
wedding
apparel
,
which
perhaps
bring
back


vague
reminiscence
of
her
own
bridal
day
:
but
on
what
might
have


happen
,
I
can
not
endure
to
reflect
.
when
I
think
of
the
thing
which


fly
at
my
throat
this
morning
,
hang
its
black
and
scarlet
visage


over
the
nest
of
my
dove
,
my
blood
curdle
—
"

what
,

I
ask
,

pause

wandering

wild

seek
the
continent

devious

intelligent

find
any

what

be
yet
to
be
record
in
the
book
of


fate
.
for
ten
long
year
I
rove
about
,
live
first
in
one
capital
,


then
another
:
sometimes
in
St.
Petersburg
;
oftener
in
Paris
;


occasionally
in
Rome
,
Naples
,
and
Florence
.
provide
with
plenty
of


money
and
the
passport
of
an
old
name
,
I
could
choose
my
own
society
:


no
circle
be
close
against
I
.
I
seek
my
ideal
of
a
woman
amongst


english
lady
,
french
countess
,
italian
signora
,
and
german


gräfinnen
.
I
could
not
find
she
.
sometimes
,
for
a
fleeting
moment
,
I


think
I
catch
a
glance
,
hear
a
tone
,
beheld
a
form
,
which
announce


the
realisation
of
my
dream
:
but
I
be
presently
undeceived
.
you
be


not
to
suppose
that
I
desire
perfection
,
either
of
mind
or
person
.
I


long
only
for
what
suit
I
—
for
the
antipode
of
the
Creole
:
and
I


long
vainly
.
amongst
they
all
I
find
not
one
whom
,
have
I
be
ever


so
free
,
I
—
warn
as
I
be
of
the
risk
,
the
horror
,
the
loathing
of


incongruous
union
—
would
have
ask
to
marry
I
.
disappointment
make
I


reckless
.
I
try
dissipation
—
never
debauchery
:
that
I
hate
,
and
hate
.


that
be
my
Indian
Messalina
’s
attribute
:
rooted
disgust
at
it
and
she


restrain
I
much
,
even
in
pleasure
.
any
enjoyment
that
border
on


riot
seem
to
approach
I
to
she
and
her
vice
,
and
I
eschew
it
.




"
yet
I
could
not
live
alone
;
so
I
try
the
companionship
of


mistress
.
the
first
I
choose
be
Céline
Varens
—
another
of
those
step


which
make
a
man
spurn
himself
when
he
recall
they
.
you
already
know


what
she
be
,
and
how
my
liaison
with
her
terminate
.
she
have
two


successor
:
an
Italian
,
Giacinta
,
and
a
german
,
Clara
;
both
consider


singularly
handsome
.
what
be
their
beauty
to
I
in
a
few
week
?


Giacinta
be
unprincipled
and
violent
:
I
tired
of
she
in
three
month
.


Clara
be
honest
and
quiet
;
but
heavy
,
mindless
,
and
unimpressible
:
not


one
whit
to
my
taste
.
I
be
glad
to
give
she
a
sufficient
sum
to
set


she
up
in
a
good
line
of
business
,
and
so
get
decently
rid
of
she
.
but
,


Jane
,
I
see
by
your
face
you
be
not
form
a
very
favourable
opinion


of
I
just
now
.
you
think
I
an
unfeeling
,
loose

principle
rake

n’t


you

do
n’t

you
so
well
as
I
have
do
sometimes

indeed

sir

do
it


not
seem
to
you
in
the
least
wrong
to
live
in
that
way
,
first
with
one


mistress
and
then
another

you
talk

it

a
mere
matter

"
it
be
with
I
;
and
I
do
not
like
it
.
it
be
a
grovelling
fashion
of


existence
:
I
should
never
like
to
return
to
it
.
hire
a
mistress
be


the
next
bad
thing
to
buy
a
slave
:
both
be
often
by
nature
,
and


always
by
position
,
inferior
:
and
to
live
familiarly
with
inferior
be


degrading
.
I
now
hate
the
recollection
of
the
time
I
pass
with


Céline
,
Giacinta
,
and
Clara
.
"




I
feel
the
truth
of
these
word
;

I
draw
from
they
the
certain


inference
,
that
if
I
be
so
far
to
forget
myself
and
all
the
teaching


that
have
ever
be
instill
into
I
,
as
—
under
any
pretext
—
with
any


justification
—
through
any
temptation
—
to
become
the
successor
of
these


poor
girl
,
he
would
one
day
regard
I
with
the
same
feeling
which
now


in
his
mind
desecrate
their
memory
.
I
do
not
give
utterance
to
this


conviction
:
it
be
enough
to
feel
it
.
I
impress
it
on
my
heart
,
that


it
might
remain
there
to
serve
I
as
aid
in
the
time
of
trial
.




"
now
,
Jane
,
why
do
n’t
you
say
'
well
,
sir
?
'
I
have
not
do
.
you
be


look
grave
.
you
disapprove
of
I
still
,
I
see
.
but
let
I
come
to


the
point
.
last
January
,
rid
of
all
mistress
—
in
a
harsh
,
bitter
frame


of
mind
,
the
result
of
a
useless
,
rove
,
lonely
life
—
corrode
with


disappointment
,
sourly
dispose
against
all
man
,
and
especially
against


all
_
woman_kind
(
for
I
begin
to
regard
the
notion
of
an
intellectual
,


faithful
,
love
woman
as
a
mere
dream
)
,
recall
by
business
,
I
come


back
to
England
.




"
on
a
frosty
winter
afternoon
,
I
ride
in
sight
of
Thornfield
Hall
.


Abhorred
spot
!
I
expect
no
peace
—
no
pleasure
there
.
on
a
stile
in
Hay


Lane
I
see
a
quiet
little
figure
sit
by
itself
.
I
pass
it
as


negligently
as
I
do
the
pollard
willow
opposite
to
it
:
I
have
no


presentiment
of
what
it
would
be
to
I
;
no
inward
warn
that
the


arbitress
of
my
life
—
my
genius
for
good
or
evil
—
wait
there
in
humble


guise
.
I
do
not
know
it
,
even
when
,
on
the
occasion
of
Mesrour
’s


accident
,
it
come
up
and
gravely
offer
I
help
.
childish
and
slend


creature
!
it
seem
as
if
a
linnet
have
hop
to
my
foot
and
propose


to
bear
I
on
its
tiny
wing
.
I
be
surly
;
but
the
thing
would
not
go
:


it
stand
by
I
with
strange
perseverance
,
and
look
and
speak
with
a


sort
of
authority
.
I
must
be
aid
,
and
by
that
hand
:
and
aid
I
be
.




"
when
once
I
have
press
the
frail
shoulder
,
something
new
—
a
fresh
sap


and
sense
—
steal
into
my
frame
.
it
be
well
I
have
learn
that
this
elf


must
return
to
I
—
that
it
belong
to
my
house
down
below
—
or
I
could


not
have
feel
it
pass
away
from
under
my
hand
,
and
see
it
vanish


behind
the
dim
hedge
,
without
singular
regret
.
I
hear
you
come
home


that
night
,
Jane
,
though
probably
you
be
not
aware
that
I
think
of


you
or
watch
for
you
.
the
next
day
I
observe
you
—
myself
unseen
—
for


half
-
an
-
hour
,
while
you
play
with
Adèle
in
the
gallery
.
it
be
a


snowy
day
,
I
recollect
,
and
you
could
not
go
out
of
door
.
I
be
in
my


room
;
the
door
be
ajar
:
I
could
both
listen
and
watch
.
Adèle
claim


your
outward
attention
for
a
while
;
yet
I
fancy
your
thought
be


elsewhere
:
but
you
be
very
patient
with
she
,
my
little
jane
;
you


talk
to
she
and
amuse
she
a
long
time
.
when
at
last
she
leave
you
,


you
lapse
at
once
into
deep
reverie
:
you
betook
yourself
slowly
to


pace
the
gallery
.
now
and
then
,
in
pass
a
casement
,
you
glance
out


at
the
thick
-
fall
snow
;
you
listen
to
the
sob
wind
,
and
again


you
pace
gently
on
and
dream
.
I
think
those
day
vision
be
not


dark
:
there
be
a
pleasurable
illumination
in
your
eye
occasionally
,
a


soft
excitement
in
your
aspect
,
which
tell
of
no
bitter
,
bilious
,


hypochondriac
brood
:
your
look
reveal
rather
the
sweet
musing
of


youth
when
its
spirit
follow
on
willing
wing
the
flight
of
Hope
up


and
on
to
an
ideal
heaven
.
the
voice
of
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
speak
to
a


servant
in
the
hall
,
waken
you
:
and
how
curiously
you
smile
to
and


at
yourself
,
Janet
!
there
be
much
sense
in
your
smile
:
it
be
very


shrewd
,
and
seem
to
make
light
of
your
own
abstraction
.
it
seem
to


say—‘My
fine
vision
be
all
very
well
,
but
I
must
not
forget
they
be


absolutely
unreal
.
I
have
a
rosy
sky
and
a
green
flowery
Eden
in
my


brain
;
but
without
,
I
be
perfectly
aware
,
lie
at
my
foot
a
rough
tract


to
travel
,
and
around
I
gather
black
tempest
to
encounter
.
'
you
run


downstairs
and
demand
of
Mrs.
Fairfax
some
occupation
:
the
weekly


house
account
to
make
up
,
or
something
of
that
sort
,
I
think
it
be
.
I


be
vex
with
you
for
get
out
of
my
sight
.




"
impatiently
I
wait
for
evening
,
when
I
might
summon
you
to
my


presence
.
an
unusual
—
to
I
—
a
perfectly
new
character
I
suspect
be


your
:
I
desire
to
search
it
deeply
and
know
it
well
.
you
enter


the
room
with
a
look
and
air
at
once
shy
and
independent
:
you
be


quaintly
dress
—
much
as
you
be
now
.
I
make
you
talk
:
ere
long
I
find


you
full
of
strange
contrast
.
your
garb
and
manner
be
restrict
by


rule
;
your
air
be
often
diffident
,
and
altogether
that
of
one
refine


by
nature
,
but
absolutely
unused
to
society
,
and
a
good
deal
afraid
of


make
herself
disadvantageously
conspicuous
by
some
solecism
or


blunder
;
yet
when
address
,
you
lift
a
keen
,
a
daring
,
and
a
glow


eye
to
your
interlocutor
’s
face
:
there
be
penetration
and
power
in


each
glance
you
give
;
when
ply
by
close
question
,
you
find
ready


and
round
answer
.
very
soon
you
seem
to
get
use
to
I
:
I
believe


you
feel
the
existence
of
sympathy
between
you
and
your
grim
and
cross


master
,
Jane
;
for
it
be
astonishing
to
see
how
quickly
a
certain


pleasant
ease
tranquillise
your
manner
:
snarl
as
I
would
,
you
show


no
surprise
,
fear
,
annoyance
,
or
displeasure
at
my
moroseness
;
you


watch
I
,
and
now
and
then
smile
at
I
with
a
simple
yet
sagacious


grace
I
can
not
describe
.
I
be
at
once
content
and
stimulate
with
what


I
see
:
I
like
what
I
have
see
,
and
wish
to
see
more
.
yet
,
for
a
long


time
,
I
treat
you
distantly
,
and
seek
your
company
rarely
.
I
be
an


intellectual
epicure
,
and
wish
to
prolong
the
gratification
of
make


this
novel
and
piquant
acquaintance
:
besides
,
I
be
for
a
while


trouble
with
a
haunting
fear
that
if
I
handle
the
flower
freely
its


bloom
would
fade
—
the
sweet
charm
of
freshness
would
leave
it
.
I
do
not


then
know
that
it
be
no
transitory
blossom
,
but
rather
the
radiant


resemblance
of
one
,
cut
in
an
indestructible
gem
.
moreover
,
I
wish
to


see
whether
you
would
seek
I
if
I
shun
you
—
but
you
do
not
;
you


keep
in
the
schoolroom
as
still
as
your
own
desk
and
easel
;
if
by


chance
I
meet
you
,
you
pass
I
as
soon
,
and
with
as
little
token
of


recognition
,
as
be
consistent
with
respect
.
your
habitual
expression


in
those
day
,
Jane
,
be
a
thoughtful
look
;
not
despondent
,
for
you


be
not
sickly
;
but
not
buoyant
,
for
you
have
little
hope
,
and
no


actual
pleasure
.
I
wonder
what
you
think
of
I
,
or
if
you
ever


think
of
I
,
and
resolve
to
find
this
out
.




"
I
resume
my
notice
of
you
.
there
be
something
glad
in
your
glance
,


and
genial
in
your
manner
,
when
you
converse
:
I
see
you
have
a
social


heart
;
it
be
the
silent
schoolroom
—
it
be
the
tedium
of
your
life
—
that


make
you
mournful
.
I
permit
myself
the
delight
of
be
kind
to
you
;


kindness
stir
emotion
soon
:
your
face
become
soft
in
expression
,


your
tone
gentle
;
I
like
my
name
pronounce
by
your
lip
in
a


grateful
happy
accent
.
I
use
to
enjoy
a
chance
meeting
with
you
,
Jane
,


at
this
time
:
there
be
a
curious
hesitation
in
your
manner
:
you


glance
at
I
with
a
slight
trouble
—
a
hovering
doubt
:
you
do
not
know


what
my
caprice
might
be
—
whether
I
be
go
to
play
the
master
and
be


stern
,
or
the
friend
and
be
benignant
.
I
be
now
too
fond
of
you
often


to
simulate
the
first
whim
;
and
,
when
I
stretch
my
hand
out


cordially
,
such
bloom
and
light
and
bliss
rise
to
your
young
,
wistful


feature
,
I
have
much
ado
often
to
avoid
strain
you
then
and
there
to


my
heart
.
"




"
do
n’t
talk
any
more
of
those
day
,
sir
,
"
I
interrupt
,
furtively


dash
away
some
tear
from
my
eye
;
his
language
be
torture
to
I
;


for
I
know
what
I
must
do
—
and
do
soon
—
and
all
these
reminiscence
,
and


these
revelation
of
his
feeling
only
make
my
work
more
difficult
.




"
no

Jane
,
"
he
return
:
"
what
necessity
be
there
to
dwell
on
the
past

unutterable
misery

strange
fear
.
the
light
that
long


ago
have
strike
I
into
syncope
,
recall
in
this
vision
,
seem


glidingly
to
mount
the
wall
,
and
tremblingly
to
pause
in
the
centre
of


the
obscure
ceiling
.
I
lift
up
my
head
to
look
:
the
roof
resolve
to


cloud
,
high
and
dim
;
the
gleam
be
such
as
the
moon
impart
to
vapour


she
be
about
to
sever
.
I
watch
she
come
—
watch
with
the
strange


anticipation
;
as
though
some
word
of
doom
be
to
be
write
on
she


disk
.
she
break
forth
as
never
moon
yet
burst
from
cloud
:
a
hand
first


penetrate
the
sable
fold
and
wave
they
away
;
then
,
not
a
moon
,
but
a


white
human
form
shine
in
the
azure
,
incline
a
glorious
brow


earthward
.
it
gaze
and
gaze
on
I
.
it
speak
to
my
spirit
:


immeasurably
distant
be
the
tone
,
yet
so
near
,
it
whisper
in
my


heart
—




"
my
daughter
,
flee
temptation
.
"




"
mother
,
I
will
.
"




so
I
answer
after
I
have
wake
from
the
trance
-
like
dream
.
it
be
yet


night
,
but
July
night
be
short
:
soon
after
midnight
,
dawn
come
.
"
it


can
not
be
too
early
to
commence
the
task
I
have
to
fulfil
,
"
think
i.


I
rise
:
I
be
dressed
;
for
I
have
take
off
nothing
but
my
shoe
.
I
know


where
to
find
in
my
drawer
some
linen
,
a
locket
,
a
ring
.
in
seek


these
article
,
I
encounter
the
bead
of
a
pearl
necklace
Mr.


Rochester
have
force
I
to
accept
a
few
day
ago
.
I
leave
that
;
it
be


not
mine
:
it
be
the
visionary
bride
’s
who
have
melt
in
air
.
the
other


article
I
make
up
in
a
parcel
;
my
purse
,
contain
twenty
shilling


(
it
be
all
I
have
)
,
I
put
in
my
pocket
:
I
tie
on
my
straw
bonnet
,


pin
my
shawl
,
take
the
parcel
and
my
slipper
,
which
I
would
not
put


on
yet
,
and
steal
from
my
room
.




"
farewell
,
kind
Mrs.
Fairfax
!
"
I
whisper
,
as
I
glide
past
her
door
.


"
farewell
,
my
darling
Adèle
!
"
I
say
,
as
I
glance
towards
the
nursery
.


no
thought
could
be
admit
of
enter
to
embrace
she
.
I
have
to


deceive
a
fine
ear
:
for
aught
I
know
it
might
now
be
listen
.




I
would
have
get
past
Mr.
Rochester
’s
chamber
without
a
pause
;
but
my


heart
momentarily
stop
its
beat
at
that
threshold
,
my
foot
be


force
to
stop
also
.
no
sleep
be
there
:
the
inmate
be
walk


restlessly
from
wall
to
wall
;
and
again
and
again
he
sigh
while
I


listen
.
there
be
a
heaven
—
a
temporary
heaven
—
in
this
room
for
I
,
if


I
choose
:
I
have
but
to
go
in
and
to
say
—




"
Mr.
Rochester
,
I
will
love
you
and
live
with
you
through
life
till


death
,
"
and
a
fount
of
rapture
would
spring
to
my
lip
.
I
think
of


this
.




that
kind
master
,
who
could
not
sleep
now
,
be
wait
with
impatience


for
day
.
he
would
send
for
I
in
the
morning
;
I
should
be
go
.
he


would
have
I
seek
for
:
vainly
.
he
would
feel
himself
forsake
;
his


love
reject
:
he
would
suffer
;
perhaps
grow
desperate
.
I
think
of


this
too
.
my
hand
move
towards
the
lock
:
I
catch
it
back
,
and
glide


on
.




drearily
I
wound
my
way
downstairs
:
I
know
what
I
have
to
do
,
and
I
do


it
mechanically
.
I
seek
the
key
of
the
side
-
door
in
the
kitchen
;
I


seek
,
too
,
a
phial
of
oil
and
a
feather
;
I
oil
the
key
and
the


lock
.
I
get
some
water
,
I
get
some
bread
:
for
perhaps
I
should
have
to


walk
far
;
and
my
strength
,
sorely
shake
of
late
,
must
not
break
down
.


all
this
I
do
without
one
sound
.
I
open
the
door
,
pass
out
,
shut


it
softly
.
dim
dawn
glimmer
in
the
yard
.
the
great
gate
be
close


and
lock
;
but
a
wicket
in
one
of
they
be
only
latch
.
through
that


I
depart
:
it
,
too
,
I
shut
;
and
now
I
be
out
of
Thornfield
.




a
mile
off
,
beyond
the
field
,
lie
a
road
which
stretch
in
the


contrary
direction
to
Millcote
;
a
road
I
have
never
travel
,
but
often


notice
,
and
wonder
where
it
lead
:
thither
I
bend
my
step
.
no


reflection
be
to
be
allow
now
:
not
one
glance
be
to
be
cast
back
;


not
even
one
forward
.
not
one
thought
be
to
be
give
either
to
the


past
or
the
future
.
the
first
be
a
page
so
heavenly
sweet
—
so
deadly


sad
—
that
to
read
one
line
of
it
would
dissolve
my
courage
and
break


down
my
energy
.
the
last
be
an
awful
blank
:
something
like
the
world


when
the
deluge
be
go
by
.




I
skirt
field
,
and
hedge
,
and
lane
till
after
sunrise
.
I
believe


it
be
a
lovely
summer
morning
:
I
know
my
shoe
,
which
I
have
put
on


when
I
leave
the
house
,
be
soon
wet
with
dew
.
but
I
look
neither
to


rise
sun
,
nor
smile
sky
,
nor
waken
nature
.
he
who
be
take
out


to
pass
through
a
fair
scene
to
the
scaffold
,
think
not
of
the
flower


that
smile
on
his
road
,
but
of
the
block
and
axe
-
edge
;
of
the


disseverment
of
bone
and
vein
;
of
the
grave
gape
at
the
end
:
and
I


think
of
drear
flight
and
homeless
wandering
—
and
oh
!
with
agony
I


think
of
what
I
leave
.
I
could
not
help
it
.
I
think
of
he
now
—
in


his
room
—
watch
the
sunrise
;
hope
I
should
soon
come
to
say
I
would


stay
with
he
and
be
his
.
I
long
to
be
his
;
I
pant
to
return
:
it


be
not
too
late
;
I
could
yet
spare
he
the
bitter
pang
of
bereavement
.


as
yet
my
flight
,
I
be
sure
,
be
undiscovered
.
I
could
go
back
and
be


his
comforter
—
his
pride
;
his
redeemer
from
misery
,
perhaps
from
ruin
.


oh
,
that
fear
of
his
self
-
abandonment
—
far
bad
than
my
abandonment
—
how


it
goad
I
!
it
be
a
barbed
arrow
-
head
in
my
breast
;
it
tear
I
when


I
try
to
extract
it
;
it
sicken
I
when
remembrance
thrust
it


far
in
.
bird
begin
singe
in
brake
and
copse
:
bird
be
faithful


to
their
mate
;
bird
be
emblem
of
love
.
what
be
I
?
in
the
midst
of


my
pain
of
heart
and
frantic
effort
of
principle
,
I
abhor
myself
.
I


have
no
solace
from
self
-
approbation
:
none
even
from
self
-
respect
.
I
have


injure
—
wound
—
leave
my
master
.
I
be
hateful
in
my
own
eye
.
still
I


could
not
turn
,
nor
retrace
one
step
.
God
must
have
lead
I
on
.
as
to
my


own
will
or
conscience
,
impassione
grief
have
trample
one
and
stifle


the
other
.
I
be
weep
wildly
as
I
walk
along
my
solitary
way
:


fast
,
fast
I
go
like
one
delirious
.
a
weakness
,
begin
inwardly
,


extend
to
the
limb
,
seize
I
,
and
I
fall
:
I
lie
on
the
ground
some


minute
,
press
my
face
to
the
wet
turf
.
I
have
some
fear
—
or
hope
—
that


here
I
should
die
:
but
I
be
soon
up
;
crawl
forwards
on
my
hand
and


knee
,
and
then
again
raise
to
my
foot
—
as
eager
and
as
determined
as


ever
to
reach
the
road
.




when
I
get
there
,
I
be
force
to
sit
to
rest
I
under
the
hedge
;
and


while
I
sit
,
I
hear
wheel
,
and
see
a
coach
come
on
.
I
stand
up
and


lift
my
hand
;
it
stop
.
I
ask
where
it
be
go
:
the
driver


name
a
place
a
long
way
off
,
and
where
I
be
sure
Mr.
Rochester
have
no


connection
.
I
ask
for
what
sum
he
would
take
I
there
;
he
say


thirty
shilling
;
I
answer
I
have
but
twenty
;
well
,
he
would
try
to


make
it
do
.
he
far
give
I
leave
to
get
into
the
inside
,
as
the


vehicle
be
empty
:
I
enter
,
be
shut
in
,
and
it
roll
on
its
way
.




gentle
reader
,
may
you
never
feel
what
I
then
feel
!
may
your
eye
never


shed
such
stormy
,
scalding
,
heart
-
wrung
tear
as
pour
from
mine
.
may


you
never
appeal
to
Heaven
in
prayer
so
hopeless
and
so
agonise
as
in


that
hour
leave
my
lip
;
for
never
may
you
,
like
I
,
dread
to
be
the


instrument
of
evil
to
what
you
wholly
love
.










chapter
XXVIII






two
day
be
pass
.
it
be
a
summer
evening
;
the
coachman
have
set
I


down
at
a
place
call
Whitcross
;
he
could
take
I
no
far
for
the


sum
I
have
give
,
and
I
be
not
possess
of
another
shilling
in
the


world
.
the
coach
be
a
mile
off
by
this
time
;
I
be
alone
.
at
this
moment


I
discover
that
I
forget
to
take
my
parcel
out
of
the
pocket
of
the


coach
,
where
I
have
place
it
for
safety
;
there
it
remain
,
there
it


must
remain
;
and
now
,
I
be
absolutely
destitute
.




Whitcross
be
no
town
,
nor
even
a
hamlet
;
it
be
but
a
stone
pillar
set


up
where
four
road
meet
:
whitewash
,
I
suppose
,
to
be
more
obvious
at


a
distance
and
in
darkness
.
four
arm
spring
from
its
summit
:
the


near
town
to
which
these
point
be
,
accord
to
the
inscription
,


distant
ten
mile
;
the
farth
,
above
twenty
.
from
the
well
-
know


name
of
these
town
I
learn
in
what
county
I
have
light
;
a


north
-
midland
shire
,
dusk
with
moorland
,
ridge
with
mountain
:
this
I


see
.
there
be
great
moor
behind
and
on
each
hand
of
I
;
there
be


wave
of
mountain
far
beyond
that
deep
valley
at
my
foot
.
the


population
here
must
be
thin
,
and
I
see
no
passenger
on
these
road
:


they
stretch
out
east
,
west
,
north
,
and
south
—
white
,
broad
,
lonely
;


they
be
all
cut
in
the
moor
,
and
the
heather
grow
deep
and
wild
to


their
very
verge
.
yet
a
chance
traveller
might
pass
by
;
and
I
wish
no


eye
to
see
I
now
:
stranger
would
wonder
what
I
be
do
,
linger


here
at
the
sign
-
post
,
evidently
objectless
and
lose
.
I
might
be


question
:
I
could
give
no
answer
but
what
would
sound
incredible
and


excite
suspicion
.
not
a
tie
hold
I
to
human
society
at
this


moment
—
not
a
charm
or
hope
call
I
where
my
fellow
-
creature
be
—
none


that
see
I
would
have
a
kind
thought
or
a
good
wish
for
I
.
I
have
no


relative
but
the
universal
mother
,
nature
:
I
will
seek
her
breast
and


ask
repose
.




I
strike
straight
into
the
heath
;
I
hold
on
to
a
hollow
I
see
deeply


furrow
the
brown
moorside
;
I
wade
knee
-
deep
in
its
dark
growth
;
I


turn
with
its
turning
,
and
find
a
moss
-
blacken
granite
crag
in


a
hidden
angle
,
I
sit
down
under
it
.
high
bank
of
moor
be
about
I
;


the
crag
protect
my
head
:
the
sky
be
over
that
.




some
time
pass
before
I
feel
tranquil
even
here
:
I
have
a
vague
dread


that
wild
cattle
might
be
near
,
or
that
some
sportsman
or
poacher
might


discover
I
.
if
a
gust
of
wind
sweep
the
waste
,
I
look
up
,
fear
it


be
the
rush
of
a
bull
;
if
a
plover
whistle
,
I
imagine
it
a
man
.


find
my
apprehension
unfounded
,
however
,
and
calm
by
the
deep


silence
that
reign
as
evening
decline
at
nightfall
,
I
take


confidence
.
as
yet
I
have
not
think
;
I
have
only
listen
,
watch
,


dread
;
now
I
regain
the
faculty
of
reflection
.




what
be
I
to
do
?
where
to
go
?
oh
,
intolerable
question
,
when
I
could


do
nothing
and
go
nowhere!—when
a
long
way
must
yet
be
measure
by
my


weary
,
tremble
limb
before
I
could
reach
human
habitation
—
when
cold


charity
must
be
entreat
before
I
could
get
a
lodging
:
reluctant


sympathy
importune
,
almost
certain
repulse
incur
,
before
my
tale


could
be
listen
to
,
or
one
of
my
want
relieve
!




I
touch
the
heath
:
it
be
dry
,
and
yet
warm
with
the
heat
of
the


summer
day
.
I
look
at
the
sky
;
it
be
pure
:
a
kindly
star
twinkle


just
above
the
chasm
ridge
.
the
dew
fall
,
but
with
propitious
softness
;


no
breeze
whisper
.
Nature
seem
to
I
benign
and
good
;
I
think
she


love
I
,
outcast
as
I
be
;
and
I
,
who
from
man
could
anticipate
only


mistrust
,
rejection
,
insult
,
clung
to
she
with
filial
fondness
.


to
-
night
,
at
least
,
I
would
be
her
guest
,
as
I
be
her
child
:
my
mother


would
lodge
I
without
money
and
without
price
.
I
have
one
morsel
of


bread
yet
:
the
remnant
of
a
roll
I
have
buy
in
a
town
we
pass


through
at
noon
with
a
stray
penny
—
my
last
coin
.
I
see
ripe
bilberry


gleam
here
and
there
,
like
jet
bead
in
the
heath
:
I
gather
a


handful
and
eat
they
with
the
bread
.
my
hunger
,
sharp
before
,
be
,
if


not
satisfied
,
appease
by
this
hermit
’s
meal
.
I
say
my
evening


prayer
at
its
conclusion
,
and
then
choose
my
couch
.






I
say
my
evening
prayer




beside
the
crag
the
heath
be
very
deep
:
when
I
lie
down
my
foot
be


bury
in
it
;
rise
high
on
each
side
,
it
leave
only
a
narrow
space
for


the
night
-
air
to
invade
.
I
fold
my
shawl
double
,
and
spread
it
over


I
for
a
coverlet
;
a
low
,
mossy
swell
be
my
pillow
.
thus
lodge
,
I
be


not
,
at
least
at
the
commencement
of
the
night
,
cold
.




my
rest
might
have
be
blissful
enough
,
only
a
sad
heart
break
it
.
it


plain
of
its
gape
wound
,
its
inward
bleeding
,
its
riven
chord
.
it


tremble
for
Mr.
Rochester
and
his
doom
;
it
bemoan
he
with
bitter


pity
;
it
demand
he
with
ceaseless
longing
;
and
,
impotent
as
a
bird


with
both
wing
break
,
it
still
quiver
its
shattered
pinion
in
vain


attempt
to
seek
he
.




wear
out
with
this
torture
of
thought
,
I
rise
to
my
knee
.
night
be


come
,
and
her
planet
be
rise
:
a
safe
,
still
night
:
too
serene
for


the
companionship
of
fear
.
we
know
that
God
be
everywhere
;
but


certainly
we
feel
his
presence
most
when
his
work
be
on
the
grand


scale
spread
before
we
;
and
it
be
in
the
unclouded
night
-
sky
,
where
his


world
wheel
their
silent
course
,
that
we
read
clear
his
infinitude
,


his
omnipotence
,
his
omnipresence
.
I
have
rise
to
my
knee
to
pray
for


Mr.
Rochester
.
look
up
,
I
,
with
tear
-
dim
eye
,
see
the
mighty


milky
-
way
.
remember
what
it
be
—
what
countless
system
there
sweep


space
like
a
soft
trace
of
light
—
I
feel
the
might
and
strength
of
God
.


sure
be
I
of
his
efficiency
to
save
what
he
have
make
:
convince
I
grow


that
neither
earth
should
perish
,
nor
one
of
the
soul
it
treasure
.
I


turn
my
prayer
to
thanksgive
:
the
Source
of
Life
be
also
the


saviour
of
spirit
.
Mr.
Rochester
be
safe
:
he
be
God
’s
,
and
by
God


would
he
be
guard
.
I
again
nestle
to
the
breast
of
the
hill
;
and
ere


long
in
sleep
forgot
sorrow
.




but
next
day
,
Want
come
to
I
pale
and
bare
.
long
after
the
little


bird
have
leave
their
nest
;
long
after
bee
have
come
in
the
sweet
prime


of
day
to
gather
the
heath
honey
before
the
dew
be
dry
—
when
the
long


morning
shadow
be
curtail
,
and
the
sun
fill
earth
and
sky
—
I
get


up
,
and
I
look
round
I
.




what
a
still
,
hot
,
perfect
day
!
what
a
golden
desert
this
spread


moor
!
everywhere
sunshine
.
I
wish
I
could
live
in
it
and
on
it
.
I
see


a
lizard
run
over
the
crag
;
I
see
a
bee
busy
among
the
sweet


bilberry
.
I
would
fain
at
the
moment
have
become
bee
or
lizard
,
that


I
might
have
find
fitting
nutriment
,
permanent
shelter
here
.
but
I
be


a
human
being
,
and
have
a
human
being
’s
want
:
I
must
not
linger
where


there
be
nothing
to
supply
they
.
I
rise
;
I
look
back
at
the
bed
I


have
leave
.
hopeless
of
the
future
,
I
wish
but
this
—
that
my
Maker
have


that
night
think
good
to
require
my
soul
of
I
while
I
sleep
;
and


that
this
weary
frame
,
absolve
by
death
from
further
conflict
with


fate
,
have
now
but
to
decay
quietly
,
and
mingle
in
peace
with
the
soil


of
this
wilderness
.
life
,
however
,
be
yet
in
my
possession
,
with
all


its
requirement
,
and
pain
,
and
responsibility
.
the
burden
must
be


carry
;
the
want
provide
for
;
the
suffering
endure
;
the


responsibility
fulfil
.
I
set
out
.




Whitcross
regain
,
I
follow
a
road
which
lead
from
the
sun
,
now


fervent
and
high
.
by
no
other
circumstance
have
I
will
to
decide
my


choice
.
I
walk
a
long
time
,
and
when
I
think
I
have
nearly
do


enough
,
and
might
conscientiously
yield
to
the
fatigue
that
almost


overpower
I
—
might
relax
this
force
action
,
and
,
sit
down
on
a


stone
I
see
near
,
submit
resistlessly
to
the
apathy
that
clog
heart


and
limb
—
I
hear
a
bell
chime
—
a
church
bell
.




I
turn
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
,
and
there
,
amongst
the
romantic


hill
,
whose
change
and
aspect
I
have
cease
to
note
an
hour
ago
,
I
see


a
hamlet
and
a
spire
.
all
the
valley
at
my
right
hand
be
full
of


pasture
-
field
,
and
cornfield
,
and
wood
;
and
a
glitter
stream
run


zig
-
zag
through
the
varied
shade
of
green
,
the
mellow
grain
,
the


sombre
woodland
,
the
clear
and
sunny
lea
.
recall
by
the
rumbling
of


wheel
to
the
road
before
I
,
I
see
a
heavily
-
laden
waggon
labour
up


the
hill
,
and
not
far
beyond
be
two
cow
and
their
drover
.
human
life


and
human
labour
be
near
.
I
must
struggle
on
:
strive
to
live
and
bend


to
toil
like
the
rest
.




about
two
o’clock
P.M.
I
enter
the
village
.
at
the
bottom
of
its
one


street
there
be
a
little
shop
with
some
cake
of
bread
in
the
window
.


I
covet
a
cake
of
bread
.
with
that
refreshment
I
could
perhaps
regain


a
degree
of
energy
:
without
it
,
it
would
be
difficult
to
proceed
.
the


wish
to
have
some
strength
and
some
vigour
return
to
I
as
soon
as
I


be
amongst
my
fellow
-
being
.
I
feel
it
would
be
degrade
to
faint


with
hunger
on
the
causeway
of
a
hamlet
.
have
I
nothing
about
I
I
could


offer
in
exchange
for
one
of
these
roll
?
I
consider
.
I
have
a
small


silk
handkerchief
tie
round
my
throat
;
I
have
my
glove
.
I
could
hardly


tell
how
man
and
woman
in
extremity
of
destitution
proceed
.
I
do


not
know
whether
either
of
these
article
would
be
accept
:
probably


they
would
not
;
but
I
must
try
.




I
enter
the
shop
:
a
woman
be
there
.
see
a
respectably
-
dress


person
,
a
lady
as
she
suppose
,
she
come
forward
with
civility
.
how


could
she
serve
I
?
I
be
seize
with
shame
:
my
tongue
would
not
utter


the
request
I
have
prepare
.
I
dared
not
offer
she
the
half
-
wear
glove
,


the
creased
handkerchief
:
besides
,
I
feel
it
would
be
absurd
.
I
only


beg
permission
to
sit
down
a
moment
,
as
I
be
tired
.
disappoint
in


the
expectation
of
a
customer
,
she
coolly
accede
to
my
request
.
she


point
to
a
seat
;
I
sink
into
it
.
I
felt
sorely
urge
to
weep
;
but


conscious
how
unseasonable
such
a
manifestation
would
be
,
I
restrain


it
.
soon
I
ask
she
"
if
there
be
any
dressmaker
or
plain
-
workwoman


in
the
village
?
"




"
yes
;
two
or
three
.
quite
as
many
as
there
be
employment
for
.
"




I
reflect
.
I
be
drive
to
the
point
now
.
I
be
bring
face
to
face


with
Necessity
.
I
stand
in
the
position
of
one
without
a
resource
,


without
a
friend
,
without
a
coin
.
I
must
do
something
.
what
?
I
must


apply
somewhere
.
where
?




"
do
she
know
of
any
place
in
the
neighbourhood
where
a
servant
be


want
?
"




"
nay
;
she
could
n’t
say
.
"

she
seem
to

my

in

I
take
leave

I
pass
up
the
street
,
look
as
I
go
at
all
the
house
to
the


right
hand

to
the
left
;
but
I
could
discover
no
pretext
,

see
an


inducement
to
enter
any
.
I
ramble
round
the
hamlet
,
go
sometimes
to


a
little
distance
and
return
again
,
for
an
hour
or
more
.
much


exhausted
,
and
suffer
greatly
now
for
want
of
food
,
I
turn
aside


into
a
lane
and
sit
down
under
the
hedge
.
ere
many
minute
have
elapse
,


I
be
again
on
my
foot
,
however
,
and
again
search
something
—
a


resource
,

at

an
informant
.
a
pretty
little
house
stand
at
the


top
of
the
lane
,
with
a
garden
before
it
,
exquisitely
neat
and


brilliantly
bloom
.
I
stop
at
it
.
what
business
have
I
to
approach


the
white
door
or
touch
the
glitter
knocker
?
in
what
way
could
it


possibly
be
the
interest
of
the
inhabitant
of
that
dwell
to
serve


I
?
yet
I
draw
near
and
knock
.
a
mild

look

cleanly

young

such
a

hopeless

a
voice
wretchedly
low

the

quite
gently

civilly

out

hold
it
open
a

long

I
believe
I

have
beg
a
piece
of
bread

I
be
now
bring
low

I
could
not
bear
to
return
to
the
sordid
village
,
where
,
besides
,
no


prospect
of
aid
be
visible
.
I
should
have
long
rather
to
deviate
to


a
wood
I
see
not
far
off
,
which
appear
in
its
thick
shade
to
offer


invite
shelter
;
but
I
be
so
sick
,
so
weak
,
so
gnaw
with
nature
’s


craving
,
instinct
keep
I
roam
round
abode
where
there
be
a


chance
of
food
.
Solitude
would
be
no
solitude
—
rest
no
rest
—
while
the


vulture
,
hunger
,
thus
sink
beak
and
talon
in
my
side
.




I
draw
near
house
;
I
leave
they
,
and
come
back
again
,
and
again
I


wander
away
:
always
repel
by
the
consciousness
of
have
no
claim


to
ask
—
no
right
to
expect
interest
in
my
isolated
lot
.
meantime
,
the


afternoon
advance
,
while
I
thus
wander
about
like
a
lost
and


starve
dog
.
in
cross
a
field
,
I
see
the
church
spire
before
I
:
I


hasten
towards
it
.
near
the
churchyard
,
and
in
the
middle
of
a


garden
,
stand
a
well
-
build
though
small
house
,
which
I
have
no
doubt
be


the
parsonage
.
I
remember
that
stranger
who
arrive
at
a
place
where


they
have
no
friend
,
and
who
want
employment
,
sometimes
apply
to
the


clergyman
for
introduction
and
aid
.
it
be
the
clergyman
’s
function
to


help
—
at
least
with
advice
—
those
who
wish
to
help
themselves
.
I
seem


to
have
something
like
a
right
to
seek
counsel
here
.
renew
then
my


courage
,
and
gather
my
feeble
remain
of
strength
,
I
push
on
.
I


reach
the
house
,
and
knock
at
the
kitchen
-
door
.
an
old
woman


open

death

be
at
Marsh
End
now
,

would
very
likely


stay
there
a
fortnight
long

and
of
she
,


reader
,
I
could
not
bear
to
ask
the
relief
for
want
of
which
I
be


sink
;
I
could
not
yet
beg
;
and
again
I
crawl
away
.




once
more
I
take
off
my
handkerchief
—
once
more
I
think
of
the
cake


of
bread
in
the
little
shop
.
oh
,
for
but
a
crust
!
for
but
one
mouthful


to
allay
the
pang
of
famine
!
instinctively
I
turn
my
face
again
to


the
village
;
I
find
the
shop
again
,
and
I
go
in
;
and
though
other


be
there
besides
the
woman
I
venture
the
request—“would
she
give
I


a
roll
for
this
handkerchief
?
"




she
look
at
I
with
evident
suspicion
:
"
nay
,
she
never
sell
stuff
I
’


that
way
.
"




almost
desperate
,
I
ask
for
half
a
cake
;
she
again
refuse
.
"
how


could
she
tell
where
I
have
get
the
handkerchief
?
"
she
say
.




"
would
she
take
my
glove
?
"




"
no
!
what
could
she
do
with
they
?
"




reader
,
it
be
not
pleasant
to
dwell
on
these
detail
.
some
say
there
be


enjoyment
in
look
back
to
painful
experience
past
;
but
at
this
day
I


can
scarcely
bear
to
review
the
time
to
which
I
allude
:
the
moral


degradation
,
blent
with
the
physical
suffering
,
form
too
distress
a


recollection
ever
to
be
willingly
dwell
on
.
I
blame
none
of
those
who


repulse
I
.
I
feel
it
be
what
be
to
be
expect
,
and
what
could
not


be
help
:
an
ordinary
beggar
be
frequently
an
object
of
suspicion
;
a


well
-
dress
beggar
inevitably
so
.
to
be
sure
,
what
I
beg
be


employment
;
but
whose
business
be
it
to
provide
I
with
employment
?


not
,
certainly
,
that
of
person
who
see
I
then
for
the
first
time
,
and


who
know
nothing
about
my
character
.
and
as
to
the
woman
who
would
not


take
my
handkerchief
in
exchange
for
her
bread
,
why
,
she
be
right
,
if


the
offer
appear
to
her
sinister
or
the
exchange
unprofitable
.
let
I


condense
now
.
I
be
sick
of
the
subject
.




a
little
before
dark
I
pass
a
farm
-
house
,
at
the
open
door
of
which


the
farmer
be
sit
,
eat
his
supper
of
bread
and
cheese
.
I


stop
and
say
—




"
will
you
give
I
a
piece
of
bread
?
for
I
be
very
hungry
.
"
he
cast
on


I
a
glance
of
surprise
;
but
without
answer
,
he
cut
a
thick
slice


from
his
loaf
,
and
give
it
to
I
.
I
imagine
he
do
not
think
I
be
a


beggar
,
but
only
an
eccentric
sort
of
lady
,
who
have
take
a
fancy
to


his
brown
loaf
.
as
soon
as
I
be
out
of
sight
of
his
house
,
I
sit
down


and
eat
it
.




I
could
not
hope
to
get
a
lodging
under
a
roof
,
and
seek
it
in
the


wood
I
have
before
allude
to
.
but
my
night
be
wretched
,
my
rest


break
:
the
ground
be
damp
,
the
air
cold
:
besides
,
intruder
pass


near
I
more
than
once
,
and
I
have
again
and
again
to
change
my


quarter
:
no
sense
of
safety
or
tranquillity
befriend
I
.
towards


morning
it
rain
;
the
whole
of
the
follow
day
be
wet
.
do
not
ask


I
,
reader
,
to
give
a
minute
account
of
that
day
;
as
before
,
I
seek


work
;
as
before
,
I
be
repulse
;
as
before
,
I
starve
;
but
once
do


food
pass
my
lip
.
at
the
door
of
a
cottage
I
see
a
little
girl
about


to
throw
a
mess
of
cold
porridge
into
a
pig
trough
.
"
will
you
give
I


that
?
"
I
ask
.






"
will
you
give
I
that
?
"
I
ask




she
stare
at
I
.
"
mother
!
"
she
exclaim
,
"
there
be
a
woman

I


to
give
she
these
porridge
.
"




"
well
lass

reply
a
voice
within
,

it
she

a
beggar

'


pig

n’t
want
it
.
"




the
girl
empty
the
stiffen
mould
into
my
hand
,
and
I
devour
it


ravenously
.




as
the
wet
twilight
deepen
,
I
stop
in
a
solitary
bridle
-
path
,


which
I
have
be
pursue
an
hour
or
more
.




"
my
strength
be
quite
fail
I
,
"
I
say
in
a
soliloquy
.
"
I
feel
I


can
not
go
much
far
.
shall
I
be
an
outcast
again
this
night
?
while


the
rain
descend
so
,
must
I
lay
my
head
on
the
cold
,
drenched
ground
?


I
fear
I
can
not
do
otherwise
:
for
who
will
receive
I
?
but
it
will
be


very
dreadful
,
with
this
feeling
of
hunger
,
faintness
,
chill
,
and
this


sense
of
desolation
—
this
total
prostration
of
hope
.
in
all
likelihood
,


though
,
I
should
die
before
morning
.
and
why
can
not
I
reconcile
myself


to
the
prospect
of
death
?
why
do
I
struggle
to
retain
a
valueless
life
?


because
I
know
,
or
believe
,
Mr.
Rochester
be
live
:
and
then
,
to
die


of
want
and
cold
be
a
fate
to
which
nature
can
not
submit
passively
.
oh
,


providence
!
sustain
I
a
little
long
!
aid!—direct
I
!
"




my
glazed
eye
wander
over
the
dim
and
misty
landscape
.
I
see
I
have


stray
far
from
the
village
:
it
be
quite

cross

way

by

path

once
more
draw
near
the

of
moorland
;

now
,

a


few

as
wild
and
unproductive
as

heath

they
be
scarcely

,
lie
between
I
and
the
dusky
hill
.




"
well
,
I
would
rather
die
yonder
than
in
a
street

on
a
frequent


road

I
reflect
.
"

far
well
that
crow
and
raven

if
any
raven


there
be
in
these
region
—
should
pick
my
flesh
from
my
bone

than
that


they
should
be
prisone
in
a
workhouse
coffin
and
moulder
in
a
pauper

grave

"




to
the
hill

then
,
I
turn
.
I
reach
it
.
it
remain
now
only
to
find


a
hollow
where
I
could
lie
down
,
and
feel
at
least
hide
,
if
not


secure
.
but
all
the
surface
of
the
waste
look
level
.
it
show
no


variation
but
of
tint
:
green
,
where
rush
and
moss
overgrow
the
marsh
;


black
,
where
the
dry
soil
bear
only
heath
.
dark
as
it
be
get
,
I


could
still
see
these
change
,
though
but
as
mere
alternation
of
light


and
shade
;
for
colour
have
fade
with
the
daylight
.




my
eye
still
rove
over
the
sullen
swell
and
along
the
moor
-
edge
,


vanish
amidst
the
wild
scenery
,
when
at
one
dim
point
,
far
in


among
the
marsh
and
the
ridge
,
a
light
spring
up
.
"
that
be
an
_
ignis


fatuus

"
be
my
first
thought
;
and
I
expect
it
would
soon
vanish
.
it


burn
on
,
however
,
quite
steadily
,
neither
recede
nor
advance
.
"
be


it
,
then
,
a
bonfire
just
kindle
?
"
I
question
.
I
watch
to
see


whether
it
would
spread
:
but
no
;
as
it
do
not
diminish
,
so
it
do
not


enlarge
.
"
it
may
be
a
candle
in
a
house
,
"
I
then
conjecture
;
"
but
if


so
,
I
can
never
reach
it
.
it
be
much
too
far
away
:
and
be
it
within
a


yard
of
I
,
what
would
it
avail
?
I
should
but
knock
at
the
door
to
have


it
shut
in
my
face
.
"




and
I
sink
down
where
I
stand
,
and
hide
my
face
against
the
ground
.
I


lie
still
a
while
:
the
night
-
wind
sweep
over
the
hill
and
over
I
,
and


die
moan
in
the
distance
;
the
rain
fall
fast
,
wet
I
afresh
to


the
skin
.
could
I
but
have
stiffen
to
the
still
frost
—
the
friendly


numbness
of
death
—
it
might
have
pelt
on
;
I
should
not
have
feel
it
;


but
my
yet
live
flesh
shudder
at
its
chilling
influence
.
I
rise
ere


long
.




the
light
be
yet
there
,
shine
dim
but
constant
through
the
rain
.
I


try
to
walk
again
:
I
drag
my
exhausted
limb
slowly
towards
it
.
it


lead
I
aslant
over
the
hill
,
through
a
wide
bog
,
which
would
have
be


impassable
in
winter
,
and
be
splashy
and
shake
even
now
,
in
the


height
of
summer
.
here
I
fall
twice
;
but
as
often
I
rise
and
rally
my


faculty
.
this
light
be
my
forlorn
hope
:
I
must
gain
it
.




having
cross
the
marsh
,
I
see
a
trace
of
white
over
the
moor
.
I


approach
it
;
it
be
a
road
or
a
track
:
it
lead
straight
up
to
the


light
,
which
now
beam
from
a
sort
of
knoll
,
amidst
a
clump
of


tree
—
fir
,
apparently
,
from
what
I
could
distinguish
of
the
character


of
their
form
and
foliage
through
the
gloom
.
my
star
vanish
as
I


draw
near
:
some
obstacle
have
intervene
between
I
and
it
.
I
put
out
my


hand
to
feel
the
dark
mass
before
I
:
I
discriminate
the
rough
stone


of
a
low
wall
—
above
it
,
something
like
palisade
,
and
within
,
a
high


and
prickly
hedge
.
I
grope
on
.
again
a
whitish
object
gleam
before


I
:
it
be
a
gate
—
a
wicket
;
it
move
on
its
hinge
as
I
touch
it
.
on


each
side
stand
a
sable
bush
—
holly
or
yew
.




enter
the
gate
and
pass
the
shrub
,
the
silhouette
of
a
house


rise
to
view
,
black
,
low
,
and
rather
long
;
but
the
guide
light
shine


nowhere
.
all
be
obscurity
.
be
the
inmate
retire
to
rest
?
I
fear


it
must
be
so
.
in
seek
the
door
,
I
turn
an
angle
:
there
shoot
out


the
friendly
gleam
again
,
from
the
lozenged
pane
of
a
very
small


lattice
window
,
within
a
foot
of
the
ground
,
make
still
small
by
the


growth
of
ivy
or
some
other
creep
plant
,
whose
leave
cluster


thick
over
the
portion
of
the
house
wall
in
which
it
be
set
.
the


aperture
be
so
screen
and
narrow
,
that
curtain
or
shutter
have
be


deem
unnecessary
;
and
when
I
stoop
down
and
put
aside
the
spray
of


foliage
shoot
over
it
,
I
could
see
all
within
.
I
could
see
clearly
a


room
with
a
sanded
floor
,
clean
scoured
;
a
dresser
of
walnut
,
with


pewter
plate
range
in
row
,
reflect
the
redness
and
radiance
of
a


glow
peat
-
fire
.
I
could
see
a
clock
,
a
white
deal
table
,
some


chair
.
the
candle
,
whose
ray
have
be
my
beacon
,
burn
on
the
table
;


and
by
its
light
an
elderly
woman
,
somewhat
rough
-
look
,
but


scrupulously
clean
,
like
all
about
she
,
be
knit
a
stocking
.




I
notice
these
object
cursorily
only
—
in
they
there
be
nothing


extraordinary
.
a
group
of
more
interest
appear
near
the
hearth
,


sit
still
amidst
the
rosy
peace
and
warmth
suffuse
it
.
two
young
,


graceful
woman
—
lady
in
every
point
—
sit
,
one
in
a
low
rocking
-
chair
,


the
other
on
a
low
stool
;
both
wear
deep
mourning
of
crape
and


bombazeen
,
which
sombre
garb
singularly
set
off
very
fair
neck
and


face
:
a
large
old
pointer
dog
rest
its
massive
head
on
the
knee
of


one
girl
—
in
the
lap
of
the
other
be
cushion
a
black
cat
.




a
strange
place
be
this
humble
kitchen
for
such
occupant
!
who
be


they
?
they
could
not
be
the
daughter
of
the
elderly
person
at
the


table
;
for
she
look
like
a
rustic
,
and
they
be
all
delicacy
and


cultivation
.
I
have
nowhere
see
such
face
as
theirs
:
and
yet
,
as
I


gaze
on
they
,
I
seem
intimate
with
every
lineament
.
I
can
not
call


they
handsome
—
they
be
too
pale
and
grave
for
the
word
:
as
they
each


bent
over
a
book
,
they
look
thoughtful
almost
to
severity
.
a
stand


between
they
support
a
second
candle
and
two
great
volume
,
to
which


they
frequently
refer
,
compare
they
,
seemingly
,
with
the
small


book
they
hold
in
their
hand
,
like
people
consult
a
dictionary
to


aid
they
in
the
task
of
translation
.
this
scene
be
as
silent
as
if
all


the
figure
have
be
shadow
and
the
firelit
apartment
a
picture
:
so


hush
be
it
,
I
could
hear
the
cinder
fall
from
the
grate
,
the
clock


tick
in
its
obscure
corner
;
and
I
even
fancy
I
could
distinguish
the


click
-
click
of
the
woman
’s
knitting
-
needle
.
when
,
therefore
,
a
voice


break
the
strange
stillness
at
last
,
it
be
audible
enough
to
I
.




"

"
and
in
a
low
voice
she


read
something
,
of
which
not
one
word
be
intelligible
to
I
;
for
it

an
unknown
tongue

neither

the
recollection
of
about
three
day
and
night
succeed
this
be
very


dim
in
my
mind
.
I
can
recall
some
sensation
feel
in
that
interval
;
but


few
thought
frame
,
and
no
action
perform
.
I
know
I
be
in
a
small


room
and
in
a
narrow
bed
.
to
that
bed
I
seem
to
have
grow
;
I
lie
on


it
motionless
as
a
stone
;
and
to
have
tear
I
from
it
would
have
be


almost
to
kill
I
.
I
take
no
note
of
the
lapse
of
time
—
of
the
change


from
morning
to
noon
,
from
noon
to
evening
.
I
observe
when
any
one


enter
or
leave
the
apartment
:
I
could
even
tell
who
they
be
;
I
could


understand
what
be
say
when
the
speaker
stand
near
to
I
;
but
I
could


not
answer
;
to
open
my
lip
or
move
my
limb
be
equally
impossible
.


Hannah
,
the
servant
,
be
my
most
frequent
visitor
.
her
come
disturb


I
.
I
have
a
feeling
that
she
wish
I
away
:
that
she
do
not


understand
I
or
my
circumstance
;
that
she
be
prejudiced
against
I
.


Diana
and
Mary
appear
in
the
chamber
once
or
twice
a
day
.
they
would


whisper
sentence
of
this
sort
at
my
bedside
—




"
it
be
very
well

take
she
in

"




"
yes
;

would
certainly
have
be
find
dead
at
the
door

the


morning
have
she
be
leave
out
all
night

I
wonder
what
she
have
go


through

"




"

manner

her
accent

quite
pure

the
clothe

take
off

peculiar
face

haggard

it
be

I
rather
like


it
;
and
when
in
good
health
and
animate
,
I
can
fancy
her
physiognomy


would
be
agreeable

"




never

hospitality
they
have
extend
to
I

Mr.
St.
John
come
but
once
:
he
look
at
I
,

say
my
state
of


lethargy
be
the
result
of
reaction
from
excessive
and
protract


fatigue

pronounce
it
needless
to
send
for
a
doctor
:
nature

he
be


sure
,

manage
good

whole

while

no

rapid


enough

deliver

voice

add

a
pause
,

the
tone
of
a
man


little
accustomed
to
expansive
comment
,

unusual
physiognomy

I

I

dinner

hour

void
of
the
feverish
flavour
which
have
hitherto
poison


what
I
have
swallow

when
she

strong

revive

satiety

repose

could
I
put
on

only
my
damp
and
bemired


apparel
;
in
which
I
have
sleep
on
the
ground

fall
in
the
marsh

there
be
a
reviving
pleasure


in
this
intercourse
,
of
a
kind
now
taste
by
I
for
the
first
time
—
the


pleasure
arise
from
perfect
congeniality
of
taste
,
sentiment
,
and


principle
.




I
like
to
read
what
they
like
to
read
:
what
they
enjoy
,
delight


I
;
what
they
approve
,
I
reverence
.
they
love
their
sequester


home
.
I
,
too
,
in
the
grey
,
small
,
antique
structure
,
with
its
low
roof
,


its
latticed
casement
,
its
mouldering
wall
,
its
avenue
of
aged


fir
—
all
grow
aslant
under
the
stress
of
mountain
wind
;
its
garden
,


dark
with
yew
and
holly
—
and
where
no
flower
but
of
the
hardy


specie
would
bloom
—
find
a
charm
both
potent
and
permanent
.
they
cling


to
the
purple
moor
behind
and
around
their
dwelling
—
to
the
hollow
vale


into
which
the
pebbly
bridle
-
path
lead
from
their
gate
descend
,

wind
between
fern

first
,

then
amongst
a
few
of
the


wild
little
pasture
-
field
that
ever
border
a
wilderness
of
heath
,


or
give
sustenance
to
a
flock
of
grey
moorland
sheep
,
with
their
little


mossy

face
lambs:—they
clung
to
this
scene
,
I
say
,
with
a
perfect


enthusiasm
of
attachment
.
I
could
comprehend
the
feeling
,
and
share


both
its
strength
and
truth
.
I
see
the
fascination
of
the
locality
.
I


feel
the
consecration
of
its
loneliness
:
my
eye
feast
on
the
outline


of
swell
and
sweep
—
on
the
wild
colouring
communicate
to
ridge
and
dell


by
moss
,
by
heath
-
bell
,
by
flower
-
sprinkle
turf
,
by
brilliant
bracken
,


and
mellow
granite
crag
.
these
detail
be
just
to
I
what
they
be


to
they
—
so
many
pure
and
sweet
source
of
pleasure
.
the
strong
blast


and
the
soft
breeze
;
the
rough
and
the
halcyon
day
;
the
hour
of


sunrise
and
sunset
;
the
moonlight
and
the
clouded
night
,
develop
for


I
,
in
these
region
,
the
same
attraction
as
for
they
—
wound
round
my


facultie
the
same
spell
that
entrance
theirs
.




Indoors
we
agree
equally
well
.
they
be
both
more
accomplished
and


well
read
than
I
be
;
but
with
eagerness
I
follow
in
the
path
of


knowledge
they
have
tread
before
I
.
I
devour
the
book
they
lend


I
:
then
it
be
full
satisfaction
to
discuss
with
they
in
the
evening


what
I
have
peruse
during
the
day
.
thought

;
opinion
meet


opinion
:
we
coincide
,
in
short
,
perfectly
.




if
in
our
trio
there
be
a
superior
and
a
leader
,
it
be
Diana
.


physically
,
she
far
excel
I
:
she
be
handsome
;
she
be
vigorous
.
in


her
animal
spirit
there
be
an
affluence
of
life
and
certainty
of


flow
,
such
as
excited
my
wonder
,
while
it
baffle
my
comprehension
.
I


could
talk
a
while
when
the
evening
commence
,
but
the
first
gush
of


vivacity
and
fluency
go
,
I
be
fain
to
sit
on
a
stool
at
Diana
’s


foot
,
to
rest
my
head
on
her
knee
,
and
listen
alternately
to
she
and


Mary
,
while
they
sound
thoroughly
the
topic
on
which
I
have
but


touch
.
Diana
offer
to
teach
I
german
.
I
like
to
learn
of
she
:
I


see
the
part
of
instructress
please
and
suit
she
;
that
of
scholar


pleased
and
suit
I
no
less
.
our
nature
dovetail
:
mutual


affection
—
of
the
strong
kind
—
be
the
result
.
they
discover
I
could


draw
:
their
pencil
and
colour
-
box
be
immediately
at
my
service
.
my


skill
,
great
in
this
one
point
than
theirs
,
surprised
and
charm


they
.
Mary
would
sit
and
watch
I
by
the
hour
together
:
then
she
would


take
lesson
;
and
a
docile
,
intelligent
,
assiduous
pupil
she
make
.
thus


occupy
,
and
mutually
entertained
,
day
pass
like
hour
,
and
week


like
day
.




as
to
Mr.
St
John
,
the
intimacy
which
have
arise
so
naturally
and


rapidly
between
I
and
his
sister
do
not
extend
to
he
.
one
reason
of


the
distance
yet
observe
between
we
be
,
that
he
be
comparatively


seldom
at
home
:
a
large
proportion
of
his
time
appear
devoted
to


visit
the
sick
and
poor
among
the
scatter
population
of
his


parish
.




no
weather
seem
to
hinder
he
in
these
pastoral
excursion
:
rain
or


fair
,
he
would
,
when
his
hour
of
morning
study
be
over
,
take
his


hat
,
and
,
follow
by
his
father
’s
old
pointer
,
Carlo
,
go
out
on
his


mission
of
love
or
duty
—
I
scarcely
know
in
which
light
he
regard
it
.


sometimes
,
when
the
day
be
very
unfavourable
,
his
sister
would


expostulate
.
he
would
then
say
,
with
a
peculiar
smile
,
more
solemn
than


cheerful
—




"
and
if
I
let
a
gust
of
wind
or
a
sprinkling
of
rain
turn
I
aside
from


these
easy
task
,
what
preparation
would
such
sloth
be
for
the
future
I


propose
to
myself
?
"




Diana
and
Mary
’s
general
answer
to
this
question
be
a
sigh
,
and
some


minute
of
apparently
mournful
meditation
.




but
besides
his
frequent
absence
,
there
be
another
barrier
to


friendship
with
he
:
he
seem
of
a
reserved
,
an
abstract
,
and
even


of
a
brood
nature
.
zealous
in
his
ministerial
labour
,
blameless
in


his
life
and
habit
,
he
yet
do
not
appear
to
enjoy
that
mental


serenity
,
that
inward
content
,
which
should
be
the
reward
of
every


sincere
christian
and
practical
philanthropist
.
often
,
of
an
evening
,


when
he
sit
at
the
window
,
his
desk
and
paper
before
he
,
he
would


cease
reading
or
writing
,
rest
his
chin
on
his
hand
,
and
deliver


himself
up
to
I
know
not
what
course
of
thought
;
but
that
it
be


perturb
and
exciting
might
be
see
in
the
frequent
flash
and


changeful
dilation
of
his
eye
.




I
think
,
moreover
,
that
Nature
be
not
to
he
that
treasury
of
delight


it
be
to
his
sister
.
he
express
once
,
and
but
once
in
my
hearing
,
a


strong
sense
of
the
rugged
charm
of
the
hill
,
and
an
inborn
affection


for
the
dark
roof
and
hoary
wall
he
call
his
home
;
but
there
be


more
of
gloom
than
pleasure
in
the
tone
and
word
in
which
the


sentiment
be
manifest
;
and
never
do
he
seem
to
roam
the
moor
for


the
sake
of
their
soothe
silence
—
never
seek
out
or
dwell
upon
the


thousand
peaceful
delight
they
could
yield
.




incommunicative
as
he
be
,
some
time
elapse
before
I
have
an


opportunity
of
gauge
his
mind
.
I
first
get
an
idea
of
its
calibre


when
I
hear
he
preach
in
his
own
church
at
Morton
.
I
wish
I
could


describe
that
sermon
:
but
it
be
past
my
power
.
I
can
not
even
render


faithfully
the
effect
it
produce
on
I
.




it
begin
calm
—
and
indeed
,
as
far
as
delivery
and
pitch
of
voice
go
,


it
be
calm
to
the
end
:
an
earnestly
feel
,
yet
strictly
restrain
zeal


breathe
soon
in
the
distinct
accent
,
and
prompt
the
nervous


language
.
this
grow
to
force
—
compress
,
condense
,
control
.
the


heart
be
thrill
,
the
mind
astonish
,
by
the
power
of
the
preacher
:


neither
be
soften
.
throughout
there
be
a
strange
bitterness
;
an


absence
of
consolatory
gentleness
;
stern
allusion
to
Calvinistic


doctrine
—
election
,
predestination
,
reprobation
—
be
frequent
;
and
each


reference
to
these
point
sound
like
a
sentence
pronounce
for
doom
.


when
he
have
do
,
instead
of
feel
well
,
calm
,
more
enlighten


by
his
discourse
,
I
experience
an
inexpressible
sadness
;
for
it
seem


to
I
—
I
know
not
whether
equally
so
to
other
—
that
the
eloquence
to


which
I
have
be
listen
have
spring
from
a
depth
where
lie
turbid


dreg
of
disappointment
—
where
move
troubling

Mr.
St.

say
nothing


to
I
yet
about
the
employment
he
have
promise
to
obtain
for
I
;
yet
it


become
urgent
that
I
should
have
a
vocation
of
some
kind
.
one
morning
,


be
leave
alone
with
he
a
few
minute
in
the
parlour
,
I
venture
to


approach
the
window
-
recess
—
which
his
table
,
chair
,
and
desk
consecrate


as
a
kind
of
study
—
and
I
be
go
to
speak
,
though
not
very
well


know
in
what
word
to
frame
my
inquiry
—
for
it
be
at
all
time


difficult
to
break
the
ice
of
reserve
glass
over
such
nature
as


his
—
when
he
save
I
the
trouble
by
be
the
first
to
commence
a


dialogue
.




look
up
as
I
draw
near—“You
have
a
question
to
ask
of
I
?
"
he
say
.




"
yes
;
I
wish
to
know
whether
you
have
hear
of
any
service
I
can
offer


myself
to
undertake
?
"




"
I
find
or
devise
something
for
you
three
week
ago
;
but
as
you


seem
both
useful
and
happy
here
—
as
my

have
evidently
become


attach
to
you
,
and
your
society
give
they
unusual
pleasure
—
I
deem


it
inexpedient
to
break
in
on
your
mutual
comfort
till
their


approach
departure
from
Marsh
End
should
render
yours
necessary

"




"

day
now

I
say
.




"
yes
;

when
they
go
,
I
shall
return
to
the
parsonage
at
Morton
:


Hannah
will
accompany
I
;

this
old
house
will
be
shut
up
.
"




I
wait
a
few
moment
,
expect
he
would
go
on
with
the
subject
first


broached
:
but
he
seem
to
have
enter
another
train
of
reflection
:


his
look
denote
abstraction
from
I
and
my
business
.
I
be
oblige
to


recall
he
to
a
theme
which
be
of
necessity
one
of
close
and
anxious


interest
to
I
.




"
what
be
the
employment
you
have
in
view
,
Mr.
Rivers
?
I
hope
this
delay


will
not
have
increase
the
difficulty
of
secure
it
.
"




"
oh
,
no
;
since
it
be
an
employment

depend
only
on
I
to
give

you
to
accept

"




he
again
pause
:
there
seem
a
reluctance
to
continue
.
I
grow


impatient
:
a
restless
movement
or
two
,
and
an
eager
and
exacting
glance


fasten
on
his
face
,
convey
the
feeling
to
he
as
effectually
as


word
could
have
do
,
and
with
less
trouble
.




"
you
need
be
in
no
hurry
to
hear
,
"
he
say
:
"
let
I
frankly
tell
you

nothing

a
quiet
,


deep
voice

with
an
unflushed

coruscate
radiance

he
resume
—




"

I

myself
poor

I
can

you

of
poverty
and
obscurity
.
_
you
_
may
even
think
it
degrade

for
I
see


now
your
habit
have
be
what
the
world
call
refine

your
taste


lean
to
the

at

be

_
I
_
consider
that
no

can
well


our

he
again
paused—“proceed

he
look
at
I
before

XXXI






my
home
,
then
,
when
I
at
last
find
a
home,—is
a
cottage
;
a
little
room


with
whitewash
wall
and
a
sanded
floor
,
contain
four
paint


chair
and
a
table
,
a
clock
,
a
cupboard
,
with
two
or
three
plate
and


dish
,
and
a
set
of
tea
-
thing
in
delf
.
above
,
a
chamber
of
the
same


dimension
as
the
kitchen
,
with
a
deal
bedstead
and
chest
of
drawer
;


small
,
yet
too
large
to
be
fill
with
my
scanty
wardrobe
:
though
the


kindness
of
my
gentle
and
generous
friend
have
increase
that
,
by
a


modest
stock
of
such
thing
as
be
necessary
.




it
be
evening
.
I
have
dismiss
,
with
the
fee
of
an
orange
,
the
little


orphan
who
serve
I
as
a
handmaid
.
I
be
sit
alone
on
the
hearth
.


this
morning
,
the
village
school
open
.
I
have
twenty
scholar
.
but


three
of
the
number
can
read
:
none
write
or
cipher
.
several
knit
,
and
a


few
sew
a
little
.
they
speak
with
the
broad
accent
of
the
district
.


at
present
,
they
and
I
have
a
difficulty
in
understand
each
other
’s


language
.
some
of
they
be
unmannered
,
rough
,
intractable
,
as
well
as


ignorant
;
but
other
be
docile
,
have
a
wish
to
learn
,
and
evince
a


disposition
that
please
I
.
I
must
not
forget
that
these
coarsely
-
clothe


little
peasant
be
of
flesh
and
blood
as
good
as
the
scion
of


gentle
genealogy
;
and
that
the
germ
of
native
excellence
,


refinement
,
intelligence
,
kind
feeling
,
be
as
likely
to
exist
in
their


heart
as
in
those
of
the
well
-
bear
.
my
duty
will
be
to
develop
these


germ
:
surely
I
shall
find
some
happiness
in
discharge
that
office
.


much
enjoyment
I
do
not
expect
in
the
life
open
before
I
:
yet
it


will
,
doubtless
,
if
I
regulate
my
mind
,
and
exert
my
power
as
I
ought
,


yield
I
enough
to
live
on
from
day
to
day
.




be
I
very
gleeful
,
settled
,
content
,
during
the
hour
I
pass
in


yonder
bare
,
humble
schoolroom
this
morning
and
afternoon
?
not
to


deceive
myself
,
I
must
reply
—
no
:
I
feel
desolate
to
a
degree
.
I


feel
—
yes
,
idiot
that
I
be
—
I
feel
degraded
.
I
doubt
I
have
take
a
step


which
sink
instead
of
raise
I
in
the
scale
of
social
existence
.
I


be
weakly
dismayed
at
the
ignorance
,
the
poverty
,
the
coarseness
of


all
I
hear
and
see
round
I
.
but
let
I
not
hate
and
despise
myself


too
much
for
these
feeling
;
I
know
they
to
be
wrong
—
that
be
a
great


step
gain
;
I
shall
strive
to
overcome
they
.
to
-
morrow
,
I
trust
,
I


shall
get
the
well
of
they
partially
;
and
in
a
few
week
,
perhaps
,


they
will
be
quite
subdue
.
in
a
few
month
,
it
be
possible
,
the


happiness
of
see
progress
,
and
a
change
for
the
well
in
my


scholar
may
substitute
gratification
for
disgust
.




meantime
,
let
I
ask
myself
one
question
—
which
be
better?—To
have


surrender
to
temptation
;
listen
to
passion
;
make
no
painful


effort
—
no
struggle;—but
to
have
sink
down
in
the
silken
snare
;
fall


asleep
on
the
flower
cover
it
;
waken
in
a
southern
clime
,
amongst


the
luxury
of
a
pleasure
villa
:
to
have
be
now
live
in
France
,


Mr.
Rochester
’s
mistress
;
delirious
with
his
love
half
my
time
—
for
he


would
—
oh
,
yes
,
he
would
have
love
I
well
for
a
while
.
he
_
do
_
love


I
—
no
one
will
ever
love
I
so
again
.
I
shall
never
more
know
the
sweet


homage
give
to
beauty
,
youth
,
and
grace
—
for
never
to
any
one
else


shall
I
seem
to
possess
these
charm
.
he
be
fond
and
proud
of
I
—
it
be


what
no
man
besides
will
ever
be.—But
where
be
I
wander
,
and
what
be


I
say
,
and
above
all
,
feel
?
whether
be
it
well
,
I
ask
,
to
be
a


slave
in
a
fool
’s
paradise
at
Marseilles
—
fevere
with
delusive
bliss


one
hour
—
suffocate
with
the
bitter
tear
of
remorse
and
shame
the


next
—
or
to
be
a
village
-
schoolmistress
,
free
and
honest
,
in
a
breezy


mountain
nook
in
the
healthy
heart
of
England
?




yes
;
I
feel
now
that
I
be
right
when
I
adhere
to
principle
and
law
,


and
scorn

to

choice

I
thank
his
providence
for
the


guidance
!




having
bring
my
eventide
musing
to
this
point
,
I
rise
,
go
to
my


door
,
and
look
at
the
sunset
of
the
harvest
-
day
,
and
at
the
quiet


field
before
my
cottage
,
which
,
with
the
school
,
be
distant
half
a


mile
from
the
village
.
the
bird

their
last
strain

the
air

mild
,
the
dew

balm
.
"






while
I
look
,
I
think
myself
happy
,
and
be
surprised
to
find


myself
ere
long
weeping
—
and
why
?
for
the
doom
which
have
reave
I
from


adhesion
to
my
master
:
for
he
I
be
no
more
to
see
;
for
the
desperate


grief
and
fatal
fury
—
consequence
of
my
departure
—
which
might
now
,


perhaps
,
be
drag
he
from
the
path
of
right
,
too
far
to
leave
hope


of
ultimate
restoration
thither
.
at
this
thought
,
I
turn
my
face


aside
from
the
lovely
sky
of
eve
and
lonely
vale
of
Morton
—
I
say


_
lonely
_
,
for
in
that
bend
of
it
visible
to
I
there
be
no
building


apparent
save
the
church
and
the
parsonage
,
half
-
hid
in
tree
,
and
,


quite
at
the
extremity
,
the
roof
of
Vale
Hall
,
where
the
rich
Mr.


Oliver
and
his
daughter
live
.
I
hide
my
eye
,
and
leant
my
head
against


the
stone
frame
of
my
door
;
but
soon
a
slight
noise
near
the
wicket

shut
in
my
tiny
garden

I
think

have


make
a
mistake
in

ministry

its
uniform
duty
weary
I


to
death

burn
for
the
more
active
life

for
the
more


exciting
toil
of
a
literary
career
—
for
the
destiny
of
an
artist
,


author
,
orator

anything
rather
than
that
of

votary

consider
;
my


life

so
wretched

it
must
be

rise

an
errand

conflict

human
weakness

I
know
I
shall
overcome

chapter
XXXII






I
continue
the
labour
of
the
village
-
school
as
actively
and


faithfully
as
I
could
.
it
be
truly
hard
work
at
first
.
some
time


elapse
before
,
with
all
my
effort
,
I
could
comprehend
my
scholar
and


their
nature
.
wholly
untaught
,
with
faculty
quite
torpid
,
they
seem


to
I
hopelessly
dull
;
and
,
at
first
sight
,
all
dull
alike
:
but
I
soon


find
I
be
mistaken
.
there
be
a
difference
amongst
they
as
amongst


the
educate
;
and
when
I
get
to
know
they
,
and
they
I
,
this
difference


rapidly
develop
itself
.
their
amazement
at
I
,
my
language
,
my
rule
,


and
way
,
once
subside
,
I
find
some
of
these
heavy
-
look
,
gape


rustic
wake
up
into
sharp
-
witted
girl
enough
.
many
show
themselves


obliging
,
and
amiable
too
;
and
I
discover
amongst
they
not
a
few


example
of
natural
politeness
,
and
innate
self
-
respect
,
as
well
as
of


excellent
capacity
,
that
win
both
my
goodwill
and
my
admiration
.
these


soon
take
a
pleasure
in
do
their
work
well
,
in
keep
their
person


neat
,
in
learn
their
task
regularly
,
in
acquire
quiet
and
orderly


manner
.
the
rapidity
of
their
progress
,
in
some
instance
,
be
even


surprising
;
and
an
honest
and
happy
pride
I
take
in
it
:
besides
,
I


begin
personally
to
like
some
of
the
good
girl
;
and
they
like
I
.
I


have
amongst
my
scholar
several
farmer
’
daughter
:
young
woman
grow
,


almost
.
these
could
already
read
,
write
,
and
sew
;
and
to
they
I
teach


the
element
of
grammar
,
geography
,
history
,
and
the
fine
kind
of


needlework
.
I
find
estimable
character
amongst
they
—
character


desirous
of
information
and
dispose
for
improvement
—
with
whom
I
pass


many
a
pleasant
evening
hour
in
their
own
home
.
their
parent
then


(
the
farmer
and
his
wife
)
load
I
with
attention
.
there
be
an


enjoyment
in
accept
their
simple
kindness
,
and
in
repay
it
by
a


consideration
—
a
scrupulous
regard
to
their
feeling
—
to
which
they
be


not
,
perhaps
,
at
all
time
accustomed
,
and
which
both
charm
and


benefit
they
;
because
,
while
it
elevate
they
in
their
own
eye
,
it


make
they
emulous
to
merit
the
deferential
treatment
they
receive
.




I
feel
I
become
a
favourite
in
the
neighbourhood
.
whenever
I
go
out
,


I
hear
on
all
side
cordial
salutation
,
and
be
welcome
with


friendly
smile
.
to
live
amidst
general
regard
,
though
it
be
but
the


regard
of
work
people
,
be
like

at
this


period
of

life
,
my
heart
far
oftener
swell
with
thankfulness
than


sink
with
dejection

and
yet
,
reader
,
to
tell
you
all
,
in
the
midst
of


this
calm
,
this
useful
existence
—
after
a
day
pass
in
honourable


exertion
amongst
my
scholar
,
an
evening
spend
in
draw
or
read


contentedly
alone
—
I
use
to
rush
into
strange
dream
at
night
:
dream


many
-
colour
,
agitated
,
full
of
the
ideal
,
the
stirring
,
the


stormy
—
dream
where
,
amidst
unusual
scene
,
charge
with
adventure
,


with
agitate
risk
and
romantic
chance
,
I
still
again
and
again
meet


Mr.
Rochester
,
always
at
some
exciting
crisis
;
and
then
the
sense
of


be
in
his
arm
,
hear
his
voice
,
meet
his
eye
,
touch
his


hand
and
cheek
,
love
he
,
be
love
by
he
—
the
hope
of
pass
a


lifetime
at
his
side
,
would
be
renew
,
with
all
its
first
force
and


fire
.
then
I
awake
.
then
I
recall
where
I
be
,
and
how
situated
.
then


I
rise
up
on
my
curtainless
bed
,
tremble
and
quiver
;
and
then
the


still
,
dark
night
witness
the
convulsion
of
despair
,
and
hear
the


burst
of
passion
.
by
nine
o’clock
the
next
morning
I
be
punctually


open
the
school
;
tranquil
,
settle
,
prepare
for
the
steady
duty


of

,
I
fear
,
do
the
eye
of
the


visitress
pierce
the
young
pastor
’s
heart
.
a
sort
of
instinct
seem
to


warn
he
of
her
entrance
,
even
when
he
do
not
see
it
;
and
when
he
be


look
quite
away
from
the
door
,
if
she
appear
at
it
,
his
cheek


would
glow
,
and
his
marble
-
seem
feature
,
though
they
refuse
to


relax
,
change
indescribably
,
and
in
their
very
quiescence
become


expressive
of
a
repressed
fervour
,
strong
than
work
muscle
or


dart
glance
could
indicate
.




of
course
,
she
know
her
power
:
indeed
,
he
do
not
,
because
he
could


not
,
conceal
it
from
she
.
in
spite
of
his
christian
stoicism
,
when
she


go
up
and
address
he
,
and
smile
gaily
,
encouragingly
,
even
fondly


in
his
face
,
his
hand
would
tremble
and
his
eye
burn
.
he
seem
to
say
,


with
his
sad
and
resolute
look
,
if
he
do
not
say
it
with
his
lip
,
"
I


love
you
,
and
I
know
you
prefer
I

it
be
not
despair
of
success
that


keep
I
dumb
.
if
I
offer
my
heart
,
I
believe
you
would
accept
it
.


but
that
heart
be
already
lay
on
a
sacred
altar
:
the
fire
be
arrange


round
it
.
it
will
soon
be
no
more
than
a
sacrifice
consume
.
"




and
then
she
would
pout
like
a
disappointed
child
;
a
pensive
cloud


would
soften
her
radiant
vivacity
;
she
would
withdraw
her
hand
hastily


from
his
,
and
turn
in
transient
petulance
from
his
aspect
,
at
once
so


heroic
and
so
martyr
-
like
.
St.
John
,
no
doubt
,
would
have
give
the


world
to
follow
,
recall
,
retain
she
,
when
she
thus
leave
he
;
but
he


would
not
give
one
chance
of
heaven
,
nor
relinquish
,
for
the
elysium
of


her
love
,
one
hope
of
the
true
,
eternal
Paradise
.
besides
,
he
could
not


bind
all
that
he
have
in
his
nature
—
the
rover
,
the
aspirant
,
the
poet
,


the
priest
—
in
the
limit
of
a
single
passion
.
he
could
not
—
he
would


not
—
renounce
his
wild
field
of
mission
warfare
for
the
parlour
and
the


peace
of
Vale
Hall
.
I
learn
so
much
from
himself
in
an
inroad

once
,


despite
his
reserve

the
daring

Miss
Oliver

honour
I
with
frequent
visit
to
my
cottage
.
I


have
learn
her
whole
character
,
which
be
without
mystery
or
disguise
:


she
be
coquettish
but
not
heartless
;
exact
,
but
not
worthlessly


selfish
.
she
have
be
indulge
from
her
birth
,
but
be
not
absolutely


spoilt
.
she
be
hasty
,
but
good
-
humoured
;
vain
(
she
could
not
help
it
,


when
every
glance
in
the
glass
show
she
such
a
flush
of
loveliness

,


but
not
affect
;
liberal
-
handed
;
innocent
of
the
pride
of
wealth
;


ingenuous
;
sufficiently
intelligent
;
gay
,
lively
,
and
unthinking
:
she


be
very
charming
,
in
short
,
even
to
a
cool
observer
of
her
own
sex


like
I
;
but
she
be
not
profoundly
interesting
or
thoroughly


impressive
.
a
very
different
sort
of
mind
be
hers
from
that
,
for


instance
,
of
the
sister
of
St.
John
.
still
,
I
like
she
almost
as
I


like
my
pupil
Adèle

that
,
for
a
child
whom
we

watch


over
and
teach

close
affection

we
can
give
an


equally
attractive
adult
acquaintance

an
amiable
caprice

I
reply
;
and
I
feel
a
thrill
of
artist
-
delight
at


the
idea
of
copying
from
so
perfect
and
radiant
a
model

she
have

wave
over
her
shoulder

all
the
wild
grace
of
natural
curl

I
take
a
sheet
of
fine
card

board
,


and
draw
a
careful
outline
.
I
promise
myself
the
pleasure
of
colour


it

,
as
it
be
get
late

I
tell

she
must
come

sit


another
day

she
make
such
a
report
of

to
her
father

that
Mr.

accompany

a
tall

head
man

at
whose
side
his
lovely
daughter
look
like
a
bright


flower
near
a
hoary
turret
.
he
appear
a
taciturn
,
and
perhaps
a
proud


personage
;

he
be
very
kind
to
I
.
the
sketch
of
Rosamond

portrait
please
he
highly
:
he
say
I
must
make
a
finish
picture
of


it

he
insist
,
too
,
on
my
come
the
next
day
to
spend
the
evening
at


Vale
Hall

I
find
it
a

handsome
residence

abundant


evidence

the
proprietor

full
of
glee

pleasure
all
the
time
I
stay

her
father
be
affable
;
and
when
he


enter
into
conversation
with
I
after
tea
,
he
express
in
strong


term
his
approbation
of
what
I
have
do
in
Morton
school
,
and
say
he


only
fear
,
from
what
he
see
and
hear
,
I
be
too
good
for
the
place
,

would
soon
quit
it

one
more
suitable
.




"
indeed

cry
Rosamond

clever
enough
to
be
a
governess

a


high
family

"




I
think
I
would
far
rather
be
where
I
be
than
in
any
high
family
in


the
land
.
Mr.
Oliver
speak
of
Mr.
Rivers
—
of
the
Rivers
family
—
with


great
respect
.
he
say
it
be
a
very
old
name
in
that
neighbourhood
;


that
the
ancestor
of
the
house
be
wealthy
;
that
all
Morton
have
once


belong
to
they
;
that
even
now
he
consider
the
representative
of


that
house
might
,
if
he
like
,
make
an
alliance
with
the
good
.
he


account
it
a
pity
that
so
fine
and
talente
a
young
man
should
have


form
the
design
of
go
out
as
a
missionary
;
it
be
quite
throw
a


valuable
life
away
.
it
appear
,
then
,
that
her
father
would
throw
no


obstacle
in
the
way
of
Rosamond
’s
union
with
St.
John
.
Mr.
Oliver


evidently
regard
the
young
clergyman
’s
good
birth
,
old
name
,
and


sacred
profession
as
sufficient
compensation
for
the
want
of
fortune
.




it
be
the
5th
of
November
,
and
a
holiday
.

little
servant
,
after


help
I
to
clean
my
house

well
satisfied
with
the
fee

I
have
also
make
myself


neat
,
and
have
now
the
afternoon
before
I
to
spend

I
would
.




the
translation
of
a
few
page
of
German
occupy
an
hour
;
then
I
get


my
palette
and
pencil
,

fall
to
the
more
soothing
,

easy


occupation

the
drapery


to
shade
off
;
a
touch
of
carmine
,
too
,
to
add
to
the
ripe
lip
—
a
soft


curl
here
and
there
to
the

a
deep
tinge
to
the
shadow
of
the


lash
under
the
azured
eyelid

in
the
execution

those
genuine

often
vouchsafed
to
the
fortunate
public
of
those

courage

I
will
not

wet
hair

the
hollow

sorrow

Moor
House
I
be
,
and
hard
I
work
;
and
so
do
Hannah
:
she


be
charm
to
see
how
jovial
I
could
be
amidst
the
bustle
of
a
house


turn
topsy
-
turvy
—
how
I
could
brush
,
and
dust
,
and
clean
,
and
cook
.


and
really
,
after
a
day
or
two
of
confusion
worse
confound
,
it
be


delightful
by
degree
to
invoke
order
from
the
chaos
ourselves
have


make
.
I
have
previously
take
a
journey
to
S
—
—
to
purchase
some
new


furniture
:
my
cousin
having
give
I
_
carte
blanche
_
to
effect
what


alteration
I
please
,
and
a
sum
having
be
set
aside
for
that


purpose
.
the
ordinary
sitting
-
room
and
bedroom
I
leave
much
as
they


be
:
for
I
know
Diana
and
Mary
would
derive
more
pleasure
from
see


again
the
old
homely
table
,
and
chair
,
and
bed
,
than
from
the


spectacle
of
the
smart
innovation
.
still
some
novelty
be


necessary
,
to
give
to
their
return
the
piquancy
with
which
I
wish
it


to
be
invest
.
dark
handsome
new
carpet
and
curtain
,
an
arrangement


of
some
carefully
select
antique
ornament
in
porcelain
and
bronze
,


new
covering
,

mirror
,

dressing
-
case
,
for
the
toilet
table
,


answer
the
end
:
they
look
fresh
without
be
glare
.
a
spare


parlour
and
bedroom
I
refurnish
entirely
,
with
old
mahogany
and


crimson
upholstery
:
I
lay
canvas
on
the
passage
,
and
carpet
on
the


stair
.
when
all
be
finish
,
I
think
Moor
House
as
complete
a
model


of
bright
modest
snugness
within
,
as
it
be
,
at
this
season
,
a
speciman


of
wintry
waste
and
desert
dreariness
without
.




the
eventful
Thursday
at
length
come
.
they
be
expect
about
dark
,


and
ere
dusk
fire
be
light
upstairs

;
the
kitchen
be
in


perfect
trim
;
Hannah
and
I
be
dressed
,
and
all
be
in
readiness
.




St.
John
arrive
first
.
I
have
entreat
he
to
keep
quite
clear
of
the


house
till
everything
be
arrange
:
and
,
indeed
,
the
bare
idea
of
the


commotion
,
at
once
sordid
and
trivial
,
go
on
within
its
wall


suffice
to
scare
he
to
estrangement
.
he
find
I
in
the
kitchen
,


watch
the
progress
of
certain
cake
for
tea
,
then
bake
.


approach
the
hearth
,
he
ask
,
"
if
I
be
at
last
satisfied
with


housemaid
’s
work
?
"
I
answer
by
invite
he
to
accompany
I
on
a


general
inspection
of
the
result
of
my
labour
.
with
some
difficulty
,
I


get
he
to
make
the
tour
of
the
house
.
he
just
look
in
at
the
door
I


open
;
and
when
he
have
wander
upstairs
and
downstairs
,
he
say
I


must
have
go
through
a
great
deal
of
fatigue
and
trouble
to
have


effect
such
considerable
change
in
so
short
a
time
:
but
not
a


syllable
do
he
utter
indicate
pleasure
in
the
improved
aspect
of
his


abode
.




this
silence
damp
I
.
I
think
perhaps
the
alteration
have
disturb


some
old
association
he
value
.
I
inquire
whether
this
be
the
case
:


no
doubt
in
a
somewhat
crest
-
fall
tone
.




"
not
at
all
;
he
have
,
on
the
contrary
,
remark
that
I
have
scrupulously


respect
every
association
:
he
fear
,
indeed
,
I
must
have
bestow


more
thought
on
the
matter
than
it
be
worth
.
how
many
minute
,
for


instance
,
have
I
devoted
to
study
the
arrangement
of
this
very


room?—by
-
the
-
bye
,
could
I
tell
he
where
such
a
book
be
?
"




I
show
he
the
volume
on
the
shelf
:
he
take
it
down
,
and
withdraw


to
his
accustomed
window
recess
,
he
begin
to
read
it
.




now
,
I
do
not
like
this
,
reader
.
St.
John
be
a
good
man
;
but
I
begin


to
feel
he
have
speak
truth
of
himself
when
he
say
he
be
hard
and


cold
.
the
humanity
and
amenity
of
life
have
no
attraction
for


he
—
its
peaceful
enjoyment
no
charm
.
literally
,
he
live
only
to


aspire
—
after
what
be
good
and
great
,
certainly
;
but
still
he
would


never
rest
,
nor
approve
of
other
rest
round
he
.
as
I
look
at
his


lofty
forehead
,
still
and
pale
as
a
white
stone
—
at
his
fine
lineament


fix
in
study
—
I
comprehend
all
at
once
that
he
would
hardly
make
a


good
husband
:
that
it
would
be
a
try
thing
to
be
his
wife
.
I


understand
,
as
by
inspiration
,
the
nature
of
his
love
for
Miss
Oliver
;


I
agree
with
he
that
it
be
but
a
love
of
the
sense
.
I
comprehend


how
he
should
despise
himself
for
the
feverish
influence
it
exercise


over
he
;
how
he
should
wish
to
stifle
and
destroy
it
;
how
he
should


mistrust
its
ever
conduct
permanently
to
his
happiness
or
her
.
I


see
he
be
of
the
material
from
which
nature
hew
her
hero
—
Christian


and
Pagan
—
her
lawgiver
,
her
statesman
,
her
conqueror
:
a
steadfast


bulwark
for
great
interest
to
rest
upon
;
but
,
at
the
fireside
,
too


often
a
cold
cumbrous
column
,
gloomy
and
out
of
place
.




"
this
parlour
be
not
his
sphere
,
"
I
reflect
:
"
the
himalayan
ridge
or


Caffre
bush
,
even
the
plague
-
curse
Guinea
Coast
swamp
would
suit
he


well
.
well
may
he
eschew
the
calm
of
domestic
life
;
it
be
not
his


element
:
there
his
faculty
stagnate
—
they
can
not
develop
or
appear
to


advantage
.
it
be
in
scene
of
strife
and
danger
—
where
courage
be


prove
,
and
energy
exercise
,
and
fortitude
task
—
that
he
will
speak


and
move
,
the
leader
and
superior
.
a
merry
child
would
have
the


advantage
of
he
on
this
hearth
.
he
be
right
to
choose
a
missionary
’s


career
—
I
see
it
now
.
"




"

cry
Hannah
,
throw
open
the


parlour
door
.
at
the
same
moment
old
Carlo
bark
joyfully
.
out
I
run
.


it
be
now
dark
;
but
a
rumbling
of
wheel
be
audible
.
Hannah
soon
have


a
lantern
light
.
the
vehicle
have
stop
at
the
wicket
;
the
driver
open


the
door

first
one
well
-
know
form
,
then
another
,
step
out
.
in
a


minute
I
have
my
face
under
their
bonnet
,
in
contact
first
with
Mary
’s


soft
cheek
,
then
with
Diana
’s
flow
curl
.
they
laugh
—
kiss


I
—
then
Hannah
:
pat
Carlo
,
who
be
half
wild
with
delight
;
ask


eagerly
if
all
be
well
;
and
be
assure
in
the
affirmative
,
hasten


into
the
house
.




they
be
stiff
with
their
long
and
jolt
drive
from
Whitcross
,
and


chill
with
the
frosty
night
air
;
but
their
pleasant
countenance


expand
to
the
cheerful
firelight
.
while
the
driver
and
Hannah
bring


in
the
box
,
they
demand
St.
John
.
at
this
moment
he
advance
from


the
parlour
.
they
both
throw
their
arm
round
his
neck
at
once
.
he
give


each
one
quiet
kiss
,
say
in
a
low
tone
a
few
word
of
welcome
,
stand
a


while
to
be
talk
to
,
and
then
,
intimate
that
he
suppose
they
would


soon
rejoin
he
in
the
parlour
,
withdraw
there
as
to
a
place
of
refuge
.




I
have
light
their
candle
to
go
upstairs
,
but
Diana
have
first
to
give


hospitable
order
respect
the
driver
;
this
do
,
both
follow
I
.


they
be
delighted
with
the
renovation
and
decoration
of

the

merry

"




the
first
time
I
find
St.
John
alone
after
this
communication
,
I
feel


tempt
to
inquire
if
the
event
distress
he
:
but
he
seem
so
little


to
need
sympathy
,
that
,
so
far
from
venture
to
offer
he
more
,
I


experience
some
shame
at
the
recollection
of
what
I
have
already


hazard
.
besides
,
I
be
out
of
practice
in
talk
to
he
:
his
reserve


be
again
freeze
over
,
and
my
frankness
be
congeal
beneath
it
.
he


have
not
keep
his
promise
of
treat
I
like
his
sister
;
he


continually
make
little
chilling
difference
between
we
,
which
do
not


at
all
tend
to
the
development
of
cordiality
:
in
short
,
now
that
I
be


acknowledge
his
kinswoman
,
and
live
under
the
same
roof
with
he
,
I


feel
the
distance
between
we
to
be
far
great
than
when
he
have
know


I
only
as
the
village
schoolmistress
.
when
I
remember
how
far
I
have


once
be
admit
to
his
confidence
,
I
could
hardly
comprehend
his


present
frigidity
.




such
be
the
case
,
I
feel
not
a
little
surprised
when
he
raise
his


head
suddenly
from
the
desk
over
which
he
be
stoop
,
and
say
—




"
you
see
,
Jane
,
the
battle
be
fight

the
victory

"




startled
at
be
thus
address
,
I
do
not
immediately
reply
:
after
a


moment
’s
hesitation
I
answer
—




"
but
be
you
sure
you
be
not
in
the
position
of
those
conqueror

triumph
have
cost
they
too
dear

would
not
such
another

you

"




"
I
think
not
;
and
if
I
be
,
it
do
not
much
signify
;
I
shall
never
be


call
upon
to
contend
for
such
another
.
the
event
of
the
conflict

decisive
:
my
way
be
now
clear
;
I
thank
God
for
it
!
"
so
say
,
he


return
to
his
paper
and
his
silence
.




as
our
mutual
happiness
(
_
i.e.
_
,
Diana
’s
,
Mary
’s
,
and
mine
)
settle


into
a
quieter
character
,
and
we
resume
our
usual
habit
and
regular


study
,
St.
John
stay
more
at
home
:
he
sit
with
we
in
the
same
room
,


sometimes
for
hour
together
.
while
Mary
draw
,
Diana
pursue
a
course


of
encyclopædic
reading
she
have
(
to
my
awe
and
amazement
)
undertake
,


and
I
fag
away
at
German
,
he
ponder
a
mystic
lore
of
his
own
:
that


of
some
eastern
tongue
,
the
acquisition
of
which
he
think
necessary


to
his
plan
.




thus
engage
,
he
appear
,
sit
in
his
own
recess
,
quiet
and


absorb
enough
;
but
that
blue
eye
of
his
have
a
habit
of
leave
the


outlandish
-
look
grammar
,
and
wander
over
,
and
sometimes
fix


upon
we
,
his
fellow
-
student
,
with
a
curious
intensity
of
observation
:


if
catch
,
it
would
be
instantly
withdraw
;
yet
ever
and
anon
,
it


return
searchingly
to
our
table
.
I
wonder
what
it
mean
:
I


wonder
,
too
,
at
the
punctual
satisfaction
he
never
fail
to
exhibit


on
an
occasion
that
seem
to
I
of
small
moment
,
namely
,
my
weekly


visit
to
Morton
school
;
and
still
more
be
I
puzzle
when
,
if
the
day


be
unfavourable
,
if
there
be
snow
,
or
rain
,
or
high
wind
,
and
his


sister
urge
I
not
to
go
,
he
would
invariably
make
light
of
their


solicitude
,
and
encourage
I
to
accomplish
the
task
without
regard
to


the
element
.




"
jane
be
not
such
a
weakling
as
you
would
make
she
,
"
he
would
say
:
"
she


can
bear
a
mountain
blast
,
or
a
shower
,
or
a
few
flake
of
snow
,
as


well
as
any
of
we
.
her
constitution
be
both
sound
and
elastic;—better


calculate
to
endure
variation
of
climate
than
many
more
robust
.
"




and
when
I
return
,
sometimes
a
good
deal
tired
,
and
not
a
little


weather
-
beat
,
I
never
dare
complain
,
because
I
see
that
to
murmur


would
be
to
vex
he
:
on
all
occasion
fortitude
please
he
;
the


reverse
be
a
special
annoyance
.




one
afternoon
,
however
,
I
get
leave
to
stay
at
home
,
because
I
really


have
a
cold
.
his
sister
be
go
to
Morton
in
my
stead
:
I
sit
read


schiller
;
he
,
decipher
his
crab
oriental
scroll
.
as
I
exchange


a
translation
for
an
exercise
,
I
happen
to
look
his
way
:
there
I


find
myself
under
the
influence
of
the
ever
-
watchful
blue
eye
.
how


long
it
have
be
search
I
through
and
through
,
and
over
and
over
,
I


can
not
tell
:
so
keen
be
it
,
and
yet
so
cold
,
I
feel
for
the
moment


superstitious
—
as
if
I
be
sit
in
the
room
with
something
uncanny
.




"
jane
,
what
be

?
"




"

"

"
in

I
must
have
it
so

I
will
tell
you
why
.
"




he
then
go
on
to
explain
that
Hindostanee
be
the
language
he
be


himself
at
present
studying
;
that
,
as
he
advance
,
he
be
apt
to
forget


the
commencement
;
that
it
would
assist
he
greatly
to
have
a
pupil
with


whom
he
might
again
and
again
go
over
the
element
,
and
so
fix
they


thoroughly
in
his
mind
;
that
his
choice
have
hover
for
some
time


between
I
and
his
sister
;
but
that
he
have
fix
on
I
because
he
see


I
could
sit
at
a
task
the
long
of
the
three
.
would
I
do
he
this


favour
?
I
should
not
,
perhaps
,
have
to
make
the
sacrifice
long
,
as
it


want
now
barely
three
month
to
his
departure
.




St.
John
be
not
a
man
to
be
lightly
refuse
:
you
feel
that
every


impression
make
on
he
,
either
for
pain
or
pleasure
,
be
deep
-
grave


and
permanent
.
I
consent
.
when
Diana
and
Mary
return
,
the

both
she

Mary
agree
that
St.
John
should
never

persuade
they


to
such
a
step
.
he
answer
quietly
—




"
I
know
it
.
"




I
find
he
a
very
patient
,
very
forbearing
,
and
yet
an
exact


master
:
he
expect
I
to
do
a
great
deal
;
and
when
I
fulfil
his


expectation
,
he
,
in
his
own
way
,
fully
testify
his
approbation
.
by


degree
,
he
acquire
a
certain
influence
over
I
that
take
away
my


liberty
of
mind
:
his
praise
and
notice
be
more
restraining
than
his


indifference
.
I
could
no
long
talk
or
laugh
freely
when
he
be
by
,


because
a
tiresomely
importunate
instinct
remind
I
that
vivacity
(
at


least
in
I
)
be
distasteful
to
he
.
I
be
so
fully
aware
that
only


serious
mood
and
occupation
be
acceptable
,
that
in
his
presence


every
effort
to
sustain
or
follow
any
other
become
vain
:
I
fall
under
a


freeze
spell
.
when
he
say
"
go

"
I
go
;
"
come

"
I
come
;
"
do

I

my

"




she
push
I
towards
he
.
I
think
Diana
very
provoking
,
and
feel


uncomfortably
confused
;
and
while
I
be
thus
think
and
feeling
,
St.


John
bend
his
head
;
his
greek
face
be
bring
to
a
level
with
mine
,


his
eye
question
my
eye
piercingly
—
he
kiss
I
.
there
be
no
such


thing
as
marble
kiss
or
ice
kiss
,
or
I
should
say
my


ecclesiastical
cousin
’s
salute
belong
to
one
of
these
class
;
but


there
may
be
experiment
kiss
,
and
his
be
an
experiment
kiss
.
when


give
,
he
view
I
to
learn
the
result
;
it
be
not
strike
:
I
be
sure


I
do
not
blush
;
perhaps
I
might
have
turn
a
little
pale
,
for
I
feel


as
if
this
kiss
be
a
seal
affix
to
my
fetter
.
he
never
omit
the


ceremony
afterwards
,
and
the
gravity
and
quiescence
with
which
I


undergo
it
,
seem
to
invest
it
for
he
with
a
certain
charm
.




as
for
I
,
I
daily
wish
more
to
please
he
;
but
to
do
so
,
I
feel


daily
more
and
more
that
I
must
disown
half
my
nature
,
stifle
half
my


faculty
,
wr
my
taste
from
their
original
bent
,
force
myself
to


the
adoption
of
pursuit
for
which
I
have
no
natural
vocation
.
he
want


to
train
I
to
an
elevation
I
could
never
reach
;
it
rack
I
hourly
to


aspire
to
the
standard
he
uplift
.
the
thing
be
as
impossible
as
to


mould
my
irregular
feature
to
his
correct
and
classic
pattern
,
to
give


to
my
changeable
green
eye
the
sea
-
blue
tint
and
solemn
lustre
of
his


own
.




not
his
ascendancy
alone
,
however
,
hold
I
in
thrall
at
present
.
of


late
it
have
be
easy
enough
for
I
to
look
sad
:
a
cankering
evil
sit


at
my
heart
and
drain
my
happiness
at
its
source
—
the
evil
of


suspense
.




perhaps
you
think
I
have
forget
Mr.
Rochester
,
reader
,
amidst
these


change
of
place
and
fortune
.
not
for
a
moment
.
his
idea
be
still
with


I
,
because
it
be
not
a
vapour
sunshine
could
disperse
,
nor
a


sand
-
trace
effigy
storm
could
wash
away
;
it
be
a
name
grave
on
a


tablet
,
fate
to
last
as
long
as
the
marble
it
inscribe
.
the
craving


to
know
what
have
become
of
he
follow
I
everywhere
;
when
I
be
at


Morton
,
I
re
-
enter
my
cottage
every
evening
to
think
of
that
;
and
now


at
Moor
House
,
I
seek
my
bedroom
each
night
to
brood
over
it
.




in
the
course
of
my
necessary
correspondence
with
Mr.
Briggs
about
the


will
,
I
have
inquire
if
he
know
anything
of
Mr.
Rochester
’s
present


residence
and
state
of
health
;
but
,
as
St.
John
have
conjecture
,
he
be


quite
ignorant
of
all
concern
he
.
I
then
write
to
Mrs.
Fairfax
,


entreat
information
on
the
subject
.
I
have
calculate
with
certainty


on
this
step
answer
my
end
:
I
feel
sure
it
would
elicit
an
early


answer
.
I
be
astonish
when
a
fortnight
pass
without
reply
;
but


when
two
month
wear
away
,
and
day
after
day
the
post
arrive
and


bring
nothing
for
I
,
I
fall
a
prey
to
the
keen
anxiety
.




I
write
again
:
there
be
a
chance
of
my
first
letter
having
miss
.


renew
hope
follow
renew
effort
:
it
shine
like
the
former
for
some


week
,
then
,
like
it
,
it
fade
,
flickered
:
not
a
line
,
not
a
word


reach
I
.
when
half
a
year
waste
in
vain
expectancy
,
my
hope
die


out
,
and
then
I
feel
dark
indeed
.




a
fine
spring
shine
round
I
,
which
I
could
not
enjoy
.
summer


approach
;
Diana
try
to
cheer
I
:
she
say
I
look
ill
,
and
wish


to
accompany
I
to
the
sea
-
side
.
this
St.
John
oppose
;
he
say
I
do


not
want
dissipation
,
I
want
employment
;
my
present
life
be
too


purposeless
,
I
require
an
aim
;
and
,
I
suppose
,
by
way
of
supply


deficiency
,
he
prolong
still
far
my
lesson
in
Hindostanee
,
and


grow
more
urgent
in
require
their
accomplishment
:
and
I
,
like
a
fool
,


never
think
of
resist
he
—
I
could
not
resist
he
.




one
day
I
have
come
to
my
study
in
low
spirit
than
usual
;
the
ebb


be
occasion
by
a
poignantly
feel
disappointment
.
Hannah
have
tell
I


in
the
morning
there
be
a
letter
for
I
,
and
when
I
go
down
to
take


it
,
almost
certain
that
the
long
-
look
for
tiding
be
vouchsafe
I


at
last
,
I
find
only
an
unimportant
note
from
Mr.
Briggs
on
business
.


the
bitter
check
have
wring
from
I
some
tear
;
and
now
,
as
I
sat
pore


over
the
crab
character
and
flourish
trope
of
an
indian
scribe
,


my
eye
fill
again
.




St.
John
call
I
to
his
side
to
read
;
in
attempt
to
do
this
my


voice

:

be

in

and
I
be
the
only


occupant
of
the
parlour
:
Diana
be

her
music
in
the


drawing

room
,
Mary
be
garden
—
it
be
a
very
fine
May
day
,
clear
,


sunny
,
and
breezy
.
my
companion
express
no
surprise
at
this
emotion
,


nor
do
he
question
I
as
to
its
cause
;
he
only
say
—




"
we
will
wait
a
few
minute
,
Jane
,
till
you
be
more
composed
.
"
and


while
I
smother
the
paroxysm
with
all
haste
,
he
sit
calm
and
patient
,


lean
on
his
desk
,
and
look
like
a
physician
watch
with
the
eye


of
science
an
expect
and
fully
understand
crisis
in
a
patient
’s


malady
.
having
stifle
my
sob
,
wipe
my
eye
,
and
mutter
something


about
not
be
very
well
that
morning
,
I
resume
my
task
,
and


succeed
in
complete
it
.
St.
John
put
away
my
book
and
his
,
lock


his
desk
,
and
say
—




"

,
Jane
,
you
shall
take
a
walk
;
and
with
I

"




"
I
will
call
Diana
and
Mary
.
"




"
no
;
I
want
only
one
companion
this
morning
,
and
that
must
be
you
.
put


on
your
thing
;
go
out
by
the
kitchen
-
door
:
take
the
road
towards
the


head
of
Marsh
Glen
:
I
will
join
you
in
a
moment
.
"




I
know
no
medium
:
I
never
in
my
life
have
know
any
medium
in
my


dealing
with
positive
,
hard
character
,
antagonistic
to
my
own
,


between
absolute
submission
and
determined
revolt
.
I
have
always


faithfully
observe
the
one
,
up
to
the
very
moment
of
bursting
,


sometimes
with
volcanic
vehemence
,
into
the
other
;
and
as
neither


present
circumstance
warrant
,
nor
my
present
mood
incline
I
to


mutiny
,
I
observe
careful
obedience
to
St.
John
’s
direction
;
and
in


ten
minute
I
be
tread
the
wild
track
of
the
glen
,
side
by
side


with
he
.




the
breeze
be
from
the
west
:
it
come
over
the
hill
,
sweet
with
scent


of
heath
and
rush
;
the
sky
be
of
stainless
blue
;
the
stream
descend


the
ravine
,
swell
with
past
spring
rain
,
pour
along
plentiful
and


clear
,
catch
golden
gleam
from
the
sun
,
and
sapphire
tint
from
the


firmament
.
as
we
advance
and
leave
the
track
,
we
trod
a
soft
turf
,


mossy
fine
and
emerald
green
,
minutely
enamelled
with
a
tiny
white


flower
,
and
spangle
with
a
star
-
like
yellow
blossom
:
the
hill
,


meantime
,
shut
we
quite
in
;
for
the
glen
,
towards
its
head
,
wound
to


their
very
core
.




"
let
we
rest
here
,
"
say
St.
John
,
as
we
reach
the
first
straggler


of
a
battalion
of
rock
,
guard
a
sort
of
pass
,
beyond
which
the
beck


rush
down
a
waterfall
;
and
where
,
still
a
little
far
,
the


mountain
shake
off
turf
and
flower
,
have
only
heath
for
raiment
and
crag


for
gem
—
where
it
exaggerate
the
wild
to
the
savage
,
and
exchange
the


fresh
for
the
frowning
—
where
it
guard
the
forlorn
hope
of
solitude
,


and
a
last
refuge
for
silence
.




I
take
a
seat
:
St.
John
stand
near
I
.
he
look
up
the
pass
and
down


the
hollow
;
his
glance
wander
away
with
the
stream
,
and
return
to


traverse
the
unclouded
heaven
which
colour
it
:
he
remove
his
hat
,


let
the
breeze
stir
his
hair
and
kiss
his
brow
.
he
seem
in
communion


with
the
genius
of
the
haunt
:
with
his
eye
he
bid
farewell
to


something
.




"
and
I
shall
see
it
again
,
"
he
say
aloud
,
"
in
dream
when
I
sleep
by


the
Ganges
:
and
again
in
a
more
remote
hour
—
when
another
slumber


overcome
I
—
on
the
shore
of
a
dark

contrive
to
impress
I


momently
with
the
conviction
that
I
be
put
beyond
the
pale
of
his


favour
.




not
that
St.

harbour
a
spirit
of
unchristian
vindictiveness

not


that
he
would
have
injure
a
hair
of
my
head
,
if
it
have
be
fully
in


his
power
to
do
so
.
both
by
nature
and
principle
,
he
be
superior
to


the
mean
gratification
of
vengeance
:
he
have
forgive
I
for
say
I


scorn
he
and
his
love

he
have
not
forget
the
word
;

as


long
as
he
and
I
live
he
never
would
forget
they
.
I
see
by
his
look
,


when
he
turn
to
I
,
that
they
be
always
write
on
the
air
between


I
and
he
;
whenever
I
speak
,
they
sound
in
my
voice
to
his
ear
,
and


their
echo
tone
every
answer
he
give
I
.




he
do
not
abstain
from
converse
with
I

he
even
call
I
as
usual


each
morning
to
join
he
at
his
desk
;
and
I
fear
the
corrupt
man
within


he
have
a
pleasure
unimparte
to
,
and
unshare
by
,
the
pure
christian
,


in
evince
with
what
skill
he
could
,
while
act
and
speak


apparently
just
as
usual
,
extract
from
every
deed
and
every
phrase
the


spirit
of
interest
and
approval
which
have
formerly
communicate
a


certain
austere
charm
to
his
language

manner
.
to
I
,
he
be
in


reality
become
no
long
flesh
,
but
marble
;
his
eye
be
a
cold
,
bright
,


blue
gem
;
his
tongue
a
speak
instrument
—
nothing
more
.




all
this
be
torture
to
I
—
refine

linger
torture
.
it
keep
up
a


slow
fire
of
indignation

a
tremble
trouble

grief

harass

crush
I
altogether

this


good
man

pure
as
the

sunless
source

soon
kill
I
,
without


draw
from
my
vein
a
single
drop
of
blood
,

receive
on
his
own


crystal
conscience
the
faint
stain
of
crime

terror
those
cold

never

his
fine
voice


sound
at

so
sweet

full

never

his
manner

so


impressive
in
its
noble
simplicity

when
he

the
oracle
of


God

voice
take
a

a

the

veneration
so
strong
that
its
impetus
thrust
I


at

to
the
point
I
have
so
long
shunned
.
I
be
tempt

with
he

to
rush
down
the
torrent
of
his

into
the
gulf


of
his
existence

there
lose
my

St.

see
nothing

I
hear
a
voice
somewhere
cry
—




"

I
listen

low

I
break
from
St.

a
different


way
to
St.

effective
in
its

very
near
a
Mighty
Spirit

my
soul
rush
out
in


gratitude
at
his
foot

rise
from
the
thanksgiving
—
take
a
resolve

down

brief
absence

,
I
hear
St.
John
quit
his
room
.
he
stop
at
my
door
:
I


fear
he
would
knock
—
no

a
slip
of
paper
be
pass
under

door

I
take
it
up
.
it
bear
these
word
—




"

an

the

overcast
and
chilly
:
rain


beat
fast
on
my
casement
.
I
hear
the
front

door
open
,
and
St.
John


pass
out
.
look
through
the
window
,
I
see
he
traverse
the
garden
.
he


take
the
way
over
the
misty
moor
in
the
direction
of
Whitcross
—
there


he
would
meet
the
coach
.




"

a
few
more
hour

shall
succeed
you
in
that
track

think
I
:
"
I
too
have
a
coach
to
meet
at
Whitcross
.
I
too
have
some
to


see
and
ask
after
in
England
,
before
I
depart
for
ever
.
"




it
want
yet
two
hour
of
breakfast
-
time
.
I
fill
the
interval
in


walk
softly
about
my
room
,
and
ponder
the
visitation
which
have


give
my
plan
their
present
bent
.
I
recall
that
inward
sensation
I


have
experience
:
for
I
could
recall
it
,
with
all
its
unspeakable


strangeness
.
I
recall
the
voice
I
have
hear
;
again
I
question


whence
it
come
,
as
vainly
as
before
:
it
seem
in
_
me_—not
in
the


external
world
.
I
ask
be
it
a
mere
nervous
impression
—
a
delusion
?
I


could
not
conceive
or
believe
:
it
be
more
like
an
inspiration
.
the


wondrous
shock
of
feeling
have
come
like
the
earthquake
which
shake
the


foundation
of
Paul
and
Silas
’s
prison
;
it
have
open
the
door
of
the


soul
’s
cell
and
loose
its
band
—
it
have
waken
it
out
of
its
sleep
,


whence
it
spring
tremble
,
listen
,
aghast
;
then
vibrate
thrice
a


cry
on
my
startled
ear
,
and
in
my
quake
heart
and
through
my
spirit
,


which
neither
fear
nor
shake
,
but
exult
as
if
in
joy
over

success

"




at
breakfast
I
announce
to
Diana
and
Mary
that
I
be
go
a
journey
,


and
should
be
absent
at
least
four
day
.




"

"
they
ask
.




"
yes
;
it
be
to
see
or
hear
news
of
a
friend
about
whom
I
have
for
some


time
be
uneasy
.
"




they
might
have
say
,
as
I
have
no
doubt
they
think
,
that
they
have


believe
I
to
be
without
any
friend
save
they
:
for
,
indeed
,
I
have


often
say
so
;
but
,
with
their
true
natural
delicacy
,
they
abstain


from
comment
,
except
that
Diana
ask
I
if
I
be
sure
I
be
well


enough
to
travel
.
I
look
very
pale
,
she
observe
.
I
reply
,
that


nothing
ail
I
save
anxiety
of
mind
,
which
I
hope
soon
to
alleviate
.




it
be
easy
to
make
my
further
arrangement
;
for
I
be
trouble
with
no


inquiry
—
no
surmise
.
having
once
explain
to
they
that
I
could
not


now
be
explicit
about
my
plan
,
they
kindly
and
wisely
acquiesce
in


the
silence
with
which
I
pursue
they
,
accord
to
I
the
privilege
of


free
action
I
should
under
similar
circumstance
have
accord
they
.




I
leave
Moor
House
at
three
o’clock
P.M.
,
and
soon
after
four
I
stand
at


the
foot
of
the
sign

post
of
Whitcross
,
wait
the
arrival
of
the


coach
which
be
to
take
I
to
distant
Thornfield
.
amidst
the
silence
of


those
solitary
road
and
desert
hill
,
I
hear
it
approach
from
a
great


distance
.
it
be
the
same
vehicle
whence
,
a
year
ago
,
I
have
alight


one
summer
evening
on
this
very
spot
—
how
desolate
,
and
hopeless
,
and


objectless
!
it
stop
as
I
beckon
.
I
enter
—
not
now
oblige
to
part


with
my
whole
fortune
as
the
price
of
its
accommodation
.
once
more
on


the
road
to
Thornfield
,
I
feel
like
the
messenger
-
pigeon
fly
home
.




it
be
a
journey
of
six
-
and
-
thirty
hour
.
I
have
set
out
from
Whitcross


on
a
Tuesday
afternoon
,

early
on
the
succeed
Thursday
morning


the
coach
stop
to
water
the
horse
at
a
wayside
inn
,
situate
in
the


midst
of
scenery

green
hedge

large
field
and
low
pastoral


hill
(
how
mild
of
feature
and
verdant
of
hue
compare
with
the
stern


North

Midland
moor
of
Morton

)
meet
my
eye
like
the
lineament
of
a


once
familiar
face
.
yes
,
I
know
the
character
of
this
landscape
:
I
be


sure
we
be
near
my
bourne
.




"
how
far
be
Thornfield
Hall
from
here

out

a
box

into

charge

call
for

be
go

brightening
day

your
master

the
British
Channel

you
hasten
,

nothing

his
presence

the
monitor

your
doubt

suggestion

sensible
,

yet
I
could
not
force
myself
to
act
on


it
.
I
so
dread
a
reply
that
would
crush
I
with
despair
.
to
prolong


doubt
be
to
prolong
hope

I
might
yet
once
more
see
the
Hall
under
the


ray
of
her
star
.
there
be
the
stile
before
I

the
very
field
through


which
I
have
hurry
,
blind
,

distract
with
a
revengeful
fury


track
and
scourge

the
morning

flee
from

they
.
how
fast
I
walk
!
how
I
run
sometimes
!
how
I
look
forward
to


catch
the
first
view
of
the
well
-
know
wood
!
with
what
feeling
I


welcome
single
tree
I
know
,
and
familiar
glimpse
of
meadow
and
hill


between
they
!




at
last
the
wood
rise
;
the
rookery
cluster
dark
;
a
loud
cawing
break


the
morning
stillness
.
strange
delight
inspire
I
:
on
I
hasten
.


another
field
cross
—
a
lane
thread
—
and
there
be
the
courtyard


wall
—
the
back
office
:
the
house
itself
,
the
rookery
still
hide
.
"
my


first
view
of
it
shall
be
in
front
,
"
I
determine
,
"
where
its
bold


battlement
will
strike
the
eye
nobly
at
once
,
and
where
I
can
single


out
my
master
’s
very
window
:
perhaps
he
will
be
stand
at
it
—
he
rise


early
:
perhaps
he
be
now
walk
in
the
orchard
,
or
on
the
pavement
in


front
.
could
I
but
see
him!—but
a
moment
!
surely
,
in
that
case
,
I


should
not
be
so
mad
as
to
run
to
he
?
I
can
not
tell
—
I
be
not
certain
.


and
if
I
do
—
what
then
?
God
bless
he
!
what
then
?
who
would
be
hurt
by


my
once
more
taste
the
life
his
glance
can
give
I
?
I
rave
:
perhaps


at
this
moment
he
be
watch
the
sun
rise
over
the
Pyrenees
,
or
on
the


tideless
sea
of
the
south
.
"




I
have
coast
along
the
low
wall
of
the
orchard
—
turn
its
angle
:


there
be
a
gate
just
there
,
open
into
the
meadow
,
between
two
stone


pillar
crown
by
stone
ball
.
from
behind
one
pillar
I
could
peep


round
quietly
at
the
full
front
of
the
mansion
.
I
advance
my
head
with


precaution
,
desirous
to
ascertain
if
any
bedroom
window
-
blind
be
yet


draw
up
:
battlement
,
window
,
long
front
—
all
from
this
sheltered


station
be
at
my
command
.




the
crow
sail
overhead
perhaps
watch
I
while
I
take
this
survey
.


I
wonder
what
they
think
.
they
must
have
consider
I
be
very


careful
and
timid
at
first
,
and
that
gradually
I
grow
very
bold
and


reckless
.
a
peep
,
and
then
a
long
stare
;
and
then
a
departure
from
my


niche
and
a
straying
out
into
the
meadow
;
and
a
sudden
stop
full
in


front
of
the
great
mansion
,
and
a
protract
,
hardy
gaze
towards
it
.


"
what
affectation
of
diffidence
be
this
at
first
?
"
they
might
have


demand
;
"
what
stupid
regardlessness
now
?
"




hear
an
illustration
,
reader
.




a
lover
find
his
mistress
asleep
on
a
mossy
bank
;
he
wish
to
catch
a


glimpse
of
her
fair
face
without
wake
she
.
he
steal
softly
over
the


grass
,
careful
to
make
no
sound
;
he
pause
—
fancy
she
have
stir
:
he


withdraw
:
not
for
world
would
he
be
see
.
all
be
still
:
he
again


advance
:
he
bend
above
she
;
a
light
veil
rest
on
her
feature
:
he


lift
it
,
bend
lower
;
now
his
eye
anticipate
the
vision
of


beauty
—
warm
,
and
blooming
,
and
lovely
,
in
rest
.
how
hurried
be
their


first
glance
!
but
how
they
fix
!
how
he
start
!
how
he
suddenly
and


vehemently
clasp
in
both
arm
the
form
he
dare
not
,
a
moment
since
,


touch
with
his
finger
!
how
he
call
aloud
a
name
,
and
drop
his
burden
,


and
gaze
on
it
wildly
!
he
thus
grasp
and
cry
,
and
gaze
,
because
he


no
long
fear
to
waken
by
any
sound
he
can
utter
—
by
any
movement
he


can
make
.
he
think
his
love
sleep
sweetly
:
he
find
she
be
stone


dead
.




I
look
with
timorous
joy
towards
a
stately
house
:
I
see
a
blacken


ruin
.




no
need
to
cower
behind
a
gate
-
post
,
indeed!—to
peep
up
at
chamber


lattice
,
fear
life
be
astir
behind
they
!
no
need
to
listen
for


door
opening
—
to
fancy
step
on
the
pavement
or
the
gravel
-
walk
!
the


lawn
,
the
ground
be
trodden
and
waste
:
the
portal
yawned
void
.
the


front
be
,
as
I
have
once
see
it
in
a
dream
,
but
a
shell
-
like
wall
,


very
high
and
very
fragile
-
look
,
perforate
with
paneless
window
:


no
roof
,
no
battlement
,
no
chimney
—
all
have
crash
in
.




and
there
be
the
silence
of
death
about
it
:
the
solitude
of
a
lonesome


wild
.
no
wonder
that
letter
address
to
people
here
have
never


receive
an
answer
:
as
well
despatch
epistle
to
a
vault
in
a
church


aisle
.
the
grim
blackness
of
the
stone
tell
by
what
fate
the
Hall
have


fall
—
by
conflagration
:
but
how
kindle
?
what
story
belong
to
this


disaster
?
what
loss
,
besides
mortar
and
marble
and
wood
-
work
have


follow
upon
it
?
have
life
be
wreck
as
well
as
property
?
if
so
,


whose
?
dreadful
question
:
there
be
no
one
here
to
answer
it
—
not
even


dumb
sign
,
mute
token
.




in
wander
round
the
shatter
wall
and
through
the
devastated


interior
,
I
gather
evidence
that
the
calamity
be
not
of
late


occurrence
.
winter
snow
,
I
think
,
have
drift
through
that
void


arch
,
winter
rain
beat
in
at
those
hollow
casement
;
for
,
amidst
the


drench
pile
of
rubbish
,
spring
have
cherish
vegetation
:
grass
and


weed
grow
here
and
there
between
the
stone
and
fall
rafter
.
and
oh
!


where
meantime
be
the
hapless
owner
of
this
wreck
?
in
what
land
?
under


what
auspex
?
my
eye
involuntarily
wander
to
the
grey
church
tower


near
the
gate
,
and
I
ask
,
"
be
he
with
Damer
de
Rochester
,
share


the
shelter
of
his
narrow
marble
house
?
"




some
answer
must
be
have
to
these
question
.
I
could
find
it
nowhere
but


at
the
inn
,
and
thither
,
ere
long
,
I
return
.
the
host
himself
bring


my
breakfast
into
the
parlour

I
request
he
to
shut
the
door
and
sit


down

I
have
some
question
to
ask
he
.
but
when
he
comply
,
I
scarcely


know
how
to
begin
;
such
horror
have
I
of
the
possible
answer
.
and
yet


the
spectacle
of
desolation
I
have
just
leave
prepare
I
in
a
measure


for
a
tale
of
misery

quite
certain

nobody

she
,

set

go

she
have
a
woman
to
take

call


Mrs.

an
able

in

very
trustworthy

for
one


fault

a
fault
common
to
a

of
they
nurse

matrons—_she
keep
a


private
bottle
of

she
_
,

now
and
then
take
a
drop
over

much
.


it
be
excusable
,
for
she
have
a
hard
life
of
it
:

still
it
be


dangerous
;
for
when
Mrs.
Poole
be
fast
asleep
after
the
gin
and
water
,


the
mad
lady
,
who
be
as
cunning
as
a
witch
,
would
take
the
key
out
of


her
pocket
,
let
herself
out
of
her
chamber
,

go
roam
about
the


house
,
do
any
wild
mischief
that
come
into
her
head
.
they
say
she


have
nearly
burn
her
husband
in
his
bed
once
:
but
I
do
n’t
know
about


that
.
however
,
on
this
night
,
she
set
fire
first
to
the
hanging
of
the


room
next
her
own
,
and
then
she
get
down
to
a
low
storey
,
and
make


her
way
to
the
chamber
that
have
be
the
governess’s—(she
be
like
as


if
she
know
somehow
how
matter
have
go
on
,
and
have
a
spite
at


her)—and
she
kindle
the
bed
there
;

there
be
nobody
sleep
in


it
,
fortunately

never

in
its
front
;
the


window
be
lattice
and
narrow
:
the
front
door
be
narrow
too
,
one


step
lead
up
to
it
.
the
whole
look
,
as
the
host
of
the
Rochester
Arms


have
say
,
"
quite
a
desolate
spot
.
"
it
be
as
still
as
a
church
on
a


week
-
day
:
the
pattering
rain
on
the
forest
leave
be
the
only
sound


audible
in
its
vicinage
.




"
can
there
be
life
here
?
"
I
ask
.




yes
,
life
of
some
kind
there
be
;
for
I
hear
a
movement
—
that
narrow


front
-
door
be
unclose
,
and
some
shape
be
about
to
issue
from
the


grange
.




it
open
slowly
:
a
figure
come
out
into
the
twilight
and
stand
on
the


step
;
a
man
without
a
hat
:
he
stretch
forth
his
hand
as
if
to
feel


whether
it
rain
.
Dusk
as
it
be
,
I
have
recognise
he
—
it
be
my


master
,
Edward
Fairfax
Rochester
,
and
no
other
.




I
stay
my
step
,
almost
my
breath
,
and
stand
to
watch
he
—
to
examine


he
,
myself
unseen
,
and
ala
!
to
he
invisible
.
it
be
a
sudden


meeting
,
and
one
in
which
rapture
be
keep
well
in
check
by
pain
.
I
have


no
difficulty
in
restrain
my
voice
from
exclamation
,
my
step
from


hasty
advance
.




his
form
be
of
the
same
strong
and
stalwart
contour
as
ever
:
his
port


be
still
erect
,
his
hair
be
still
raven
black
;
nor
be
his
feature


alter
or
sink
:
not
in
one
year
’s
space
,
by
any
sorrow
,
could
his


athletic
strength
be
quell
or
his
vigorous
prime
blight
.
but
in
his


countenance
I
see
a
change
:
that
look
desperate
and
brood
—
that


remind
I
of
some
wrong
and
fettered
wild
beast
or
bird
,
dangerous


to
approach
in
his
sullen
woe
.
the
cage
eagle
,
whose
gold
-
ring
eye


cruelty
have
extinguish
,
might
look
as
look
that
sightless
Samson
.




and
,
reader
,
do
you
think
I
fear
he
in
his
blind
ferocity?—if
you


do
,
you
little
know
I
.
a
soft
hope
blent
with
my
sorrow
that
soon
I


should
dare
to
drop
a
kiss
on
that
brow
of
rock
,
and
on
those
lip
so


sternly
seal
beneath
it
:
but
not
yet
.
I
would
not
accost
he
yet
.




he
descend
the
one
step
,
and
advance
slowly
and
gropingly
towards


the
grass
-
plat
.
where
be
his
dare
stride
now
?
then
he
pause
,
as
if


he
know
not
which
way
to
turn
.
he
lift
his
hand
and
open
his


eyelid
;
gaze
blank
,
and
with
a
straining
effort
,
on
the
sky
,
and


toward
the
amphitheatre
of
tree
:
one
see
that
all
to
he
be
void


darkness
.
he
stretch
his
right
hand
(
the
left
arm
,
the
mutilated
one
,


he
keep
hide
in
his
bosom
)
;
he
seem
to
wish
by
touch
to
gain
an


idea
of
what
lie
around
he
:
he
meet
but
vacancy
still
;
for
the
tree


be
some
yard
off
where
he
stand
.
he
relinquish
the
endeavour
,


fold
his
arm
,
and
stand
quiet
and
mute
in
the
rain
,
now
fall
fast


on
his
uncovered
head
.
at
this
moment
John
approach
he
from
some


quarter
.




"
will
you
take
my
arm
,
sir
?
"
he
say
;
"
there
be
a
heavy
shower
come


on
:
have
you
not
well
go
in
?
"




"
let
I
alone
,
"
be
the
answer
.




John
withdraw
without
having
observe
I
.
Mr.
Rochester
now
try
to


walk
about
:
vainly,—all
be
too
uncertain
.
he
grope
his
way
back
to


the
house
,
and
,
re
-
enter
it
,
close
the
door
.




I
now
draw
near
and
knock
:
John
’s
wife
open
for
I
.
"
Mary
,
"
I
say
,


"
how
be
you
?
"




she
start
as
if
she
have
see
a
ghost
:
I
calm
she
.
to
her
hurried


"
be
it
really
you
,
miss
,
come
at
this
late
hour
to
this
lonely
place
?
"


I
answer
by
take
her
hand
;
and
then
I
follow
she
into
the


kitchen
,
where
John
now
sit
by
a
good
fire
.
I
explain
to
they
,
in
few


word
,
that
I
have
hear
all
which
have
happen
since
I
leave
Thornfield
,


and
that
I
be
come
to
see
Mr.
Rochester
.
I
ask
John
to
go
down
to


the
turn
-
pike
-
house
,
where
I
have
dismiss
the
chaise
,
and
bring
my


trunk
,
which
I
have
leave
there
:
and
then
,
while
I
remove
my
bonnet
and


shawl
,
I
question
Mary
as
to
whether
I
could
be
accommodate
at
the


Manor
House
for
the
night
;
and
find
that
arrangement
to
that


effect
,
though
difficult
,
would
not
be
impossible
,
I
inform
she
i


should
stay
.
just
at
this
moment
the
parlour
-
bell
rang
.




"
when
you
go
in

"
say
I
,
"

your
master

"




"

she
answer
;
"

"




when
she
return
,
I
inquire
what
he
have
say
.




"

your
name

she
reply
.
she
then


proceed
to
fill
a
glass
with
water
,
and
place
it
on
a
tray
,
together


with
candle
.




"

I
ask
.




"
yes

I
take

and
fast

Mary
open
the
door
for
I
,

shut
it
behind
I
.

"




I
write
to
Moor
House
and
to
Cambridge
immediately
,
to
say
what
I
have


do
:
fully
explain
also
why
I
have
thus
act
.
Diana
and
Mary


approve
the
step
unreservedly
.
Diana
announce
that
she
would
just


give
I
time
to
get
over
the
honeymoon
,
and
then
she
would
come
and
see


I
.




"
she
have
well
not
wait
till
then
,
Jane
,
"
say
Mr.
Rochester
,
when
I


read
her
letter
to
he
;
"
if
she
do
,
she
will
be
too
late
,
for
our


honeymoon
will
shine
our
life
long
:
its
beam
will
only
fade
over
your


grave
or
mine
.
"




how
St.
John
receive
the
news
,
I
do
n’t
know
:
he
never
answer
the


letter
in
which
I
communicate
it
:
yet
six
month
after
he
write
to
I
,


without
,
however
,
mention
Mr.
Rochester
’s
name
or
allude
to
my


marriage
.
his
letter
be
then
calm
,
and
,
though
very
serious
,
kind
.
he


have
maintain
a
regular
,
though
not
frequent
,
correspondence
ever


since
:
he
hope
I
be
happy
,
and
trust
I
be
not
of
those
who
live


without
God
in
the
world
,
and
only
mind
earthly
thing
.




you
have
not
quite
forget
little
Adèle
,
have
you
,
reader
?
I
have
not
;


I
soon
ask
and
obtain
leave
of
Mr.
Rochester
,
to
go
and
see
she
at


the
school
where
he
have
place
she
.
her
frantic
joy
at
behold
I


again
move
I
much
.
she
look
pale
and
thin
:
she
say
she
be
not


happy
.
I
find
the
rule
of
the
establishment
be
too
strict
,
its


course
of
study
too
severe
for
a
child
of
her
age
:
I
take
her
home
with


I
.
I
mean
to
become
her
governess
once
more
,
but
I
soon
find
this


impracticable
;
my
time
and
care
be
now
require
by
another
—
my


husband
need
they
all
.
so
I
seek
out
a
school
conduct
on
a
more


indulgent
system
,
and
near
enough
to
permit
of
my
visit
she
often
,


and
bring
her
home
sometimes
.
I
take
care
she
should
never
want
for


anything
that
could
contribute
to
her
comfort
:
she
soon
settle
in
she


new
abode
,
become
very
happy
there
,
and
make
fair
progress
in
she


study
.
as
she
grow
up
,
a
sound
english
education
correct
in
a
great


measure
her
french
defect
;
and
when
she
leave
school
,
I
find
in
she
a


pleasing
and
obliging
companion
:
docile
,
good
-
temper
,
and


well
-
principle
.
by
her
grateful
attention
to
I
and
mine
,
she
have
long


since
well
repay
any
little
kindness
I
ever
have
it
in
my
power
to


offer
she
.




my
tale
draw
to
its
close
:
one
word
respect
my
experience
of


marry
life
,
and
one
brief
glance
at
the
fortune
of
those
whose
name


have
most
frequently
recur
in
this
narrative
,
and
I
have
do
.




I
have
now
be
marry
ten
year
.
I
know
what
it
be
to
live
entirely


for
and
with
what
I
love
well
on
earth
.
I
hold
myself
supremely


blest
—
bl
beyond
what
language
can
express
;
because
I
be
my
husband
’s


life
as
fully
as
he
be
mine
.
no
woman
be
ever
near
to
her
mate
than


I
be
:
ever
more
absolutely
bone
of
his
bone
and
flesh
of
his
flesh
.
I


know
no
weariness
of
my
Edward
’s
society
:
he
know
none
of
mine
,
any


more
than
we
each
do
of
the
pulsation
of
the
heart
that
beat
in
our


separate
bosom
;
consequently
,
we
be
ever
together
.
to
be
together
be


for
we
to
be
at
once
as
free
as
in
solitude
,
as
gay
as
in
company
.
we


talk
,
I
believe
,
all
day
long
:
to
talk
to
each
other
be
but
a
more


animated
and
an
audible
thinking
.
all
my
confidence
be
bestow
on
he
,


all
his
confidence
be
devoted
to
I
;
we
be
precisely
suited
in


character
—
perfect
concord
be
the
result
.




Mr.
Rochester
continue
blind
the
first
two
year
of
our
union
;
perhaps


it
be
that
circumstance
that
draw
we
so
very
near
—
that
knit
we
so
very


close
:
for
I
be
then
his
vision
,
as
I
be
still
his
right
hand
.


literally
,
I
be
(
what
he
often
call
I
)
the
apple
of
his
eye
.
he
see


nature
—
he
see
book
through
I
;
and
never
do
I
weary
of
gaze
for
his


behalf
,
and
of
put
into
word
the
effect
of
field
,
tree
,
town
,


river
,
cloud
,
sunbeam
—
of
the
landscape
before
we
;
of
the
weather
round


we
—
and
impress
by
sound
on
his
ear
what
light
could
no
long
stamp


on
his
eye
.
never
do
I
weary
of
read
to
he
;
never
do
I
weary
of


conduct
he
where
he
wish
to
go
:
of
do
for
he
what
he
wish


to
be
do
.
and
there
be
a
pleasure
in
my
service
,
most
full
,
most


exquisite
,
even
though
sad
—
because
he
claim
these
service
without


painful
shame
or
damp
humiliation
.
he
love
I
so
truly
,
that
he


know
no
reluctance
in
profit
by
my
attendance
:
he
feel
I
love
he


so
fondly
,
that
to
yield
that
attendance
be
to
indulge
my
sweetest


wish
.




one
morning
at
the
end
of
the
two
year
,
as
I
be
write
a
letter
to


his
dictation
,
he
come
and
bend
over
I
,
and
said—“jane
,
have
you
a


glitter
ornament
round
your
neck
?
"




I
have
a
gold
watch
-
chain
:
I
answer
"
yes
.
"




"
and
have
you
a
pale
blue
dress
on
?
"






and
have
you
a
pale
blue
dress
on
?




I
have
.
he
inform
I
then
,
that
for
some
time
he
have
fancy
the


obscurity
cloud
one
eye
be
become
less
dense
;
and
that
now
he
be


sure
of
it
.




he
and
I
go
up
to
London
.
he
have
the
advice
of
an
eminent
oculist
;


and
he
eventually
recover
the
sight
of
that
one
eye
.
he
can
not
now


see
very
distinctly
:
he
can
not
read
or
write
much
;
but
he
can
find
his


way
without
be
lead
by
the
hand
:
the
sky
be
no
long
a
blank
to


he
—
the
earth
no
long
a
void
.
when
his
first
-
bear
be
put
into
his


arm
,
he
could
see
that
the
boy
have
inherit
his
own
eye
,
as
they


once
be
—
large
,
brilliant
,
and
black
.
on
that
occasion
,
he
again
,
with


a
full
heart
,
acknowledge
that
God
have
temper
judgment
with
mercy
.




my
Edward
and
I
,
then
,
be
happy
:
and
the
more
so
,
because
those
we


most
love
be
happy
likewise
.
Diana
and
Mary
Rivers
be
both
married
:


alternately
,
once
every
year
,
they
come
to
see
we
,
and
we
go
to
see


they
.
Diana
’s
husband
be
a
captain
in
the
navy
,
a
gallant
officer
and
a


good
man
.
Mary
’s
be
a
clergyman
,
a
college
friend
of
her
brother
’s
,


and
,
from
his
attainment
and
principle
,
worthy
of
the
connection
.


both
Captain
Fitzjames
and
Mr.
Wharton
love
their
wife
,
and
be
love


by
they
.




as
to
St.
John
Rivers
,
he
leave
England
:
he
go
to
India
.
he
enter
on


the
path
he
have
mark
for
himself
;
he
pursue
it
still
.
a
more


resolute
,
indefatigable
pioneer
never
work
amidst
rock
and
danger
.


firm
,
faithful
,
and
devoted
,
full
of
energy
,
and
zeal
,
and
truth
,
he


labour
for
his
race
;
he
clear
their
painful
way
to
improvement
;
he


hew
down
like
a
giant
the
prejudice
of
creed
and
caste
that
encumber


it
.
he
may
be
stern
;
he
may
be
exact
;
he
may
be
ambitious
yet
;
but


his
be
the
sternness
of
the
warrior
Greatheart
,
who
guard
his
pilgrim


convoy
from
the
onslaught
of
Apollyon
.
his
be
the
exaction
of
the


apostle
,
who
speak
but
for
Christ
,
when
he
says—“whosoever
will
come


after
I
,
let
he
deny
himself
,
and
take
up
his
cross
and
follow
I
.
"


his
be
the
ambition
of
the
high
master
-
spirit
,
which
aim
to
fill
a


place
in
the
first
rank
of
those
who
be
redeem
from
the
earth
—
who


stand
without
fault
before
the
throne
of
God
,
who
share
the
last
mighty


victory
of
the
Lamb
,
who
be
call
,
and
choose
,
and
faithful
.




St.
John
be
unmarried
:
he
never
will
marry
now
.
himself
have
hitherto


suffice
to
the
toil
,
and
the
toil
draw
near
its
close
:
his
glorious


sun
hasten
to
its
setting
.
the
last
letter
I
receive
from
he
draw


from
my
eye
human
tear
,
and
yet
fill
my
heart
with
divine
joy
:
he


anticipate
his
sure
reward
,
his
incorruptible
crown
.
I
know
that
a


stranger
’s
hand
will
write
to
I
next
,
to
say
that
the
good
and


faithful
servant
have
be
call
at
length
into
the
joy
of
his
Lord
.


and
why
weep
for
this
?
no
fear
of
death
will
darken
St.
John
’s
last


hour
:
his
mind
will
be
unclouded
,
his
heart
will
be
undaunted
,
his
hope


will
be
sure
,
his
faith
steadfast
.
his
own
word
be
a
pledge
of
this
—




"
my
Master
,

he
say
,
"
have
forewarn
I
.
Daily
he
announce
more


distinctly,—‘surely
I
come
quickly
!
'
and
hourly
I
more
eagerly


respond,—‘aman
