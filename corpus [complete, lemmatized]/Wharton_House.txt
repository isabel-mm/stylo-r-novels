to
his
work
from


a
hurried
dip
into
the
country
;

what

town
at


that
season
?
if
she
have
appear
to

catch
a
train
,
he
might
have


infer
that
he
have
come
on
she
in
the
act
of
transition
between
one
and


another

dispute
her
presence
after
the

desultory
air
perplex
he
.
she
stand


apart
from
the
crowd
,
let
it
drift
by
she
to
the
platform
or
the


street
,
and
wear
an
air
of
irresolution
which
might
,
as
he
surmise
,


be
the
mask
of
a
very
definite
purpose
.

he
at
once

be
nothing
new
about
Lily
Bart
,
yet
he
could
never
see
she
without


a
faint
movement
of
interest
:
it
be
characteristic
of
she
that
she


always

speculation
,
that
her
simple
act
seem
the
result
of


far
-
reach

.




an
impulse
of
curiosity
make
he
turn
out
of
his
direct
line
to
the
door
,


and
stroll
past
she
.
he
know
that
if
she
do
not
wish
to
be
see
she


would
contrive
to
elude
he
;
and

he
to
think
of
put
she


skill
to
the
test

the
dinginess

section
of
womanhood

a
luxurious
pleasure
in

nearness

modelling
of
she


little
ear

crisp
upward
wave
of
her
hair

it
ever
so
slightly


brighten
by
art?--and
the
thick
planting
of
her
straight
black
lash

about
she

at
once
vigorous

exquisite
,
at
once
strong

fine

a
confused
sense

a
great
deal
to


make

that
a
great
many
dull

way

to


vulgar
clay

analogy

he
unsatisfie
,
for
a
coarse
texture


will
not
take
a
high
finish
;

it
not
possible
that
the
material


be
fine

circumstance

fashion
it
into
a
futile
shape

her
hand
to
Mr.

heedless
of
his
protestation
,


she
spring
into

in

lean
back
with
a
sigh
.
why
must
a
girl
pay
so
dearly


for
her
least
escape
from
routine
?
why
could
one
never
do
a
natural
thing


without
have
to
screen
it
behind
a
structure
of
artifice
?
she
have


yield
to
a
pass
impulse
in
go
to
Lawrence
Selden
's
room
,
and
it


be
so
seldom
that
she
could
allow
herself
the
luxury
of
an
impulse
!
this


one
,
at
any
rate
,
be
go
to
cost
she
rather
more
than
she
could


afford
.
she
be
vex
to
see
that
,
in
spite
of
so
many
year
of


vigilance
,
she
have
blunder
twice
within
five
minute
.
that
stupid
story


about
her
dress
-
maker
be
bad
enough
--
it
would
have
be
so
simple
to


tell
Rosedale
that
she
have
be
take
tea
with
Selden
!
the
mere


statement
of
the
fact
would
have
render
it
innocuous
.
but
,
after
have


let
herself
be
surprised
in
a
falsehood
,
it
be
doubly
stupid
to
snub
the


witness
of
her
discomfiture
.
if
she
have
have
the
presence
of
mind
to
let


Rosedale
drive
she
to
the
station
,
the
concession
might
have
purchase


his
silence
.
he
have
his
race
's
accuracy
in
the
appraisal
of
value
,
and


to
be
see
walk
down
the
platform
at
the
crowded
afternoon
hour
in
the


company
of
Miss
Lily
Bart
would
have
be
money
in
his
pocket
,
as
he


might
himself
have
phrase
it
.
he
know
,
of
course
,
that
there
would
be
a


large
house

at
Bellomont
,
and
the
possibility
of
be
take
for


one
of
Mrs.
Trenor
's
guest
be
doubtless
include
in
his
calculation
.


Mr.
Rosedale
be
still
at
a
stage
in
his
social
ascent
when
it
be
of


importance
to
produce
such
impression
.




the
provoking
part
be
that
Lily
know
all
this
--
know
how
easy
it
would


have
be
to
silence
he
on
the
spot
,
and
how
difficult
it
might
be
to
do


so
afterward
.
Mr.
Simon
Rosedale
be
a
man
who
make
it
his
business
to


know
everything
about
every
one
,
whose
idea
of
show
himself
to
be
at


home
in
society
be
to
display
an
inconvenient
familiarity
with
the


habit
of
those
with
whom
he
wish
to
be
think
intimate
.
Lily
be
sure


that
within
twenty
-
four
hour
the
story
of
she
visit
her
dress
-
maker


at
the
Benedick
would
be
in
active
circulation
among
Mr.
Rosedale
's


acquaintance
.
the
bad
of
it
be
that
she
have
always

and


ignore

.
on
his
first

when
her

training
and
experience
have
teach
she
to
be
hospitable
to


newcomer
,
since
the
most
unpromising
might
be

later
on

plenty
of

the

have
make

Mr.

into
his

without
a

.
he
have
leave
behind
only
the
ripple
of
amusement
which
his
speedy


despatch
have
cause
among
her

later
(

it

Hitherto

,
stick
manfully
to


his
gun
,
show
himself
with
Rosedale
at
the
fashionable
restaurant
,
in


company
with
the
personally
vivid
if
socially
obscure
lady
who
be


available
for
such

but
the

Mr.

,
it
will
be

,
be
thus
far
not
a
factor
to
be


fear
--
unless
one
put
one
's
self
in
his
power
.
and
this
be
precisely


what
Miss
Bart
have
do
.
her
clumsy
fib
have
let
he
see
that
she
have


something
to
conceal
;
and
she
be
sure
he
have
a
score
to
settle
with
she
.


something
in
his
smile
tell
she
he
have
not
forget
.
she
turn
from
the


think
with
a
little
shiver

but
it
hang
on
she
all
the
way
to
the


station
,
and
dog
she
down
the
platform
with
the
persistency
of
Mr.


Rosedale
himself
.




she
have
just
time
to
take
her
seat
before
the
train
start
;
but
have


arrange
herself
in
her
corner
with
the
instinctive
feeling
for
effect


which
never
forsook
she
,
she
glance
about
in
the
hope
of
see
some


other
member
of
the
Trenors
'
party
.
she
want
to
get
away
from
herself
,


and
conversation
be
the
only
mean
of
escape
that
she
know
.




her
search
be
reward
by
the
discovery
of
a
very
blond
young
man
with
a


soft
reddish
beard
,
who
,
at
the
other
end
of
the
carriage
,
appear
to
be


dissemble
himself
behind
an
unfolded
newspaper
.
Lily
's
eye
brighten
,


and
a
faint
smile
relax
the
draw
line
of
her
mouth
.
she
have
know


that
Mr.
Percy
Gryce
be
to
be
at
Bellomont
,
but
she
have
not
count
on


the
luck
of
have
he
to
herself
in
the
train
;
and
the
fact
banish
all


perturb
thought
of
Mr.
Rosedale
.
perhaps
,
after
all
,
the
day
be
to


end
more
favourably
than
it
have
begin
.




she
begin
to
cut
the
page
of
a
novel
,
tranquilly
study
her
prey


through
downcast
lash
while
she
organize
a
method
of
attack
.


something
in
his
attitude
of
conscious
absorption
tell
she
that
he
be


aware
of
her
presence
:
no
one
have
ever
be
quite
so
engrossed
in
an


evening
paper
!
she
guess
that
he
be
too
shy
to
come
up
to
she
,
and


that
she
would
have
to
devise
some
mean
of
approach
which
should
not


appear
to
be
an
advance
on
her
part
.
 
it
amuse
she
to
think
that
any
one


as
rich
as
Mr.
Percy
Gryce
should
be
shy
;
but
she
be
gift
with


treasure
of
indulgence
for
such
idiosyncrasy
,
and
besides
,
his


timidity
might
serve
her
purpose
well
than
too
much
assurance
.
she
have


the
art
of
give
self
-
confidence
to
the
embarrassed
,
but
she
be
not


equally
sure
of
be
able
to
embarrass
the
self
-
confident
.




she
wait
till
the
train
have
emerge
from
the
tunnel
and
be
race


between
the
ragged
edge
of
the
northern
suburb
.
then
,
as
it
lower
its


speed
near
Yonkers
,
she
rise
from
her
seat
and
drift
slowly
down
the


carriage
.
as
she
pass
Mr.
Gryce
,
the
train
give
a
lurch
,
and
he
be


aware
of
a
slend
hand
grip
the
back
of
his
chair
.
he
rise
with
a


start
,
his
ingenuous
face
look
as
though
it
have
be
dip
in


crimson
:
even
the
reddish
tint
in
his
beard
seem
to
deepen
.
the
train


sway
again
,
almost
fling
Miss
Bart
into
his
arm
.




she
steady
herself
with
a
laugh
and
draw
back
;
but
he
be
envelop
in


the
scent
of
her
dress
,
and
his
shoulder
have
feel
her
fugitive
touch
.




"
oh
,
Mr.
Gryce
,
be
it
you
?
I
be
so
sorry
--
I
be
try
to
find
the
porter


and
get
some
tea
.
"




she
hold
out
her
hand
as
the
train
resume
its
level
rush
,
and
they
stand


exchange
a
few
word
in
the
aisle
.
yes
--
he
be
go
to
Bellomont
.
he


have
hear
she
be
to
be
of
the
party
--
he
blush
again
as
he
admit
it
.


and
be
he
to
be
there
for
a
whole
week
?
 
how
delightful
!




but
at
this
point
one
or
two
belate
passenger
from
the
last
station


force
their
way
into
the
carriage

and
Lily
have
to
retreat
to
her
seat
.




"
the
chair
next
to
mine
be
empty
--
do
take
it
,
"
she
say
over
she


shoulder
;
and
Mr.
Gryce
,
with
considerable
embarrassment
,
succeed
in


effect
an
exchange
which
enable
he
to
transport
himself
and
his
bag


to
her
side
.




"
ah
--
and
here
be
the
porter
,
and
perhaps
we
can
have
some
tea
.
"




she
signal
to
that
official
,
and
in
a
moment
,
with
the
ease
that


seem
to
attend
the
fulfilment
of
all
her
wish
,
a
little
table
have


be
set
up
between
the
seat
,
and
she
have
help
Mr.
Gryce
to
bestow
his


encumber
property
beneath
it
.




when
the
tea
come
he
watch
she
in
silent
fascination
while
her
hand


flit
above
the
tray
,
look
miraculously
fine
and
slender
in
contrast


to
the
coarse
china
and
lumpy
bread
.
it
seem
wonderful
to
he
that
any


one
should
perform
with
such
careless
ease
the
difficult
task
of
make


tea
in
public
in
a
lurch
train
.
he
would
never
have
dare
to
order
it


for
himself
,
lest
he
should
attract
the
notice
of
his
fellow
-
passenger
;


but
,
secure
in
the
shelter
of
her
conspicuousness
,
he
sip
the
inky


draught
with
a
delicious
sense
of
exhilaration

with
the
flavour
of

no
great


fancy
to
drown
it
in
the
railway
brew
which
seem
such
nectar
to
she


companion
;
but
,
rightly
judge
that
one
of
the
charm
of
tea
be
the
fact


of
drink
it
together
,
she
proceed
to
give
the
last
touch
to
Mr.

's
enjoyment
by
smile
at

ask


solicitously

he
reply
with
conviction
that
he
have
never
taste


well
tea
.




"
I
daresay
it
be
true
,
"
she
reflect
;
and
her
imagination
be
fire
by


the
thought
that
Mr.
Gryce
,
who
might
have
sound
the
depth
of
the
most


complex
self
-
indulgence
,
be
perhaps
actually
take
his
first
journey


alone
with
a
pretty
woman
.




it
strike
she
as
providential
that
she
should
be
the
instrument
of
his


initiation
.
some
girl
would
not
have
know
how
to
manage
he
.
they
would


have
over
-
emphasize
the
novelty
of
the
adventure
,
try
to
make
he


feel
in
it
the
z
of
an
escapade
.
 
but
Lily
's
method
be
more


delicate
.
she
remember
that
her
cousin
Jack
Stepney
have
once
define


Mr.
Gryce
as
the
young
man
who
have
promise
his
mother
never
to
go
out
in


the
rain
without
his
overshoe
;
and
act
on
this
hint
,
she
resolve
to


impart
a
gently
domestic
air
to
the
scene
,
in
the
hope
that
she


companion
,
instead
of
feel
that
he
be
do
something
reckless
or


unusual
,
would
merely
be
lead
to
dwell
on
the
advantage
of
always
have
a


companion
to
make
one
's
tea
in
the
train
.




but
in
spite
of
her
effort
,
conversation
flag
after
the
tray
have
be


remove
,
and
she
be
drive
to
take
a
fresh
measurement
of
Mr.
Gryce
's


limitation
.
it
be
not
,
after
all
,
opportunity
but
imagination
that
he


lack
:
he
have
a
mental
palate
which
would
never
learn
to
distinguish


between
railway
tea
and
nectar
.
 
there
be
,
however
,
one
topic
she
could


rely
on
:
one
spring
that
she
have
only
to
touch
to
set
his
simple


machinery
in
motion
.
she
have
refrain
from
touch
it
because
it
be
a


last
resource
,
and
she
have
rely
on
other
art
to
stimulate
other


sensation
;
but
as
a
settled
look
of
dulness
begin
to
creep
over
his


candid
feature
,
she
see
that
extreme
measure
be
necessary
.




"
and
how
,
"
she
say
,
lean
forward
,
"
be
you
get
on
with
your


Americana
?
"




his
eye
become
a
degree
less
opaque
:
it
be
as
though
an
incipient
film


have
be
remove
from
it
,
and
she
feel
the
pride
of
a
skilful
operator
.




"
I
've
get
a
few
new
thing
,
"
he
say
,
suffuse
with
pleasure
,
but


lower
his
voice
as
though
he
fear
his
fellow
-
passenger
might
be
in


league
to
despoil
he
.




she
return
a
sympathetic
enquiry
,
and
gradually
he
be
draw
on
to
talk


of
his
late
purchase
.
it
be
the
one
subject
which
enable
he
to


forget
himself
,
or
allow
he
,
rather
,
to
remember
himself
without


constraint
,
because
he
be
at
home
in
it
,
and
could
assert
a
superiority


that
there
be
few
to
dispute
.
hardly
any
of
his
acquaintance
care
for


Americana
,
or
know
anything
about
they
;
and
the
consciousness
of
this


ignorance
throw
Mr.
Gryce
's
knowledge
into
agreeable
relief
.
the
only


difficulty
be
to
introduce
the
topic
and
to
keep
it
to
the
front
;
most


people
show
no
desire
to
have
their
ignorance
dispel
,
and
Mr.
Gryce


be
like
a
merchant
whose
warehouse
be
cram
with
an
unmarketable


commodity
.




but
Miss
Bart
,
it
appear
,
really
do
want
to
know
about
Americana
;
and


moreover
,
she
be
already
sufficiently
inform
to
make
the
task
of


farth
instruction
as
easy
as
it
be
agreeable
.
 
she
question
he


intelligently
,
she
hear
he
submissively
;
and
,
prepare
for
the
look
of


lassitude
which
usually
creep
over
his
listener
'
face
,
he
grow
eloquent


under
her
receptive
gaze
.
 
the
"
point
"
she
have
have
the
presence
of
mind


to
glean
from
Selden
,
in
anticipation
of
this
very
contingency
,
be


serve
she
to
such
good
purpose
that
she
begin
to
think
her
visit
to
he


have
be
the
lucky
incident
of
the
day
.
she
have
once
more
show
she


talent
for
profit
by
the
unexpected
,
and
dangerous
theory
as
to
the


advisability
of
yield
to
impulse
be
germinate
under
the
surface
of


smile
attention
which
she
continue
to
present
to
her
companion
.




Mr.
Gryce
's
sensation
,
if
less
definite
,
be
equally
agreeable
.
 
he


feel
the
confused
titillation
with
which
the
low
organism
welcome
the


gratification
of
their
need
,
and
all
his
sense
flounder
in
a
vague


well
-
being
,
through
which
Miss
Bart
's
personality
be
dimly
but


pleasantly
perceptible
.




Mr.
Gryce
's
interest
in
Americana
have
not
originate
with
himself
:
it
be


impossible
to
think
of
he
as
evolve
any
taste
of
his
own
.
an
uncle
have


leave
he
a
collection
already
note
among
bibliophile
;
the
existence
of


the
collection
be
the
only
fact
that
have
ever
shed
glory
on
the
name
of


Gryce
,
and
the
nephew
take
as
much
pride
in
his
inheritance
as
though
it


have
be
his
own
work
.
indeed
,
he
gradually
come
to
regard
it
as
such
,


and
to
feel
a
sense
of
personal
complacency
when
he
chance
on
any


reference
to
the
Gryce
Americana
.
anxious
as
he
be
to
avoid
personal


notice
,
he
take
,
in
the
print
mention
of
his
name
,
a
pleasure
so


exquisite
and
excessive
that
it
seem
a
compensation
for
his
shrink


from
publicity
.




to
enjoy
the
sensation
as
often
as
possible
,
he
subscribe
to
all
the


review
deal
with
book
-
collect
in
general
,
and
american
history
in


particular
,
and
as
allusion
to
his
library
abound
in
the
page
of


these
journal
,
which
form
his
only
reading
,
he
come
to
regard
himself


as
figure
prominently
in
the
public
eye
,
and
to
enjoy
the
thought
of


the
interest
which
would
be
excited
if
the
person
he
meet
in
the
street
,


or
sit
among
in
travelling
,
be
suddenly
to
be
tell
that
he
be
the


possessor
of
the
Gryce
Americana
.




Most
timidity
have
such
secret
compensation
,
and
Miss
Bart
be


discern
enough
to
know
that
the
inner
vanity
be
generally
in


proportion
to
the
outer
self
-
depreciation
.
with
a
more
confident
person


she
would
not
have
dare
to
dwell
so
long
on
one
topic
,
or
to
show
such


exaggerated
interest
in
it
;
but
she
have
rightly
guess
that
Mr.
Gryce
's


egoism
be
a
thirsty
soil
,
require
constant
nurture
from
without
.
Miss


Bart
have
the
gift
of
follow
an
undercurrent
of
thought
while
she


appear
to
be
sail
on
the
surface
of
conversation
;
and
in
this
case


her
mental
excursion
take
the
form
of
a
rapid
survey
of
Mr.
Percy
Gryce
's


future
as
combine
with
her
own
.
the
Gryces
be
from
Albany
,
and
but


lately
introduce
to
the
metropolis
,
where
the
mother
and
son
have
come
,


after
old
Jefferson
Gryce
's
death
,
to
take
possession
of
his
house
in


Madison
Avenue
--
an
appalling
house
,
all
brown
stone
without
and
black


walnut
within
,
with
the
Gryce
library
in
a
fire
-
proof
annex
that
look


like
a
mausoleum
.
 
Lily
,
however
,
know
all
about
they
:
young
Mr.
Gryce
's


arrival
have
flutter
the
maternal
breast
of
New
York
,
and
when
a
girl


have
no
mother
to
palpitate
for
she
she
must
needs
be
on
the
alert
for


herself
.
lily
,
therefore
,
have
not
only
contrive
to
put
herself
in
the


young
man
's
way
,
but
have
make
the
acquaintance
of
Mrs.
Gryce
,
a


monumental
woman
with
the
voice
of
a
pulpit
orator
and
a
mind
preoccupy


with
the
iniquity
of
her
servant
,
who
come
sometimes
to
sit
with
Mrs.


Peniston
and
learn
from
that
lady
how
she
manage
to
prevent
the


kitchen
-
maid
's
smuggling
grocery
out
of
the
house
.
Mrs.
Gryce
have
a


kind
of
impersonal
benevolence
:
case
of
individual
need
she
regard


with
suspicion
,
but
she
subscribe
to
Institutions
when
their
annual


report
show
an
impressive
surplus
.
her
domestic
duty
be
manifold
,


for
they
extend
from
furtive
inspection
of
the
servant
'
bedroom
to


unannounced
descent
to
the
cellar
;
but
she
have
never
allow
herself


many
pleasure
.
once
,
however
,
she
have
have
a
special
edition
of
the
Sarum


rule
print
in
rubric
and
present
to
every
clergyman
in
the
diocese
;


and
the
gilt
album
in
which
their
letter
of
thank
be
paste
form


the
chief
ornament
of
her
drawing

.




percy
have
be
bring
up
in
the
principle
which
so
excellent
a
woman


be
sure
to
inculcate
.
every
form
of
prudence
and
suspicion
have
be


graft
on
a
nature
originally
reluctant
and
cautious
,
with
the
result


that
it
would
have
seem
hardly
needful
for
Mrs.
Gryce
to
extract
his


promise
about
the
overshoe
,
so
little
likely
be
he
to
hazard
himself


abroad
in
the
rain
.
after
attain
his
majority
,
and
come
into
the


fortune
which
the
late
Mr.
Gryce
have
make
out
of
a
patent
device
for


exclude
fresh
air
from
hotel
,
the
young
man
continue
to
live
with
his


mother
in
Albany
;
but
on
Jefferson
Gryce
's
death
,
when
another
large


property
pass
into
her
son
's
hand
,
Mrs.
Gryce
think
that
what
she


call
his
"
interest
"
demand
his
presence
in
New
York
.
she
accordingly


instal
herself
in
the
Madison
Avenue
house
,
and
Percy
,
whose
sense
of


duty
be
not
inferior
to
his
mother
's
,
spend
all
his
week
day
in
the


handsome
Broad
Street
office
where
a
batch
of
pale
man
on
small
salary


have
grow
grey
in
the
management
of
the
Gryce
estate
,
and
where
he
be


initiate
with
become
reverence
into
every
detail
of
the
art
of


accumulation
.




as
far
as
Lily
could
learn
,
this
have
hitherto
be
Mr.
Gryce
's
only


occupation
,
and
she
might
have
be
pardon
for
think
it
not
too
hard


a
task
to
interest
a
young
man
who
have
be
keep
on
such
low
diet
.
 
at


any
rate
,
she
feel
herself
so
completely
in
command
of
the
situation
that


she
yield
to
a
sense
of
security
in
which
all
fear
of
Mr.
Rosedale
,
and


of
the
difficulty
on
which
that
fear
be
contingent
,
vanish
beyond


the
edge
of
thought
.




the
stopping
of
the
train
at
Garrisons
would
not
have
distract
she
from


these
thought
,
have
she
not
catch
a
sudden
look
of
distress
in
she


companion
's
eye
.
his
seat
face
toward
the
door
,
and
she
guess
that
he


have
be
perturb
by
the
approach
of
an
acquaintance
;
a
fact
confirm


by
the
turning
of
head
and
general
sense
of
commotion
which
her
own


entrance
into
a
railway
-
carriage
be
apt
to
produce
.




she
know
the
symptom
at
once
,
and
be
not
surprised
to
be
hail
by
the


high
note
of
a
pretty
woman
,
who
enter
the
train
accompany
by
a


maid
,
a
bull
-
terri
,
and
a
footman
stagger
under
a
load

it

evening

after
that

could
take
a

up

echo

she

he
on

must
follow
up
her
success

fresh
compliance

all
on

chance

the

it

what
choice

she

whole
be

it

the
background

could
breathe

the

she


daily
meed
of
pleasure
without

the
obligation

impose
,

feel
herself
a
mere


pensioner
on
the
splendour
which
have
once

there


be
even
moment

be
conscious

have
to
pay
her
way

for
a
long
time

have
refuse

could
not


afford
it

she
be
afraid

acquire
so
expensive
a
taste

she
have


see
the
danger
exemplify
in
more
than
one
of
her
associate

in
young


Ned
Silverton

for
instance

the
charming
fair
boy
now
seat
in
abject


rapture
at
the
elbow
of
Mrs.
Fisher
,
a
striking
divorcee
with
eye
and


gown
as
emphatic
as
the
head
-
line
of
her
"
case
.
"
lily
could
remember


when
young
Silverton
have
stumble
into
their
circle
,
with
the
air
of
a


stray
Arcadian
who
have
publish
charming
sonnet
in
his
college
journal
.


since
then
he
have
develop
a
taste
for
Mrs.
Fisher
and
bridge
,
and
the


latter
at
least
have
involve
he
in
expense
from
which
he
have
be
more


than
once
rescue
by
harass
maiden
sister
,
who
treasure
the
sonnet
,


and
go
without
sugar
in
their
tea
to
keep
their
darling
afloat
.
Ned
's


case
be
familiar
to
Lily
:
she
have
see
his
charming
eye
--
which
have
a


good
deal
more
poetry
in
they
than
the
sonnet
--
change
from
surprise
to


amusement
,
and
from
amusement
to
anxiety
,
as
he
pass
under
the
spell


of
the
terrible
god
of
chance
;
and
she
be
afraid
of
discover
the


same
symptom
in
her
own
case
.




for
in
the
last
year
she
have
find
that
her
hostess
expect
she
to


take
a
place
at
the
card
-
table
.
it
be
one
of
the
taxis
she
have
to
pay


for
their
prolong
hospitality
,
and
for
the
dress
and
trinket
which


occasionally
replenish
her
insufficient
wardrobe
.
and
since
she
have


play
regularly
the
passion
have
grow
on
she
.
once
or
twice
of
late
she


have
win
a
large
sum
,
and
instead
of
keep
it
against
future
loss
,
have


spend
it
in
dress
or
jewelry
;
and
the
desire
to
atone
for
this


imprudence
,
combine
with
the
increase
exhilaration
of
the
game
,
drive


she
to
risk
high
stake
at
each
fresh
venture
.
she
try
to
excuse


herself
on
the
plea
that
,
in
the
trenor
set
,
if
one
play
at
all
one


must
either
play
high
or
be
set
down
as
priggish
or
stingy
;
but
she
know


that
the
gambling
passion
be
upon
she
,
and
that
in
her
present


surrounding
there
be
small
hope
of
resist
it
.




tonight
the
luck
have
be
persistently
bad
,
and
the
little
gold
purse


which
hang
among
her
trinket
be
almost
empty
when
she
return
to
she


room
.
she
unlock
the
wardrobe
,
and
take
out
her
jewel
-
case
,
look


under
the
tray
for
the
roll
of
bill
from
which
she
have
replenish
the


purse
before
go
down
to
dinner
.
 
only
twenty
dollar
be
leave
:
the


discovery
be
so
startling
that
for
a
moment
she
fancy
she
must
have


be
rob
.
then
she
take
paper
and
pencil
,
and
seat
herself
at
the


writing
-
table
,
try
to
reckon
up
what
she
have
spend
during
the
day
.
 
her


head
be
throb
with
fatigue
,
and
she
have
to
go
over
the
figure
again


and
again
;
but
at
last
it
become
clear
to
she
that
she
have
lose
three


hundred
dollar
at
card
.
she
take
out
her
cheque
-
book
to
see
if
she


balance
be
large
than
she
remember
,
but
find
she
have
err
in
the


other
direction
.
then
she
return
to
her
calculation
;
but
figure
as
she


would
,
she
could
not
conjure
back
the
vanish
three
hundred
dollar
.
it


be
the
sum
she
have
set
aside
to
pacify
her
dress
-
maker
--
unless
she


should
decide
to
use
it
as
a
sop
to
the
jeweller
.
at
any
rate
,
she
have
so


many
use
for
it
that
its
very
insufficiency
have
cause
she
to
play
high


in
the
hope
of
double
it
.
 
but
of
course
she
have
lose
--
she
who
need


every
penny
,
while
Bertha
Dorset
,
whose
husband
shower
money
on
she
,


must

such
a

a
world
in
which
such
thing
could
be
seem
a
miserable
place
to
Lily


Bart
;
but
then
she
have
never
be
able
to
understand
the
law
of
a


universe
which
be
so
ready
to
leave
she
out
of
its
calculation
.




she
begin
to
undress
without
ring
for
her
maid
,
whom
she
have
send
to

be
long
enough

to
other
people

pleasure
to
be


considerate
of
those
who
depend
on
hers
,
and
in
her
bitter
mood
it


sometimes
strike
she
that
she
and
her
maid
be
in
the
same
position
,


except
that
the
latter
receive
her
wage
more
regularly
.




as
she
sit
before
the
mirror
brush
her
hair
,
her
face
look
hollow


and
pale
,
and
she
be
frighten
by
two
little
line
near
her
mouth
,


faint
flaw
in
the
smooth
curve
of
the
cheek

must
stop

exclaim
.

reflect
,

up
from

the

she
turn
out
the
wall

light
,
and
peer
at
herself
between
the


candle

the
white
oval
of
her
face
swam
out
waveringly
from
a


background
of
shadow
,
the
uncertain
light
blur
it

a
haze

the

in
haste

"
it
be
only
because
I
be
tired

have
such
odious
thing
to
think


about
,
"
she
keep
repeat
;
and
it
seem
an
add
injustice
that
petty


care
should
leave
a
trace
on
the
beauty
which
be
her
only
defence


against
they

the
odious
thing
be
there
,

remain
with
she
.
she
return


wearily
to
the
thought
of
Percy
Gryce
,
as
a
wayfarer
pick
up
a
heavy


load
and
toil
on
after
a
brief
rest

reward

the


reward
itself

unpalatable
just
then

she
could
get
no
z
from


the
thought
of
victory
.
it
would
be
a
rest
from
worry
,
no
more
--
and
how


little
that
would
have
seem
to
she
a
few
year
early
!
her
ambition


have
shrink
gradually
in
the
desiccate
air
of
failure
.
but
why
have
she


fail
?
be
it
her
own
fault
or
that
of
destiny
?




she
remember
how
her
mother
,
after
they
have
lose
their
money
,
use
to


say
to
she
with
a
kind
of
fierce
vindictiveness
:

rouse
a
whole

reaction

such
be
the
setting
of
Lily

's
first
memory
.




rule
the

element

be
the
vigorous
and
determined


figure

young
enough
to

her
ball

even
to


the
eye
of
infancy
,
Mrs.
Hudson
Bart
have
appear
young
;
but
Lily
could


not
recall
the
time
when
her
father
have
not
be
bald
and
slightly


stoop
,
with
streak
of
grey
in
his
hair
,
and
a
tired
walk
.
it
be
a


shock
to
she
to
learn
afterward
that
he
be
but
two
year
old
than
she


mother
.




lily
seldom
see
her
father
by
daylight
.
all
day
he
be
"
down
town
"
;
and


in
winter
it
be
long
after
nightfall
when
she
hear
his
fag
step
on


the
stair
and
his
hand
on
the
school
-
room
door
.
he
would
kiss
she
in


silence
,
and
ask
one
or
two
question
of
the
nurse
or
the
governess
;
then


Mrs.
Bart
's
maid
would
come
to
remind
he
that
he
be
dine
out
,
and
he


would
hurry
away
with
a
nod
to
Lily
.
in
summer
,
when
he
join
they
for
a


Sunday
at
Newport
or
Southampton
,
he
be
even
more
effaced
and
silent


than
in
winter
.
it
seem
to
tire
he
to
rest
,
and
he
would
sit
for
hour


stare
at
the
sea
-
line
from
a
quiet
corner
of
the
verandah
,
while
the


clatter
of
his
wife
's
existence
go
on
unheeded
a
few
foot
off
.


generally
,
however
,
Mrs.
Bart
and
Lily
go
to
Europe
for
the
summer
,
and


before
the
steamer
be
half
way
over
Mr.
Bart
have
dip
below
the


horizon
.
sometimes
his
daughter
hear
he
denounce
for
having
neglect


to
forward
Mrs.
Bart
's
remittance
;
but
for
the
most
part
he
be
never


mention
or
think
of
till
his
patient
stoop
figure
present
itself


on
the
New
York
dock
as
a
buffer
between
the
magnitude
of
his
wife
's


luggage
and
the
restriction
of
the
american
custom
-
house
.




in
this
desultory
yet
agitate
fashion
life
go
on
through
Lily
's
teen
:


a
zig
-
zag
break
course
down
which
the
family
craft
glide
on
a
rapid


current
of
amusement
,
tug
at
by
the
underflow
of
a
perpetual
need
--
the


need
of
more
money
.
lily
could
not
recall
the
time
when
there
have
be


money
enough
,
and
in
some
vague
way
her
father
seem
always
to
blame
for


the
deficiency
.
 
it
could
certainly
not
be
the
fault
of
Mrs.
Bart
,
who


be
speak
of
by
her
friend
as
a
"
wonderful
manager
.
"
Mrs.
Bart
be


famous
for
the
unlimited
effect
she
produce
on
limited
mean
;
and
to
the


lady
and
her
acquaintance
there
be
something
heroic
in
live
as
though


one
be
much
rich
than
one
's
bank
-
book
denote
.




Lily
be
naturally
proud
of
her
mother
's
aptitude
in
this
line
:
she
have


be
bring
up
in
the
faith
that
,
whatever
it
cost
,
one
must
have
a
good


cook
,
and
be
what
Mrs.
Bart
call
"
decently
dress
.
"
Mrs.
Bart
's
bad


reproach
to
her
husband
be
to
ask
he
if
he
expect
she
to
"
live
like
a


pig
"
;
and
his
replying
in
the
negative
be
always
regard
as
a


justification
for
cable
to
Paris
for
an
extra
dress
or
two
,
and


telephone
to
the
jeweller
that
he
might
,
after
all
,
send
home
the


turquoise
bracelet
which
Mrs.
Bart
have
look
at
that
morning
.




Lily
know
people
who
"
live
like
pig
,
"
and
their
appearance
and


surrounding
justify
her
mother
's
repugnance
to
that
form
of
existence
.


they
be
mostly
cousin
,
who
inhabit
dingy
house
with
engraving
from


Cole
's
Voyage
of
Life
on
the
drawing

room

,
and
slatternly


parlour

maid
who
say
"
I
'll
go
and
see
"
to
visitor

at
an
hour


when
all
right
-
minded
person
be
conventionally
if
not
actually
out
.
the


disgusting
part
of
it
be
that
many
of
these
cousin
be
rich
,
so
that


Lily
imbibe
the
idea
that
if
people
live
like
pig
it
be
from
choice
,


and
through
the
lack
of
any
proper
standard
of
conduct
.
 
this
give
she
a


sense
of
reflect
superiority
,
and
she
do
not
need
Mrs.
Bart
's
comment


on
the
family
frump
and
miser
to
foster
she
naturally
lively
taste
for


splendour
.




Lily
be
nineteen
when
circumstance
cause
she
to
revise
her
view
of
the


universe
.




the
previous
year
she
have
make
a
dazzle
debut
fringe
by
a
heavy


thunder
-
cloud
of
bill
.
the
light
of
the
debut
still
linger
on
the


horizon
,
but
the
cloud
have
thicken
;
and
suddenly
it
break
.
the


suddenness
add
to
the
horror
;
and
there
be
still
time
when
Lily


relive
with
painful
vividness
every
detail
of
the
day
on
which
the
blow


fall
.
she
and
her
mother
have
be

at
the
luncheon

over
the


CHAUFROIX

it

the
pleasant
languor
which
be
youth
's


penalty
for
dancing
till
dawn

her
mother
,
in

of

about

under

sight


of
Mr.
Bart
at
luncheon
be
an
unwonted
one
.
but
neither
his
wife
nor
his


daughter
be
sufficiently
interested
to
ask
an
explanation
.




Mr.
Bart
drop
into
a
chair
,
and
sat
gaze
absently
at
the
fragment
of


jelly
salmon
which
the
butler
have
place
before
he
.

"




she
lean
confidently
toward
her
father
:
he
seldom
refuse
she
anything
,


and
Mrs.

have
teach

motionless

even
paler

thin
hair
lie


in
untidy
streak
on
his
forehead
.
suddenly
he
look
at
his
daughter
and


laugh
.
the
laugh
be
so
strange
that
Lily
colour
under
it

she


disliked

ridicule
,
and
her
father
seem
to
see
something


ridiculous
in
the
request

perhaps
he
think
it
foolish
that

slow

dying

he


no
long
count

he
have
become
extinct
when
he
cease

his


purpose

she
sit
at

the
provisional
air
of
a
traveller


who
wait
for
a
belate
train
to
start

Lily
's
feeling
be
soft

pity
he
in
a
frightened
ineffectual
way

the
fact
that
he
be
for


the
most
part
unconscious
,

that
his
attention
,
when

into


the

drift
away
from
she

a
moment

make
he
even
more
of

strange
than
in
the
nursery
day
when
he
have
never
come
home
till
after


dark
.
she
seem
always
to
have
see
he
through
a
blur

first
of


sleepiness
,
then
of
distance
and
indifference
--
and
now
the
fog
have


thicken
till
he
be
almost
indistinguishable

any
little
service

have
exchange

a

of
those
affect

an
extensive
perusal
of
fiction
have
lead


she
to
connect
with
such
occasion
,
the
filial
instinct
might
have


stir
in
she
;
but
her
pity
,
find
no
active
expression
,
remain
in
a


state
of
spectatorship
,
overshadow
by
her
mother
's
grim
unflagge


resentment
.
every
look
and
act
of
Mrs.

you

"




it
be
a
relief

then
a
long
winter
set
in
.

be
a
little
money

to
Mrs.

it
seem
bad
than
nothing

the
mere
mockery
of
what
she
be

to
.
what
be
the
use
of
live
if
one
have
to
live
like
a
pig

she
sink
into
a
kind
of
furious
apathy
,
a
state
of
inert
anger
against


fate
.
her
faculty
for
"

desert
she
,

she
no
long
take


sufficient
pride
in

well
enough

not

the
fact
that
one
have
to
go
on

the

Lily

from
place
to
place
,

pay
long
visit


to
relation
whose
house

keep
Mrs.

criticize
,

who
deplore


the
fact
that
she
let
Lily
breakfast
in
bed
when
the
girl
have
no


prospect
before
she
,
and
now
vegetate
in
cheap
continental
refuge
,


where
Mrs.

hold
herself
fiercely
aloof
from
the
frugal
tea
-
table
of


her
companion
in
misfortune
.
she
be
especially
careful
to
avoid
her
old


friend
and
the
scene
of
her
former
success
.
to
be
poor
seem
to
she


such
a
confession
of
failure
that
it
amount
to
disgrace
;
and
she


detect
a
note
of
condescension
in
the
friendly
advance
.




only
one
thought
console
she
,
and
that
be
the
contemplation
of
Lily
's


beauty
.
she
study
it
with
a
kind
of
passion
,
as
though
it
be
some


weapon
she
have
slowly
fashion
for
her
vengeance
.
 
it
be
the
last
asset


in
their
fortune
,
the
nucleus
around
which
their
life
be
to
be
rebuild
.


she
watch
it
jealously
,
as
though
it
be
her
own
property
and
Lily
its


mere
custodian
;
and
she
try
to
instil
into
the
latter
a
sense
of
the


responsibility
that
such
a
charge
involve
.
she
follow
in
imagination


the
career
of
other
beauty
,
point
out
to
her
daughter
what
might
be


achieve
through
such
a
gift
,
and
dwell
on
the
awful
warning
of
those


who
,
in
spite
of
it
,
have
fail
to
get
what
they
want

to
Mrs.
Bart
,


only
stupidity
could
explain
the
lamentable
denouement
of
some
of
she


example
.
she
be
not
above
the
inconsistency
of
charge
fate
,
rather


than
herself
,
with
her
own
misfortune
;
but
she
inveigh
so


acrimoniously
against
love
-
match
that
Lily
would
have
fancy
her
own


marriage
have
be
of
that
nature
,
have
not
Mrs.

frequently
assure


she
that
she
have
be
"
talk
into
it"--by
whom
,
she
never
make
clear
.




Lily
be
duly
impressed
by
the
magnitude
of
her
opportunity
.
 
the


dinginess
of
her
present
life
throw
into
enchant
relief
the
existence


to
which
she
feel
herself
entitle
.
to
a
less
illuminated
intelligence


Mrs.
Bart
's
counsel
might
have
be
dangerous
;
but
Lily
understand
that


beauty
be
only
the
raw
material
of
conquest
,
and
that
to
convert
it
into


success
other
art
be
require
.
she
know
that
to
betray
any
sense
of


superiority
be
a
subtler
form
of
the
stupidity
her
mother
denounce
,
and


it
do
not
take
she
long
to
learn
that
a
beauty
need
more
tact
than
the


possessor
of
an
average
set
of
feature
.




her
ambition
be
not
as
crude
as
Mrs.
Bart
's
.
it
have
be
among
that


lady
's
grievance
that
her
husband
--
in
the
early
day
,
before
he
be
too


tired
--
have
waste
his
evening
in
what
she
vaguely
describe
as
"
read


poetry
"
;
and
among
the
effect
pack
off
to
auction
after
his
death
be


a
score
or
two
of
dingy
volume
which
have
struggle
for
existence
among


the
boot
and
medicine
bottle
of
his
dressing

room

there
be
in

a
vein
of
sentiment

transmit
from
this
source
,
which


give
an
idealizing
touch
to
her
most
prosaic
purpose
.
she
like
to
think


of
her
beauty
as
a
power
for
good
,
as
give
she
the
opportunity
to


attain
a
position
where
she
should
make
her
influence
feel
in
the
vague


diffusion
of
refinement
and
good
taste
.
 
she
be
fond
of
picture
and


flower
,
and
of
sentimental
fiction
,
and
she
could
not
help
think
that


the
possession
of
such
taste
ennoble
her
desire
for
worldly
advantage
.


she
would
not
indeed
have
care
to
marry
a
man
who
be
merely
rich
:
she


be
secretly
ashamed
of
her
mother
's
crude
passion
for
money
.
 
Lily
's


preference
would
have
be
for
an
english
nobleman
with
political


ambition
and
vast
estate
;
or
,
for
second
choice

italian
prince

Apennines

hereditary
office
in
the
Vatican

a
romantic
charm
for
she
,

to
picture
herself
as


stand
aloof
from
the
vulgar
press
of
the
Quirinal
,

sacrifice
she


pleasure
to
the
claim
of
an
immemorial
tradition

how
long
ago

how
far
off
it
all
seem
!
those
ambition
be
hardly


more
futile
and
childish
than
the
early
one

have
centre
about


the
possession
of
a
french
jointed
doll
with
real
hair

italian
prince

after
two
year

a
deep


disgust

have
hate
dinginess

it
be
her
fate
to
be
dingy

she


vision
of
a
brilliant
marriage

fade
after

be
the

her
lament

"
do
n't
let
it
creep
up
on
you
and
drag
you
down
.

your
way
out
of
it


somehow
--
you're
young

can
do
it

"
she
insist
.




she
have
die
during
one
of
their
brief
visit
to
New
York
,
and
there
Lily


at
once
become
the
centre
of
a
family
council
compose
of
the
wealthy


relative
whom
she
have
be
teach
to
despise
for
live
like
pig
.
it


may
be
that
they
have
an
inkling
of
the
sentiment
in
which
she
have
be


bring
up
,
for
none
of
they
manifest
a
very
lively
desire
for
she


company
;
indeed
,
the
question
threaten
to
remain
unsolved
till
Mrs.


Peniston
with
a
sigh
announce
:
"
I
'll
try
she
for
a
year
.
"




every
one
be
surprised
,
but
one
and
all
conceal
their
surprise
,
lest


Mrs.
Peniston
should
be
alarm
by
it
into
reconsider
her
decision
.




Mrs.
Peniston
be
Mr.
Bart
's
widow
sister
,
and
if
she
be
by
no
mean


the
rich
of
the
family
group
,
its
other
member
nevertheless
abound


in
reason
why
she
be
clearly
destine
by
Providence
to
assume
the


charge
of
Lily
.
in
the
first
place
she
be
alone
,
and
it
would
be


charming
for
she
to
have
a
young
companion
.
then
she
sometimes
travel
,


and
Lily
's
familiarity
with
foreign
custom
--
deplore
as
a
misfortune
by


her
more
conservative
relative
--
would
at
least
enable
she
to
act
as
a


kind
of
courier
.
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
Mrs.
Peniston
have
not
be


affect
by
these
consideration
.
she
have
take
the
girl
simply
because


no
one
else
would
have
she
,
and
because
she
have
the
kind
of
moral


MAUVAISE
HONTE
which
make
the
public
display
of
selfishness
difficult
,


though
it
do
not
interfere
with
its
private
indulgence
.
it
would
have


be
impossible
for
Mrs.
Peniston
to
be
heroic
on
a
desert
island
,
but


with
the
eye
of
her
little
world
upon
she
she
take
a
certain
pleasure
in


her
act
.




she
reap
the
reward
to
which
disinterestedness
be
entitle
,
and
find


an
agreeable
companion
in
her
niece
.
she
have
expect
to
find
Lily


headstrong
,
critical
and
"
foreign"--for
even
Mrs.
Peniston
,
though
she


occasionally
go
abroad
,
have
the
family
dread
of
foreignness
--
but
the


girl
show
a
pliancy
,
which
,
to
a
more
penetrate
mind
than
her
aunt
's
,


might
have
be
less
reassuring
than
the
open
selfishness
of
youth
.


Misfortune
have
make
Lily
supple
instead
of
harden
she
,
and
a
pliable


substance
be
less
easy
to
break
than
a
stiff
one
.




Mrs.
Peniston
,
however
,
do
not
suffer
from
her
niece
's
adaptability
.


Lily
have
no
intention
of
take
advantage
of
her
aunt
's
good
nature
.
 
she


be
in
truth
grateful
for
the
refuge
offer
she
:
Mrs.
Peniston
's
opulent


interior
be
at
least
not
externally
dingy
.
but
dinginess
be
a
quality


which
assume
all
manner
of
disguise
;
and
Lily
soon
find
that
it
be
as


latent
in
the
expensive
routine
of
her
aunt
's
life
as
in
the
makeshift


existence
of
a
continental
pension
.




Mrs.
Peniston
be
one
of
the
episodical
person
who
form
the
padding
of


life
.
it
be
impossible
to
believe
that
she
have
herself
ever
be
a
focus


of
activity
.
the
most
vivid
thing
about
she
be
the
fact
that
she


grandmother
have
be
a
Van
Alstyne
.
this
connection
with
the
well
-
feed
and


industrious
stock
of
early
New
York
reveal
itself
in
the
glacial


neatness
of
Mrs.
Peniston
's
drawing
-
room
and
in
the
excellence
of
she


cuisine
.
she
belong
to
the
class
of
old
New
Yorkers
who
have
always


live
well
,
dress
expensively
,
and
do
little
else
;
and
to
these


inherit
obligation
Mrs.
Peniston
faithfully
conform
.
 
she
have
always


be
a
looker
-
on
at
life
,
and
her
mind
resemble
one
of
those
little


mirror
which
her
dutch
ancestor
be
accustomed
to
affix
to
their
upper


window
,
so
that
from
the
depth
of
an
impenetrable
domesticity
they


might
see
what
be
happen
in
the
street
.




Mrs.
Peniston
be
the
owner
of
a
country
-
place
in
New
Jersey
,
but
she
have


never
live
there
since
her
husband
's
death
--
a
remote
event
,
which


appear
to
dwell
in
her
memory
chiefly
as
a
dividing
point
in
the


personal
reminiscence
that
form
the
staple
of
her
conversation
.
she


be
a
woman
who
remember
date
with
intensity
,
and
could
tell
at
a


moment
's
notice
whether
the
drawing
-
room
curtain
have
be
renew
before


or
after
Mr.
Peniston
's
last
illness
.




Mrs.
Peniston
think
the
country
lonely
and
tree
damp
,
and
cherish
a


vague
fear
of
meet
a
bull
.
to
guard
against
such
contingency
she


frequent
the
more
populous
watering
-
place
,
where
she
instal
herself


impersonally
in
a
hire
house
and
look
on
at
life
through
the
matting


screen
of
her
verandah
.
in
the
care
of
such
a
guardian
,
it
soon
become


clear
to
Lily
that
she
be
to
enjoy
only
the
material
advantage
of
good


food
and
expensive
clothing
;
and
,
though
far
from
underrate
these
,
she


would
gladly
have
exchange
they
for
what
Mrs.
Bart
have
teach
she
to


regard
as
opportunity
.
she
sigh
to
think
what
her
mother
's
fierce


energy
would
have
accomplish
,
have
they
be
couple
with
Mrs.


Peniston
's
resource
.
Lily
have
abundant
energy
of
her
own
,
but
it
be


restrict
by
the
necessity
of
adapt
herself
to
her
aunt
's
habit
.
she


see
that
at
all
cost
she
must
keep
Mrs.
Peniston
's
favour
till
,
as
Mrs.


Bart
would
have
phrase
it
,
she
could
stand
on
her
own
leg
.
Lily
have
no


mind
for
the
vagabond
life
of
the
poor
relation
,
and
to
adapt
herself
to


Mrs.
Peniston
she
have
,
to
some
degree
,
to
assume
that
lady
's
passive


attitude
.
she
have
fancy
at
first
that
it
would
be
easy
to
draw
her
aunt


into
the
whirl
of
her
own
activity
,
but
there
be
a
static
force
in


Mrs.
Peniston
against
which
her
niece
's
effort
spend
themselves
in
vain
.


to
attempt
to
bring
she
into
active
relation
with
life
be
like
tug


at
a
piece
of
furniture
which
have
be
screw
to
the
floor
.
she
do
not
,


indeed
,
expect
Lily
to
remain
equally
immovable
:
she
have
all
the
american


guardian
's
indulgence
for
the
volatility
of
youth
.




she
have
indulgence
also
for
certain
other
habit
of
her
niece
's
.
 
it


seem
to
her
natural
that
Lily
should
spend
all
her
money
on
dress
,
and


she
supplement
the
girl
's
scanty
income
by
occasional
"
handsome


present
"
mean
to
be
apply
to
the
same
purpose
.
Lily
,
who
be


intensely
practical
,
would
have
prefer
a
fix
allowance
;
but
Mrs.


Peniston
like
the
periodical
recurrence
of
gratitude
evoke
by


unexpected
cheque
,
and
be
perhaps
shrewd
enough
to
perceive
that
such
a


method
of
give
keep
alive
in
her
niece
a
salutary
sense
of
dependence
.




beyond
this
,
Mrs.
Peniston
have
not
felt
call
upon
to
do
anything
for


her
charge
:
she
have
simply
stand
aside
and
let
she
take
the
field
.
lily


have
take
it
,
at
first
with
the
confidence
of
assure
possessorship
,
then


with
gradually
narrow
demand
,
till
now
she
find
herself
actually


struggle
for
a
foothold
on
the
broad
space
which
have
once
seem
she


own
for
the
asking
.
how
it
happen
she
do
not
yet
know
.
 
sometimes
she


think
it
be
because
Mrs.
Peniston
have
be
too
passive
,
and
again
she


fear
it
be
because
she
herself
have
not
be
passive
enough
.
have
she


show
an
undue
eagerness
for
victory
?
have
she
lack
patience
,
pliancy


and
dissimulation
?
whether
she
charge
herself
with
these
fault
or


absolve
herself
from
they
,
make
no
difference
in
the
sum
-
total
of
she


failure
.
young
and
plainer
girl
have
be
marry
off
by
dozen
,
and


she
be
nine
-
and
-
twenty
,
and
still
Miss
Bart
.




she
be
begin
to
have
fit
of
angry
rebellion
against
fate
,
when
she


long
to
drop
out
of
the
race
and
make
an
independent
life
for
herself
.


but
what
manner
of
life
would
it
be
?
she
have
barely
enough
money
to
pay


her
dress
-
maker
'
bill
and
her
gambling
debt
;
and
none
of
the
desultory


interest
which
she
dignify
with
the
name
of
taste
be
pronounce


enough
to
enable
she
to
live
contentedly
in
obscurity
.
 
ah
,
no
--
she
be


too
intelligent
not
to
be
honest
with
herself
.
she
know
that
she
hate


dinginess
as
much
as
her
mother
have
hate
it
,
and
to
her
last
breath
she


mean
to
fight
against
it
,
drag
herself
up
again
and
again
above
its


flood
till
she
gain
the
bright
pinnacle
of
success
which
present


such
a
slippery
surface
to
her
clutch

the
next
morning
,

Miss

find
a
note
from

Dearest
Lily

it

if
it

you
come

toss
aside
the

a
bore
to
be
down
by

--
an
hour

at
Bellomont
as
vaguely


synchronous
with

and
she
know

well
the
nature
of
the


tiresome

Miss

,

never
lose
her
sensitiveness
to


their
charm
.
mere
display
leave
she
with
a
sense
of
superior
distinction

she
feel
an
affinity
to
all
the
subtler
manifestation
of
wealth
.




Mrs.
Trenor
's
summon
,
however
,
suddenly
recall
her
state
of


dependence
,

she
rise
and
dress
in
a
mood
of
irritability
that
she


be
usually
too
prudent
to
indulge
.
she
know
that
such
emotion
leave


line
on
the
face
as
well
as
in
the
character
,
and
she
have
mean
to
take


warn
by
the
little
crease
which
her
midnight
survey
have

she


irritation

one
do
drag
one

self
out
of

at
such
an
hour
,
and


come
down
fresh
and
radiant
to
the
monotony
of
note

writing
,
some
special


recognition
of
the
sacrifice
seem
fitting
.
but
Mrs.
Trenor
's
tone


show
no
consciousness
of
the
fact
.




"
oh
,
Lily
,
that
be
nice
of
you

"
she
merely
sigh
across
the
chaos
of


letter
,
bill
and
other
domestic
document
which
give
an
incongruously


commercial
touch
to
the
slender
elegance
of
her
writing
-
table
.




"
there
be
such
lot
of
horror
this
morning
,
"
she
add
,
clear
a


space
in
the
centre
of
the
confusion
and

Miss


Bart

Mrs.
Trenor
be
a
tall
fair
woman
,
whose
height
just
save
she
from


redundancy
.
her
rosy
blondness
have
survive
some
forty
year
of
futile


activity
without
show
much
trace
of
ill
-
usage
except
in
a
diminished


play
of
feature
.
it
be
difficult
to
define
she
beyond
say
that
she


seem
to
exist
only
as
a
hostess
,
not
so
much
from
any
exaggerated


instinct
of
hospitality
as
because
she
could
not
sustain
life
except
in
a


crowd
.
the
collective
nature
of
her
interest
exempt
she
from
the


ordinary
rivalry
of
her
sex
,
and
she
know
no
more
personal
emotion
than


that
of
hatred
for
the
woman
who
presume
to
give
big
dinner
or
have


more
amusing
house

almost
always
assure
her
ultimate
triumph
in


such
competition
,

have
develop
in
she
an
unscrupulous
good


nature
toward
the
rest
of
her
sex
,
and
in
Miss
Bart
's
utilitarian


classification
of
her
friend
,
Mrs.
Trenor
rank
as
the
woman
who
be


least
likely
to
"
go
back

on
she
.




"
it
be
simply
inhuman
of

Mrs.

anything

have
a
house

party

I
be
sure
I


shall
get
most
horribly
mixed
up
and
there
will
be
some
awful
row
.
when


I
be
down
at
Tuxedo
I
ask
a
lot
of
people
for
next
week
,

I
've


mislay
the
list

ca
n't
remember
who
be
come
.
and
this
week
be
go


to
be
a
horrid
failure
too
--
and
Gwen
Van
Osburgh
will
go
back
and
tell


her
mother
how
bored
people
be
.
I
do
mean
to
ask
the
Wetheralls
--
that


be
a
blunder
of
Gus
's
.
they
disapprove
of
Carry
Fisher
,
you
know
.
as
if


one
could
help
have
carry
Fisher
!
it
be
foolish
of
she
to
get
that


second
divorce
--
Carry
always
overdo
thing
--
but
she
say
the
only
way


to
get
a
penny
out
of
Fisher
be
to
divorce
he
and
make
he
pay
alimony
.


and
poor
Carry
have
to
consider
every
dollar
.
it
be
really
absurd
of
Alice


wetherall
to
make
such
a
fuss
about
meet
she
,
when
one
think
of
what


society
be
come
to
.
some
one
say
the
other
day
that
there
be
a


divorce
and
a
case
of
appendicitis
in
every
family
one
know
.

,


Carry
be
the
only
person
who
can
keep
Gus
in
a
good
humour
when
we
have


bore
in
the
house
.
have
you
notice
that
all
the
husband
like
she
?
all
,


I
mean
,
except
her
own
.
it
be
rather
clever
of
she
to
have
make
a


specialty
of
devote
herself
to
dull
people
--
the
field
be
such
a
large


one
,
and
she
have
it
practically
to
herself
.
she
find
compensation
,
no


doubt
--
I
know
she
borrow
money
of
Gus
--
but
then
I
'd
pay
she
to
keep
he


in
a
good
humour
,

I
ca
n't
complain
,
after
all
.
"




Mrs.

pause
to

unravel
her
tangled
correspondence

Wetheralls

a
fresh
note


of
lament
.

over
with


letter
to
the
Van

I
hear
that
Maria
Van
Osburgh
be


ask
a
big
party
to
meet
she
this
week
,

I
think
it
would
be
fun
to


get
she
away
,

Jack
Stepney
,
who
know
she
in
India
,

it
for

Maria
be
furious
,

actually
have
the
impudence
to
make
Gwen
invite


herself
here
,

that
they
should
n't
be
quite
out
of
it

I
have
know


what
Lady
Cressida
be
like
,
they
could
have
have
she
and
welcome

but
I


think
any
friend
of
the
Skiddaws
'
be
sure
to
be
amusing
.
you
remember


what
fun
Lady
Skiddaw
be
?
there
be
time
when
I
simply
have
to
send
the


girl
out

room
.
besides
,
Lady
Cressida
be
the
Duchess
of


Beltshire
's
sister
,

I
naturally
suppose
she
be
the

sort

you
never

the

do
missionary
work

bother

out

CRESCENDO

to
soar
into
that
empyrean
of


security
where
creditor
can
not

she

have
smart
gown


than
Judy

far
,
far
more
jewel
than
Bertha

she
would


be
free
forever
from

and


she
have
no
doubt
as
to
the
extent
of
her
power

she
know
that
Mr.

be
of
the
small
chary
type
most
inaccessible
to
impulse
and
emotion
.


he
have
the
kind
of
character
in
which
prudence
be
a
vice
,
and
good
advice


the
most
dangerous
nourishment
.
but
Lily
have
know
the
specie
before
:


she
be
aware
that
such
a
guard
nature
must
find
one
huge
outlet
of


egoism
,
and
she
determine
to
be
to
he
what
his
Americana
have
hitherto


be
:
the
one
possession
in
which
he
take
sufficient
pride
to
spend
money


on
it
.
she
know
that
this
generosity
to
self
be
one
of
the
form
of


meanness
,
and
she
resolve
so
to
identify
herself
with
her
husband
's


vanity
that
to
gratify
her
wish
would
be
to
he
the
most
exquisite
form


of
self
-
indulgence
.
the
system
might
at
first
necessitate
a
resort
to


some
of
the
very
shift
and
expedient
from
which
she
intend
it
should


free
she
;
but
she
feel
sure
that
in
a
short
time
she
would
be
able
to


play
the
game
in
her
own
way
.
how
should
she
have
distrust
her
power
?


her
beauty
itself
be
not
the
mere
ephemeral
possession
it
might
have


be
in
the
hand
of
inexperience

her
skill
in
enhance
it
,
the
care


she
take
of
it
,
the
use
she
make
of
it
,
seem
to
give
it
a
kind
of


permanence
.
she
feel
she
could
trust
it
to
carry
she
through
to
the
end
.




and
the
end
,
on
the
whole
,
be
worthwhile
.
life
be
not
the
mockery
she


have
think
it
three
day
ago
.
there
be
room
for
she
,
after
all
,
in
this


crowded
selfish
world
of
pleasure
whence
,
so
short
a
time
since
,
she


poverty
have
seem
to
exclude
she
.
 
these
people
whom
she
have
ridicule


and
yet
envy
be
glad
to
make
a
place
for
she
in
the
charmed
circle


about
which
all
her
desire
revolve

they
be
not
as
brutal
and


self
-
engross
as
she
have
fancy
--
or
rather
,
since
it
would
no
long
be


necessary
to
flatter
and
humour
they
,
that
side
of
their
nature
become


less
conspicuous
.
society
be
a
revolving
body
which
be
apt
to
be
judge


accord
to
its
place
in
each
man
's
heaven

and
at
present
it
be


turn
its
illuminated
face
to
Lily
.




in
the
rosy
glow
it
diffuse
her
companion
seem
full
of
amiable


quality
.
she
like
their
elegance
,
their
lightness
,
their
lack
of


emphasis
:
even
the
self
-
assurance
which
at
time
be
so
like
obtuseness


now
seem
the
natural
sign
of
social
ascendency
.
they
be
lord
of
the


only
world
she
care
for
,
and
they
be
ready
to
admit
she
to
their
rank


and
let
she
lord
it
with
they
.
already
she
feel
within
she
a
stealing


allegiance
to
their
standard
,
an
acceptance
of
their
limitation
,
a


disbelief
in
the
thing
they
do
not
believe
in
,
a
contemptuous
pity
for


the
people
who
be
not
able
to
live
as
they
live
.




the
early
sunset
be
slant
across
the
park
.
through
the
bough
of
the


long
avenue
beyond
the
garden
she
catch
the
flash
of
wheel
,
and


divine
that
more
visitor
be
approach
.
there
be
a
movement
behind


she
,
a
scattering
of
step
and
voice
:
it
be
evident
that
the
party


about
the
tea
-
table
be
break
up
.
 
presently
she
hear
a
tread
behind


she
on
the
terrace
.
she
suppose
that
Mr.
Gryce
have
at
last
find
mean


to
escape
from
his
predicament
,
and
she
smile
at
the
significance
of
his


come
to
join
she
instead
of
beat
an
instant
retreat
to
the
fire
-
side
.




she
turn
to
give
he
the
welcome
which
such
gallantry
deserve
;
but
she


greet
waver
into
a
blush
of
wonder
,
for
the
man
who
have
approach


she
be
Lawrence
Selden
.




"
you
see
I
come
after
all
,

he
say
;

before
she
have
time
to
answer
,


Mrs.
Dorset
,
break
away
from
a
lifeless
colloquy
with
her
host
,
have


step
between

with
a
little
gesture
of
appropriation
.








chapter
5




the
observance
of
Sunday
at
Bellomont
be
chiefly
mark
by
the
punctual


appearance
of
the
smart
omnibus
destine
to
convey
the
household
to
the


little
church
at
the
gate
.
whether
any
one
get
into
the
omnibus
or
not


be
a
matter
of
secondary
importance
,
since
by
stand
there
it
not
only


bear
witness
to
the
orthodox
intention
of
the
family
,
but
make
Mrs.


trenor
feel
,
when
she
finally
hear
it
drive
away
,
that
she
have
somehow


vicariously
make
use
of
it
.




it
be
Mrs.
Trenor
's
theory
that
her
daughter
actually
do
go
to
church


every
Sunday
;
but
their
french
governess
's
conviction
call
she
to
the


rival
fane
,
and
the
fatigue
of
the
week
keep
their
mother
in
her
room


till
luncheon
,
there
be
seldom
any
one
present
to
verify
the
fact
.
now


and
then
,
in
a
spasmodic
burst
of
virtue
--
when
the
house
have
be
too


uproarious
over
night
--
Gus
Trenor
force
his
genial
bulk
into
a
tight


frock
-
coat
and
route
his
daughter
from
their
slumber
;
but
habitually
,


as
Lily
explain
to
Mr.
Gryce
,
this
parental
duty
be
forget
till
the


church
bell
be
ring
across
the
park
,
and
the
omnibus
have
drive


away
empty
.




Lily
have
hint
to
Mr.
Gryce
that
this
neglect
of
religious
observance


be
repugnant
to
her
early
tradition
,
and
that
during
her
visit
to


Bellomont
she
regularly
accompany
Muriel
and
Hilda
to
church
.
this


tally
with
the
assurance
,
also
confidentially
imparted
,
that
,
never


having
play
bridge
before
,
she
have
be
"
drag
into
it
"
on
the
night


of
her
arrival
,
and
have
lose
an
appalling
amount
of
money
in
consequence


of
her
ignorance
of
the
game
and
of
the
rule
of
bet
.
 
Mr.
Gryce
be


undoubtedly
enjoy
Bellomont
.
he
like
the
ease
and
glitter
of
the


life
,
and
the
lustre
confer
on
he
by
be
a
member
of
this
group
of


rich
and
conspicuous
people
.
 
but
he
think
it
a
very
materialistic


society
;
there
be
time
when
he
be
frighten
by
the
talk
of
the
man


and
the
look
of
the
lady
,
and
he
be
glad
to
find
that
Miss
Bart
,
for


all
her
ease
and
self
-
possession
,
be
not
at
home
in
so
ambiguous
an


atmosphere
.
for
this
reason
he
have
be
especially
pleased
to
learn
that


she
would
,
as
usual
,
attend
the
young
Trenors
to
church
on
Sunday


morning
;
and
as
he
pace
the
gravel
sweep
before
the
door
,
his
light


overcoat
on
his
arm
and
his
prayer
-
book
in
one
carefully
-
glove
hand
,
he


reflect
agreeably
on
the
strength
of
character
which
keep
she
true
to


her
early
training
in
surrounding
so
subversive
to
religious
principle
.




for
a
long
time
Mr.
Gryce
and
the
omnibus
have
the
gravel
sweep
to


themselves
;
but
,
far
from
regret
this
deplorable
indifference
on
the


part
of
the
other
guest

he
find
himself
nourish
the
hope
that
Miss


Bart
might
be
unaccompanied
.
the
precious
minute
be
fly
,
however
;


the
big
chestnut
paw
the
ground
and
fleck
their
impatient
side
with


foam
;
the
coachman
seem
to
be
slowly
petrify
on
the
box
,
and
the


groom
on
the
doorstep
;
and
still
the
lady
do
not
come
.
 
suddenly
,


however
,
there
be
a
sound
of
voice
and
a
rustle
of
skirt
in
the


doorway
,
and
Mr.
Gryce
,
restore
his
watch
to
his
pocket
,
turn
with
a


nervous
start
;
but
it
be
only
to
find
himself
hand
Mrs.
Wetherall


into
the
carriage
.




the
Wetheralls
always
go
to
church
.
they
belong
to
the
vast
group
of


human
automata
who
go
through
life
without
neglect
to
perform
a
single


one
of
the
gesture
execute
by
the
surround
puppet
.
it
be
true
that


the
Bellomont
puppet
do
not
go
to
church
;
but
other
equally
important


do
--
and
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Wetherall
's
circle
be
so
large
that
God
be


include
in
their
visit
-
list
.
they
appear
,
therefore
,
punctual
and


resign
,
with
the
air
of
people
bind
for
a
dull
"
at
home
,
"
and
after


they
Hilda
and
Muriel
straggle
,
yawn
and
pin
each
other
's
veil


and
ribbon
as
they
come
.
they
have
promise
Lily
to
go
to
church
with


she
,
they
declare
,
and
Lily
be
such
a
dear
old
duck
that
they
do
n't


mind
do
it
to
please
she
,
though
they
could
n't
fancy
what
have
put
the


idea
in
her
head
,
and
though
for
their
own
part
they
would
much
rather


have
play
lawn
tennis
with
Jack
and
Gwen
,
if
she
have
n't
tell
they
she


be
come
.
the
Misses
Trenor
be
follow
by
Lady
Cressida
Raith
,
a


weather
-
beat
person
in
Liberty
silk
and
ethnological
trinket
,
who
,
on


see
the
omnibus
,
express
her
surprise
that
they
be
not
to
walk


across
the
park
;
but
at
Mrs.
Wetherall
's
horrified
protest
that
the


church
be
a
mile
away
,
her
ladyship
,
after
a
glance
at
the
height
of
the


other
's
heel
,
acquiesce
in
the
necessity
of
driving
,
and
poor
Mr.
Gryce


find
himself
roll
off
between
four
lady
for
whose
spiritual
welfare


he
feel
not
the
least
concern
.




it
might
have
afford
he
some
consolation
could
he
have
know
that
Miss


Bart
have
really
mean
to
go
to
church
.
she
have
even
rise
early
than


usual
in
the
execution
of
her
purpose
.
she
have
an
idea
that
the
sight
of


she
in
a
grey
gown
of
devotional
cut
,
with
her
famous
lash
droop


above
a
prayer
-
book
,
would
put
the
finishing
touch
to
Mr.
Gryce
's


subjugation
,
and
render
inevitable
a
certain
incident
which
she
have


resolve
should
form
a
part
of
the
walk
they
be
to
take
together
after


luncheon
.
her
intention
in
short
have
never
be
more
definite
;
but
poor


lily
,
for
all
the
hard
glaze
of
her
exterior
,
be
inwardly
as
malleable


as
wax
.
her
faculty
for
adapt
herself
,
for
enter
into
other


people
's
feeling
,
if
it
serve
she
now
and
then
in
small
contingency
,


hamper
she
in
the
decisive
moment
of
life
.
she
be
like
a
water
-
plant


in
the
flux
of
the
tide
,
and
today
the
whole
current
of
her
mood
be


carry
she
toward
Lawrence
Selden
.
why
have
he
come
?
be
it
to
see


herself
or
Bertha
Dorset
?
 
it
be
the
last
question
which
,
at
that


moment
,
should
have
engage
she
.
she
might
well
have
content
herself


with
thinking
that
he
have
simply
respond
to
the
despairing
summon
of


his
hostess
,
anxious
to
interpose
he
between
herself
and
the
ill
-
humour


of
Mrs.
Dorset
.
but
Lily
have
not
rest
till
she
learn
from
Mrs.
Trenor


that
Selden
have
come
of
his
own
accord
.
 
"
he
do
n't
even
wire
I
--
he
just


happen
to
find
the
trap
at
the
station
.
perhaps
it
be
not
over
with


Bertha
after
all
,
"
Mrs.
Trenor
musingly
conclude
;
and
go
away
to


arrange
her
dinner
-
card
accordingly
.




perhaps
it
be
not
,
Lily
reflect
;
but
it
should
be
soon
,
unless
she
have


lose
she
cunning
.
if
Selden
have
come
at
Mrs.
Dorset
's
call
,
it
be
at
she


own
that
he
would
stay
.
so
much
the
previous
evening
have
tell
she
.
Mrs.


trenor
,
true
to
her
simple
principle
of
make
she
married
friend
happy
,


have
place
Selden
and
Mrs.
Dorset
next
to
each
other
at
dinner
;
but
,
in


obedience
to
the
time
-
honour
tradition
of
the
match
-
maker
,
she
have


separate
Lily
and
Mr.
Gryce
,
send
in
the
former
with
George
Dorset
,


while
Mr.
Gryce
be
couple
with
Gwen
Van
Osburgh
.




George
Dorset
's
talk
do
not
interfere
with
the
range
of
his
neighbour
's


thought
.
he
be
a
mournful
dyspeptic
,
intent
on
find
out
the


deleterious
ingredient
of
every
dish
and
divert
from
this
care
only
by


the
sound
of
his
wife
's
voice
.
on
this
occasion
,
however
,
Mrs.
Dorset


take
no
part
in
the
general
conversation
.
she
sat
talk
in
low
murmur


with
Selden
,
and
turn
a
contemptuous
and
denude
shoulder
toward
she


host
,
who
,
far
from
resent
his
exclusion
,
plunge
into
the
excess
of


the
MENU
with
the
joyous
irresponsibility
of
a
free
man
.
to
Mr.
Dorset
,


however
,
his
wife
's
attitude
be
a
subject
of
such
evident
concern
that
,


when
he
be
not
scrape
the
sauce
from
his
fish
,
or
scoop
the
moist


bread
-
crumb
from
the
interior
of
his
roll
,
he
sat
strain
his
thin


neck
for
a
glimpse
of
she
between
the
light
.




Mrs.
Trenor
,
as
it
chance
,
have
place
the
husband
and
wife
on
opposite


side
of
the
table
,
and
Lily
be
therefore
able
to
observe
Mrs.
Dorset


also
,
and
by
carry
her
glance
a
few
foot
far
,
to
set
up
a
rapid


comparison
between
Lawrence
Selden
and
Mr.
Gryce
.
it
be
that
comparison


which
be
her
undoing
.
why
else
have
she
suddenly
grow
interested
in


Selden
?
she
have
know
he
for
eight
year
or
more
:
ever
since
her
return


to
America
he
have
form
a
part
of
her
background
.
she
have
always
be


glad
to
sit
next
to
he
at
dinner
,
have
find
he
more
agreeable
than
most


man
,
and
have
vaguely
wish
that
he
possess
the
other
quality
needful


to
fix
her
attention
;
but
till
now
she
have
be
too
busy
with
her
own


affair
to
regard
he
as
more
than
one
of
the
pleasant
accessory
of


life
.
Miss
Bart
be
a
keen
reader
of
her
own
heart
,
and
she
see
that
she


sudden
preoccupation
with
Selden
be
due
to
the
fact
that
his
presence


shed
a
new
light
on
her
surrounding
.
not
that
he
be
notably
brilliant


or
exceptional
;
in
his
own
profession
he
be
surpass
by
more
than
one


man
who
have
bore
Lily
through
many
a
weary
dinner
.
it
be
rather
that
he


have
preserve
a
certain
social
detachment
,
a
happy
air
of
view
the


show
objectively
,
of
have
point
of
contact
outside
the
great
gilt
cage


in
which
they
be
all
huddle
for
the
mob
to
gape
at
.
how
alluring
the


world
outside
the
cage
appear
to
Lily
,
as
she
hear
its
door
clang
on


she
!
in
reality
,
as
she
know
,
the
door
never
clang
:
it
stand
always


open
;
but
most
of
the
captive
be
like
fly
in
a
bottle
,
and
have


once
fly
in
,
could
never
regain
their
freedom
.
it
be
Selden
's


distinction
that
he
have
never
forget
the
way
out
.




that
be
the
secret
of
his
way
of
readjust
her
vision
.
lily
,
turn


her
eye
from
he
,
find
herself
scan
her
little
world
through
his


retina
:
it
be
as
though
the
pink
lamp
have
be
shut
off
and
the
dusty


daylight
let
in
.
she
look
down
the
long
table
,
study
its
occupant


one
by
one
,
from
Gus
Trenor
,
with
his
heavy
carnivorous
head
sink
between


his
shoulder
,
as
he
prey
on
a
jelly
plover
,
to
his
wife
,
at
the


opposite
end
of
the
long
bank
of
orchid
,
suggestive
,
with
her
glare


good

look
,
of
a
jeweller
's
window
light
by
electricity
.
and
between
the


two
,
what
a
long
stretch
of
vacuity
!
how
dreary
and
trivial
these
people


be
!

at

how
different

a
few
hour
ago
!
then
they
have
symbolize
what

they

for
what

that

they

full
of
brilliant

that

she

it
be
not
that
she

she
would
have
like

the
way

which
,
a

,
she
have

her
eye
an

the
vacuous

of
the

she
have


choose
stretch
before
she
like
a
long
white
road
without
dip

it
be
true
she
be
to
roll
over
it
in
a
carriage
instead
of


trudge
it

her
eye
on
the
spectacle

be
afford


Mr.

such
legitimate
mirth

it
certainly
appear
,

he
say
,
that


Mrs.
Dorset
be
the
more
active
participant
in
the
scene

her
neighbour


seem
to
receive
her
advance
with
a
temperate
zest
which
do
not

from
his
dinner

sight
restore
Lily
's
good
humour

know
the
peculiar
disguise
which
Mr.

marital
fear

,


she
ask
gaily
:

"




dorset
greet
the
sally
with
delight

you've

he
add
suddenly
,
push
back
his


plate
with
a
clouded
countenance
;

Lily
,
unfailingly
adaptable

accord
her
radiant
attention
to
his
prolong
denunciation
of
other


people
's
cook
,
with
a
supplementary
tirade
on
the
toxic
quality
of


melt
butter

it
be
not
often
that

so
ready

a
man

well


as
a
dyspeptic

his
grievance

not
insensible
to
its
rosy
symmetry

Miss

make
more
odious
by
its
diminutive
,
obtrude


itself
on
Lily

thought
like
a

.
it
stand
for
one
of
the
many
hate


possibility
hover
on
the
edge
of
life
.
if
she
do
not
marry
Percy


Gryce
,
the
day
might
come
when
she
would
have
to
be
civil
to
such
man
as


rosedale
.
if
she
do
not
MARRY
HIM

but
she
mean
to
marry
he
--
she
be


sure
of
he
and
sure
of
herself
.
she
draw
back
with
a
shiver
from
the


pleasant
path
in
which
her
thought
have
be
stray
,
and
set
her
foot


once
more
in
the
middle
of
the
long
white
road
....
 
when
she
go


upstairs
that
night
she
find
that
the
late
post
have
bring
she
a
fresh


batch
of
bill
.
Mrs.
Peniston
,
who
be
a
conscientious
woman
,
have


forward
they
all
to
Bellomont
.




Miss
Bart
,
accordingly
,
rise
the
next
morning
with
the
most
earnest


conviction
that
it
be
her
duty
to
go
to
church
.
she
tear
herself
betime


from
the
linger
enjoyment
of
her
breakfast
-
tray
,
ring
to
have
her
grey


gown
lay
out
,
and
despatch
her
maid
to
borrow
a
prayer
-
book
from
Mrs.


trenor
.




but
her
course
be
too
purely
reasonable
not
to
contain
the
germ
of


rebellion
.
no
soon
be
her
preparation
make
than
they
rouse
a


smother
sense
of
resistance
.
a
small
spark
be
enough
to
kindle
Lily
's


imagination
,
and
the
sight
of
the
grey
dress
and
the
borrow
prayer
-
book


flash
a
long
light
down
the
year
.
she
would
have
to
go
to
church
with


percy
Gryce
every
Sunday
.
they
would
have
a
front
pew
in
the
most


expensive
church
in
New
York
,
and
his
name
would
figure
handsomely
in
the


list
of
parish
charity
.
in
a
few
year
,
when
he
grow
stouter
,
he
would


be
make
a
warden
.
once
in
the
winter
the
rector
would
come
to
dine
,
and


her
husband
would
beg
she
to
go
over
the
list
and
see
that
no
divorcees


be
include
,
except
those
who
have
show
sign
of
penitence
by
be


re
-
married
to
the
very
wealthy
.
there
be
nothing
especially
arduous
in


this
round
of
religious
obligation
;
but
it
stand
for
a
fraction
of
that


great
bulk
of
boredom
which
loom
across
her
path
.
and
who
could
consent


to
be
bored
on
such
a
morning
?
 
Lily
have
sleep
well
,
and
her
bath
have


fill
she
with
a
pleasant
glow
,
which
be
becomingly
reflect
in
the


clear
curve
of
her
cheek
.
no
line
be
visible
this
morning
,
or
else
the


glass
be
at
a
happy
angle
.




and
the
day
be
the
accomplice
of
her
mood
:
it
be
a
day
for
impulse
and


truancy
.
the
light
air
seem
full
of
powdered
gold
;
below
the
dewy
bloom


of
the
lawn
the
woodland
blush
and
smouldered
,
and
the
hill
across


the
river
swam
in
molten
blue
.
 
every
drop
of
blood
in
Lily
's
vein


invite
she
to
happiness
.




the
sound
of
wheel
rouse
she
from
these
musing
,
and
lean
behind
she


shutter
she
see
the
omnibus
take
up
its
freight
.
she
be
too
late
,


then
--
but
the
fact
do
not
alarm
she
.
a
glimpse
of
Mr.
Gryce
's


crestfallen
face
even
suggest
that
she
have
do
wisely
in
absent


herself
,
since
the
disappointment
he
so
candidly
betray
would
surely


whet
his
appetite
for
the
afternoon
walk
.
that
walk
she
do
not
mean
to


miss
;
one
glance
at
the
bill
on
her
writing
-
table
be
enough
to
recall


its
necessity
.
but
meanwhile
she
have
the
morning
to
herself
,
and
could


muse
pleasantly
on
the
disposal
of
its
hour
.
she
be
familiar
enough


with
the
habit
of
Bellomont
to
know
that
she
be
likely
to
have
a
free


field
till
luncheon
.
she
have
see
the
Wetheralls
,
the
trenor
girl
and


Lady
Cressida
pack
safely
into
the
omnibus
;
Judy
Trenor
be
sure
to
be


have
her
hair
shampooed
;
Carry
Fisher
have
doubtless
carry
off
she


host
for
a
drive
;
Ned
Silverton
be
probably
smoke
the
cigarette
of


young
despair
in
his
bedroom
;
and
Kate
Corby
be
certain
to
be
play


tennis
with
Jack
Stepney
and
Miss
Van
Osburgh
.
of
the
lady
,
this
left


only
Mrs.
Dorset
unaccounte
for
,
and
Mrs.
Dorset
never
come
down
till


luncheon
:
her
doctor
,
she
aver
,
have
forbid
she
to
expose
herself


to
the
crude
air
of
the
morning
.




to
the
remain
member
of
the
party
Lily
give
no
special
thought
;


wherever
they
be
,
they
be
not
likely
to
interfere
with
her
plan
.


these
,
for
the
moment
,
take
the
shape
of
assume
a
dress
somewhat
more


rustic
and
summerlike
in
style
than
the
garment
she
have
first
select
,


and
rustle
downstairs
,
sunshade
in
hand
,
with
the
disengaged
air
of
a


lady
in
quest
of
exercise
.
the
great
hall
be
empty
but
for
the
knot
of


dog
by
the
fire
,
who
,
take
in
at
a
glance
the
outdoor
aspect
of
Miss


Bart
,
be
upon
she
at
once
with
lavish
offer
of
companionship
.
 
she
put


aside
the
ramming
paw
which
convey
these
offer
,
and
assure
the


joyous
volunteer
that
she
might
presently
have
a
use
for
their
company
,


saunter
on
through
the
empty
drawing
-
room
to
the
library
at
the
end
of


the
house
.
the
library
be
almost
the
only
survive
portion
of
the
old


manor

house
of
Bellomont
:

with
pleasantly

shabby
book

book
mostly
contemporaneous
with
the


ancestor
in
question
,
and
to
which
the
subsequent
Trenors
have
make
no


perceptible
addition
.
the
library
at
Bellomont
be
in
fact
never
use


for
reading
,
though
it
have
a
certain
popularity
as
a
smoking
-
room
or
a


quiet
retreat
for
flirtation
.
it
have
occur
to
Lily
,
however
,
that
it


might
on
this
occasion
have
be
resort
to
by
the
only
member
of
the


party
in
the
least
likely
to
put
it
to
its
original
use
.
she
advance


noiselessly
over
the
dense
old
rug
scatter
with
easy
-
chair
,
and
before


she
reach
the
middle
of
the
room
she
see
that
she
have
not
be


mistaken
.
Lawrence

at

for
a
moment

about
to
withdraw
,

think
well
of
this
,
she
announce
she

a
slight
shake
of
her

a
look

quiet
smile

composure

effect
on
Lily
;

in
her
case
to
make
a
more


brilliant
effort
at
self

possession

at


your
disposal

with
Mr.
Selden
!
my
engagement
be
to
go
to


church
;
and
I
be
afraid
the
omnibus
have
start
without
I
.
 
have
it


start
,
do
you
know
?
"




she
turn
to
Selden
,
who
reply
that
he
have
hear
it
drive
away
some


time
since
.




"
ah
,
then
I
shall
have
to
walk
;
I
promise
Hilda
and
Muriel
to
go
to


church
with
they
.
it
be
too
late
to
walk
there
,
you
say
?
well
,
I
shall


have
the
credit
of
try
,
at
any
rate
--
and
the
advantage
of
escape


part
of
the
service
.
I
be
not
so
sorry
for
myself
,
after
all
!
"




and
with
a
bright
nod
to
the
couple
on
whom
she
have
intrude
,
Miss
Bart


stroll
through
the
glass
door
and
carry
her
rustle
grace
down
the


long
perspective
of
the
garden
walk
.




she
be
take
her
way
churchward
,
but
at
no
very
quick
pace
;
a
fact
not


lose
on
one
of
her
observer
,
who
stand
in
the
doorway
look
after
she


with
an
air
of
puzzle
amusement
.
the
truth
be
that
she
be
conscious
of


a
somewhat
keen
shock
of
disappointment
.
all
her
plan
for
the
day
have


be
build
on
the
assumption
that
it
be
to
see
she
that
Selden
have
come


to
Bellomont
.
she
have
expect
,
when
she
come
downstairs
,
to
find
he
on


the
watch
for
she
;
and
she
have
find
he
,
instead
,
in
a
situation
which


might
well
denote
that
he
have
be
on
the
watch
for
another
lady
.
be
it


possible
,
after
all
,
that
he
have
come
for
Bertha
Dorset
?
the
latter
have


act
on
the
assumption
to
the
extent
of
appear
at
an
hour
when
she


never
show
herself
to
ordinary
mortal
,
and
Lily
,
for
the
moment
,
see


no
way
of
put
she
in
the
wrong
.
it
do
not
occur
to
she
that
Selden


might
have
be
actuate
merely
by
the
desire
to
spend
a
Sunday
out
of


town
:
woman
never
learn
to
dispense
with
the
sentimental
motive
in
their


judgment
of
man
.
but
Lily
be
not
easily
disconcert
;
competition
put


she
on
her
mettle
,
and
she
reflect
that
Selden
's
come
,
if
it
do
not


declare
he
to
be
still
in
Mrs.
Dorset
's
toil
,
show
he
to
be
so


completely
free
from
they
that
he
be
not
afraid
of
her
proximity
.




these
thought
so
engage
she
that
she
fall
into
a
gait
hardly
likely
to


carry
she
to
church
before
the
sermon
,
and
at
length
,
having
pass
from


the
garden
to
the
wood
-
path
beyond
,
so
far
forget
her
intention
as
to


sink
into
a
rustic
seat
at
a
bend
of
the
walk
.
the
spot
be
charming
,
and


Lily
be
not
insensible
to
the
charm
,
or
to
the
fact
that
her
presence


enhance
it
;
but
she
be
not
accustomed
to
taste
the
joy
of
solitude


except
in
company
,
and
the
combination
of
a
handsome
girl
and
a
romantic


scene
strike
she
as
too
good
to
be
waste
.
no
one
,
however
,
appear
to


profit
by
the
opportunity
;
and
after
a
half
hour
of
fruitless
wait
she


rise
and
wander
on
.
she
feel
a
stealing
sense
of
fatigue
as
she
walk
;


the
sparkle
have
die
out
of
she
,
and
the
taste
of
life
be
stale
on
she


lip
.
she
hardly
know
what
she
have
be
seek
,
or
why
the
failure
to


find
it
have
so
blot
the
light
from
her
sky
:
she
be
only
aware
of
a


vague
sense
of
failure
,
of
an
inner
isolation
deeply
than
the
loneliness


about
she
.




her
footstep
flag
,
and
she
stand
gaze
listlessly
ahead
,
dig
the


ferny
edge
of
the
path
with
the
tip
of
her
sunshade
.
 
as
she
do
so
a


step
sound
behind
she
,
and
she
see
Selden
at
her
side
.




"
how
fast
you
walk
!
"
he
remark
.
"
I
think
I
should
never
catch
up
with


you
.
"




she
answer
gaily
:
"
you
must
be
quite
breathless

I
've
be

under

tree

an
hour

"




"

"
he
rejoin
;
and
she
say
with
a
vague
laugh
:




"
well
--
wait
to
see
if
you
would
come
.
"




"
I
seize
the

"




"

I
have
only
a
limited
time

"




"

Lily

again
.
"

just

"




Lily
receive
this
with
fresh
appreciation
;

nonsense

like
the


bubble

look
at

enjoyment

a
note

hush
and
harmony
of


thing
.
in
his
own
mind
there
be
only
a
lazy
sense
of
pleasure
,
veil


the
sharp
edge
of
sensation
as
the
September
haze
veil
the
scene
at


their
foot
.
but
Lily
,
though
her
attitude
be
as
calm
as
his
,
be


throb
inwardly
with
a
rush
of
thought
.
there
be
in
she
at
the


moment
two
being
,
one
draw
deep
breath
of
freedom
and
exhilaration
,


the
other
gasp
for
air
in
a
little
black
prison
-
house
of
fear
.
but


gradually
the
captive
's
gasp
grow
fainter
,
or
the
other
pay
less
heed


to
they
:
the
horizon
expand
,
the
air
grow
strong
,
and
the
free
spirit


quiver
for
flight
.




she
could
not
herself
have
explain
the
sense
of
buoyancy
which
seem


to
lift
and
swing
she
above
the
sun
-
suffuse
world
at
her
foot
.
be
it


love
,
she
wonder
,
or
a
mere
fortuitous
combination
of
happy
thought


and
sensation
?
how
much
of
it
be
owe
to
the
spell
of
the
perfect


afternoon
,
the
scent
of
the
fade
wood
,
the
thought
of
the
dulness
she


have
flee
from
?
Lily
have
no
definite
experience
by
which
to
test
the


quality
of
her
feeling
.
 
she
have
several
time
be
in
love
with


fortune
or
career
,
but
only
once
with
a
man
.
that
be
year
ago
,
when


she
first
come
out
,
and
have
be
smite
with
a
romantic
passion
for
a


young
gentleman
name
Herbert
Melson
,
who
have
blue
eye
and
a
little
wave


in
his
hair
.
Mr.
Melson
,
who
be
possess
of
no
other
negotiable


security
,
have
hasten
to
employ
these
in
capture
the
eld
Miss
Van


Osburgh
:
since
then
he
have
grow
stout
and
wheezy
,
and
be
give
to


tell
anecdote
about
his
child
.
if
Lily
recall
this
early
emotion


it
be
not
to
compare
it
with
that
which
now
possess
she
;
the
only


point
of
comparison
be
the
sense
of
lightness
,
of
emancipation
,
which


she
remember
feeling
,
in
the
whirl
of
a
waltz
or
the
seclusion
of
a


conservatory
,
during
the
brief
course
of
her
youthful
romance
.
 
she
have


not
know
again
till
today
that
lightness
,
that
glow
of
freedom
;
but
now


it
be
something
more
than
a
blind
groping
of
the
blood
.
the
peculiar


charm
of
her
feeling
for
Selden
be
that
she
understand
it
;
she
could
put


her
finger
on
every
link
of
the
chain
that
be
draw
they
together
.


though
his
popularity
be
of
the
quiet
kind
,
feel
rather
than
actively


express
among
his
friend
,
she
have
never
mistake
his
inconspicuousness


for
obscurity
.
his
reputed
cultivation
be
generally
regard
as
a
slight


obstacle
to
easy
intercourse
,
but
Lily
,
who
pride
herself
on
she


broad
-
minded
recognition
of
literature
,
and
always
carry
an

Khayam

her
travel

bag
,
be
attract
by
this
attribute
,
which
she
feel


would
have
have
its
distinction
in
an
old
society
.
it
be
,
moreover
,
one


of
his
gift
to
look
his
part
;
to
have
a
height
which
lift
his
head


above
the
crowd
,
and
the
keenly
-
model
dark
feature
which
,
in
a
land


of
amorphous
type
,
give
he
the
air
of
belong
to
a
more
specialized


race
,
of
carry
the
impress
of
a
concentrated
past
.
expansive
person


find
he
a
little
dry
,
and
very
young
girl
think
he
sarcastic
;
but


this
air
of
friendly
aloofness
,
as
far
remove
as
possible
from
any


assertion
of
personal
advantage
,
be
the
quality
which
pique
Lily
's


interest
.
 
everything
about
he
accord
with
the
fastidious
element
in


her
taste
,
even
to
the
light
irony
with
which
he
survey
what
seem
to


her
most
sacred
.
she
admire
he
most
of
all
,
perhaps
,
for
be
able
to


convey
as
distinct
a
sense
of
superiority
as
the
rich
man
she
have
ever


meet
.




it
be
the
unconscious
prolongation
of
this
think
which
lead
she
to
say


presently
,
with
a
laugh
:
"
I
have
break
two

for
you
today

how
many
have
you
break
for
I
?
"




"
none
,
"
say
Selden
calmly
.
"
my
only
engagement
at
Bellomont
be
with


you
.
"




she
glance
down
at
he
,
faintly
smile
.




"
do
you
really
come
to
Bellomont
to
see
I
?
"




"
of
course
I
do
.
"




her
look
deepen
meditatively
.
"
why
?
"
she
murmur
,
with
an
accent
which


take
all
tinge
of
coquetry
from
the
question
.




"
because
you
be
such
a
wonderful
spectacle
:
I
always
like
to
see
what
you


be
do
.
"




"
how
do
you
know
what
I
should
be
do
if
you
be
not
here
?
"




Selden
smile
.
"
I
do
n't
flatter
myself
that
my
coming
have
deflect
your


course
of
action
by
a
hair
's
breadth
.
"




"
that
be
absurd
--
since
,

you
be
not
here
,
I

obviously

take
a
walk
with
you

"




"
no

your

a
walk
with

only
another
way

use

your
material

you
be
an
artist
and
I
happen
to
be
the
bit
of
colour
you


be
use
today
.
it
be
a
part
of
your
cleverness
to
be
able
to
produce


premeditate
effect
extemporaneously
.
"




Lily
smile
also
:
his
word
be
too
acute
not
to
strike
her
sense
of


humour
.
it
be
true
that
she
mean
to
use
the
accident
of
his
presence
as


part
of
a
very
definite
effect
;
or
that
,
at
least
,
be
the
secret
pretext


she
have
find
for
break
her
promise
to
walk
with
Mr.
Gryce
.
 
she
have


sometimes
be
accuse
of
be
too
eager
--
even
Judy
Trenor
have
warn


she
to
go
slowly
.
 
well
,
she
would
not
be
too
eager
in
this
case
;
she


would
give
her
suitor
a
long
taste
of
suspense
.
where
duty
and


inclination
jump
together
,
it
be
not
in
Lily
's
nature
to
hold
they


asunder
.
she
have
excuse
herself
from
the
walk
on
the
plea
of
a
headache
:


the
horrid
headache
which
,
in
the
morning
,
have
prevent
her
venture
to


church
.
her
appearance
at
luncheon
justify
the
excuse
.
 
she
look


languid
,
full
of
a
suffering
sweetness
;
she
carry
a
scent
-
bottle
in
she


hand
.
Mr.
Gryce
be
new
to
such
manifestation
;
he
wonder
rather


nervously
if
she
be
delicate
,
have
far
-
reach
fear
about
the


future
of
his
progeny
.
but
sympathy
win
the
day
,
and
he
beseech
she
not


to
expose
herself
:
he
always
connect
the
outer
air
with
idea
of


exposure
.




Lily
have
receive
his
sympathy
with
languid
gratitude
,
urge
he
,
since


she
should
be
such
poor
company
,
to
join
the
rest
of
the
party
who
,
after


luncheon
,
be
start
in
automobile
on
a
visit
to
the
Van
Osburghs
at


Peekskill
.
Mr.
Gryce
be
touch
by
her
disinterestedness
,
and
,
to
escape


from
the
threaten
vacuity
of
the
afternoon
,
have
take
her
advice
and


depart
mournfully
,
in
a
dust
-
hood
and
goggle
:
as
the
motor
-
car
plunge


down
the
avenue
she
smile
at
his
resemblance
to
a
baffled
beetle
.
Selden


have
watch
her
manoeuvre
with
lazy
amusement
.
 
she
have
make
no
reply
to


his
suggestion
that
they
should
spend
the
afternoon
together
,
but
as
she


plan
unfold
itself
he
feel
fairly
confident
of
be
include
in
it
.


the
house
be
empty
when
at
length
he
hear
her
step
on
the
stair
and


stroll
out
of
the
billiard
-
room
to
join
she
.




she
have
on
a
hat
and
walking
-
dress
,
and
the
dog
be
bound
at
she


foot
.




"
I
think
,
after
all
,
the
air
might
do
I
good
,
"
she
explain
;
and
he


agree
that
so
simple
a
remedy
be
worth
try
.




the
excursionist
would
be
go
at
least
four
hour
;
Lily
and
Selden
have


the
whole
afternoon
before
they
,
and
the
sense
of
leisure
and
safety
give


the
last
touch
of
lightness
to
her
spirit
.
with
so
much
time
to
talk
,
and


no
definite
object
to
be
lead
up
to
,
she
could
taste
the
rare
joy
of


mental
vagrancy
.




she
feel
so
free
from
ulterior
motive
that
she
take
up
his
charge
with
a


touch
of
resentment
.




"

lean
near

draw


down
her

a
gesture
less
passionate
than
grave

reflection
steady
his

pity
and
irony

quiver
of
his


egoism

at
once

quite
simply

so
completely

how
far
this

a
distinct

Miss

leisure
to
muse
over

application

herself

why
should

to
suffer
for
have
once
,
for
a
few
hour
,
borrow
money

an


elderly
cousin

when
a
woman
like
Carry
Fisher
could
make
a
living


unrebuked
from
the
good

nature
of
her
man
friend

the
tolerance
of


their

it
all
turn
on
the
tiresome
distinction
between
what
a


married
woman
might
,
and
a
girl
might
not
,
do

of

shocking


for
a
married
woman
to
borrow
money

and
Lily
be
expertly
aware
of
the


implication

still
,
it
be
the
mere
MALUM

the

decrie

condone
,

which
,
though
it
may
be
punish
by


private
vengeance
,
do
not
provoke
the
collective
disapprobation
of


society

Miss
Bart
,
in
short
,
no
such
opportunity
be
possible

she


could
of
course
borrow
from
her
woman
friend
--
a
hundred
here

there
,


at
the
utmost
--

they
be
more
ready
to
give
a
gown

a
trinket

look
a
little
askance
when

those
among
whom
her

either
in

herself

else
too
far
remove
from
it


to
understand
its
necessity
.
 
the
result
of
her
meditation
be
the


decision
to
join
her
aunt

dear
friend

confirm
the


assurance
by
the
appeal
of
her
exquisite
nearness

he
be
ready
to
swear


that
such
a
marriage
be
a
desecration

that
,

a

could

an
uncalculated
impulse

it

feel
really
virtuous
as


she
dispense
the
sum
in
sop
to
her
tradesman
,
and
the
fact
that
a
fresh


order
accompany
each
payment
do
not
lessen
her
sense
of


disinterestedness

how
many
woman
,
in
her
place

have

the

an

that
she
consequently


owe
he
no
more

the
gratitude

such

she
vaguely
suppose
that

raise
the

he
have

this
be
a
point
over

she

decline

that
,

much
tall
than

,
she
have

the

at
the

long


before

the

on

the

that
she

a
casual
spectator
,

of
the


mystically
veiled

her
resolve

a
special
appositeness

to
these
reflection
by
the

there
be
something
almost
bridal
in
his

gardenia
have
a
symbolic
air
that
strike
Lily
as
a
good
oman
.


after
all
,
see
in
an
assemblage
of
his
kind
he
be
not


ridiculous
-
look
:
a
friendly
critic
might
have
call
his
heaviness


weighty
,
and
he
be
at
his
good
in
the
attitude
of

passivity
which


bring
out
the

man
whose
sentimental
association
would
be

by
the
conventional


imagery
of

the
terrace

a

man


be
linger
over
cigarette

liqueur

scatter
couple

autumn

stir

the
pulse

his


nearness
always
cause
be
increase
by
a
slight
sense
of
constraint

they
have
not
meet
since
their
Sunday
afternoon
walk
at
Bellomont

that


episode
be
still
so
vivid
to
she
that
she
could
hardly
believe
he
to
be


less
conscious
of
it

his
greeting
express
no
more
than
the


satisfaction
which
every
pretty
woman
expect
to
see
reflect
in


masculine
eye
;

the
discovery

distasteful

vanity

reassure

nerve

the
relief

her
escape

the
vague
apprehension
of
her
meeting
with

pleasant


to
rest
a
moment

complete
understanding

Lawrence

still
extract
sentimental
solace
from
the
wedding
present

she


appear
to
regard
their
number

value

evidence

the
disintereste


affection

slightly

enjoyment

her
grace

feel
with
a


faint
chill
of
regret

back

an
effort

something
more

piece

sentient
prettiness

a
pass


diversion

his

by
a
sudden


obstacle

a

mood

she
continue
to
face
he
in
silence
,
her
glance
just
level


with
his
polished
baldness
.
the
look
put
the
finishing
touch
to
what
she


silence
imply
.

redden
slowly
,
shift
from
one
foot
to
the
other
,
finger
the


plump
black
pearl
in
his
tie
,
and
give
a
nervous
twist
to
his
moustache
;


then
,
run
his
eye
over
she
,
he
draw
back
,
and
say
,
with
a


side
-
glance
at
Selden
:
"
upon
my
soul
,
I
never

a
more

if
so

I
wonder
all
the

n't
go
to

too
!
"




the
word
be
project
sharply
against
Lily
's
silence
,
and
she
see
in
a


flash
that
her
own
act
have
give
they
their
emphasis
.
in
ordinary
talk


they
might
have
pass
unheeded
;
but
follow
on
her
prolong
pause


they
acquire
a
special
meaning
.
she
feel
,
without
look
,
that
Selden


have
immediately
seize
it
,
and
would
inevitably
connect
the
allusion
with


her
visit
to
himself
.
the
consciousness
increase
her
irritation
against


Rosedale
,
but
also
her
feeling
that
now
,
if
ever
,
be
the
moment
to


propitiate
he
,
hateful
as
it
be
to
do
so
in
Selden
's
presence
.




"
how
do
you

not
afraid
to
give
her
address
to
my

"




her
glance
and
accent
so
plainly
include
Rosedale
in
this
privileged


circle
that
his
small
eye
pucker
with
gratification
,

a
know


smile
draw
up
his
moustache

"

Jove
,

he
declare
.
"

'em
the
whole


outfit

win
at
a
canter

"
ah
,
that
be
nice
of
you

it
would
be
nice
still
if
you
would
carry


I
off
to
a
quiet
corner
,
and
get
I
a
glass
of
lemonade
or
some
innocent


drink
before
we
all
have
to
rush
for
the
train
.
"




she
turn
away
as
she
speak
,
let
he
strut
at
her
side
through
the


gather
group
on
the
terrace
,
while
every
nerve
in
her
throbbed
with


the
consciousness
of
what
Selden
must
have
think
of
the
scene
.




but
under
her
angry
sense
of
the
perverseness
of
thing
,
and
the
light


surface
of
her
talk
with
Rosedale
,
a
third
idea
persist
:
she
do
not


mean
to
leave
without
an
attempt
to
discover
the
truth
about
Percy
Gryce
.


chance
,
or
perhaps
his
own
resolve
,
have
keep
they
apart
since
his
hasty


withdrawal
from
Bellomont
;
but
Miss
Bart
be
an
expert
in
make
the
most


of
the
unexpected
,
and
the
distasteful
incident
of
the
last
few


minute
--
the
revelation
to
Selden
of
precisely
that
part
of
her
life


which
she
most
wish
he
to
ignore
--
increase
her
longing
for
shelter
,


for
escape
from
such
humiliating
contingency
.
any
definite
situation


would
be
more
tolerable
than
this
buffeting
of
chance
,
which
keep
she
in


an
attitude
of
uneasy
alertness
toward
every
possibility
of
life
.




indoor
there
be
a
general
sense
of
dispersal
in
the
air

itself
up
for
departure

the
principal
actor

among

about

ugliness
of

aside
with
an

as
she
do
so


she

that
she

again
descend
the
staircase
from
Selden

room
;
and
look
down
to


remonstrate
with
the
dispenser
of
the
soapy
flood
,
she
find
herself
meet


by
a
lift
stare
which
have
once
before
confront
she
under
similar


circumstance
.
it
be
the
char
-
woman
of
the
Benedick
who
,
rest
on


crimson
elbow

unflinche
curiosity

apparent
reluctance

at
first
seem
not

then
,
without
a
word
of
excuse
,


she
push
back
her
pail
and
drag
a
wet
floor

cloth
across
the


land
,
keep
her
eye
fix
on
Lily
while
the
latter
sweep
by
.
it
be


insufferable
that
Mrs.
Peniston
should
have
such
creature
about
the


house
;
and
Lily
enter
her

Mrs.
Peniston

shut
up
with
her
maid

over
she


fur
,
a
process
which
form
the
culminate
episode
in
the
drama
of


household
renovation
.
in
the
evening
also
Lily
find
herself
alone
,
for


her
aunt
,
who
rarely
dine
out
,
have
respond
to
the
summon
of
a
Van


Alstyne
cousin
who
be
pass
through
town
.
the
house
,
in
its
state
of


unnatural
immaculateness
and
order
,
be
as
dreary
as
a
tomb
,
and
as
Lily
,


turn
from
her
brief
repast
between
shroud
sideboard
,
wander
into


the
newly
-
uncover
glare
of
the
drawing
-
room
she
feel
as
though
she
be


bury
alive
in
the
stifle
limit
of
Mrs.
Peniston
's
existence
.




she
usually
contrive
to
avoid
be
at
home
during
the
season
of


domestic
renewal
.
on
the
present
occasion
,
however
,
a
variety
of
reason


have
combine
to
bring
she
to
town
;
and
foremost
among
they
be
the
fact


that
she
have
few
invitation
than
usual
for
the
autumn
.
she
have
so
long


be
accustomed
to
pass
from
one
country
-
house
to
another
,
till
the
close


of
the
holiday
bring
her
friend
to
town
,
that
the
unfilled
gap
of


time
confront
she
produce
a
sharp
sense
of
wane
popularity
.
it
be


as
she
have
say
to
Selden
--
people
be
tired
of
she
.
 
they
would
welcome


she
in
a
new
character
,
but
as
Miss
Bart
they
know
she
by
heart
.
 
she


know
herself
by
heart
too
,
and
be
sick
of
the
old
story
.
 
there
be


moment
when
she
long
blindly
for
anything
different
,
anything
strange
,


remote
and
untried
;
but
the
utmost
reach
of
her
imagination
do
not
go


beyond
picture
her
usual
life
in
a
new
setting
.
she
could
not
figure


herself
as
anywhere
but
in
a
drawing
-
room
,
diffuse
elegance
as
a
flower


shed
perfume
.




meanwhile
,
as
October
advance
she
have
to
face
the
alternative
of


return
to
the
Trenors
or
join
her
aunt
in
town
.
even
the
desolating


dulness
of
New
York
in
October
,
and
the
soapy
discomfort
of
Mrs.


Peniston
's
interior
,
seem
preferable
to
what
might
await
she
at


bellomont
;
and
with
an
air
of
heroic
devotion
she
announce
her
intention


of
remain
with
her
aunt
till
the
holiday
.




sacrifice
of
this
nature
be
sometimes
receive
with
feeling
as
mixed


as
those
which
actuate
they
;
and
Mrs.
Peniston
remark
to
she


confidential
maid
that
,
if
any
of
the
family
be
to
be
with
she
at
such


a
crisis

for
forty
year

be
think
competent
to

her

would
certainly
have

out

represent


the
one
artistic
excess
of
Mr.

temperate
career

Mrs.

,

ordinary
circumstance
,
be
as
much

the

ask
.




"
I
should

a
word
to

the
tone
be
neither


aggressive
nor
conciliatory
:
it
reveal
nothing
of
the
speaker
's
errand
.


nevertheless
,
some
precautionary
instinct
warn
Lily
to
withdraw

shot
of
the
hover

she
speak


the
name
with
an
unpleasant
emphasis
,

though
her
know
it
make
a


part
of
her
reason

she
return
.




Lily
look
at
she
perplexedly
.
she
be
sure
,
now
,
that
her
visitor
's


manner
convey
a
threat
;
but
,
expert
as
she
be
in
certain
direction
,


there
be
nothing
in
her
experience
to
prepare
she
for
the
exact


significance
of
the
present
scene
.
she
feel
,

,
that
it
must
be


end
as
promptly
as
possible

for


I

"




the
woman
be
unabashe
by
the
question
.
she
be
evidently
prepared
to


answer
it
,
but
like
all
her
class
she
have
to
go
a
long
way
back
to
make
a


beginning
,
and
it
be
only
after
a
pause
that
she
reply
:
"
my
husband


be
janitor
to
the
Benedick
till
the
first
of
the
month
;

then
he


ca
n't
get
nothing
to
do
.
"




Lily
remain
silent
and
she
continue
:
"
it
be
n't
no
fault
of
our
own
,


neither
:
the
agent
have
another
man
he
want
the
place
for
,

we
be


put
out
,
bag
and
baggage
,
just
to
suit
his
fancy
.
 
I
have
a
long
sickness


last
winter
,
and
an
operation
that
eat
up
all
we
'd
put
by
;
and
it
be
hard


for
I
and
the
child
,
Haffen
be
so
long
out
of
a
job
.
"




after
all
,
then
,
she
have
come
only
to
ask
Miss
Bart
to
find
a
place
for


her
husband
;
or
,
more
probably
,
to
seek
the
young
lady
's
intervention


with
Mrs.
Peniston
.
Lily
have
such
an
air
of
always
get
what
she


want
that
she
be
use
to
be
appeal
to
as
an
intermediary
,
and
,


relieve
of
her
vague
apprehension
,
she
take
refuge
in
the
conventional


formula
.




"
I
be
sorry
you
have
be
in
trouble
,
"
she
say
.




"
oh
,
that
we
have
,
Miss
,

it
be
on'y
just

another

at
this
point
Lily
's
impatience
overcome
she
.
"
if
you
have
anything
to


say
to
me----
"
she
interpose
.




the
woman
's
resentment
of
the
rebuff
seem
to
spur
her
lag
idea
.




"
yes
,
Miss
;
I
be
come
to
that
,
"
she
say
.
she
pause
again
,
with
she


eye
on
Lily
,
and
then
continue
,
in
a
tone
of
diffuse
narrative
:
"
when


we
be
at
the
Benedick
I
have
charge
of
some
of
the
gentleman
's
room
;


leastway
,
I
swep
'
'em
out
on
Saturdays
.
 
some
of
the
gentleman
get
the


great
sight
of
letter
:
I
never
see
the
like
of
it
.
their
waste
-
paper


basket
'd
be
fairly
brim
,
and
paper
fall
over
on
the
floor
.


maybe
havin'
so
many
be
how
they
get
so
careless
.
some
of
'em
be
bad


than
other
.
Mr.
Selden
,
Mr.
Lawrence
Selden
,
he
be
always
one
of
the


carefullest
:
burn
his
letter
in
winter
,
and
tear
'em
in
little
bit
in


summer
.
but
sometimes
he
'd
have
so
many
he
'd
just
bunch
'em
together
,
the


way
the
other
do
,
and
tear
the
lot
through
once
--
like
this
.
"




while
she
speak
she
have
loosen
the
string
from
the
parcel
in
her
hand
,


and
now
she
draw
forth
a
letter
which
she
lay
on
the
table
between
Miss


Bart
and
herself
.
as
she
have
say
,
the
letter
be
tear
in
two
;
but
with
a


rapid
gesture
she
lay
the
tear
edge
together
and
smooth
out
the
page
.




a
wave
of
indignation
sweep
over
Lily
.
she
feel
herself
in
the
presence


of
something
vile
,
as
yet
but
dimly
conjecture
--
the
kind
of
vileness
of


which
people
whisper
,
but
which
she
have
never
think
of
as
touch


her
own
life
.
she
draw
back
with
a
motion
of
disgust
,
but
her
withdrawal


be
check
by
a
sudden
discovery
:
under
the
glare
of
Mrs.
Peniston
's


chandelier
she
have
recognize
the
hand
-
writing
of
the
letter
.
it
be
a


large
disjointed
hand
,
with
a
flourish
of
masculinity
which
but
slightly


disguise
its
ramble
weakness
,
and
the
word
,
scrawl
in
heavy
ink
on


pale
-
tint
notepaper
,
smite
on
Lily
's
ear
as
though
she
have
hear
they


speak
.




at
first
she
do
not
grasp
the
full
import
of
the
situation
.
she


understand
only
that
before
she
lie
a
letter
write
by
Bertha
Dorset
,


and
address
,
presumably
,
to
Lawrence
Selden
.
there
be
no
date
,
but
the


blackness
of
the
ink
prove
the
writing
to
be
comparatively
recent
.
 
the


packet
in
Mrs.
Haffen
's
hand
doubtless
contain
more
letter
of
the
same


kind
--
a
dozen
,
Lily
conjecture
from
its
thickness
.
the
letter
before
she


be
short
,
but
its
few
word
,
which
have
leapt
into
her
brain
before
she


be
conscious
of
read
they
,
tell
a
long
history
--
a
history
over
which
,


for
the
last
four
year
,
the
friend
of
the
writer
have
smile
and


shrug
,
view
it
merely
as
one
among
the
countless
"
good
situation
"


of
the
mundane
comedy
.
now
the
other
side
present
itself
to
Lily
,
the


volcanic
nether
side
of
the
surface
over
which
conjecture
and
innuendo

so
lightly
till
the
first
fissure
turn
their
whisper

a
shriek

Lily
know
that
there
be
nothing
society
resent
so
much
as
having
give


its
protection
to
those
who
have
not
know
how
to
profit
by
it
:
it
be
for


having
betray
its
connivance
that
the
body
social
punish
the
offender


who
be
find
out
.
and
in
this
case
there
be
no
doubt
of
the
issue
.
the


code
of
Lily
's
world
decree
that
a
woman
's
husband
should
be
the
only


judge
of
her
conduct
:
she
be
technically
above
suspicion
while
she
have


the
shelter
of
his
approval
,
or
even
of
his
indifference
.
but
with
a
man


of
George
Dorset
's
temper
there
could
be
no
thought
of
condonation
--
the


possessor
of
his
wife
's
letter
could
overthrow
with
a
touch
the
whole


structure
of
her
existence
.
and
into
what
hand
Bertha
Dorset
's
secret


have
be
deliver
!
for
a
moment
the
irony
of
the
coincidence
tinge


Lily
's
disgust
with
a
confused
sense
of
triumph
.
but
the
disgust


prevail
--
all
her
instinctive
resistance
,
of
taste
,
of
training
,
of


blind
inherit
scruple
,
rise
against
the
other
feeling
.
her
strong


sense
be
one
of
personal
contamination
.




she
move
away
,
as
though
to
put
as
much
distance
as
possible
between


herself
and
her
visitor
.
"
I
know
nothing

;

I


have
no

Mrs.

steadily
.

I
'll
tell
you
why

Miss.
 
I

on
again
at
the
Benedick

see
you


talk
to
Mr.
Rosedale
on
the
step
that
day
you
come
out
of
Mr.


Selden

rooms----
"




the
blood
rush
to
Lily
's
forehead
.
she
understand
now
--
Mrs.
Haffen


suppose
she
to
be
the
writer
of
the
letter
.
in
the
first
leap
of
she


anger
she
be
about
to
ring
and
order
the
woman
out
;
but
an
obscure


impulse
restrain
she
.
the
mention
of
Selden
's
name
have
start
a
new


train
of
thought
.
Bertha
Dorset
's
letter
be
nothing
to
she
--
they
might


go
where
the
current
of
chance
carry
they
!
but
Selden
be
inextricably


involve
in
their
fate
.
 
man
do
not
,
at
bad
,
suffer
much
from
such


exposure
;
and
in
this
instance
the
flash
of
divination
which
have
carry


the
meaning
of
the
letter
to
Lily
's
brain
have
reveal
also
that
they


be
appeal
--
repeat
and
therefore
probably
unanswered
--
for
the
renewal


of
a
tie
which
time
have
evidently
relax
.
 
nevertheless
,
the
fact
that


the
correspondence
have
be
allow
to
fall
into
strange
hand
would


convict
Selden
of
negligence
in
a
matter
where
the
world
hold
it
least


pardonable
;
and
there
be
graver
risk
to
consider
where
a
man
of


Dorset
's
ticklish
balance
be
concern
.




if
she
weigh
all
these
thing
it
be
unconsciously
:
she
be
aware
only


of
feeling
that
Selden
would
wish
the
letter
rescue
,
and
that
therefore


she
must
obtain
possession
of
they
.
beyond
that
her
mind
do
not
travel
.


she
have
,
indeed
,
a
quick
vision
of
return
the
packet
to
Bertha
Dorset
,


and
of
the
opportunity
the
restitution
offer
;
but
this
thought
light
up


abyss
from
which
she
shrink
back
ashamed
.




meanwhile
Mrs.
Haffen
,
prompt
to
perceive
her
hesitation
,
have
already


open
the
packet
and
range
its
content
on
the
table
.
 
all
the
letter


have
be
piece
together
with
strip
of
thin
paper
.
some
be
in
small


fragment
,
the
other
merely
tear
in
half
.

there
be
not
many
,


thus
spread
out
they
nearly
cover
the
table

Lily
's
glance
fall
on
a


word
here
and
there
--
then
she
say
in
a
low
voice
:
"
what
do
you
wish
I


to
pay
you
?
"




Mrs.
Haffen
's
face
redden
with
satisfaction
.
it
be
clear
that
the


young
lady
be
badly
frightened
,
and
Mrs.
Haffen
be
the
woman
to
make


the
most
of
such
fear
.
anticipate
an
easy
victory
than
she
have


foresee
,
she
name
an
exorbitant
sum
.




but
Miss
Bart
show
herself
a
less
ready
prey
than
might
have
be


expect
from
her
imprudent
opening
.
she
refuse
to
pay
the
price
name
,


and
after
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
meet
it
by
a
counter
-
offer
of
half
the


amount
.




Mrs.
Haffen
immediately
stiffen
.
her
hand
travel
toward
the


outspread
letter
,
and
fold
they
slowly
,
she
make
as
though
to
restore


they
to
their
wrapping
.




"
I
guess
they
be
worth
more
to
you
than
to
I
,
Miss
,

the
poor
have
get


to
live
as
well
as
the
rich

she
observe
sententiously
.






Lily
be
throb
with
fear
,
but
the
insinuation
fortify
she


resistance
.




"
you
be
mistaken
,
"
she
say
indifferently
.
"
I
have
offer
all
I
be


willing
to
give
for
the
letter

there
may
be
other
way
of
get


they
.
"




Mrs.
Haffen
raise
a
suspicious
glance
:
she
be
too
experienced
not
to


know
that
the
traffic
she
be
engage
in
have
peril
as
great
as
its


reward
,
and
she
have
a
vision
of
the
elaborate
machinery
of
revenge
which


a
word
of
this
command
young
lady
's
might
set
in
motion
.




she
apply
the
corner
of
her
shawl
to
her
eye
,
and
murmur
through
it


that
no
good
come
of
bear
too
hard
on
the
poor
,
but
that
for
her
part


she
have
never
be
mix
up
in
such
a
business
before
,
and
that
on
she


honour
as
a
Christian
all
she
and
Haffen
have
think
of
be
that
the


letter
must
n't
go
any
far
.




Lily
stand
motionless
,
keep
between
herself
and
the
char
-
woman
the


great
distance
compatible
with
the
need
of
speak
in
low
tone
.
 
the


idea
of
bargaining
for
the
letter
be
intolerable
to
she
,
but
she
know


that
,
if
she
appear
to
weaken
,
Mrs.
Haffen
would
at
once
increase
she


original
demand
.




she
could
never
afterward
recall
how
long
the
duel
last
,
or
what
be


the
decisive
stroke
which
finally
,
after
a
lapse
of
time
record
in


minute
by
the
clock
,
in
hour
by
the
precipitate
beat
of
her
pulse
,
put


she
in
possession
of
the
letter
;
she
know
only
that
the
door
have
finally


close
,
and
that
she
stand
alone
with
the
packet
in
her
hand
.




she
have
no
idea
of
read
the
letter
;
even
to
unfold
Mrs.
Haffen
's


dirty
newspaper
would
have
seem
degrading
.
but
what
do
she
intend
to


do
with
its
content
?
the
recipient
of
the
letter
have
mean
to
destroy


they
,
and
it
be
her
duty
to
carry
out
his
intention
.
she
have
no
right
to


keep
they
--
to
do
so
be
to
lessen
whatever
merit
lie
in
having
secure


their
possession
.
but
how
destroy
they
so
effectually
that
there
should


be
no
second
risk
of
their
fall
in
such
hand

of
woman

my
dear
,
you
look
tired

suppose
it

the
excitement

Cornelia

it
be
odd

the
CONSOMME

a

breakfast

it
straight
from

a
whole
closet
-
full
,
I


remember
;
and
I
can
tell
to
this
day
what
ball
I
get
they
at
.
Molly
Van


Alstyne
remind
I
of
what
I
be
at
that
age
;
it
be
wonderful
how
she


notice
.
she
be
able
to
tell
her
mother
exactly
how
the
wedding
-
dress


be
cut
,
and
we
know
at
once
,
from
the
fold
in
the
back
,
that
it
must


have
come
from
Paquin
.
"




Mrs.
Peniston
rise
abruptly
,
and
,
advance
to
the
ormolu
clock


surmount
by
a
helmeted
Minerva
,
which
throne
on
the
chimney
-
piece


between
two
malachite
vase
,
pass
her
lace
handkerchief
between
the


helmet
and
its
visor
.




"
I
know
it
--
the
parlour
-
maid
never
dust
there
!
"
she
exclaim
,


triumphantly
display
a
minute
spot
on
the
handkerchief
;
then
,


reseat
herself
,
she
go
on
:
"
molly
think
Mrs.
Dorset
the


well
-
dress
woman
at
the
wedding
.
I
've
no
doubt
her
dress
do
cost
more


than
any
one
else
's
,
but
I
ca
n't
quite
like
the
idea
--
a
combination
of


sable
and
POINT
DE
MILAN
.
it
seem
she
go
to
a
new
man
in
Paris
,
who


wo
n't
take
an
order
till
his
client
have
spend
a
day
with
he
at
his
villa


at
Neuilly
.
he
say
he
must
study
his
subject
's
home
life
--
a
most


peculiar
arrangement
,
I
should
say
!
but
Mrs.
Dorset
tell
Molly
about
it


herself
:
she
say
the
villa
be
full
of
the
most
exquisite
thing
and
she


be
really
sorry
to
leave
.
molly
say
she
never
see
her
look
well
;


she
be
in
tremendous
spirit
,
and
say
she
have
make
a
match
between
Evie


Van
Osburgh
and
Percy
Gryce
.
she
really
seem
to
have
a
very
good


influence
on
young
man
.
I
hear
she
be
interesting
herself
now
in
that


silly
Silverton
boy
,
who
have
have
his
head
turn
by
Carry
Fisher
,
and
have


be
gamble
so
dreadfully
.
well
,
as
I
be
say
,
Evie
be
really


engage
:
Mrs.
Dorset
have
she
to
stay
with
Percy
Gryce
,
and
manage
it


all
,
and
Grace
Van
Osburgh
be
in
the
seventh
heaven
--
she
have
almost


despair
of
marry
Evie
.
"




Mrs.
Peniston
again
pause
,
but
this
time
her
scrutiny
address
itself
,


not
to
the
furniture
,
but
to
her
niece
.




"
Cornelia
Van
Alstyne
be
so
surprised
:
she
have
hear
that
you
be
to


marry
young
Gryce
.
she
see
the
Wetheralls
just
after
they
have
stop


with
you
at
Bellomont
,
and
Alice
Wetherall
be
quite
sure
there
be
an


engagement
.
she
say
that
when
Mr.
Gryce
leave
unexpectedly
one
morning
,


they
all
think
he
have
rush
to
town
for
the
ring
.
"




Lily
rise
and
move
toward
the
door
.




"
I
believe
I
be
tired
:
I
think
I
will
go
to
bed
,
"
she
say
;
and
Mrs.


Peniston
,
suddenly
distract
by
the
discovery
that
the
easel
sustain


the
late
Mr.
Peniston
's
crayon
-
portrait
be
not
exactly
in
line
with
the


sofa
in
front
of
it
,
present
an
absent
-
minded
brow
to
her
kiss
.




in
her
own
room
Lily
turn
up
the
gas
-
jet
and
glance
toward
the
grate
.


it
be
as
brilliantly
polished
as
the
one
below
,
but
here
at
least
she


could
burn
a
few
paper
with
less
risk
of
incur
her
aunt
's


disapproval
.
she
make
no
immediate
motion
to
do
so
,
however
,
but
drop


into
a
chair
look
wearily
about
she
.
her
room
be
large
and


comfortably
-
furnished
--
it
be
the
envy
and
admiration
of
poor
grace


Stepney
,
who
board
;
but
,
contrast
with
the
light
tint
and
luxurious


appointment
of
the
guest
-
room
where
so
many
week
of
Lily
's
existence


be
spend
,
it
seem
as
dreary
as
a
prison
.
the
monumental
wardrobe
and


bedstead
of
black
walnut
have
migrate
from
Mr.
Peniston
's
bedroom
,
and


the
magenta
"
flock
"
wall
-
paper
,
of
a
pattern
dear
to
the
early
'
sixty
,


be
hang
with
large
steel
engraving
of
an
anecdotic
character
.
Lily
have


try
to
mitigate
this
charmless
background
by
a
few
frivolous
touch
,


in
the
shape
of
a
lace
-
deck
toilet
table
and
a
little
paint
desk


surmount
by
photograph
;
but
the
futility
of
the
attempt
strike
she
as


she
look
about
the
room
.
what
a
contrast
to
the
subtle
elegance
of
the


set
she
have
picture
for
herself
--
an
apartment
which
should
surpass


the
complicated
luxury
of
her
friend
'
surrounding
by
the
whole
extent


of
that
artistic
sensibility
which
make
she
feel
herself
their
superior
;


in
which
every
tint
and
line
should
combine
to
enhance
her
beauty
and


give
distinction
to
her
leisure
!
once
more
the
haunt
sense
of
physical


ugliness
be
intensify
by
her
mental
depression
,
so
that
each
piece
of


the
offend
furniture
seem
to
thrust
forth
its
most
aggressive
angle
.




her
aunt
's
word
have
tell
she
nothing
new
;
but
they
have
revive
the


vision
of
Bertha
Dorset
,
smile
,
flattered
,
victorious
,
hold
she
up


to
ridicule
by
insinuation
intelligible
to
every
member
of
their
little


group
.
the
thought
of
the
ridicule
strike
deep
than
any
other


sensation
:
Lily
know
every
turn
of
the
allusive
jargon
which
could
flay


its
victim
without
the
shedding
of
blood
.
her
cheek
burn
at
the


recollection
,
and
she
rise
and
catch
up
the
letter
.
she
no
long
mean


to
destroy
they
:
that
intention
have
be
efface
by
the
quick
corrosion


of
Mrs.
Peniston
's
word
.




instead
,
she
approach
her
desk
,
and
light
a
taper
,
tie
and
seal


the
packet
;
then
she
open
the
wardrobe
,
draw
out
a
despatch
-
box
,
and


deposit
the
letter
within
it
.
as
she
do
so
,
it
strike
she
with
a


flash
of
irony
that
she
be
indebted
to
Gus
Trenor
for
the
mean
of


buy
they
.








chapter

the
autumn
drag
on
monotonously
.
Miss
Bart
have
receive
one
or
two


note
from
Judy
Trenor
,
reproach
she
for
not
return
to
Bellomont
;


but
she
reply
evasively
,
allege
the
obligation
to
remain
with
she


aunt
.
in
truth
,
however
,
she
be
fast
wearying
of
her
solitary
existence


with
Mrs.
Peniston
,
and
only
the
excitement
of
spend
she


newly
-
acquire
money
lighten
the
dulness
of
the
day
.




all
her
life
Lily
have
see
money
go
out
as
quickly
as
it
come
in
,
and


whatever
theory
she
cultivate
as
to
the
prudence
of
set
aside
a


part
of
her
gain
,
she
have
unhappily
no
save
vision
of
the
risk
of
the


opposite
course
.
it
be
a
keen
satisfaction
to
feel
that
,
for
a
few


month
at
least
,
she
would
be
independent
of
her
friend
'
bounty
,
that


she
could
show
herself
abroad
without
wonder
whether
some
penetrate


eye
would
detect
in
her
dress
the
trace
of
Judy
Trenor
's
refurbish


splendour
.
the
fact
that
the
money
free
she
temporarily
from
all
minor


obligation
obscure
her
sense
of
the
great
one
it
represent
,
and


having
never
before
know
what
it
be
to
command
so
large
a
sum
,
she


linger
delectably
over
the
amusement
of
spend
it
.




it
be
on
one
of
these
occasion
that
,
leave
a
shop
where
she
have
spend


an
hour
of
deliberation
over
a
dressing
-
case
of
the
most
complicated


elegance
,
she
run
across
Miss
Farish
,
who
have
enter
the
same


establishment
with
the
modest
object
of
have
her
watch
repair
.
 
Lily


be
feel
unusually
virtuous
.
she
have
decide
to
defer
the
purchase
of


the
dressing
-
case
till
she
should
receive
the
bill
for
her
new


opera
-
cloak
,
and
the
resolve
make
she
feel
much
rich
than
when
she
have


enter
the
shop
.
in
this
mood
of
self
-
approval
she
have
a
sympathetic
eye


for
other
,
and
she
be
strike
by
her
friend
's
air
of
dejection
.




Miss
Farish
,
it
appear
,
have
just
leave
the
committee
-
meeting
of
a


struggle
charity
in
which
she
be
interested
.
the
object
of
the


association
be
to
provide
comfortable
lodging
,
with
a
reading
-
room
and


other
modest
distraction
,
where
young
woman
of
the
class
employ
in


down
town
office
might
find
a
home
when
out
of
work
,
or
in
need
of
rest
,


and
the
first
year
's
financial
report
show
so
deplorably
small
a


balance
that
Miss
Farish
,
who
be
convince
of
the
urgency
of
the
work
,


feel
proportionately
discourage
by
the
small
amount
of
interest
it


arouse
.
the
other
-
regard
sentiment
have
not
be
cultivate
in
Lily
,


and
she
be
often
bore
by
the
relation
of
her
friend
's
philanthropic


effort
,
but
today
her
quick
dramatize
fancy
seize
on
the
contrast


between
her
own
situation
and
that
represent
by
some
of
Gerty
's


"
case
.
"
these
be
young
girl
,
like
herself
;
some
perhaps
pretty
,
some


not
without
a
trace
of
her
fine
sensibility
.
she
picture
herself


lead
such
a
life
as
theirs
--
a
life
in
which
achievement
seem
as


squalid
as
failure
--
and
the
vision
make
her
shudder
sympathetically
.
the


price
of
the
dressing
-
case
be
still
in
her
pocket
;
and
draw
out
she


little
gold
purse
she
slip
a
liberal
fraction
of
the
amount
into
Miss


Farish
's
hand
.




the
satisfaction
derive
from
this
act
be
all
that
the
most
ardent


moralist
could
have
desire
.
Lily
feel
a
new
interest
in
herself
as
a


person
of
charitable
instinct
:
she
have
never
before
thought
of
do


good
with
the
wealth
she
have
so
often
dream
of
possess
,
but
now
her


horizon
be
enlarge
by
the
vision
of
a
prodigal
philanthropy
.
 
moreover
,


by
some
obscure
process
of
logic
,
she
feel
that
her
momentary
burst
of


generosity
have
justify
all
previous
extravagance
,
and
excuse
any
in


which
she
might
subsequently
indulge
.
Miss
Farish
's
surprise
and


gratitude
confirm
this
feeling
,
and
Lily
part
from
she
with
a
sense


of
self
-
esteem
which
she
naturally
mistook
for
the
fruit
of
altruism
.




about
this
time
she
be
far
cheer
by
an
invitation
to
spend
the


thanksgiving
week
at
a
camp
in
the
Adirondacks
.
the
invitation
be
one


which
,
a
year
early
,
would
have
provoke
a
less
ready
response
,
for
the


party
,
though
organize
by
Mrs.
Fisher
,
be
ostensibly
give
by
a
lady
of


obscure
origin
and
indomitable
social
ambition
,
whose
acquaintance
Lily


have
hitherto
avoid
.
now
,
however
,
she
be
disposed
to
coincide
with


Mrs.
Fisher
's
view
,
that
it
do
n't
matter
who
give
the
party
,
as
long
as


thing
be
well
do
;
and
do
thing
well
(
under
competent
direction
)

the

whose
consort

know


as
"
welly
"
bry
on
the
Stock
Exchange
and
in

)
have
already


sacrifice
one
husband
,
and
sundry
minor
consideration
,
to
she


determination
to
get
on
;
and
,
having
obtain
a
hold
on
Carry
Fisher
,
she


be
astute
enough
to
perceive
the
wisdom
of
commit
herself
entirely


to
that
lady
's
guidance
.
everything
,
accordingly
,
be
well
do
,
for


there
be
no
limit
to
Mrs.
Fisher
's
prodigality
when
she
be
not
spend


her
own
money
,
and
as
she
remark
to
her
pupil
,
a
good
cook
be
the
good


introduction
to
society
.
if
the
company
be
not
as
select
as
the
CUISINE
,


the
Welly
Brys
at
least
have
the
satisfaction
of
figure
for
the
first


time
in
the
society
column
in
company
with
one
or
two
noticeable
name
;


and
foremost
among
these
be
of
course
Miss
Bart

.
the
young
lady
be


treat
by
her
host
with
corresponding
deference
;
and
she
be
in
the


mood
when
such
attention
be
acceptable
,
whatever
their
source
.
Mrs.


bry
's
admiration
be
a
mirror
in
which
Lily
's
self
-
complacency
recover


its
lost
outline
.
no
insect
hang
its
nest
on
thread
as
frail
as
those


which
will
sustain
the
weight
of
human
vanity
;
and
the
sense
of
be
of


importance
among
the
insignificant
be
enough
to
restore
to
Miss
Bart
the


gratify
consciousness
of
power
.
if
these
people
pay
court
to
her
it


prove
that
she
be
still
conspicuous
in
the
world
to
which
they
aspire
;


and
she
be
not
above
a
certain
enjoyment
in
dazzle
they
by
she


fineness
,
in
develop
their
puzzled
perception
of
her
superiority
.




perhaps
,
however
,
her
enjoyment
proceed
more
than
she
be
aware
from


the
physical
stimulus
of
the
excursion
,
the
challenge
of
crisp
cold
and


hard
exercise
,
the
responsive
thrill
of
her
body
to
the
influence
of
the


winter
wood
.
she
return
to
town
in
a
glow
of
rejuvenation
,
conscious


of
a
clear
colour
in
her
cheek
,
a
fresh
elasticity
in
her
muscle
.
the


future
seem
full
of
a
vague
promise
,
and
all
her
apprehension
be


sweep
out
of
sight
on
the
buoyant
current
of
her
mood
.




a
few
day
after
her
return
to
town
she
have
the
unpleasant
surprise
of
a


visit
from
Mr.
Rosedale
.
he
come
late
,
at
the
confidential
hour
when
the


tea
-
table
still
linger
by
the
fire
in
friendly
expectancy
;
and
his


manner
show
a
readiness
to
adapt
itself
to
the
intimacy
of
the
occasion
.




Lily
,
who
have
a
vague
sense
of
his
be
somehow
connect
with
her
lucky


speculation
,
try
to
give
he
the
welcome
he
expect
;
but
there
be


something
in
the
quality
of
his
geniality
which
chill
her
own
,
and
she


be
conscious
of
mark
each
step
in
their
acquaintance
by
a
fresh


blunder
.




Mr.
Rosedale
--
make
himself
promptly
at
home
in
an
adjoining
easy
-
chair
,


and
sip
his
tea
critically
,
with
the
comment
:
"
you
ought
to
go
to
my


man
for
something
really
good"--appeare
totally
unconscious
of
the


repugnance
which
keep
she
in
frozen
erectness
behind
the
urn
.
it
be


perhaps
her
very
manner
of
hold
herself
aloof
that
appeal
to
his


collector
's
passion
for
the
rare
and
unattainable
.
he
give
,
at
any
rate
,


no
sign
of
resent
it
and
seem
prepared
to
supply
in
his
own
manner


all
the
ease
that
be
lack
in
hers
.




his
object
in
call
be
to
ask
she
to
go
to
the
opera
in
his
box
on
the


opening
night
,
and
see
she
hesitate
he
say
persuasively
:
"

as
Lily

silence

he
with
this
allusion
on
his
hand
,
he
add
with


a
confidential
smile
:

an
inward
motion

annoyance

be
distasteful
enough


to
hear
her
name

with
Trenor

on
Rosedale
's
lip

allusion

peculiarly
unpleasant

"

good
friend

in

a
well

put
down

an
abrupt

back
at
he

relax
the
tension
of
her
attitude

admit
he
,
by
imperceptible
gradation
of
glance

step
far
toward

she


acceptance
of

a
general
sense
of
having
comport


himself
in
a
way
calculate
to
advance
his
cause
.
he
have
always
believe


he
have
a
light
touch
and
a
know
way
with
woman
,
and
the
prompt
manner


in
which
Miss
Bart
(
as
he
would
have
phrase
it
)
have
"

she


way
of
gloss
over
the
transaction
with
Trenor
he
regard
at
once
as
a


tribute
to
his
own
acuteness
,
and
a
confirmation
of
his
suspicion
.
the


girl
be
evidently
nervous
,
and
Mr.
Rosedale
,
if
he
see
no
other
mean
of


advance
his
acquaintance
with

not

take
advantage
of


her
nervousness
.




he
leave
Lily
to
a
passion
of
disgust
and
fear
.
it
seem
incredible
that


Gus
Trenor
should
have
speak
of
she
to
Rosedale
.
 
with
all
his
fault
,


trenor
have
the
safeguard
of
his
tradition
,
and
be
the
less
likely
to


overstep
they
because
they
be
so
purely
instinctive
.
but
Lily
recall


with
a
pang
that
there
be
convivial
moment
when
,
as
Judy
have
confide


to
she
,
Gus
"
talk
foolishly
"
:
in
one
of
these
,
no
doubt
,
the
fatal
word


have
slip
from
he
.
as
for
Rosedale
,
she
do
not
,
after
the
first


shock
,
greatly
care
what
conclusion
he
have
draw
.
 
though
usually
adroit


enough
where
her
own
interest
be
concern
,
she
make
the
mistake
,
not


uncommon
to
person
in
whom
the
social
habit
be
instinctive
,
of


suppose
that
the
inability
to
acquire
they
quickly
imply
a
general


dulness
.
because
a
blue

bottle
bang
irrationally
against
a
window
-
pane
,


the
drawing
-
room
naturalist
may
forget
that
under
less
artificial


condition
it
be
capable
of
measure
distance
and
draw
conclusion


with
all
the
accuracy
needful
to
its
welfare
;
and
the
fact
that
Mr.


Rosedale
's
drawing
-
room
manner
lack
perspective
make
Lily
class
he


with
Trenor
and
the
other
dull
man
she
know
,
and
assume
that
a
little


flattery
,
and
the
occasional
acceptance
of
his
hospitality
,
would
suffice


to
render
he
innocuous
.
however
,
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
the


expediency
of
show
herself
in
his
box
on
the
opening
night
of
the


opera
;
and
after
all
,
since
Judy
Trenor
have
promise
to
take
he
up
that


winter
,
it
be
as
well
to
reap
the
advantage
of
be
first
in
the
field
.




for
a
day
or
two
after
Rosedale
's
visit
,
Lily
's
thought
be
dog
by


the
consciousness
of
Trenor
's
shadowy
claim
,
and
she
wish
she
have
a


clear
notion
of
the
exact
nature
of
the
transaction
which
seem
to


have
put
she
in
his
power
;
but
her
mind
shrink
from
any
unusual


application
,
and
she
be
always
helplessly
puzzle
by
figure
.
moreover


she
have
not
see
Trenor
since
the
day
of
the
Van
Osburgh
wedding
,
and
in


his
continued
absence
the
trace
of
Rosedale
's
word
be
soon
efface
by


other
impression
.




when
the
opening
night
of
the
opera
come
,
her
apprehension
have
so


completely
vanish
that
the
sight
of
Trenor
's
ruddy
countenance
in
the


back
of
Mr.
Rosedale
's
box
fill
she
with
a
sense
of
pleasant


reassurance
.
Lily
have
not
quite
reconcile
herself
to
the
necessity
of


appear
as
Rosedale
's
guest
on
so
conspicuous
an
occasion
,
and
it
be
a


relief
to
find
herself
support
by
any
one
of
her
own
set
--
for
Mrs.


Fisher
's
social
habit
be
too
promiscuous
for
her
presence
to
justify


Miss
Bart
's
.




to
Lily
,
always
inspirit
by
the
prospect
of
show
her
beauty
in


public
,
and
conscious
tonight
of
all
the
add
enhancement
of
dress
,
the


insistency
of
Trenor
's
gaze
merge
itself
in
the
general
stream
of


admire
look
of
which
she
feel
herself
the
centre
.
ah
,
it
be
good
to


be
young
,
to
be
radiant
,
to
glow
with
the
sense
of
slenderness
,
strength


and
elasticity
,
of
well
-
poise
line
and
happy
tint
,
to
feel
one
's
self


lift
to
a
height
apart
by
that
incommunicable
grace
which
be
the
bodily


counterpart
of
genius
!




all
mean
seem
justifiable
to
attain
such
an
end
,
or
rather
,
by
a
happy


shift
of
light
with
which
practice
have
familiarize
Miss
Bart
,
the


cause
shrink
to
a
pin

point
in
the
general
brightness
of
the
effect
.
but


brilliant
young
lady
,
a
little
blind
by
their
own
effulgence
,
be
apt


to
forget
that
the
modest
satellite
drown
in
their

enjoyment
of

by
the

thought


that
her
gown
and
opera
cloak

be
indirectly

for
by
Gus
Trenor
,


the
latter
have
not
sufficient
poetry
in
his
composition
to
lose
sight
of


these
prosaic
fact

he
know
only
that
he
have
never

Lily

smart
in
her
life

there

a
woman
in
the
house
who
show


off
good

no

company
with
several
hundred
other
pair
of
eye

come
to
Lily

a
disagreeable
surprise

Trenor

,


without
preamble
,
and
in
a
tone
of
sulky
authority
:
"
look
here
,
Lily

how


be
a

that
the
remark
be
in
distinctly
bad
taste

not
make
it
any


easy
to

vividly
aware

that
draw
up
of

slim
figure

unpleasantly

something
in

recall


the

Lily

send
out

I
through
a
course

this


every
winter

so
bad
on
italian
night

come
late

there
be
time
to

when
they
give
Wagner
we
have
to
rush


dinner
,

I
pay
up
for
it
.

the
draught
be
damnable

asphyxia
in


front
and
pleurisy
in
the
back

you
ever
watch

you
do

you
'd
wonder
why

alive

I
suppose
he
be
leather
inside
too.--But
I
come
to

my

want
you
to
come
down
to
our
place
next
Sunday

for

some
of
'em

long

they
start
an
argument
with
the


soup

do
n't
notice

I

the
gist

this
strange
communication
give
Lily
a
distinct
thrill

pleasure

ordinary
circumstance
,
there
would
have
be
nothing


surprising
in
an
invitation
from

since
the
Bellomont


episode
an
unavowed
hostility

keep
the
two
woman
apart

now
,
with
a


start
of
inner
wonder

Lily
feel
that
her
thirst
for
retaliation

die


out

if
you
would

your

the

if
she
have
destroy
Mrs.

letter
,
she
might
have


continue
to
hate
she
;
but
the
fact
that
they
remain
in
her
possession


have
feed
her
resentment
to
satiety

utter
a

in
the
renewal

put
a
more
unerring


finger
on
the
distinguish
feature
of
each

its
dulness

its


extravagance

its
lack

triumphantly

reach

apt


to
display

talk
of

buying
the
newly

of
one
of
the
victim
of

,
who
,
in

of
twelve
short
month
,
have
make
the

number
of
million
,
build
a
house
in
Fifth

,
fill
a


picture

with
old
master
,

be
smuggle
out
of

between
a

nurse
and
a
doctor
,


while
his
creditor
mount
guard
over
the
old
master
,
and
his
guest


explain
to
each
other
that
they
have
dine
with
he
only
because
they


want
to
see
the
picture
.
Mr.
Rosedale
mean
to
have
a
less
meteoric


career
.
he
know
he
should
have
to
go
slowly
,
and
the
instinct
of
his


race
fit
he
to
suffer
rebuff
and
put
up
with
delay
.
but
he
be


prompt
to
perceive
that
the
general
dulness
of
the
season
afford
he
an


unusual
opportunity
to
shine
,
and
he
set
about
with
patient
industry
to


form
a
background
for
his
grow
glory
.
 
Mrs.
Fisher
be
of
immense


service
to
he
at
this
period
.
she
have
set
off
so
many
newcomer
on
the


social
stage
that
she
be
like
one
of
those
piece
of
stock
scenery
which


tell
the
experienced
spectator
exactly
what
be
go
to
take
place
.
but


Mr.
Rosedale
want
,
in
the
long
run
,
a
more
individual
environment
.
he


be
sensitive
to
shade
of
difference
which
Miss
Bart
would
never
have


credit
he
with
perceive
,
because
he
have
no
correspond
variation


of
manner
;
and
it
be
become
more
and
more
clear
to
he
that
Miss
Bart


herself
possess
precisely
the
complementary
quality
need
to
round


off
his
social
personality
.




such
detail
do
not
fall
within
the
range
of
Mrs.
Peniston
's
vision
.


like
many
mind
of
panoramic
sweep
,
hers
be
apt
to
overlook
the
MINUTIAE


of
the
foreground
,
and
she
be
much
more
likely
to
know
where
Carry


Fisher
have
find
the
Welly
Brys
'
CHEF
for
they
,
than
what
be
happen


to
her
own
niece
.
she
be
not
,
however
,
without
purveyor
of
information


ready
to
supplement
her
deficiency
.
Grace
Stepney
's
mind
be
like
a


kind
of
moral
fly
-
paper
,
to
which
the
buzz
item
of
gossip
be
draw


by
a
fatal
attraction
,
and
where
they
hang
fast
in
the
toil
of
an


inexorable
memory
.
Lily
would
have
be
surprised
to
know
how
many


trivial
fact
concern
herself
be
lodge
in
Miss
Stepney
's
head
.
she


be
quite
aware
that
she
be
of
interest
to
dingy
people
,
but
she
assume


that
there
be
only
one
form
of
dinginess
,
and
that
admiration
for


brilliancy
be
the
natural
expression
of
its
inferior
state
.
she
know
that


Gerty
Farish
admire
she
blindly
,
and
therefore
suppose
that
she


inspire
the
same
sentiment
in
Grace
Stepney
,
whom
she
classify
as
a


Gerty
Farish
without
the
saving
trait
of
youth
and
enthusiasm
.




in
reality
,
the
two
differ
from
each
other
as
much
as
they
differ


from
the
object
of
their
mutual
contemplation
.
Miss
Farish
's
heart
be
a


fountain
of
tender
illusion
,
Miss
Stepney
's
a
precise
register
of
fact


as
manifest
in
their
relation
to
herself
.
she
have
sensibility
which
,


to
Lily
,
would
have
seem
comic
in
a
person
with
a
freckle
nose
and
red


eyelid
,
who
live
in
a
boarding
-
house
and
admire
Mrs.
Peniston
's


drawing
-
room
;
but
poor
Grace
's
limitation
give
they
a
more
concentrated


inner
life
,
as
poor
soil
starve
certain
plant
into
intenser


efflorescence
.
she
have
in
truth
no
abstract
propensity
to
malice
:
she
do


not
dislike
Lily
because
the
latter
be
brilliant
and
predominant
,
but


because
she
think
that
Lily
dislike
she
.
it
be
less
mortifying
to


believe
one
's
self
unpopular
than
insignificant
,
and
vanity
prefer
to


assume
that
indifference
be
a
latent
form
of
unfriendliness
.
even
such


scant
civility
as
Lily
accord
to
Mr.
Rosedale
would
have
make
Miss


stepney
her
friend
for
life
;
but
how
could
she
foresee
that
such
a
friend


be
worth
cultivate
?
how
,
moreover
,
can
a
young
woman
who
have
never


be
ignore
measure
the
pang
which
this
injury
inflict
?
and
,
lastly
,


how
could
lily
,
accustom
to
choose
between
a
pressure
of
engagement
,


guess
that
she
have
mortally
offend
Miss
Stepney
by
cause
she
to
be


exclude
from
one
of
Mrs.
Peniston
's
infrequent
dinner
-
party
?




Mrs.
Peniston
dislike
give
dinner
,
but
she
have
a
high
sense
of
family


obligation
,
and
on
the
Jack
Stepneys
'
return
from
their
honeymoon
she


feel
it
incumbent
upon
she
to
light
the
drawing
-
room
lamp
and
extract


her
good
silver
from
the
Safe
Deposit
vault

Mrs.

's
rare


entertainment

precede
by
day
of

-
rend
vacillation
as
to


every
detail
of
the

,
from
the
seating
of
the
guest
to
the
pattern


of
the
table
-
cloth
,
and
in
the
course
of
one
of
these
preliminary


discussion
she
have
imprudently
suggest
to
her
cousin
Grace
that
,
as


the
dinner
be
a
family
affair
,
she

for
a
week

up
Miss

colourless
existence
;
then
she


have
be
give
to
understand
that
it
would
be
more
convenient
to
have
she


another
day
.
Miss
Stepney

exactly
what
have
happen
.
lily
,
to
whom


family
reunion

occasion
of
unalloyed
dulness
,
have
persuade
she


aunt
that
a
dinner
of
"
smart
"
people
would
be
much
more
to
the
taste
of


the
young
couple
,
and
Mrs.
Peniston
,
who
lean
helplessly
on
her
niece


in
social
matter
,
have
be
prevail
upon
to
pronounce
Grace
's
exile
.


after
all
,
Grace
could
come
any
other
day
;
why
should
she
mind
be
put


off
?




it
be
precisely
because
Miss
Stepney
could
come
any
other
day
--
and


because
she
know
her
relation

in
the
secret
of

unoccupied


evening

that
this

horizon

for
it
;

to

Mrs.

,
on
whom
she
have
look
in
a
day
or
two
after
the
dinner
,


lay
down
her
crochet

and
turn
abruptly
from

Mrs.

a
frightened

unequalled

she
have
the
innocence


of

at

be
gradually


lose
control
of
the
situation
.
trenor
be
in
truth
in
an
unmanageable


mood
.
in
spite
of
his
understanding
with
Rosedale
he
have
be
somewhat


heavily
"
touch
"
by
the
fall
in
stock
;
his
household
expense
weigh


on
he
,
and
he
seem
to
be
meet
,
on
all
side
,
a
sullen
opposition
to


his
wish
,
instead
of
the
easy
good
luck
he
have
hitherto
encounter
.




Mrs.
Trenor
be
still
at
Bellomont
,
keep
the
town
-
house
open
,
and


descend
on
it
now
and
then
for
a
taste
of
the
world
,
but
prefer


the
recurrent
excitement
of
week
-
end
party
to
the
restriction
of
a


dull
season
.
since
the
holiday
she
have
not
urge
Lily
to
return
to


Bellomont
,
and
the
first
time
they
meet
in
town
Lily
fancy
there
be
a


shade
of
coldness
in
her
manner
.
 
be
it
merely
the
expression
of
she


displeasure
at
Miss
Bart
's
neglect
,
or
have
disquieting
rumour
reach


she
?
the
latter
contingency
seem
improbable
,
yet
Lily
be
not
without
a


sense
of
uneasiness
.
if
her
roam
sympathy
have
strike
root
anywhere
,


it
be
in
her
friendship
with
Judy
Trenor
.
she
believe
in
the
sincerity


of
her
friend
's
affection
,
though
it
sometimes
show
itself
in


self
-
interested
way
,
and
she
shrink
with
peculiar
reluctance
from
any


risk
of
estrange
it
.
but
,
aside
from
this
,
she
be
keenly
conscious
of


the
way
in
which
such
an
estrangement
would
react
on
herself
.
the
fact


that
Gus
Trenor
be
Judy
's
husband
be
at
time
Lily
's
strong
reason


for
dislike
he
,
and
for
resent
the
obligation
under
which
he
have


place
she
.
to
set
her
doubt
at
rest
,
Miss
Bart
,
soon
after
the
New


year
,
"
propose
"
herself
for
a
week
-
end
at
Bellomont
.
she
have
learn
in


advance
that
the
presence
of
a
large
party
would
protect
she
from
too


great
assiduity
on
Trenor
's
part
,
and
his
wife
's
telegraphic
"
come
by
all


means
"
seem
to
assure
she
of
her
usual
welcome
.




Judy
receive
she
amicably
.
the
care
of
a
large
party
always
prevail


over
personal
feeling
,
and
Lily
see
no
change
in
her
hostess
's
manner
.


nevertheless
,
she
be
soon
aware
that
the
experiment
of
come
to


Bellomont
be
destine
not
to
be
successful
.
the
party
be
make
up
of


what
Mrs.
Trenor
call
"
poky
people"--her
generic
name
for
person
who


do
not
play
bridge
--
and
,
it
be
her
habit
to
group
all
such


obstructionist
in
one
class
,
she
usually
invite
they
together
,


regardless
of
their
other
characteristic
.
the
result
be
apt
to
be
an


irreducible
combination
of
person
have
no
other
quality
in
common
than


their
abstinence
from
bridge
,
and
the
antagonism
develop
in
a
group


lack
the
one
taste
which
might
have
amalgamate
they
,
be
in
this


case
aggravate
by
bad
weather
,
and
by
the
ill
-
conceal
boredom
of
their


host
and
hostess
.
in
such
emergency
,
Judy
would
usually
have
turn
to


lily
to
fuse
the
discordant
element
;
and
Miss
Bart
,
assume
that
such
a


service
be
expect
of
she
,
throw
herself
into
it
with
her
accustomed


zeal
.
but
at
the
outset
she
perceive
a
subtle
resistance
to
her
effort
.


if
Mrs.
Trenor
's
manner
toward
she
be
unchanged
,
there
be
certainly
a


faint
coldness
in
that
of
the
other
lady
.
an
occasional
caustic


allusion
to
"
your
friend
the
Wellington
Brys
,
"
or
to
"
the
little
Jew
who


have
buy
the
Greiner
house
--
some
one
tell
we
you
know
he
,
Miss


bart,"--showe
Lily
that
she
be
in
disfavour
with
that
portion
of


society
which
,
while
contribute
least
to
its
amusement
,
have
assume
the


right
to
decide
what
form
that
amusement
shall
take
.
the
indication
be


a
slight
one
,
and
a
year
ago
Lily
would
have
smile
at
it
,
trust
to


the
charm
of
her
personality
to
dispel
any
prejudice
against
she
.
but
now


she
have
grow
more
sensitive
to
criticism
and
less
confident
in
her
power


of
disarm
it
.
she
know
,
moreover
,
that
if
the
lady
at
Bellomont


permit
themselves
to
criticize
her
friend
openly
,
it
be
a
proof
that


they
be
not
afraid
of
subject
she
to
the
same
treatment
behind
she


back
.
the
nervous
dread
lest
anything
in
Trenor
's
manner
should
seem
to


justify
their
disapproval
make
she
seek
every
pretext
for
avoid
he
,


and
she
leave
Bellomont
conscious
of
having
fail
in
every
purpose
which


have
take
she
there
.




in
town
she
return
to
preoccupation
which
,
for
the
moment
,
have
the


happy
effect
of
banish
troublesome
thought
.
the
Welly
Brys
,
after


much
debate
,
and
anxious
counsel
with
their
newly
acquire
friend
,
have


decide
on
the
bold
move
of
give
a
general
entertainment
.
to
attack


society
collectively
,
when
one
's
mean
of
approach
be
limit
to
a
few


acquaintance
,
be
like
advance
into
a
strange
country
with
an


insufficient
number
of
scout
;
but
such
rash
tactic
have
sometimes
lead


to
brilliant
victory
,
and
the
Brys
have
determine
to
put
their
fate
to


the
touch
.
Mrs.
Fisher
,
to
whom
they
have
entrust
the
conduct
of
the


affair
,
have
decide
that
TABLEAUX
vivant
and
expensive
music
be
the


two
bait
most
likely
to
attract
the
desire
prey
,
and
after
prolong


negotiation
,
and
the
kind
of
wire
-
pull
in
which
she
be
know
to


excel
,
she
have
induce
a
dozen
fashionable
woman
to
exhibit
themselves
in


a
series
of
picture
which
,
by
a
farther
miracle
of
persuasion
,
the


distinguished
portrait
painter
,
Paul
Morpeth
,
have
be
prevail
upon
to


organize
.




Lily
be
in
her
element
on
such
occasion
.
under
Morpeth
's
guidance
she


vivid
plastic
sense
,
hitherto
nurture
on
no
high
food
than


dress
-
making
and
upholstery
,
find
eager
expression
in
the
disposal
of


drapery
,
the
study
of
attitude
,
the
shifting
of
light
and
shadow
.


her
dramatic
instinct
be
rouse
by
the
choice
of
subject
,
and
the


gorgeous
reproduction
of
historic
dress
stir
an
imagination
which


only
visual
impression
could
reach
.
but
keen
of
all
be
the


exhilaration
of
display
her
own
beauty
under
a
new
aspect
:
of
show


that
her
loveliness
be
no
mere
fix
quality
,
but
an
element
shape
all


emotion
to
fresh
form
of
grace
.




Mrs.
Fisher
's
measure
have
be
well
-
take
,
and
society
,
surprise
in
a


dull
moment
,
succumb
to
the
temptation
of
Mrs.
Bry
's
hospitality
.
the


protest
minority
be
forget
in
the
throng
which
abjure
and
come
;


and
the
audience
be
almost
as
brilliant
as
the
show
.




Lawrence
Selden
be
among
those
who
have
yield
to
the
proffer


inducement
.
if
he
do
not
often
act
on
the
accept
social
axiom
that
a


man
may
go
where
he
please
,
it
be
because
he
have
long
since
learn


that
his
pleasure
be
mainly
to
be
find
in
a
small
group
of
the


like
-
minded
.
but
he
enjoy
spectacular
effect
,
and
be
not
insensible


to
the
part
money
play
in
their
production
:
all
he
ask
be
that
the


very
rich
should
live
up
to
their
calling
as
stage
-
manager
,
and
not


spend
their
money
in
a
dull
way
.
this
the
Brys
could
certainly
not
be


charge
with
do
.
their
recently
build
house
,
whatever
it
might
lack
as


a
frame
for
domesticity
,
be
almost
as
well
-
design
for
the
display
of
a


festal
assemblage
as
one
of
those
airy
pleasure
-
hall
which
the
italian


architect
improvise
to
set
off
the
hospitality
of
prince
.
 
the
air
of


improvisation
be
in
fact
strikingly
present
:
so
recent
,
so


rapidly

the


marble
column

one
's
self
in


one
of
the
damask

gold
arm
-
chair

be
sure
it
be
not

Selden
,
who
have
put
one
of
these

to
the
test
,
find
himself
,
from


an
angle
of
the
ball

room
,
survey
the
scene
with
frank
enjoyment
.
 
the


company
,
in
obedience
to
the
decorative
instinct
which
call
for
fine


clothe
in
fine
surrounding
,
have
dress
rather
with
an
eye
to
Mrs.


Bry
's
background
than
to
herself
.
the
seated
throng
,
fill
the
immense


room
without
undue
crowding
,
present
a
surface
of
rich
tissue
and


jewel
shoulder
in
harmony
with
the
festoon
and
gilded
wall
,
and


the
flushed
splendour
of
the
venetian
ceiling
.
at
the
farther
end
of
the


room
a
stage
have
be
construct
behind
a
proscenium
arch
curtain
with


fold
of
old
damask
;
but
in
the
pause
before
the
parting
of
the
fold


there
be
little
thought
of
what
they
might
reveal
,
for
every
woman
who


have
accept
Mrs.
Bry
's
invitation

engage
in

to
find
out
how


many
of
her

the

Gerty

next
to
Selden
,
be
lose
in
that
indiscriminate
and


uncritical
enjoyment
so
irritate
to
Miss
Bart
's
fine
perception
.
it


may
be
that
Selden
's
nearness
have
something
to
do
with
the
quality
of
his


cousin
's
pleasure
;
but
Miss
Farish
be
so
little
accustomed
to
refer
she


enjoyment
of
such
scene
to
her
own
share
in
they
,
that
she
be
merely


conscious
of
a
deep
sense
of
contentment
.




"
be
n't
it
dear
of
Lily
to
get
I
an
invitation
?
of
course
it
would
never


have
occur
to
carry
Fisher
to
put
I
on
the
list
,
and
I
should
have


be
so
sorry
to
miss
see
it
all
--
and
especially
Lily
herself
.
 
some


one
tell
I
the
ceiling
be
by
Veronese
--
you
would
know
,
of
course
,


lawrence
.
I
suppose
it
be
very
beautiful
,
but
his
woman
be
so
dreadfully


fat
.
goddess
?
 
well
,
I
can
only
say
that
if
they
have
be
mortal
and
have


to
wear
corset
,
it
would
have
be
well
for
they
.
I
think
our
woman


be
much
handsomer
.
and
this
room
be
wonderfully
become
--
every
one


look
so
well
!
do
you
ever
see
such
jewel
?
do
look
at
Mrs.
George


dorset
's
pearl
--
I
suppose
the
small
of
they
would
pay
the
rent
of
our


girl
'
club
for
a
year
.
not
that
I
ought
to
complain
about
the
club
;


every
one
have
be
so
wonderfully
kind
.
 
do
I
tell
you
that
Lily
have


give
we
three
hundred
dollar
?
 
be
n't
it
splendid
of
she
?
and
then
she


collect
a
lot
of
money
from
her
friend
--
Mrs.
Bry
give
we
five
hundred
,


and
Mr.
Rosedale
a
thousand
.
I
wish
Lily
be
not
so
nice
to
Mr.


Rosedale
,

now

only
a
motion

indignant
contempt

have
time
to

the
whole


tragedy

her
beauty
,
thus
detach
from
all


that
cheapen

vulgarize
it

have
hold

the
performance
over
,
Selden
's
first
impulse
be
to
seek
Miss
Bart
.


during
the
interlude
of
music
which
succeed
the
tableaux
,
the
actor


have
seat
themselves
here
and
there
in
the
audience
,
diversify
its


conventional
appearance
by
the
varied
picturesqueness
of
their
dress
.


lily
,
however
,
be
not
among
they
,
and
her
absence
serve
to
protract
the


effect
she
have
produce
on
Selden
:
it
would
have
break
the
spell
to
see


she
too
soon
in
the
surrounding
from
which
accident
have
so
happily


detach
she
.
they
have
not
meet
since
the
day
of
the
Van
Osburgh
wedding
,


and
on
his
side
the
avoidance
have
be
intentional
.
 
tonight
,
however
,
he


know
that
,
soon
or
later
,
he
should
find
himself
at
her
side
;
and


though
he
let
the
disperse
crowd
drift
he
whither
it
would
,
without


make
an
immediate
effort
to
reach
she
,
his
procrastination
be
not
due


to
any
linger
resistance
,
but
to
the
desire
to
luxuriate
a
moment
in


the
sense
of
complete
surrender
.




Lily
have
not
an
instant
's
doubt
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
murmur
greeting


her
appearance
.
no
other
tableau
have
be
receive
with
that
precise
note


of
approval
:
it
have
obviously
be
call
forth
by
herself
,
and
not
by


the
picture
she
impersonate
.
she
have
fear
at
the
last
moment
that
she


be
risk
too
much
in
dispense
with
the
advantage
of
a
more


sumptuous
setting
,
and
the
completeness
of
her
triumph
give
she
an


intoxicate
sense
of
recover
power
.
not
care
to
diminish
the


impression
she
have
produce
,
she
hold
herself
aloof
from
the
audience


till
the
movement
of
dispersal
before
supper
,
and
thus
have
a
second


opportunity
of
show
herself
to
advantage
,
as
the
throng
pour
slowly


into
the
empty
drawing

room
where
she
be

.




she
be
soon
the
centre
of
a
group
which
increase
and
renew
itself
as


the
circulation
become
general
,
and
the
individual
comment
on
she


success
be
a
delightful
prolongation
of
the
collective
applause
.
at


such
moment
she
lose
something
of
her
natural
fastidiousness
,
and
care


less
for
the
quality
of
the
admiration
receive
than
for
its
quantity

of
personality

in
a
warm
atmosphere
of
praise
,

which
her

expand

and
if
Selden
have


approach
a
moment
or
two

he
would
have
see
she
turn

one
or

of

wander
off
in

of

the

,


notice
Selden

way
to
he
in

with
the
tacit


freemasonry
of

the

.
the
look
do
indeed
deepen

the

beat
of

his
nearness
always
produce

she


read
,

,
in
his
answer

the
delicious
confirmation
of
she


triumph

for
the

it
in
silence
,


and
they
move
away
,
not
toward
the
supper
-
room
,
but
against
the
tide


which
be
set
thither
.
the
face
about
she
flow
by
like
the


streaming
image
of
sleep
:
she
hardly
notice
where
Selden
be
lead


she
,
till
they
pass
through
a
glass
doorway
at
the
end
of
the
long


suite
of
room
and
stand
suddenly
in
the
fragrant
hush
of
a
garden
.


Gravel
grate
beneath
their
foot
,
and
about
they
be
the
transparent


dimness
of
a
midsummer
night
.
hang
light
make
emerald
cavern
in
the


depth
of
foliage
,
and
whiten
the
spray
of
a
fountain
fall
among


lily
.
the
magic
place
be
desert
:
there
be
no
sound
but
the
splash


of
the
water
on
the
lily
-
pad
,
and
a
distant
drift
of
music
that
might


have
be
blow
across
a
sleep
lake
.




Selden
and
Lily
stand
still
,
accept
the
unreality
of
the
scene
as
a


part
of
their
own
dream
-
like
sensation
.
it
would
not
have
surprise
they


to
feel
a
summer
breeze
on
their
face
,
or
to
see
the
light
among
the


bough
reduplicate
in
the
arch
of
a
starry
sky
.
the
strange
solitude


about
they
be
no
strange
than
the
sweetness
of
be
alone
in
it


together
.
at
length
Lily
withdraw
her
hand
,
and
move
away
a
step
,
so


that
her
white
-
robed
slimness
be
outline
against
the
dusk
of
the


branch
.
Selden
follow
she
,
and
still
without
speak
they
seat


themselves
on
a
bench
beside
the
fountain
.




suddenly
she
raise
her
eye
with
the
beseech
earnestness
of
a
child
.


"
you
never
speak
to
I
--
you
think
hard
thing
of
I
,
"
she
murmur
.




"
I
think
of
you
at
any
rate
,
God
know
!
"
he
say
.




"
then
why
do
we
never
see
each
other
?
why
ca
n't
we
be
friend
?
 
you


promise
once
to
help
I
,

she
continue
in
the
same
tone
,
as
though
the


word
be
draw
from
she
unwillingly
.




"
the
only
way
I
can
help
you
be
by
love
you
,
"
Selden
say
in
a
low


voice
.




she
make
no
reply
,
but
her
face
turn
to
he
with
the
soft
motion
of
a


flower
.
his
own
meet
it
slowly
,
and
their
lip
touch
.
she
draw
back
and


rise
from
her
seat
.
Selden
rise
too
,
and
they
stand
face
each
other
.


suddenly
she
catch
his
hand
and
press
it
a
moment
against
her
cheek
.




"
ah
,
love
I
,
love
I
--
but
do
n't
tell
I
so
!
"
she
sigh
with
her
eye
in


his
;
and
before
he
could
speak
she
have
turn
and
slip
through
the


arch
of
bough
,
disappear
in
the
brightness
of
the
room
beyond
.




Selden
stand
where
she
have
leave
he
.
he
know
too
well
the
transiency
of


exquisite
moment
to
attempt
to
follow
she
;
but
presently
he
reentere


the
house
and
make
his
way
through
the
deserted

in
the

of
a

one
of

invitingly

out

Lily
wake
from
happy
dream
to
find
two
note
at
her
bedside
.




one
be
from
Mrs.
Trenor
,
who
announce
that
she
be
come
to
town
that


afternoon
for
a
flying
visit
,
and
hope
Miss
Bart
would
be
able
to
dine


with
she
.
the
other
be
from
Selden
.
he
write
briefly
that
an
important


case
call
he
to
Albany
,
whence
he
would
be
unable
to
return
till
the


evening
,
and
ask
Lily
to
let
he
know
at
what
hour
on
the
following
day


she
would
see
he
.




lily
,
lean
back
among
her
pillow
,
gaze
musingly
at
his
letter
.
the


scene
in
the
Brys
'
conservatory
have
be
like
a
part
of
her
dream
;
she


have
not
expect
to
wake
to
such
evidence
of
its
reality
.
her
first


movement
be
one
of
annoyance
:
this
unforeseen
act
of
Selden
's
add


another
complication
to
life
.
it
be
so
unlike
he
to
yield
to
such
an


irrational
impulse
!
do
he
really
mean
to
ask
she
to
marry
he
?
she
have


once
show
he
the
impossibility
of
such
a
hope
,
and
his
subsequent


behaviour
seem
to
prove
that
he
have
accept
the
situation
with
a


reasonableness
somewhat
mortifying
to
her
vanity
.
it
be
all
the
more


agreeable
to
find
that
this
reasonableness
be
maintain
only
at
the


cost
of
not
see
she
;
but
,
though
nothing
in
life
be
as
sweet
as
the


sense
of
her
power
over
he
,
she
see
the
danger
of
allow
the
episode


of
the
previous
night
to
have
a
sequel
.
since
she
could
not
marry
he
,
it


would
be
kind
to
he
,
as
well
as
easy
for
herself
,
to
write
a
line


amicably
evade
his
request
to
see
she
:
he
be
not
the
man
to
mistake


such
a
hint
,
and
when
next
they
meet
it
would
be
on
their
usual
friendly


foot
.




lily
spring
out
of
bed
,
and
go
straight
to
her
desk
.
she
want
to


write
at
once
,
while
she
could
trust
to
the
strength
of
her
resolve
.
 
she


be
still
languid
from
her
brief
sleep
and
the
exhilaration
of
the


evening
,
and
the
sight
of
Selden
's
writing
bring
back
the
culminating


moment
of
her
triumph
:
the
moment
when
she
have
read
in
his
eye
that
no


philosophy
be
proof
against
her
power
.
it
would
be
pleasant
to
have
that


sensation
again
.
.
.
no
one
else
could
give
it
to
she
in
its
fulness
;


and
she
could
not
bear
to
mar
her
mood
of
luxurious
retrospection
by
an


act
of
definite
refusal
.
she
take
up
her
pen
and
write
hastily
:
"
tomorrow


at
four
;

murmur
to
herself
,
as
she
slip
the
sheet
into
its


envelope
:

Judy
Trenor
's
summon
be
very
welcome
to
Lily
.
it
be
the
first
time
she


have
receive
a
direct
communication
from
Bellomont
since
the
close
of
she


last
visit
there
,
and
she
be
still
visit
by
the
dread
of
have


incur
Judy
's
displeasure
.
but
this
characteristic
command
seem
to


reestablish
their
former
relation
;
and
Lily
smile
at
the
thought
that


her
friend
have
probably
summon
she
in
order
to
hear
about
the
Brys
'


entertainment
.
Mrs.
Trenor
have
absent
herself
from
the
feast
,
perhaps


for
the
reason
so
frankly
enunciate
by
her
husband
,
perhaps
because
,
as


Mrs.
Fisher
somewhat
differently
put
it
,
she
"
could
n't
bear
new
people


when
she
have
n't
discover
they
herself
.
"
at
any
rate
,
though
she


remain
haughtily
at
Bellomont
,
Lily
suspect
in
she
a
devouring


eagerness
to
hear
of
what
she
have
miss
,
and
to
learn
exactly
in
what


measure
Mrs.
Wellington
Bry
have
surpass
all
previous
competitor
for


social
recognition
.
Lily
be
quite
ready
to
gratify
this
curiosity
,
but


it
happen
that
she
be
dine
out
.
she
determine
,
however
,
to
see
Mrs.


trenor
for
a
few
moment
,
and
ring
for
her
maid
she
despatch
a


telegram
to
say
that
she
would
be
with
her
friend
that
evening
at
ten
.




she
be
dine
with
Mrs.
Fisher
,
who
have
gather
at
an
informal
feast
a


few
of
the
performer
of
the
previous
evening
.
there
be
to
be
plantation


music
in
the
studio
after
dinner
--
for
Mrs.
Fisher
,
despair
of
the


republic
,
have
take
up
modelling
,
and
annex
to
her
small
crowded
house


a
spacious
apartment
,
which
,
whatever
its
use
in
her
hour
of
plastic


inspiration
,
serve
at
other
time
for
the
exercise
of
an
indefatigable


hospitality
.
Lily
be
reluctant
to
leave
,
for
the
dinner
be
amusing
,
and


she
would
have
like
to
lounge
over
a
cigarette
and
hear
a
few
song
;
but


she
could
not
break
her
engagement
with
Judy
,
and
shortly
after
ten
she


ask
her
hostess
to
ring
for
a
hansom
,
and
drive
up
Fifth
Avenue
to
the


trenor
'
.




she
wait
long
enough
on
the
doorstep
to
wonder
that
Judy
's
presence
in


town
be
not
signalize
by
a
great
promptness
in
admit
she
;
and
she


surprise
be
increase
when
,
instead
of
the
expect
footman
,
push
his


shoulder
into
a
tardy
coat
,
a
shabby
care
-
take
person
in
calico
let


she
into
the
shrouded
hall
.
trenor
,
however
,
appear
at
once
on
the


threshold
of
the
drawing
-
room
,
welcome
she
with
unusual
volubility


while
he
relieve
she
of
her
cloak
and
draw
she
into
the
room
.




"
come
along
to
the
den
;
it
be
the
only
comfortable
place
in
the
house

n't
this
room
look
as
if
it

for
the
body
to
be

down

ca
n't
see
why
Judy
keep
the
house
wrap
up
in
this
awful


slippery
white
stuff
--
it
be
enough
to
give
a
fellow
pneumonia
to
walk


through
these
room
on
a
cold
day
.
you
look
a
little
pinch
yourself
,
by


the
way
:
it
be
rather
a
sharp
night
out
.
I
notice
it
walk
up
from
the


club
.
come
along
,

that
can
be
tell
be
but
half
a
pain
,
so
the
pity
that


question
have
little
healing
in
its
touch
.
what
Lily
crave
be
the


darkness
make
by
enfold
arm
,
the
silence
which
be
not
solitude
,
but


compassion
hold
its
breath
.




she
start
up
and
look
forth
on
the
pass
street
.
 
gerty!--they


be
near
Gerty
's
corner
.
if
only
she
could
reach
there
before
this


labour
anguish
burst
from
her
breast
to
her
lip
--
if
only
she
could


feel
the
hold
of
Gerty
's
arm
while
she
shake
in
the
ague
-
fit
of
fear


that
be
come
upon
she
!
she
push
up
the
door
in
the
roof
and
call


the
address
to
the
driver
.
it
be
not
so
late
--
Gerty
might
still
be


wake
.
and
even
if
she
be
not
,
the
sound
of
the
bell
would
penetrate


every
recess
of
her
tiny
apartment
,
and
rouse
she
to
answer
her
friend
's


call
.








chapter
14




Gerty
Farish
,
the
morning
after
the
Wellington
Brys
'
entertainment
,
wake


from
dream
as
happy
as
Lily
's
.
if
they
be
less
vivid
in
hue
,
more


subdue
to
the
half
-
tint
of
her
personality
and
her
experience
,
they


be
for
that
very
reason
well
suited
to
her
mental
vision
.
such


flash
of
joy
as
Lily
move
in
would
have
blind
Miss
Farish
,
who
be


accustom
,
in
the
way
of
happiness
,
to
such
scant
light
as
shine
through


the
crack
of
other
people
's
life
.




now
she
be
the
centre
of
a
little
illumination
of
her
own
:
a
mild
but


unmistakable
beam
,
compound
of
Lawrence
Selden
's
grow
kindness
to


herself
and
the
discovery
that
he
extend
his
liking
to
Lily
Bart
.
if


these
two
factor
seem
incompatible
to
the
student
of
feminine


psychology
,
it
must
be
remember
that
Gerty
have
always
be
a
parasite


in
the
moral
order
,
live
on
the
crumb
of
other
table
,
and
content
to


look
through
the
window
at
the
banquet
spread
for
her
friend
.
now
that


she
be
enjoy
a
little
private
feast
of
her
own
,
it
would
have
seem


incredibly
selfish
not
to
lay
a
plate
for
a
friend
;
and
there
be
no
one


with
whom
she
would
rather
have
share
her
enjoyment
than
Miss
Bart
.




as
to
the
nature
of
Selden
's
grow
kindness
,
Gerty
would
no
more
have


dare
to
define
it
than
she
would
have
try
to
learn
a
butterfly
's


colour
by
knock
the
dust
from
its
wing
.
to
seize
on
the
wonder
would


be
to
brush
off
its
bloom
,
and
perhaps
see
it
fade
and
stiffen
in
she


hand
:
well
the
sense
of
beauty
palpitating
out
of
reach
,
while
she
hold


her
breath
and
watch
where
it
would
alight
.
yet
Selden
's
manner
at
the


Brys
'
have
bring
the
flutter
of
wing
so
close
that
they
seem
to
be


beat
in
her
own
heart
.
she
have
never
see
he
so
alert
,
so
responsive
,


so
attentive
to
what
she
have
to
say
.
his
habitual
manner
have
an


absent
-
minded
kindliness
which
she
accept
,
and
be
grateful
for
,
as
the


lively
sentiment
her
presence
be
likely
to
inspire
;
but
she
be
quick


to
feel
in
he
a
change
imply
that
for
once
she
could
give
pleasure
as


well
as
receive
it
.




and
it
be
so
delightful
that
this
high
degree
of
sympathy
should
be


reach
through
their
interest
in
Lily
Bart
!




Gerty
's
affection
for
her
friend
--
a
sentiment
that
have
learn
to
keep


itself
alive
on
the
scanty
diet
--
have
grow
to
active
adoration
since


Lily
's
restless
curiosity
have
draw
she
into
the
circle
of
Miss
Farish
's


work
.
Lily
's
taste
of
beneficence
have
waken
in
she
a
momentary
appetite


for
well
-
doing
.
her
visit
to
the
girl
'
Club
have
first
bring
she
in


contact
with
the
dramatic
contrast
of
life
.
she
have
always
accept
with


philosophic
calm
the
fact
that
such
existence
as
hers
be
pedestalle


on
foundation
of
obscure
humanity
.
the
dreary
limbo
of
dinginess
lie
all


around
and
beneath
that
little
illuminated
circle
in
which
life
reach


its
fine
efflorescence
,
as
the
mud
and
sleet
of
a
winter
night
enclose


a
hot
-
house
fill
with
tropical
flower
.
all
this
be
in
the
natural


order
of
thing
,
and
the
orchid
bask
in
its
artificially
create


atmosphere
could
round
the
delicate
curve
of
its
petal
undisturbe
by


the
ice
on
the
pane
.




but
it
be
one
thing
to
live
comfortably
with
the
abstract
conception
of


poverty
,
another
to
be
bring
in
contact
with
its
human
embodiment
.


Lily
have
never
conceive
of
these
victim
of
fate
otherwise
than
in
the


mass
.
that
the
mass
be
compose
of
individual
life
,
innumerable


separate
centre
of
sensation
,
with
her
own
eager
reaching
for
pleasure
,


her
own
fierce
revulsion
from
pain
--
that
some
of
these
bundle
of


feeling
be
clothe
in
shape
not
so
unlike
her
own
,
with
eye
mean
to


look
on
gladness
,
and
young
lip
shape
for
love
--
this
discovery
give


lily
one
of
those
sudden
shock
of
pity
that
sometimes
decentralize
a


life
.
Lily
's
nature
be
incapable
of
such
renewal
:
she
could
feel
other


demand
only
through
her
own
,
and
no
pain
be
long
vivid
which
do
not


press
on
an
answer
nerve
.
but
for
the
moment
she
be
draw
out
of


herself
by
the
interest
of
her
direct
relation
with
a
world
so
unlike
she


own
.
she
have
supplement
her
first
gift
by
personal
assistance
to
one
or


two
of
Miss
Farish
's
most
appealing
subject
,
and
the
admiration
and


interest
her
presence
excite
among
the
tired
worker
at
the
club


minister
in
a
new
form
to
her
insatiable
desire
to
please
.




Gerty
Farish
be
not
a
close
enough
reader
of
character
to
disentangle


the
mixed
thread
of
which
Lily
's
philanthropy
be
weave
.
she
suppose


her
beautiful
friend
to
be
actuate
by
the
same
motive
as
herself
--
that


sharpen
of
the
moral
vision
which
make
all
human
suffering
so
near


and
insistent
that
the
other
aspect
of
life
fade
into
remoteness
.
 
Gerty


live
by
such
simple
formula
that
she
do
not
hesitate
to
class
she


friend
's
state
with
the
emotional
"
change
of
heart
"
to
which
her
dealing


with
the
poor
have
accustom
she
;
and
she
rejoice
in
the
thought
that


she
have
be
the
humble
instrument
of
this
renewal
.
now
she
have
an
answer


to
all
criticism
of
Lily
's
conduct
:
as
she
have
say
,
she
know
"
the
real


lily
,
"
and
the
discovery
that
Selden
share
her
knowledge
raise
she


placid
acceptance
of
life
to
a
dazzled
sense
of
its
possibility
--
a


sense
far
enlarge
,
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
,
by
the
receipt
of


a
telegram
from
Selden
ask
if
he
might
dine
with
she
that
evening
.




while
Gerty
be
lose
in
the
happy
bustle
which
this
announcement
produce


in
her
small
household
,
Selden
be
at
one
with
she
in
think
with


intensity
of
Lily
Bart
.
the
case
which
have
call
he
to
Albany
be
not


complicate
enough
to
absorb
all
his
attention
,
and
he
have
the


professional
faculty
of
keep
a
part
of
his
mind
free
when
its
service


be
not
need
.
this
part
--
which
at
the
moment
seem
dangerously
like


the
whole
--
be
fill
to
the
brim
with
the
sensation
of
the
previous


evening
.
 
Selden
understand
the
symptom
:
he
recognize
the
fact
that
he


be
pay
up
,
as
there
have
always
be
a
chance
of
his
have
to
pay
up
,


for
the
voluntary
exclusion
of
his
past
.
he
have
mean
to
keep
free
from


permanent
tie
,
not
from
any
poverty
of
feeling
,
but
because
,
in
a


different
way
,
he
be
,
as
much
as
Lily
,
the
victim
of
his
environment
.


there
have
be
a
germ
of
truth
in
his
declaration
to
Gerty
Farish
that
he


have
never
want
to
marry
a
"
nice
"
girl
:
the
adjective
connoting
,
in
his


cousin
's
vocabulary
,
certain
utilitarian
quality
which
be
apt
to


preclude
the
luxury
of
charm
.
 
now
it
have
be
Selden
's
fate
to
have
a


charming
mother
:
her
graceful
portrait
,
all
smile
and
Cashmere
,
still


emit
a
faded
scent
of
the
undefinable
quality
.
his
father
be
the
kind


of
man
who
delight
in
a
charming
woman
:
who
quote
she
,
stimulate
she
,


and
keep
she
perennially
charming
.
neither
one
of
the
couple
care
for


money
,
but
their
disdain
of
it
take
the
form
of
always
spend
a
little


more
than
be
prudent
.
if
their
house
be
shabby
,
it
be
exquisitely


keep
;
if
there
be
good
book
on
the
shelf
there
be
also
good
dish


on
the
table
.
Selden
senior
have
an
eye
for
a
picture
,
his
wife
an


understanding
of
old
lace
;
and
both
be
so
conscious
of
restraint
and


discrimination
in
buying
that
they
never
quite
know
how
it
be
that
the


bill
mount
up
.




though
many
of
Selden
's
friend
would
have
call
his
parent
poor
,
he


have
grow
up
in
an
atmosphere
where
restrict
mean
be
feel
only
as
a


check
on
aimless
profusion
:
where
the
few
possession
be
so
good
that


their
rarity
give
they
a
merit
relief
,
and
abstinence
be
combine
with


elegance
in
a
way
exemplify
by
Mrs.
Selden
's
knack
of
wear
her
old


velvet
as
if
it
be
new
.
a
man
have
the
advantage
of
be
deliver


early
from
the
home
point
of
view
,
and
before
Selden
leave
college
he
have


learn
that
there
be
as
many
different
way
of
go
without
money
as


of
spend
it
.
unfortunately
,
he
find
no
way
as
agreeable
as
that


practise
at
home
;
and
his
view
of
womankind
in
especial
be
tinge
by


the
remembrance
of
the
one
woman
who
have
give
he
his
sense
of
"
value
.
"


it
be
from
she
that
he
inherit
his
detachment
from
the
sumptuary
side


of
life
:
the
stoic
's
carelessness
of
material
thing
,
combine
with
the


Epicurean
's
pleasure
in
they
.
life
shorn
of
either
feeling
appear
to


he
a
diminished
thing
;
and
nowhere
be
the
blending
of
the
two


ingredient
so
essential
as
in
the
character
of
a
pretty
woman
.




it
have
always
seem
to
Selden
that
experience
offer
a
great
deal


besides
the
sentimental
adventure
,
yet
he
could
vividly
conceive
of
a


love
which
should
broaden
and
deepen
till
it
become
the
central
fact
of


life
.
what
he
could
not
accept
,
in
his
own
case
,
be
the
makeshift


alternative
of
a
relation
that
should
be
less
than
this
:
that
should


leave
some
portion
of
his
nature
unsatisfie
,
while
it
put
an
undue


strain
on
other
.
he
would
not
,
in
other
word
,
yield
to
the
growth
of
an


affection
which
might
appeal
to
pity
yet
leave
the
understanding


untouched
:
sympathy
should
no
more
delude
he
than
a
trick
of
the
eye
,


the
grace
of
helplessness
than
a
curve
of
the
cheek
.




but
now
--
that
little
but
pass
like
a
sponge
over
all
his
vow
.
 
his


reason
-
out
resistance
seem
for
the
moment
so
much
less
important


than
the
question
as
to
when
Lily
would
receive
his
note
!
he
yield


himself
to
the
charm
of
trivial
preoccupation
,
wonder
at
what
hour


her
reply
would
be
send
,
with
what
word
it
would
begin
.
as
to
its
import


he
have
no
doubt
--
he
be
as
sure
of
her
surrender
as
of
his
own
.
 
and
so


he
have
leisure
to
muse
on
all
its
exquisite
detail
,
as
a
hard
worker
,
on


a
holiday
morning
,
might
lie
still
and
watch
the
beam
of
light
travel


gradually
across
his
room
.
but
if
the
new
light
dazzle
,
it
do
not
blind


he
.
he
could
still
discern
the
outline
of
fact
,
though
his
own
relation


to
they
have
change
.
he
be
no
less
conscious
than
before
of
what
be


say
of
Lily
Bart
,
but
he
could
separate
the
woman
he
know
from
the


vulgar
estimate
of
she
.
 
his
mind
turn
to
Gerty
Farish
's
word
,
and
the


wisdom
of
the
world
seem
a
grope
thing
beside
the
insight
of


innocence
.
 
BLESSED
be
the
pure
in
HEART
,
for
they
shall
see
GOD
--
even


the
hidden
god
in
their
neighbour
's
breast
!
Selden
be
in
the
state
of


impassione
self
-
absorption
that
the
first
surrender
to
love
produce
.


his
craving
be
for
the
companionship
of
one
whose
point
of
view
should


justify
his
own
,
who
should
confirm
,
by
deliberate
observation
,
the
truth


to
which
his
intuition
have
leap
.
he
could
not
wait
for
the
midday


recess
,
but
seize
a
moment
's
leisure
in
court
to
scribble
his
telegram


to
Gerty

to
his
club

he
hope
a
note


from
Miss

await
he
.
but
his
box
contain
only
a
line
of


rapturous
assent
from
Gerty

to

in
the

just
then
sweetest
to
his
ear

it
be
surprising
how


little
narrow
wall

a
low
ceiling

he

mood

off
the
whole

.
she
have


make
the
caramel
custard
with
her
own
hand
?
it
be
sinful
to
keep
such


gift
to
herself

he
reflect
with
a
throb
of
pride
that
Lily
could
trim


her
own
hat

she
have
tell

so
the
day

he
do
not

after

during
the
little
repast
he


keep
the
talk
on
his
hostess

,
flutter
at
be
the

shine
as
rosy
as
the

she

for


the
occasion
.
Selden
evince
an
extraordinary
interest
in
her
household


arrangement
:
compliment
she
on
the
ingenuity
with
which
she
have


utilize
every
inch
of
her
small
quarter
,
ask
how
her
servant
manage


about
afternoon
out
,
learn
that
one
may
improvise
delicious
dinner
in


a
chafing
-
dish
,
and
utter
thoughtful
generalization
on
the
burden
of
a


large
establishment
.




when
they
be
in
the
sitting
-
room
again
,
where
they
fit
as
snugly
as


bit
in
a
puzzle
,
and
she
have
brew
the
coffee
,
and
pour
it
into
she


grandmother
's
egg
-
shell
cup
,
his
eye
,
as
he
lean
back
,
bask
in
the


warm
fragrance
,
light
on
a
recent
photograph
of
Miss
Bart
,
and
the


desire
transition
be
effect
without
an
effort
.
the
photograph
be


well
enough
--
but
to
catch
she
as
she
have
look
last
night
!
Gerty
agree


with
he
--
never
have
she
be
so
radiant
.
but
could
photography
capture


that
light
?
there
have
be
a
new
look
in
her
face
--
something
different
;


yes
,
Selden
agree
there
have
be
something
different
.
 
the
coffee
be
so


exquisite
that
he
ask
for
a
second
cup
:
such
a
contrast
to
the
watery


stuff
at
the
club
!
ah
,
your
poor
bachelor
with
his
impersonal
club
fare
,


alternate
with
the
equally
impersonal
CUISINE
of
the
dinner
-
party
!
a


man
who
live
in
lodging
miss
the
good
part
of
life
--
he
picture
the


flavourless
solitude
of
Trenor
's
repast
,
and
feel
a
moment
's
compassion


for
the
man
.
.
.
but
to
return
to
Lily
--
and
again
and
again
he
return
,


question
,
conjecture
,
lead
Gerty
on
,
drain
her
inmost
thought


of
their
store
tenderness
for
her
friend
.




at
first
she
pour
herself
out
unstintingly
,
happy
in
this
perfect


communion
of
their
sympathy
.
his
understanding
of
Lily
help
to


confirm
her
own
belief
in
her
friend
.
they
dwell
together
on
the
fact


that
Lily
have
have
no
chance
.
Gerty
instance
her
generous
impulse
--
she


restlessness
and
discontent
.
the
fact
that
her
life
have
never
satisfy


she
prove
that
she
be
make
for
well
thing
.
she
might
have
marry


more
than
once
--
the
conventional
rich
marriage
which
she
have
be
teach


to
consider
the
sole
end
of
existence
--
but
when
the
opportunity
come
she


have
always
shrink
from
it
.
Percy
Gryce
,
for
instance
,
have
be
in
love


with
she
--
every
one
at
Bellomont
have
suppose
they
to
be
engage
,
and
she


dismissal
of
he
be
think
inexplicable
.
this
view
of
the
Gryce


incident
chime
too
well
with
Selden
's
mood
not
to
be
instantly
adopt


by
he
,
with
a
flash
of
retrospective
contempt
for
what
have
once
seem


the
obvious
solution
.
if
rejection
there
have
be
--
and
he
wonder
now


that
he
have
ever
doubt
it!--then
he
hold
the
key
to
the
secret
,
and
the


hillside
of
Bellomont
be
light
up
,
not
with
sunset
,
but
with
dawn
.
it


be
he
who
have
waver
and
disown
the
face
of
opportunity
--
and
the
joy


now
warm
his
breast
might
have
be
a
familiar
inmate
if
he
have


capture
it
in
its
first
flight
.




it
be
at
this
point
,
perhaps
,
that
a
joy
just
try
its
wing
in


Gerty
's
heart
drop
to
earth
and
lie
still
.
she
sat
face
Selden
,


repeat
mechanically
:
"
no
,
she
have
never
be
understood----
"
and
all


the
while
she
herself
seem
to
be
sit
in
the
centre
of
a
great
glare


of
comprehension
.
the
little
confidential
room
,
where
a
moment
ago
their


thought
have
touch
elbow
like
their
chair
,
grow
to
unfriendly


vastness
,
separate
she
from
Selden
by
all
the
length
of
her
new
vision


of
the
future
--
and
that
future
stretch
out
interminably
,
with
she


lonely
figure
toil
down
it
,
a
mere
speck
on
the
solitude
.




"
she
be
herself
with
a
few
people
only
;
and
you
be
one
of
they

she


hear
Selden
say
.
and
again
:
"
be
good
to
she
,
Gerty
,
wo
n't
you

"
and
:


"

it
in

she

"




the
word
beat
on
Gerty
's
brain
like
the
sound
of
a
language
which
have


seem
familiar
at
a
distance
,
but
on
approach
be
find
to
be


unintelligible
.
he
have
come
to
talk
to
she
of
Lily

that
be
all
!
there


have
be
a
third
at
the
feast
she
have
spread
for
he
,
and
that
third
have


take
her
own
place
.

try
to
follow
what
he
be
say
,
to
cling
to


her
own
part
in
the
talk
--
but
it
be
all
as
meaningless
as
the
boom
of


wave
in
a
drown
head
,
and
she
feel
,
as
the
drowning
may
feel
,
that
to


sink
would
be
nothing
beside
the
pain
of
struggle
to
keep
up
.




Selden
rise
,
and
she
draw
a
deep
breath
,
feel
that
soon
she
could


yield
to
the
bless
wave
.

a
clean
rush
of
wave
they
have
to
win
through

a


clog

clear

be
at

judgment

Western


sight

he
'll
get
out
of

phase
,

want
something


that
the
crowd
will
pass
and
the
few
pause
before
.

in
with
the
query
:
"

the
Wellington
Brys
'

rather


clever

n't
you
think

"




they
be
just
beneath
the
wide
white
facade
,
with
its
rich
restraint
of


line
,
which
suggest
the
clever
corseting
of
a
redundant
figure
.




"
that
be
the
next
stage

the
desire
to
imply
that
one
have
be
to
Europe
,


and
have
a
standard
.
I
be
sure
Mrs.

think
her
house
a
copy
of
the


trianon
;
in

every
marble
house
with
gilt
furniture

to

how

choose
the
Corinthian

on
the
good
precedent

the
dimension
of

he
have


kiss
she
before

but
not
with
another
woman
on
his
lip
.
if
he
have


spare
she
that
she
could
have

quietly

the
dark
flood

now
the

shoot
through

it
be
hard
to
drown
at

Gerty
hide
her
face


from
the
light

it
pierce
to
the
cranny
of
her
soul

perception
,
have
be
uncritical
and
simple
in
his


view

never

the
situation
be
light
up
by
a
dreary
flash
of
irony

she


know
Selden

how
the
force

her
faith
in
Lily

have

to
dispel

Lily

inconscient

have

when
,
in
such
matter
,
be
a
woman

perception
at
fault

and
if
she


know
,
then
she
have
deliberately
despoil
her
friend
,

in
mere


wantonness
of
power
,
since
,
even
to
Gerty
's
suddenly
flame
jealousy
,
it


seem
incredible
that
Lily
should
wish
to
be
Selden
's
wife
.
Lily
might


be
incapable
of
marry
for
money
,
but
she
be
equally
incapable
of


live
without
it
,
and
Selden
's
eager
investigation
into
the
small


economy
of
house

keeping
make
he
appear

tragically
dupe

out
imperially

cheap

cramp
furniture
of
the

room
.
could
selden
picture


she
in
such
an
interior

Gerty
feel
the
poverty
,
the
insignificance
of


her
surrounding
:
she
behold
her
life
as
it
must
appear
to
Lily
.
and
the


cruelty
of
Lily
's
judgment
smite
upon
her
memory
.
she
see
that
she
have


dress
her
idol
with
attribute
of
her
own
making

when

Lily
ever


really
feel
,

pity
,

understand

all
she
want
be
the
taste
of


new
experience

she
seem

cruel
creature

fatigue

the
long

her
night

this
sense
of
physical
discomfort
be
the
first
to
assert
itself
;

she
perceive
,
beneath
it

a
corresponding
mental
prostration
,
a
languor


of
horror
more
insufferable

the
first
rush
of
her
disgust

the


think
of

to
wake
every

this
weight

must
find
some
way
out
of
the


slough
into
which
she
have
stumble

it
be
not
so
much
compunction

the


dread
of
her
morning
thought

press
on
she
the
need
of
action
.

unutterably

weariness

connectedly

lie


back
,
look
about
the
poor
slit
of
a
room
with
a
renewal
of
physical


distaste

she


outraged
feeling

she
a
paralyze

priggish

superior

drift
into

what
the
other
do

I
've
have
a
dreadful
lesson

you
need
n't
make
any
promise

unnecessary

"
I
shall
certainly
not
do
anything
to
give
the
impression
that
I


countenance
your
behaviour
.
if
you
really
owe
your
dress

maker

I
will


settle
with
she

recognize
no
obligation

assume
your


debt

"




Lily
have
rise
,
and
stand
pale
and
quiver
before
her
aunt
.
 
Pride


storm
in
she
,
but
humiliation
force
the
cry
from
her
lip
:
"
aunt


Julia
,
I
shall
be
disgrace
--
I--
"
but
she
could
go
no
far
.
if
she


aunt
turn
such
a
stony
ear
to
the
fiction
of
the
gambling
debt
,
in


what
spirit
would
she
receive
the
terrible
avowal
of
the
truth
?




"
I
consider
that
you
be
disgrace
,
Lily
:
disgrace
by
your
conduct
far


more
than
by
its
result
.
you
say
your
friend
have
persuade
you
to
play


card
with
they
;
well
,
they
may
as
well
learn
a
lesson
too
.
they
can


probably
afford
to
lose
a
little
money
--
and
at
any
rate
,
I
be
not
go


to
waste
any
of
mine
in
pay
they
.
and
now
I
must
ask
you
to
leave


I
--
this
scene
have
be
extremely
painful
,
and
I
have
my
own
health
to


consider
.
 
draw
down
the
blind
,
please
;
and
tell
Jennings
I
will
see
no


one
this
afternoon
but
Grace
Stepney
.
"




Lily
go
up
to
her
own
room
and
bolt
the
door
.
she
be
tremble
with


fear
and
anger
--
the
rush
of
the
fury
'
wing
be
in
her
ear
.
she
walk


up
and
down
the
room
with
blind
irregular
step
.
the
last
door
of
escape


be
closed
--
she
feel
herself
shut
in
with
her
dishonour
.




suddenly
her
wild
pacing
bring
she
before
the
clock
on
the


chimney
-
piece
.
its
hand
stand
at
half
-
past
three
,
and
she
remember


that
Selden
be
to
come
to
she
at
four
.
she
have
mean
to
put
he
off
with


a
word
--
but
now
her
heart
leap
at
the
thought
of
see
he
.
be
there


not
a
promise
of
rescue
in
his
love
?
as
she
have
lain
at
Gerty
's
side
the


night
before
,
she
have
think
of
his
coming
,
and
of
the
sweetness
of


weep
out
her
pain
upon
his
breast
.
of
course
she
have
mean
to
clear


herself
of
its
consequence
before
she
meet
he
--
she
have
never
really


doubt
that
Mrs.
Peniston
would
come
to
her
aid
.
and
she
have
feel
,
even


in
the
full
storm
of
her
misery
,
that
Selden
's
love
could
not
be
she


ultimate
refuge
;
only
it
would
be
so
sweet
to
take
a
moment
's
shelter


there
,
while
she
gather
fresh
strength
to
go
on
.




but
now
his
love
be
her
only
hope
,
and
as
she
sit
alone
with
she


wretchedness
the
thought
of
confide
in
he
become
as
seductive
as
the


river
's
flow
to
the
suicide
.
the
first
plunge
would
be
terrible
--
but


afterward
,
what
blessedness
might
come
!
she
remember
Gerty
's
word
:
"
I


know
he
--
he
will
help
you
"
;
and
her
mind
clung
to
they
as
a
sick
person


might
cling
to
a
healing
relic
.
oh
,
if
he
really
understand
--
if
he
would


help
she
to
gather
up
her
broken
life
,
and
put
it
together
in
some
new


semblance
in
which
no
trace
of
the
past
should
remain
!
he
have
always
make


her
feel
that
she
be
worthy
of
well
thing
,
and
she
have
never
be
in


great
need
of
such
solace
.
once
and
again
she
shrink
at
the
thought
of


imperille
his
love
by
her
confession
:
for
love
be
what
she
need
--
it


would
take
the
glow
of
passion
to
weld
together
the
shatter
fragment


of
her
self
-
esteem
.
but
she
recur
to
Gerty
's
word
and
hold
fast
to


they
.
she
be
sure
that
Gerty
know
Selden
's
feeling
for
she
,
and
it
have


never
dawn
upon
her
blindness
that
Gerty
's
own
judgment
of
he
be


colour
by
emotion
far
more
ardent
than
her
own
.




four
o'clock
find
she
in
the
drawing
-
room
:
she
be
sure
that
Selden


would
be
punctual
.
but
the
hour
come
and
pass
--
it
move
on
feverishly
,


measure
by
her
impatient
heart
-
beat
.
she
have
time
to
take
a
fresh


survey
of
her
wretchedness
,
and
to
fluctuate
anew
between
the
impulse
to


confide
in
Selden
and
the
dread
of
destroy
his
illusion
.
 
but
as
the


minute
pass
the
need
of
throw
herself
on
his
comprehension
become


more
urgent
:
she
could
not
bear
the
weight
of
her
misery
alone
.
there


would
be
a
perilous
moment
,
perhaps
:
but
could
she
not
trust
to
she


beauty
to
bridge
it
over
,
to
land
she
safe
in
the
shelter
of
his
devotion
?




but
the
hour
speed
on
and
Selden
do
not
come
.
Doubtless
he
have
be


detain
,
or
have
misread
her
hurriedly
scrawled
note
,
take
the
four
for


a
five
.
the
ringing
of
the
door
-
bell
a
few
minute
after
five
confirm


this
supposition
,
and
make
Lily
hastily
resolve
to
write
more
legibly
in


future
.
the
sound
of
step
in
the
hall
,
and
of
the
butler
's
voice


precede
they
,
pour
fresh
energy
into
her
vein
.
she
feel
herself
once


more
the
alert
and
competent
moulder
of
emergency
,
and
the
remembrance


of
her
power
over
Selden
flush
she
with
sudden
confidence
.
but
when
the


drawing
-
room
door
open
it
be
Rosedale
who
come
in
.




the
reaction
cause
she
a
sharp
pang
,
but
after
a
pass
movement
of


irritation
at
the
clumsiness
of
fate
,
and
at
her
own
carelessness
in
not


deny
the
door
to
all
but
Selden
,
she
control
herself
and
greet


Rosedale
amicably
.
it
be
annoying
that
Selden
,
when
he
come
,
should
find


that
particular
visitor
in
possession
,
but
Lily
be
mistress
of
the
art


of
rid
herself
of
superfluous
company
,
and
to
her
present
mood


Rosedale
seem
distinctly
negligible
.




his
own
view
of
the
situation
force
itself
upon
she
after
a
few
moment
'


conversation
.
she
have
catch
at
the
Brys
'
entertainment
as
an
easy


impersonal
subject
,
likely
to
tide
they
over
the
interval
till
Selden


appear
,
but
Mr.
Rosedale
,
tenaciously
plant
beside
the
tea
-
table
,
his


hand
in
his
pocket
,
his
leg
a
little
too
freely
extend
,
at
once
give


the
topic
a
personal
turn
.




"
pretty
well
do
--
well
,
yes
,
I
suppose
it
be
:
Welly
Bry
be
get
his
back


up
and
do
n't
mean
to
let
go
till
he
be
get
the
hang
of
the
thing
.
 
of


course
,
there
be
thing
here
and
there
--
thing
Mrs.
Fisher
could
n't
be


expect
to
see
to
--
the
champagne
be
n't
cold
,
and
the
coat
got
mix
in


the
coat
-
room
.
I
would
have
spend
more
money
on
the
music
.
but
that
be
my


character
:
if
I
want
a
thing
I
be
willing
to
pay
:
I
do
n't
go
up
to
the


counter
,
and
then
wonder
if
the
article
's
worth
the
price
.
I
would
n't
be


satisfied
to
entertain
like
the
Welly
Brys
;
I
'd
want
something
that
would


look
more
easy
and
natural
,
more
as
if
I
take
it
in
my
stride
.
and
it


take
just
two
thing
to
do
that
,
Miss
Bart
:
money
,
and
the
right
woman


to
spend
it
.
"




he
pause
,
and
examine
she
attentively
while
she
affect
to
rearrange


the
tea
-
cup
.




"
I
've
get
the
money
,
"
he
continue
,
clear
his
throat
,
"
and
what
I
want


be
the
woman
--
and
I
mean
to
have
she
too
.
"




he
lean
forward
a
little
,
rest
his
hand
on
the
head
of
his


walk
-
stick
.
he
have
see
man
of
Ned
Van
Alstyne
's
type
bring
their
hat


and
stick
into
a
drawing
-
room
,
and
he
think
it
add
a
touch
of


elegant
familiarity
to
their
appearance
.




Lily
be
silent
,
smile
faintly
,
with
her
eye
absently
rest
on
his


face
.
she
be
in
reality
reflect
that
a
declaration
would
take
some


time
to
make
,
and
that
Selden
must
surely
appear
before
the
moment
of


refusal
have
be
reach
.
her
brooding
look
,
as
of
a
mind
withdraw
yet


not
avert
,
seem
to
Mr.
Rosedale
full
of
a
subtle
encouragement
.
he


would
not
have
like
any
evidence
of
eagerness
.




"
I
mean
to
have
she
too
,
"
he
repeat
,
with
a
laugh
intend
to


strengthen
his
self
-
assurance
.
"
I
generally
have
get
what
I
want
in


life
,
Miss
Bart
.
I
want
money
,
and
I
've
get
more
than
I
know
how
to


invest
;
and
now
the
money
do
n't
seem
to
be
of
any
account
unless
I
can


spend
it
on
the
right
woman
.
that
be
what
I
want
to
do
with
it
:
I
want
my


wife
to
make
all
the
other
woman
feel
small
.
I
'd
never
grudge
a
dollar


that
be
spend
on
that
.
but
it
be
n't
every
woman
can
do
it
,
no
matter
how


much
you
spend
on
she
.
there
be
a
girl
in
some
history
book
who
want


gold
shield
,
or
something
,
and
the
fellow
throw
'em
at
she
,
and
she
be


crush
under
'em
:
they
kill
she
.
well
,
that
be
true
enough
:
some
woman


looked
bury
under
their
jewelry
.
what
I
want
be
a
woman
who
'll
hold
she


head
high
the
more
diamond
I
put
on
it
.
 
and
when
I
look
at
you
the


other
night
at
the
Brys
'
,
in
that
plain
white
dress
,
look
as
if
you


have
a
crown
on
,
I
say
to
myself
:
'
by
gad
,
if
she
have
one
she
'd
wear
it


as
if
it
grow
on
she
.
'
"




still
Lily
do
not
speak
,
and
he
continue
,
warm
with
his
theme
:
"
tell


you
what
it
be
,
though
,
that
kind
of
woman
cost
more
than
all
the
rest


of
'em
put
together
.
if
a
woman
be
go
to
ignore
her
pearl
,
they
want


to
be
well

I

you
know
it
be
only
the
showy
thing
that

cheap
.


well
,
I
should
want
my
wife
to
be
able
to
take
the
earth
for
grant
if


she
want
to
.
I
know
there
be
one
thing
vulgar
about
money
,
and
that
be


the
thinking
about
it
;

my
wife
would
never
have
to
demean
herself
in


that
way
.
"
he
pause
,
and
then
add
,
with
an
unfortunate
lapse
to
an


early
manner
:
"
I
guess
you
know
the
lady
I
've
get
in
view
,
Miss
Bart
.
"




Lily
raise
her
head
,
brighten
a
little
under
the
challenge
.
 
even


through
the
dark
tumult
of
her
thought
,
the
clink
of
Mr.
Rosedale
's


million
have
a
faintly
seductive
note
.
oh
,
for
enough
of
they
to
cancel


her
one
miserable
debt
!
but
the
man
behind
they
grow
increasingly


repugnant
in
the
light
of
Selden
's
expect
come
.
the
contrast
be
too


grotesque
:
she
could
scarcely
suppress
the
smile
it
provoke
.
she
decide


that
directness
would
be
good
.




"
if
you
mean
I
,
Mr.
Rosedale
,
I
be
very
grateful
--
very
much
flattered
;


but
I
do
n't
know
what
I
have
ever
do
to
make
you
think--

you
mean
you

in
love
with

get
sense
enough

you

amusement

time

the

"




he
pause
,
and
she
return
with
a
chilling
smile
:
"
you
be
mistaken
in


one
point
,
Mr.
Rosedale
:
whatever
I

I

prepared

settle
for
.
"




she
speak
with
the
intention
of
make
he
see
that
,
if
his
word

a
tentative
allusion
to
her
private
affair

if

it
fail
to
abash
he
,


and
he
go
on
in
the

tone
:

offence

her
whole

coolly

careless
about

flushed

his
unhoped

for
success

discipline
by
the
tradition

his
blood

undue
haste

force
of
a


patience

at

continued
absence

smite
she
with
a

alarm

Rosedale
have
remain
over
an
hour
,

she
understand
that
it
be
now

late
to
hope
for
Selden

he
would
write

course
;
there
would
be
a
note

the
chill
of
the

heavily
on

it
lie
heavy

bring
no

she
have
to
go
upstairs

a
lonely
night

a
night
as
grim
and
sleepless


as
her
tortured
fancy
have
picture
it
to
Gerty

she
have
never

with

to
be
confront
with
they
through
such


hour

the
confused
wretchedness

easily
bearable

Daylight
disband
the
phantom

make
it
clear
to
she
that
she


would
hear
from
Selden
before
noon
;
but
the
day
pass
without

Lily
remain
at
home
,
lunch

dining
alone
with


her
aunt

who
complain
of
fluttering
of

talk
icily

down

she
be
about
to

for
a


messenger
to
despatch
it
when
her
eye
fall
on
a
paragraph
in
the
evening


paper

lie
at
her
elbow
:

she
lay
down

motionless

at

she


understand
now
that

how
do
she
look
to

she
move
away
,

begin
to
wander
aimlessly
about
the
room
,


fit
her
step
with
mechanical
precision

what

it

one
feel
that

reach
its
climax


and
that
the
desultory

would
soon


dissolve
and
re

Lord
Hubert
Dacey

finally


go
off
in
quest
of
the
Duchess
of
Beltshire
,
charge
by
Mrs.
Bry
with


the
delicate
negotiation
of
secure
that
lady
's
presence
at
dinner
,
the


Stepneys
have
leave
for
Nice
in
their
motor

car
,
and
Mr.
Bry
have
depart


to
take
his
place
in
the
pigeon
shooting
match
which
be
at
the
moment


engage
his
high
faculty
.




Mrs.
Bry
,
who
have
a
tendency
to
grow
red
and
stertorous
after
luncheon
,


have
be
judiciously
prevail
upon
by
Carry
Fisher
to
withdraw
to
she


hotel
for
an
hour
's
repose
;
and
Selden
and
his
companion
be
thus
leave


to
a
stroll
propitious
to
confidence
.
the
stroll
soon
resolve
itself


into
a
tranquil
session
on
a
bench
overhang
with
laurel
and
banksian


rose
,
from
which
they
catch
a
dazzle
of
blue
sea
between
marble


baluster
,
and
the
fiery
shaft
of
cactus
-
blossom
shoot
meteor
-
like


from
the
rock
.
the
soft
shade
of
their
niche
,
and
the
adjacent
glitter
of


the
air
,
be
conducive
to
an
easy
lounging
mood
,
and
to
the
smoking
of


many
cigarette
;
and
Selden
,
yield
to
these
influence
,
suffer
Mrs.


fisher
to
unfold
to
he
the
history
of
her
recent
experience
.
she
have


come
abroad
with
the
Welly
Brys
at
the
moment
when
fashion
flee
the


inclemency
of
the
New
York
spring
.
the
Brys
,
intoxicate
by
their
first


success
,
already
thirst
for
new
kingdom
,
and
Mrs.
Fisher
,
view
the


Riviera
as
an
easy
introduction
to
London
society
,
have
guide
their


course
thither
.
she
have
affiliation
of
her
own
in
every
capital
,
and
a


facility
for
pick
they
up
again
after
long
absence
;
and
the
carefully


disseminate
rumour
of
the
Brys
'
wealth
have
at
once
gather
about
they
a


group
of
cosmopolitan
pleasure
-
seeker
.




"
but
thing
be
not
go
as
well
as
I
expect
,
"
Mrs.
Fisher
frankly


admit
.
"
it
be
all
very
well
to
say
that
every
body
with
money
can
get


into
society
;
but
it
would
be
truer
to
say
that
NEARLY
everybody
can
.


and
the
London
market
be
so
glut
with
new
Americans
that
,
to
succeed


there
now
,
they
must
be
either
very
clever
or
awfully
queer
.
the
Brys
be


neither
.
he
would
get
on
well
enough
if
she
'd
let
he
alone
;
they
like


his
slang
and
his
brag
and
his
blunder
.
but
Louisa
spoil
it
all
by


try
to
repress
he
and
put
herself
forward
.
if
she
'd
be
natural


herself
--
fat
and
vulgar
and
bounce
--
it
would
be
all
right
;
but
as
soon


as
she
meet
anybody
smart
she
try
to
be
slender
and
queenly
.
 
she


try
it
with
the
Duchess
of
Beltshire
and
Lady
Skiddaw
,
and
they
flee
.


I
've
do
my
good
to
make
she
see
her
mistake
--
i've
say
to
she
again
and


again
:
'
just
let
yourself
go
,
Louisa
'
;
but
she
keep
up
the
humbug
even


with
I
--
I
believe
she
keep
on
be
queenly
in
her
own
room
,
with
the


door
shut
.




"
the
bad
of
it
be
,
"
Mrs.
Fisher
go
on
,
"
that
she
think
it
be
all
my


fault
.
when
the
Dorsets
turn
up
here
six
week
ago
,
and
everybody
begin


to
make
a
fuss
about
Lily
Bart
,
I
could
see
Louisa
think
that
if
she
'd


have
Lily
in
tow
instead
of
I
she
would
have
be
hob
-
nobbing
with
all


the
royalty
by
this
time
.
she
do
n't
realize
that
it
be
Lily
's
beauty


that
do
it
:
Lord
Hubert
tell
I
Lily
be
think
even
handsomer
than


when
he
know
she
at
Aix
ten
year
ago
.
it
seem
she
be
tremendously


admire
there
.
an
italian
Prince
,
rich
and
the
real
thing
,
want
to


marry
she
;
but
just
at
the
critical
moment
a
good
-
look
step
-
son
turn


up
,
and
Lily
be
silly
enough
to
flirt
with
he
while
she


marriage
-
settlement
with
the
step
-
father
be
be
draw
up
.
some


people
say
the
young
man
do
it
on
purpose
.
you
can
fancy
the
scandal
:


there
be
an
awful
row
between
the
man
,
and
people
begin
to
look
at
Lily


so
queerly
that
Mrs.
Peniston
have
to
pack
up
and
finish
her
cure


elsewhere
.
not
that
SHE
ever
understand
:
to
this
day
she
think
that
Aix


do
n't
suit
she
,
and
mention
she
having
be
send
there
as
proof
of
the


incompetence
of
french
doctor
.
that
be
Lily
all
over
,
you
know
:
she
work


like
a
slave
prepare
the
ground
and
sow
her
seed
;
but
the
day
she


ought
to
be
reap
the
harvest
she
over
-
sleep
herself
or
go
off
on
a


picnic
.
"




Mrs.
Fisher
pause
and
look
reflectively
at
the
deep
shimmer
of
sea


between
the
cactus
-
flower
.
"
sometimes
,
"
she
add
,
"
I
think
it
be
just


flightiness
--
and
sometimes
I
think
it
be
because
,
at
heart
,
she
despise


the
thing
she
be
try
for
.
and
it
be
the
difficulty
of
decide
that


make
she
such
an
interesting
study
.
"
she
glance
tentatively
at
Selden
's


motionless
profile
,
and
resume
with
a
slight
sigh
:
"
well
,
all
I
can
say


be
,
I
wish
she
'd
give
I
some
of
her
discard
opportunity
.
 
I
wish
we


could
change
place
now
,
for
instance
.
she
could
make
a
very
good
thing


out
of
the
Brys
if
she
manage
they
properly
,
and
I
should
know
just
how


to
look
after
George
Dorset
while
Bertha
be
read
Verlaine
with
Neddy


Silverton
.
"




she
meet
Selden
's
sound
of
protest
with
a
sharp
derisive
glance
.
 
"
well
,


what
be
the
use
of
mince
matter
?
we
all
know
that
be
what
Bertha
bring


her
abroad
for
.
when
Bertha
want
to
have
a
good
time
she
have
to
provide


occupation
for
George
.
at
first
I
think
Lily
be
go
to
play
she


card
well
this
time
,
but
there
be
rumour
that
Bertha
be
jealous
of
she


success
here
and
at
Cannes
,
and
I
should
n't
be
surprised
if
there
be
a


break
any
day
.
Lily
's
only
safeguard
be
that
Bertha
need
she
badly
--
oh
,


very
badly
.
the
Silverton
affair
be
in
the
acute
stage
:
it
be
necessary


that
George
's
attention
should
be
pretty
continuously
distract
.
and
I
be


bind
to
say
Lily
does
distract
it
:
I
believe
he
'd
marry
she
tomorrow
if


he
find
out
there
be
anything
wrong
with
Bertha
.
but
you
know
he
--
he
be


as
blind
as
he
be
jealous
;
and
of
course
Lily
's
present
business
be
to


keep
he
blind
.
a
clever
woman
might
know
just
the
right
moment
to
tear


off
the
bandage
:
but
Lily
be
n't
clever
in
that
way
,
and
when
George
do


open
his
eye
she
'll
probably
contrive
not
to
be
in
his
line
of
vision

Mrs.

contempt

his

forward
some
important
business
letter
to
Nice

at


nice
he
would
quietly
await

himself
for

he
have
intend
to
pass
the
week
which


remain
to
he
before
sailing

it
would
now
be
difficult
to
return


on
his

chance

even
the
repeat
mention
of
she


name

would
send
his
thought
back
into
groove
from
which
he
have


resolutely
detach
they
;
whereas
,
if
she
could
be
entirely
exclude
from


his
life

pressure
of
new

impression

which
no

trust
himself

gradually
to

reasonable
view
of
Miss

reach
the

arrive
at
this
point

his


reflection

the
increase

on
the
platform

he
that


he

express
purpose
of
defeat
Mrs.
Bry
's
endeavour
to


capture
the
Duchess
.




during
the
laugh
relation
of
this
manoeuvre
,
Selden
have
time
for
a


rapid
impression
of
Miss
Bart
,
who
have
seat
herself
opposite
to
he
in


the
golden
afternoon
light
.
scarcely
three
month
have
elapse
since
he


have
part
from
she
on
the
threshold
of
the
Brys
'
conservatory
;
but
a


subtle
change
have
pass
over
the
quality
of
her
beauty
.
then
it
have
have


a
transparency
through
which
the
fluctuation
of
the
spirit
be


sometimes
tragically
visible
;
now
its
impenetrable
surface
suggest
a


process
of
crystallization
which
have
fuse
her
whole
be
into
one
hard


brilliant
substance
.
the
change
have
strike
Mrs.
Fisher
as
a
rejuvenation
:


to
Selden
it
seem
like
that
moment
of
pause
and
arrest
when
the
warm


fluidity
of
youth
be
chill
into
its
final
shape
.




he
feel
it
in
the
way
she
smile
on
he
,
and
in
the
readiness
and


competence
with
which
,
fling
unexpectedly
into
his
presence
,
she
take
up


the
thread
of
their
intercourse
as
though
that
thread
have
not
be


snap
with
a
violence
from
which
he
still
reel
.
such
facility


sicken
he
--
but
he
tell
himself
that
it
be
with
the
pang
which


precede
recovery
.
now
he
would
really
get
well
--
would
eject
the
last


drop
of
poison
from
his
blood
.
already
he
feel
himself
calmer
in
she


presence
than
he
have
learn
to
be
in
the
thought
of
she
.
her
assumption


and
elision
,
her
short
-
cut
and
long
detours
,
the
skill
with
which
she


contrive
to
meet
he
at
a
point
from
which
no
inconvenient
glimpse
of


the
past
be
visible
,
suggest
what
opportunity
she
have
have
for


practise
such
art
since
their
last
meeting
.
he
feel
that
she
have
at


last
arrive
at
an
understanding
with
herself
:
have
make
a
pact
with
she


rebellious
impulse
,
and
achieve
a
uniform
system
of
self
-
government
,


under
which
all
vagrant
tendency
be
either
hold
captive
or
force


into
the
service
of
the
state
.




and
he
see
other
thing
too
in
her
manner
:
see
how
it
have
adjust
itself


to
the
hidden
intricacy
of
a
situation
in
which
,
even
after
Mrs.


Fisher
's
elucidate
flash
,
he
still
feel
himself
agrope
.
surely
Mrs.


Fisher
could
no
long
charge
Miss
Bart
with
neglect
she


opportunity
!
to
Selden
's
exasperated
observation
she
be
only
too


completely
alive
to
they
.
she
be
"
perfect
"
to
every
one
:
subservient
to


Bertha
's
anxious
predominance
,
good
-
naturedly
watchful
of
Dorset
's
mood
,


brightly
companionable
to
Silverton
and
Dacey
,
the
latter
of
whom
meet
she


on
an
evident
footing
of
old
admiration
,
while
young
Silverton
,


portentously
self
-
absorb
,
seem
conscious
of
she
only
as
of
something


vaguely
obstructive
.
and
suddenly
,
as
Selden
note
the
fine
shade
of


manner
by
which
she
harmonize
herself
with
her
surrounding
,
it
flash


on
he
that
,
to
need
such
adroit
handling
,
the
situation
must
indeed
be


desperate
.
she
be
on
the
edge
of
something
--
that
be
the
impression
leave


with
he
.
 
he
seem
to
see
she
poise
on
the
brink
of
a
chasm
,
with
one


graceful
foot
advanced
to
assert
her
unconsciousness
that
the
ground
be


fail
she
.




on
the
Promenade
des
Anglais
,
where
Ned
Silverton
hang
on
he
for
the


half
hour
before
dinner
,
he
receive
a
deep
impression
of
the
general


insecurity
.
Silverton
be
in
a
mood
of
titanic
pessimism
.
how
any
one


could
come
to
such
a
damn
hole
as
the
Riviera
--
any
one
with
a
grain
of


imagination
--
with
the
whole
Mediterranean
to
choose
from
:
but
then
,
if


one
's
estimate
of
a
place
depend
on
the
way
they
broil
a
spring


chicken
!
Gad
!
 
what
a
study
might
be
make
of
the
tyranny
of
the


stomach
--
the
way
a
sluggish
liver
or
insufficient
gastric
juice
might


affect
the
whole
course
of
the
universe
,
overshadow
everything
in


reach
--
chronic
dyspepsia
ought
to
be
among
the
"
statutory
cause
"
;
a


woman
's
life
might
be
ruin
by
a
man
's
inability
to
digest
fresh
bread
.


Grotesque
?
yes
--
and
tragic
--
like
most
absurdity
.
there
be
nothing


grimmer
than
the
tragedy
that
wear
a
comic
mask
....
where
be
he
?


oh
--
the
reason
they
chuck
sicily
and
rush
back
?
well
--
partly
,
no


doubt
,
Miss
Bart
's
desire
to
get
back
to
bridge
and
smartness
.
dead
as
a


stone

art
and
poetry

the
light
never

she

and


of
course
she
persuade
Dorset
that
the
italian
food
be
bad
for
he
.
oh
,


she
could
make
he

anything

anything

Mrs.
Dorset
be
aware
of


it
--
oh
,
perfectly
:
nothing
she
do
n't

but
she
could
hold
she


tongue

she'd
have
to

often
enough
.
Miss
Bart

intimate

she


would

plunge
across
the

Selden
to
a
meditative


cigar

the
conclusion
it
lead
he
to
be
fortify
,
later
in
the
evening
,
by


some
of
those
faint
corroborative
hint
that
generate
a
light
of
their


own
in
the
dusk
of
a
doubt
mind
.
Selden
,
stumble
on
a
chance


acquaintance
,
have
dine
with
he
,
and
adjourn
,
still
in
his
company
,
to


the
brightly
light
Promenade

of
crowded
stand

of

Overhead

a
summer
sky
furrow
with
the
rush
of
rocket
;
and
from


the
east
a
late
moon
,
push
up
beyond
the
lofty
bend
of
the
coast
,
send


across
the
bay
a
shaft
of
brightness

snatch
of

above
the
hum
of
the
crowd
and
the
soft


tossing
of
bough
in
dusky
garden
;
and
between
these
garden
and
the


back
of
the
stand
there
flow
a
stream
of
people
in
whom
the


vociferous
carnival
mood
seem
temper
by
the
grow
languor
of
the


season

Selden

his
companion
,
unable
to
get
seat
on
one
of
the
stand

the
bay
,
have
wander
for
a
while
with
the
throng

then
find
a
point


of
vantage
on
a
high
garden
-
parapet
above
the
Promenade
.
 
thence
they


catch
but
a
triangular
glimpse
of
the
water
,
and
of
the
flash
play
of


boat
across
its
surface
;
but
the
crowd
in
the
street
be
under
their


immediate
view
,
and
seem
to
Selden
,
on
the
whole
,
of
more
interest
than


the
show
itself
.
after
a
while
,
however
,
he
weary
of
his
perch
and
,


drop
alone
to
the
pavement
,
push
his
way
to
the
first
corner
and


turn
into
the
moonlit
silence
of
a
side

by

a
dark
boundary

an
empty
cab

along
the
deserted
thoroughfare
,

presently
Selden
see
two

emerge
from
the
opposite
shadow
,
signal
to
the
cab
,
and
drive


off
in
it

the

touch
they

it

as


they
have
breakfast
.
supply
with
these
fact
,
Lily
lean
awhile
over


the
side
,
give
herself
up
to
a
leisurely
enjoyment
of
the
spectacle


before
she
.
unclouded
sunlight
envelop
sea
and
shore
in
a
bath
of


pure
radiancy
.
the
purpling
water
draw
a
sharp
white
line
of
foam
at


the
base
of
the
shore
;
against
its
irregular
eminence
,
hotel
and
villa


flash
from
the
greyish
verdure
of
olive
and
eucalyptus
;
and
the


background
of
bare
and
finely
-
pencil
mountain
quiver
in
a
pale


intensity
of
light
.






how
beautiful
it
be
--
and
how
she
love
beauty
!
she
have
always
feel
that


her
sensibility
in
this
direction
make
up
for
certain
obtuseness
of


feeling
of
which
she
be
less
proud
;
and
during
the
last
three
month
she


have
indulge
it
passionately
.
the
dorset
'
invitation
to
go
abroad
with


they
have
come
as
an
almost
miraculous
release
from
crush
difficulty
;


and
her
faculty
for
renew
herself
in
new
scene
,
and
cast
off


problem
of
conduct
as
easily
as
the
surrounding
in
which
they
have


arise
,
make
the
mere
change
from
one
place
to
another
seem
,
not
merely
a


postponement
,
but
a
solution
of
her
trouble
.
moral
complication
exist


for
she
only
in
the
environment
that
have
produce
they
;
she
do
not
mean


to
slight
or
ignore
they
,
but
they
lose
their
reality
when
they
change


their
background
.
she
could
not
have
remain
in
New
York
without


repay
the
money
she
owe
to
Trenor
;
to
acquit
herself
of
that
odious


debt
she
might
even
have
face
a
marriage
with
Rosedale
;
but
the
accident


of
place
the
Atlantic
between
herself
and
her
obligation
make
they


dwindle
out
of
sight
as
if
they
have
be
milestone
and
she
have
travel


past
they
.




her
two
month
on
the
Sabrina
have
be
especially
calculate
to
aid
this


illusion
of
distance
.
she
have
be
plunge
into
new
scene
,
and
have
find


in
they
a
renewal
of
old
hope
and
ambition
.
the
cruise
itself
charm


she
as
a
romantic
adventure
.
 
she
be
vaguely
touch
by
the
name
and


scene
amid
which
she
move
,
and
have
listen
to
Ned
Silverton
read


theocritus
by
moonlight
,
as
the
yacht
round
the
sicilian
promontory
,


with
a
thrill
of
the
nerve
that
confirm
her
belief
in
her
intellectual


superiority
.
but
the
week
at
Cannes
and
Nice
have
really
give
she
more


pleasure
.
the
gratification
of
be
welcome
in
high
company
,
and
of


make
she
own
ascendency
feel
there
,
so
that
she
find
herself
figure


once
more
as
the
"
beautiful
Miss
Bart
"
in
the
interesting
journal
devote


to
record
the
least
movement
of
her
cosmopolitan
companion
--
all


these
experience
tend
to
throw
into
the
extreme
background
of
memory


the
prosaic
and
sordid
difficulty
from
which
she
have
escape
.




if
she
be
faintly
aware
of
fresh
difficulty
ahead
,
she
be
sure
of
she


ability
to
meet
they
:
it
be
characteristic
of
she
to
feel
that
the
only


problem
she
could
not
solve
be
those
with
which
she
be
familiar
.


meanwhile
she
could
honestly
be
proud
of
the
skill
with
which
she
have


adapt
herself
to
somewhat
delicate
condition
.
she
have
reason
to
think


that
she
have
make
herself
equally
necessary
to
her
host
and
hostess
;
and


if
only
she
have
see
any
perfectly
irreproachable
mean
of
draw
a


financial
profit
from
the
situation
,
there
would
have
be
no
cloud
on


her
horizon
.
the
truth
be
that
her
fund
,
as
usual
,
be
inconveniently


low
;
and
to
neither
Dorset
nor
his
wife
could
this
vulgar
embarrassment


be
safely
hint
.
still
,
the
need
be
not
a
press
one
;
she
could
worry


along
,
as
she
have
so
often
do
before
,
with
the
hope
of
some
happy


change
of
fortune
to
sustain
she
;
and
meanwhile
life
be
gay
and


beautiful
and
easy
,
and
she
be
conscious
of
figure
not
unworthily
in


such
a
setting
.




she
be
engage
to
breakfast
that
morning
with
the
Duchess
of
Beltshire
,


and
at
twelve
o'clock
she
ask
to
be
set
ashore
in
the
gig
.
 
before
this


she
have
send
she
maid
to
enquire
if
she
might
see
Mrs.
Dorset
;
but
the


reply
come
back
that
the
latter
be
tired
,
and
try
to
sleep
.
lily


think
she
understand
the
reason
of
the
rebuff
.
her
hostess
have
not
be


include
in
the
Duchess
's
invitation
,
though
she
herself
have
make
the


most
loyal
effort
in
that
direction
.
but
her
grace
be
impervious
to


hint
,
and
invite
or
omit
as
she
choose
.
it
be
not
Lily
's
fault
if


Mrs.
Dorset
's
complicated
attitude
do
not
fall
in
with
the
Duchess
's


easy
gait
.
the
Duchess
,
who
seldom
explain
herself
,
have
not
formulate


her
objection
beyond
say
:
"
she
be
rather
a
bore
,
you
know
.
the
only
one


of
your
friend

like
be
that
little
Mr.
Bry
--
HE
be
funny--
"
but
Lily


know
enough
not
to
press
the
point
,
and
be
not
altogether
sorry
to
be


thus
distinguish
at
her
friend
's
expense
.
Bertha
certainly
have
grow


tiresome
since
she
have
take
to
poetry
and
Ned
Silverton
.




on
the
whole
,
it
be
a
relief
to
break
away
now
and
then
from
the


Sabrina
;
and
the
Duchess

little
breakfast
,

Lord
Hubert


with
all
his
usual
virtuosity

the
pleasanter
to
Lily
for
not

her
travel

.
dorset
,
of
late
,
have
grow
more
than


usually
morose
and
incalculable
,
and
Ned
Silverton
go
about
with
an
air


that
seem
to
challenge
the
universe
.
the
freedom
and
lightness
of
the


ducal
intercourse
make
an
agreeable
change
from
these
complication
,
and


Lily
be
tempt
,
after
luncheon
,
to
adjourn
in
the
wake
of
she


companion
to
the
hectic
atmosphere
of
the
Casino
.
she
do
not
mean
to


play
;
her
diminish
pocket

money
offer
small
scope
for
the
adventure
;


but
it
amuse
she
to
sit
on
a
divan
,
under
the
doubtful
protection
of
the


duchess
's
back
,
while
the
latter
hang
above
her
stake
at
a
neighbouring


table
.




the
room
be
pack
with
the
gaze
throng
which
,
in
the
afternoon


hour
,
trickle
heavily
between
the
table

Sunday

stagnant
flow
of
the
mass

Lily
presently
see
Mrs.
Bry
cleave
she
determined


way
through
the
door
,

,
in
the
broad
wake
she
leave
,
the
light
figure


of
Mrs.

bob
after
she
like
a
row

at
the
stern
of
a
tug

Mrs.

on

animate
by
the
resolve

echo
the

an
indifferent

the
step
of

down
to
the

now
have
the
immediate
impression

something
more
be
to
happen


first
.

way

the


second
question
before

answer
,

not
wait
for
a


reply
to
either
before
he
direct
she
silently
toward
the
comparative


seclusion
of
the
low
garden
.




she
detect
in
he
at
once
all
the
sign
of
extreme
nervous
tension

skin

puff
out
under
his
sink
eye
,
and
its
sallowness
have


pale
to
a
leaden
white
against
which
his
irregular
eyebrow
and
long


reddish
moustache
be
relieve
with
a
saturnine
effect
.
his
appearance

in
short
,

an
odd
mixture

the
bedraggle

the
ferocious

silence

quick
precipitate
step

reach
the
embower
slope
to
the
east
of
the
Casino

up


abruptly

this

a
laugh

the
whir
sound
in
a
disabled


clock
.

at
once
how
little
even
this
necessity


account
for
the
fatal
lapse
of
hour

know--

the
explanatory
note
make
it
almost
seem
as
though
he
be


put
the
case
for
his
wife--"and

the
more
earnestness

pause

take
this
in

only
possible
way

a
laugh

treatment

sudden


grimness

disconcert
by
the
abrupt
change
in
his
tone

as
in


one
flash
she

the
peril
of
the
moment

the
fatigue
which

off
by
this
time

she
clung
to
the
note
bravely
,
though
its
futility
be
now
plain
to
she


in
the
glare
of
his
miserable
eye
.




"

"
he
break
out
,
with
the
hurt
cry
of
a
child
;
and
while


she
try
to
merge
her
sympathy
,

her
resolve
to
ignore
any
cause
for


it

in
one
ambiguous
murmur
of
deprecation
,
he
drop
down
on
the
bench


near
which
they
have
pause
,
and
pour
out
the
wretchedness
of
his
soul
.




it
be
a
dreadful
hour
--
an
hour
from
which
she
emerge
shrink
and


sear
,
as
though
her
lid
have
be
scorch
by
its
actual
glare
.
it
be


not
that
she
have
never
have
premonitory
glimpse
of
such
an
outbreak
;
but


rather
because
,
here
and
there
throughout
the
three
month
,
the
surface


of
life
have
show
such
ominous
crack
and
vapour
that
her
fear
have


always
be
on
the
alert
for
an
upheaval
.
there
have
be
moment
when
the


situation
have
present
itself
under
a
homely
yet
more
vivid


image
--
that
of
a
shaky
vehicle
,
dash
by
unbroken
steed
over
a
bumping


road
,
while
she
cower
within
,
aware
that
the
harness
want
mending
,


and
wonder
what
would
give
way
first
.
 
well
--
everything
have
give
way


now
;
and
the
wonder
be
that
the
crazy
outfit
have
hold
together
so
long
.


her
sense
of
be
involve
in
the
crash
,
instead
of
merely
witness
it


from
the
road
,

intensify
by
the
way
in
which
Dorset
,
through
his


fury
of
denunciation
and
wild
reaction
of
self
-
contempt
,
make
she
feel


the
need
he
have
of
she
,
the
place
she
have
take
in
his
life
.

for
she
,


what
ear
would
have
be
open
to
his
cry
?
 
and
what
hand
but
hers
could


drag
he
up
again
to
a
footing
of
sanity
and
self
-
respect

all
through


the
stress
of
the
struggle
with
he

be
conscious
of
something


faintly
maternal
in
her
effort

for
the

to
she

it
be
not

drag
up

to


feel
some
one
flounder
in
the
depth
with
he

he
want
she
to
suffer


with
he
,
not
to
help
he
to
suffer
less

happily
for
both
,
there
be
little
physical
strength
to
sustain
his


frenzy
.
it
leave
he
,
collapse
and
breathe
heavily
,
to
an
apathy
so


deep
and
prolong

Lily

fear
the

think
it


the
result

their

but
Monte

all

the
one
where
the
human
bond
be

close

the

on
the


couple

no
intrusive

disturb
they

the

sweep

she

;
we
'll
put
it
off
till
nine
if
you


like
.
"




it
be
past
four
already
;
and
when
a
cab
have
drop
she
at
the
quay
,
and


she
stand
wait
for
the
gig
to
put
off
for
she
,
she
begin
to
wonder


what
have
be
happen
on
the
yacht
.
of
Silverton
's
whereabouts
there


have
be
no
mention
.
have
he
return
to
the
Sabrina
?
or
could
Bertha
--
the


dread
alternative
spring
on
she
suddenly
--
could
Bertha
,
leave
to
herself
,


have
go
ashore
to
rejoin
he
?
Lily
's
heart
stand
still
at
the
thought
.


all
her
concern
have
hitherto
be
for
young
Silverton
,
not
only
because
,


in
such
affair
,
the
woman
's
instinct
be
to
side
with
the
man
,
but


because
his
case
make
a
peculiar
appeal
to
her
sympathy
.
he
be
so


desperately
in
earnest
,
poor
youth
,
and
his
earnestness
be
of
so


different
a
quality
from
Bertha
's
,
though
hers
too
be
desperate
enough
.


the
difference
be
that
Bertha
be
in
earnest
only
about
herself
,
while


he
be
in
earnest
about
she
.
 
but
now
,
at
the
actual
crisis
,
this


difference
seem
to
throw
the
weight
of
destitution
on
Bertha
's
side
,


since
at
least
he
have
she
to
suffer
for
,
and
she
have
only
herself
.
at
any


rate
,
view
less
ideally
,
all
the
disadvantage
of
such
a
situation
be


for
the
woman
;
and
it
be
to
Bertha
that
Lily
's
sympathy
now
go
out
.


she
be
not
fond
of
Bertha
Dorset
,
but
neither
be
she
without
a
sense
of


obligation
,
the
heavy
for
have
so
little
personal
liking
to
sustain


it
.
Bertha
have
be
kind
to
she
,
they
have
live
together
,
during
the
last


month
,
on
term
of
easy
friendship
,
and
the
sense
of
friction
of
which


Lily
have
recently
become
aware
seem
to
make
it
the
more
urgent
that
she


should
work
undividedly
in
her
friend
's
interest
.




it
be
in
Bertha
's
interest
,
certainly
,
that
she
have
despatch
Dorset
to


consult
with
Lawrence
Selden
.
once
the
grotesqueness
of
the
situation


accept
,
she
have
see
at
a
glance
that
it
be
the
safe
in
which
dorset


could
find
himself
.
who
but
Selden
could
thus
miraculously
combine
the


skill
to
save
Bertha
with
the
obligation
of
do
so
?
the
consciousness


that
much
skill
would
be
require
make
Lily
rest
thankfully
in
the


greatness
of
the
obligation
.
since
he
would
have
to
pull
Bertha
through


she
could
trust
he
to
find
a
way
;
and
she
put
the
fulness
of
her
trust


in
the
telegram
she
manage
to
send
he
on
her
way
to
the
quay
.




thus
far
,
then
,
Lily
feel
that
she
have
do
well
;
and
the
conviction


strengthen
she
for
the
task
that
remain
.
she
and
Bertha
have
never


be
on
confidential
term
,
but
at
such
a
crisis
the
barrier
of
reserve


must
surely
fall
:
Dorset
's
wild
allusion
to
the
scene
of
the
morning


make
Lily
feel
that
they
be
down
already
,
and
that
any
attempt
to


rebuild
they
would
be
beyond
Bertha
's
strength
.
she
picture
the
poor


creature
shiver
behind
her
fall
defence
and
await
with
suspense


the
moment
when
she
could
take
refuge
in
the
first
shelter
that
offer
.


if
only
that
shelter
have
not
already
offer
itself
elsewhere
!
as
the
gig


traverse
the
short
distance
between
the
quay
and
the
yacht
,
Lily
grow


more
than
ever
alarm
at
the
possible
consequence
of
her
long
absence
.


what
if
the
wretched
Bertha
,
find
in
all
the
long
hour
no
soul
to


turn
to
--
but
by
this
time
Lily
's
eager
foot
be
on
the
side
-
ladder
,
and


her
first
step
on
the
Sabrina
show
the
bad
of
her
apprehension
to
be


unfounded
;
for
there
,
in
the
luxurious
shade
of
the
after
-
deck
,
the


wretche
Bertha
,
in
full
command
of
her
usual
attenuate
elegance
,
sit


dispense
tea
to
the
Duchess
of
Beltshire
and
Lord
Hubert
.




the
sight
fill
Lily
with
such
surprise
that
she
feel
that
Bertha
,
at


least
,
must
read
its
meaning
in
her
look
,
and
she
be
proportionately


disconcert
by
the
blankness
of
the
look
return
.
but
in
an
instant
she


see
that
Mrs.
Dorset
have
,
of
necessity
,
to
look
blank
before
the
other
,


and
that
,
to
mitigate
the
effect
of
her
own
surprise
,
she
must
at
once


produce
some
simple
reason
for
it
.
the
long
habit
of
rapid
transition


make
it
easy
for
she
to
exclaim
to
the
duchess
:
"
why
,
I
think
you
'd


go
back
to
the
Princess
!
"
and
this
suffice
for
the
lady
she
address
,


if
it
be
hardly
enough
for
Lord
Hubert
.




at
least
it
open
the
way
to
a
lively
explanation
of
how
the
Duchess


be
,
in
fact
,
go
back
the
next
moment
,
but
have
first
rush
out
to
the


yacht
for
a
word
with
Mrs.
Dorset
on
the
subject
of
tomorrow
's


dinner
--
the
dinner
with
the
Brys
,
to
which
Lord
Hubert
have
finally


insist
on
drag
they
.




"
to
save
my
neck
,
you
know
!
"
he
explain
,
with
a
glance
that
appeal
to


lily
for
some
recognition
of
his
promptness
;
and
the
Duchess
add
,
with


her
noble
candour
:
"
Mr.
Bry
have
promise
he
a
tip
,
and
he
say
if
we
go


he
'll
pass
it
onto
we
.
"




this
lead
to
some
final
pleasantry
,
in
which
,
as
it
seem
to
Lily
,
Mrs.


dorset
bear
her
part
with
astounding
bravery
,
and
at
the
close
of
which


Lord
Hubert
,
from
half
way
down
the
side
-
ladder
,
call
back
,
with
an
air


of
number
head
:
"
and
of
course
we
may
count
on
Dorset
too
?
"




"
oh
,
count
on
he
,
"
his
wife
assent
gaily
.
she
be
keep
up
well
to


the
last
--
but
as
she
turn
back
from
wave
her
adieu
over
the
side
,


Lily
say
to
herself
that
the
mask
must
drop
and
the
soul
of
fear
look


out
.




Mrs.
Dorset
turn
back
slowly
;
perhaps
she
want
time
to
steady
she


muscle
;
at
any
rate
,
they
be
still
under
perfect
control
when
,


drop
once
more
into
her
seat
behind
the
tea
-
table
,
she
remark
to


Miss
Bart
with
a
faint
touch
of
irony
:
"
I
suppose
I
ought
to
say
good


morning
.
"




if
it
be
a
cue
,
Lily
be
ready
to
take
it
,
though
with
only
the
vague


sense
of
what
be
expect
of
she
in
return
.
there
be
something


unnerve
in
the
contemplation
of
Mrs.
Dorset
's
composure
,
and
she
have
to


force
the
light
tone
in
which
she
answer
:
"
I
try
to
see
you
this


morning

not
yet
up

"
no

I
get
to
bed
late
.
after
we
miss
you

the
station

she
speak
very
gently
,
but


with
just
the
least
tinge
of
reproach
.




"

"
now
indeed
Lily
be


too
far
adrift
in
bewilderment
to
measure
the
other
's
word

Mrs.

this
with
the


immediate
query

conjecture

Miss

's
telegram
catch
Lawrence
Selden
at
the
door
of
his
hotel
;
and


having
read
it
,
he
turn
back
to
wait
for
Dorset
.
the
message


necessarily
leave
large
gap
for
conjecture
;
but
all
that
he
have
recently


hear
and
see
make
these
but
too
easy
to
fill
in
.
on
the
whole
he
be


surprised
;
for
though
he
have
perceive
that
the
situation
contain
all


the
element
of
an
explosion
,
he
have
often
enough
,
in
the
range
of
his


personal
experience
,
see
just
such
combination
subside
into


harmlessness
.
still
,
Dorset
's
spasmodic
temper
,
and
his
wife
's
reckless


disregard
of
appearance
,
give
the
situation
a
peculiar
insecurity
;
and


it
be
less
from
the
sense
of
any
special
relation
to
the
case
than
from


a
purely
professional
zeal
,
that
Selden
resolve
to
guide
the
pair
to


safety
.
whether
,
in
the
present
instance
,
safety
for
either
lie
in


repair
so
damage
a
tie
,
it
be
no
business
of
his
to
consider
:
he
have


only
,
on
general
principle
,
to
think
of
avert
a
scandal
,
and
his


desire
to
avert
it
be
increase
by
his
fear
of
its
involve
Miss
Bart
.


there
be
nothing
specific
in
this
apprehension
;
he
merely
wish
to


spare
she
the
embarrassment
of
be
ever
so
remotely
connect
with
the


public
washing
of
the
Dorset
linen
.




how
exhaustive
and
unpleasant
such
a
process
would
be
,
he
see
even
more


vividly
after
his
two
hour
'
talk
with
poor
Dorset
.
if
anything
come
out


at
all
,
it
would
be
such
a
vast
unpacking
of
accumulate
moral
rag
as


leave
he
,
after
his
visitor
have
go
,
with
the
feeling
that
he
must
fling


open
the
window
and
have
his
room
sweep
out
.
but
nothing
should
come


out
;
and
happily
for
his
side
of
the
case
,
the
dirty
rag
,
however
piece


together
,
could
not
,
without
considerable
difficulty
,
be
turn
into
a


homogeneous
grievance
.
the
tear
edge
do
not
always
fit
--
there
be


miss
bit
,
there
be
disparity
of
size
and
colour
,
all
of
which
it


be
naturally
Selden
's
business
to
make
the
most
of
in
put
they
under


his
client
's
eye
.
but
to
a
man
in
Dorset
's
mood
the
complete


demonstration
could
not
carry
conviction
,
and
Selden
see
that
for
the


moment
all
he
could
do
be
to
soothe
and
temporize
,
to
offer
sympathy
and


to
counsel
prudence
.
he
let
Dorset
depart
charge
to
the
brim
with
the


sense
that
,
till
their
next
meeting
,
he
must
maintain
a
strictly


noncommittal
attitude
;
that
,
in
short
,
his
share
in
the
game
consist


for
the
present
in
look
on
.
Selden
know
,
however
,
that
he
could
not


long
keep
such
violence
in
equilibrium
;
and
he
promise
to
meet
Dorset
,


the
next
morning
,
at
an
hotel
in
Monte
Carlo
.
meanwhile
he
count
not
a


little
on
the
reaction
of
weakness
and
self
-
distrust
that
,
in
such


nature
,
follow
on
every
unwonted
expenditure
of
moral
force
;
and
his


telegraphic
reply
to
Miss
Bart
consist
simply
in
the
injunction
:


"
assume
that
everything
be
as
usual
.
"




on
this
assumption
,
in
fact
,
the
early
part
of
the
follow
day
be


live
through

dorset
,
as
if
in
obedience
to
Lily
's
imperative
bidding
,


have
actually
return
in
time
for
a
late
dinner
on
the
yacht
.
the
repast


have
be
the
most
difficult
moment
of
the
day
.
Dorset
be
sink
in
one
of


the
abysmal
silence
which
so
commonly
follow
on
what
his
wife
call


his
"
attack
"
that
it
be
easy
,
before
the
servant
,
to
refer
it
to
this


cause
;
but
Bertha
herself
seem
,
perversely
enough
,
little
disposed
to


make
use
of
this
obvious
mean
of
protection
.
she
simply
leave
the
brunt


of
the
situation
on
her
husband
's
hand
,
as
if
too
absorb
in
a


grievance
of
her
own
to
suspect
that
she
might
be
the
object
of
one


herself

to
Lily
this
attitude
be
the
most
ominous
,
because
the
most


perplexing
,
element
in
the
situation

she
try
to
fan
the
weak


flicker
of
talk
,
to
build
up
,
again
and
again
,

crumble
structure
of


"
appearance

"
her
own
attention

by
the


question
:
"
what
on
earth
can
she
be
drive
at
?
"
there
be
something


positively
exasperate
in
Bertha

attitude
of
isolated
defiance
.
if


only
she
would
have
give
her
friend
a
hint
they
might
still
have
work


together
successfully
;
but
how
could
Lily
be
of
use
,
while
she
be
thus


obstinately
shut
out
from
participation

to
be
of
use

what
she


honestly
want

for
the
dorset

not

in

to
put
a
little
order
in
theirs
.
but
the
close
of
the
short
dreary


evening
leave
she
with
a
sense
of
effort
hopelessly
waste
.
she
have
not


try
to
see
Dorset
alone
:
she
have
positively
shrink
from
a
renewal
of


his
confidence
.
it
be
Bertha
whose
confidence
she
seek

who


should

eagerly
have
invite

seem
part
of
the
general
mystery
in
which
she
move
that
more
than
an


hour
should
elapse
before
she
hear
Bertha
walk
down
the
silent
passage


and
regain
her
room
.
the
morrow
,

on
an
apparent
continuance
of
the

condition
,

nothing
of
what

occur
between
the


confront

fact
alone
outwardly
proclaim
the
change
they
be


all
conspire
to
ignore
;
and
that
be
the
non

appearance
of
Ned

.
no
one
refer
to
it
,
and
this
tacit
avoidance
of
the
subject


keep
it
in
the
immediate
foreground
of
consciousness
.
but
there
be


another
change
,
perceptible
only
to
Lily
;
and
that
be
that
Dorset
now


avoid
she
almost
as
pointedly
as
his
wife
.
perhaps
he
be
repent
his


rash
outpouring
of
the
previous
day
;
perhaps
only
try
,
in
his
clumsy


way
,
to
conform
to
Selden
's
counsel
to
behave
"
as
usual
.
"
such


instruction
no
more
make
for
easiness
of
attitude
than
the


photographer
's
behest
to
"
look
natural
"
;
and
in
a
creature
as
unconscious


as
poor
Dorset
of
the
appearance
he
habitually
present
,
the
struggle
to


maintain
a
pose
be
sure
to
result
in
queer
contortion
.




it
result
,
at
any
rate
,
in
throw
Lily
strangely
on
her
own


resource
.
she
have
learn
,
on
leave
her
room
,
that
Mrs.
Dorset
be


still
invisible
,
and
that
Dorset
have
leave
the
yacht
early
;
and
feel


too
restless
to
remain
alone
,
she
too

herself
ferry
ashore
.


stray
toward
the
Casino
,
she
attach
herself
to
a
group
of


acquaintance
from
Nice
,
with
whom
she
lunch
,
and
in
whose
company
she


be
return
to
the
room
when
she
encounter
Selden
cross
the


square
.
she
could
not
,
at
the
moment
,
separate
herself
definitely
from


her
party
,
who
have
hospitably
assume
that
she
would
remain
with
they


till
they
take
their
departure
;
but
she
find
time
for
a
momentary
pause


of
enquiry
,
to
which
he
promptly
return
:
"
I
've
see
he
again
--
he
be


just
leave
I
.
"




she
wait
before
he
anxiously
.
"
well
?
what
have
happen
?
what
will


happen
?
"




"
nothing
as
yet
--
and
nothing
in
the
future
,
I
think
.
"




"
it
be
over
,
then
?
it
be
settle
?
you
be
sure
?
"




he
smile
.
"
give
I
time
.
I
be
not
sure
--
but
I
be
a
good
deal
surer
.
"
and


with
that
she
have
to
content
herself
,
and
hasten
on
to
the
expectant


group
on
the
step
.




Selden
have
in
fact
give
she
the
utmost
measure
of
his
sureness
,
have
even


stretch
it
a
shade
to
meet
the
anxiety
in
her
eye
.
 
and
now
,
as
he


turn
away
,
stroll
down
the
hill
toward
the
station
,
that
anxiety


remain
with
he
as
the
visible
justification
of
his
own
.
it
be
not
,


indeed
,
anything
specific
that
he
fear
:
there
have
be
a
literal
truth


in
his
declaration
that
he
do
not
think
anything
would
happen
.
what


trouble
he
be
that
,
though
Dorset
's
attitude
have
perceptibly
change
,


the
change
be
not
clearly
to
be
account
for
.
it
have
certainly
not
be


produce
by
Selden
's
argument
,
or
by
the
action
of
his
own
soberer


reason
.
five
minute
'
talk
suffice
to
show
that
some
alien
influence
have


be
at
work
,
and
that
it
have
not
so
much
subdue
his
resentment
as


weaken
his
will
,
so
that
he
move
under
it
in
a
state
of
apathy
,
like
a


dangerous
lunatic
who
have
be
drug
.
 
temporarily
,
no
doubt
,
however


exert
,
it
work
for
the
general
safety
:
the
question
be
how
long
it


would
last
,
and
by
what
kind
of
reaction
it
be
likely
to
be
follow
.
on


these
point
Selden
could
gain
no
light
;
for
he
see
that
one
effect
of


the
transformation
have
be
to
shut
he
off
from
free
communion
with


dorset
.
the
latter
,
indeed
,
be
still
move
by
the
irresistible
desire
to


discuss
his
wrong
;
but
,
though
he
revolve
about
it
with
the
same
forlorn


tenacity
,
Selden
be
aware
that
something
always
restrain
he
from
full


expression
.
his
state
be
one
to
produce
first
weariness
and
then


impatience
in
his
hearer
;
and
when
their
talk
be
over
,
Selden
begin
to


feel
that
he
have
do
his
utmost
,
and
might
justifiably
wash
his
hand
of


the
sequel
.




it
be
in
this
mind
that
he
have
be
make
his
way
back
to
the
station


when
Miss
Bart
cross
his
path
;
but
though
,
after
his
brief
word
with


she
,
he
keep
mechanically
on
his
course
,
he
be
conscious
of
a
gradual


change
in
his
purpose
.
the
change
have
be
produce
by
the
look
in
she


eye
;
and
in
his
eagerness
to
define
the
nature
of
that
look
,
he
drop


into
a
seat
in
the
garden
,
and
sat
brood
upon
the
question
.
 
it
be


natural
enough
,
in
all
conscience
,
that
she
should
appear
anxious
:
a


young
woman
place
,
in
the
close
intimacy
of
a
yachting
-
cruise
,
between
a


couple
on
the
verge
of
disaster
,
could
hardly
,
aside
from
her
concern
for


her
friend
,
be
insensible
to
the
awkwardness
of
her
own
position
.
the


bad
of
it
be
that
,
in
interpret
Miss
Bart
's
state
of
mind
,
so
many


alternative
reading
be
possible
;
and
one
of
these
,
in
Selden
's


troubled
mind
,
take
the
ugly
form
suggest
by
Mrs.
Fisher
.
if
the
girl


be
afraid
,
be
she
afraid
for
herself
or
for
her
friend
?
and
to
what


degree
be
her
dread
of
a
catastrophe
intensify
by
the
sense
of
be


fatally
involve
in
it
?
the
burden
of
offence
lie
manifestly
with
Mrs.


dorset
,
this
conjecture
seem
on
the
face
of
it
gratuitously
unkind
;
but


Selden
know
that
in
the
most
one
-
sided
matrimonial
quarrel
there
be


generally
counter
-
charge
to
be
bring
,
and
that
they
be
bring
with


the
great
audacity
where
the
original
grievance
be
so
emphatic
.
Mrs.


Fisher
have
not
hesitate
to
suggest
the
likelihood
of
Dorset
's
marrying


Miss
Bart
if
"
anything
happen
"
;
and
though
Mrs.
Fisher
's
conclusion


be
notoriously
rash
,
she
be
shrewd
enough
in
read
the
sign
from


which
they
be
draw
.
Dorset
have
apparently
show
mark
interest
in
the


girl
,
and
this
interest
might
be
use
to
cruel
advantage
in
his
wife
's


struggle
for
rehabilitation
.
Selden
know
that
Bertha
would
fight
to
the


last
round
of
powder
:
the
rashness
of
her
conduct
be
illogically


combine
with
a
cold
determination
to
escape
its
consequence
.
she
could


be
as
unscrupulous
in
fight
for
herself
as
she
be
reckless
in


court
danger
,
and
whatever
come
to
her
hand
at
such
moment
be
likely


to
be
use
as
a
defensive
missile
.
he
do
not
,
as
yet
,
see
clearly
just


what
course
she
be
likely
to
take
,
but
his
perplexity
increase
his


apprehension
,
and
with
it
the
sense
that
,
before
leave
,
he
must
speak


again
with
Miss
Bart
.
whatever
her
share
in
the
situation
--
and
he
have


always
honestly
try
to
resist
judge
she
by
her
surrounding
--
however


free
she
might
be
from
any
personal
connection
with
it
,
she
would
be


well
out
of
the
way
of
a
possible
crash
;
and
since
she
have
appeal
to


he
for
help
,
it
be
clearly
his
business
to
tell
she
so
.




this
decision
at
last
bring
he
to
his
foot
,
and
carry
he
back
to


the
gambling
room
,
within
whose
door
he
have
see
she
disappear
;
but


a
prolong
exploration
of
the
crowd
fail
to
put
he
on
her
trace
.
he


see
instead
,
to
his
surprise
,
Ned
Silverton
loitering
somewhat


ostentatiously
about
the
table
;
and
the
discovery
that
this
actor
in
the


drama
be
not
only
hover
in
the
wing
,
but
actually
invite
the


exposure
of
the
footlight
,
though
it
might
have
seem
to
imply
that
all


peril
be
over
,
serve
rather
to
deepen
Selden
's
sense
of
foreboding
.


charge
with
this
impression
he
return
to
the
square
,
hope
to
see


Miss
Bart
move
across
it
,
as
every
one
in
Monte
Carlo
seem
inevitably


to
do
at
least
a
dozen
time
a
day
;
but
here
again
he
wait
vainly
for
a


glimpse
of
she
,
and
the
conclusion
be
slowly
force
on
he
that
she
have


go
back
to
the
Sabrina
.
it
would
be
difficult
to
follow
she
there
,
and


still
more
difficult
,
should
he
do
so
,
to
contrive
the
opportunity
for
a


private
word
;
and
he
have
almost
decide
on
the
unsatisfactory
alternative


of
writing
,
when
the
ceaseless
diorama
of
the
square
suddenly
unrolled


before
he
the
figure
of
Lord
Hubert
and
Mrs.
Bry
.




hail
they
at
once
with
his
question
,
he
learn
from
Lord
Hubert
that


Miss
Bart
have
just
return
to
the
Sabrina
in
Dorset
's
company
;
an


announcement
so
evidently
disconcert
to
he
that
Mrs.
Bry
,
after
a


glance
from
her
companion
,
which
seem
to
act
like
the
pressure
on
a


spring
,
bring
forth
the
prompt
proposal
that
he
should
come
and
meet


his
friend
at
dinner
that
evening--"at
Becassin's
--
a
little
dinner
to


the
duchess
,
"
she
flash
out
before
Lord
Hubert
have
time
to
remove
the


pressure
.




Selden
's
sense
of
the
privilege
of
be
include
in
such
company
bring


he
early
in
the
evening
to
the
door
of
the
restaurant
,
where
he
pause


to
scan
the
rank
of
diner
approach
down
the
brightly
light
terrace
.


there
,
while
the
Brys
hover
within
over
the
last
agitate
alternative


of
the
MENU
,
he
keep
watch
for
the
guest
from
the
Sabrina
,
who
at
length


rise
on
the
horizon
in
company
with
the
Duchess
,
Lord
and
Lady
Skiddaw


and
the
Stepneys
.
 
from
this
group
it
be
easy
for
he
to
detach
Miss


Bart
on
the
pretext
of
a
moment
's
glance
into
one
of
the
brilliant
shop


along
the
terrace
,
and
to
say
to
she
,
while
they
linger
together
in
the


white
dazzle
of
a
jeweller
's
window
:
"
I
stop
over
to
see
you
--
to
beg


of
you
to
leave
the
yacht
.
"




the
eye
she
turn
on
he
show
a
quick
gleam
of
her
former
fear
.
"
to


leave--

what

you

what

"




the
glare
from
the
jeweller
's
window
,
deepen
the
pallour
of
her
face
,


give
to
its
delicate
line
the
sharpness
of
a
tragic
mask

would
leave

"




the
word
ring
out
on
a
note
of
contempt
--
be
it
possibly
of
contempt
for


himself
?
well
,
he
be
willing
to
risk
its
renewal
to
the
extent
of


insist
,
with
an
undeniable
throb
of
add
interest
:

with
a

fall
of
sadness

he

more
for

reassurance


than
for
hers
;

"

course

she
valiantly
assent

new
gown

he
shrink
with


dyspeptic
dread
from
the
multiplied
solicitation
of
the

the

fact

that
her
opportunity
for
observation
have
be
ampler


than
his
own
.




meanwhile
,
as
the
dinner
advance
through
a
labyrinth
of
course
,
in


which
it
become
clear
that
Mrs.
Bry
have
occasionally
break
away
from


Lord
Hubert
's
restraining
hand
,
Selden
's
general
watchfulness
begin
to


lose
itself
in
a
particular
study
of
Miss
Bart
.
it
be
one
of
the
day


when
she
be
so
handsome
that
to
be
handsome
be
enough
,
and
all
the


rest
--
her
grace
,
her
quickness
,
her
social
felicity
--
seem
the


overflow
of
a
bounteous
nature
.
but
what
especially
strike
he
be
the


way
in
which
she
detach
herself
,
by
a
hundred
undefinable
shade
,
from


the
person
who
most
abound
in
her
own
style
.
it
be
in
just
such


company
,
the
fine
flower
and
complete
expression
of
the
state
she
aspire


to
,
that
the
difference
come
out
with
special
poignancy
,
her
grace


cheapen
the
other
woman
's
smartness
as
her
finely
-
discriminate


silence
make
their
chatter
dull
.
the
strain
of
the
last
hour
have


restore
to
her
face
the
deep
eloquence
which
Selden
have
lately
miss


in
it
,
and
the
bravery
of
her
word
to
he
still
flutter
in
her
voice


and
eye
.
yes
,
she
be
matchless
--
it
be
the
one
word
for
she
;
and
he


could
give
his
admiration
the
free
play
because
so
little
personal


feeling
remain
in
it
.
his
real
detachment
from
she
have
take
place
,
not


at
the
lurid
moment
of
disenchantment
,
but
now
,
in
the
sober
after
-
light


of
discrimination
,
where
he
see
she
definitely
divided
from
he
by
the


crudeness
of
a
choice
which
seem
to
deny
the
very
difference
he
feel


in
she
.
it
be
before
he
again
in
its
completeness
--
the
choice
in
which


she
be
content
to
rest
:
in
the
stupid
costliness
of
the
food
and
the


showy
dulness
of
the
talk
,
in
the
freedom
of
speech
which
never
arrive


at
wit
and
the
freedom
of
act
which
never
make
for
romance
.
the
strident


set
of
the
restaurant
,
in
which
their
table
seem
set
apart
in
a


special
glare
of
publicity
,
and
the
presence
at
it
of
little
Dabham
of


the
"
Riviera
Notes
,
"
emphasize
the
ideal
of
a
world
where


conspicuousness
pass
for
distinction
,
and
the
society
column
have
become


the
roll
of
fame
.




it
be
as
the
immortalizer
of
such
occasion
that
little
Dabham
,
wedge


in
modest
watchfulness
between
two
brilliant
neighbour
,
suddenly
become


the
centre
of
Selden
's
scrutiny
.
how
much
do
he
know
of
what
be
go


on
,
and
how
much
,
for
his
purpose
,
be
still
worth
find
out
?
his


little
eye
be
like
tentacle
throw
out
to
catch
the
float


intimation
with
which
,
to
Selden
,
the
air
at
moment
seem
thick
;
then


again
it
clear
to
its
normal
emptiness
,
and
he
could
see
nothing
in
it


for
the
journalist
but
leisure
to
note
the
elegance
of
the
lady
'
gown
.


Mrs.
Dorset
's
,
in
particular
,
challenge
all
the
wealth
of
Mr.
Dabham
's


vocabulary
:
it
have
surprise
and
subtlety
worthy
of
what
he
would
have


call
"
the
literary
style
.
"
at
first
,
as
Selden
have
notice
,
it
have
be


almost
too
preoccupying
to
its
wearer
;
but
now
she
be
in
full
command
of


it
,
and
be
even
produce
her
effect
with
unwonted
freedom
.
be
she


not
,
indeed
,
too
free
,
too
fluent
,
for
perfect
naturalness
?
and
be
not


dorset
,
to
whom
his
glance
have
pass
by
a
natural
transition
,
too


jerkily
waver
between
the
same
extreme
?
 
Dorset
indeed
be
always


jerky
;
but
it
seem
to
Selden
that
tonight
each
vibration
swing
he


far
from
his
centre
.




the
dinner
,
meanwhile
,
be
move
to
its
triumphant
close
,
to
the
evident


satisfaction
of
Mrs.
Bry
,
who
,
throne
in
apoplectic
majesty
between
Lord


Skiddaw
and
Lord
Hubert
,
seem
in
spirit
to
be
call
on
Mrs.
Fisher
to


witness
her
achievement
.
short
of
Mrs.
Fisher
her
audience
might
have


be
call
complete
;
for
the
restaurant
be
crowd
with
person
mainly


gather
there
for
the
purpose
of
spectatorship
,
and
accurately
post
as


to
the
name
and
face
of
the
celebrity
they
have
come
to
see
.
Mrs.
Bry
,


conscious
that
all
her
feminine
guest
come
under
that
heading
,
and
that


each
one
look
her
part
to
admiration
,
shine
on
Lily
with
all
the


pen
-
up
gratitude
that
Mrs.
Fisher
have
fail
to
deserve
.
Selden
,


catch
the
glance
,
wonder
what
part
Miss
Bart
have
play
in


organize
the
entertainment
.
she
do
,
at
least
,
a
great
deal
to
adorn


it
;
and
as
he
watch
the
bright
security
with
which
she
bear
herself
,
he


smile
to
think
that
he
should
have
fancy
she
in
need
of
help
.
never


have
she
appear
more
serenely
mistress
of
the
situation
than
when
,
at


the
moment
of
dispersal
,
detach
herself
a
little
from
the
group
about


the
table
,
she
turn
with
a
smile
and
a
graceful
slant
of
the
shoulder


to
receive
her
cloak
from
Dorset
.




the
dinner
have
be
protract
over
Mr.
Bry
's
exceptional
cigar
and
a


bewildering
array
of
liqueur
,
and
many
of
the
other
table
be
empty
;


but
a
sufficient
number
of
diner
still
linger
to
give
relief
to
the


leave
-
taking
of
Mrs.
Bry
's
distinguished
guest
.
this
ceremony
be
draw


out
and
complicate
by
the
fact
that
it
involve
,
on
the
part
of
the


Duchess
and
Lady
Skiddaw
,
definite
farewell
,
and
pledge
of
speedy


reunion
in
Paris
,
where
they
be
to
pause
and
replenish
their
wardrobe


on
the
way
to
England
.
the
quality
of
Mrs.
Bry
's
hospitality
,
and
of
the


tip
her
husband
have
presumably
impart
,
lend
to
the
manner
of
the


english
lady
a
general
effusiveness
which
shed
the
rosy
light
over


their
hostess
's
future
.
in
its
glow
Mrs.
Dorset
and
the
Stepneys
be


also
visibly
include
,
and
the
whole
scene
have
touch
of
intimacy
worth


their
weight
in
gold
to
the
watchful
pen
of
Mr.
Dabham
.




a
glance
at
her
watch
cause
the
Duchess
to
exclaim
to
her
sister
that


they
have
just
time
to
dash
for
their
train
,
and
the
flurry
of
this


departure
over
,
the
Stepneys
,
who
have
their
motor
at
the
door
,
offer
to


convey
the
dorset
and
Miss
Bart
to
the
quay
.
 
the
offer
be

and
Mrs.
Dorset
move
away
with
her
husband
in
attendance
.
 
Miss
Bart
have


linger
for
a
last
word
with
Lord
Hubert
,
and
Stepney
,
on
whom
Mr.
Bry

to
obey
;

as
she
do
so
,
Mrs.
Dorset
,
who
have
pause
on


her
way
out
,
move
a
few
step
back
toward
the
table
.




"
Miss
Bart

she
say
in
a
voice
of


singular
distinctness
.




a
startled
look

from
eye
to
eye

to
the

congestion

nervously

in
the
general
turmoil
of
his
sensation

mainly
conscious
of


a
longing
to

the
collar

during
this
brief
exchange
of
word
,

in
admirable


erectness

slightly
isolate
from
the
embarrassed

high
above

a
tentative
glance


from
one
to
another

she
read
their
incredulity

wretchedness
of

half

second

the
sky

gusty
and
overcast

as
Lily

Selden
move


toward
the
deserted
garden
below
the
restaurant
,
spurt
of
warm
rain


blow
fitfully
against
their
face

the
fiction
of
the
cab
have
be


tacitly
abandon

the
electric
lamp
at
the


bend
of
the
path
shed
a
gleam
on
the
struggle

her
face

Selden
sit
down
beside
she

wait
for
she
to
speak
,
fearful
lest
any


word
he
choose
should
touch
too
roughly
on
her
wound
,
and
keep
also
from


free
utterance
by
the
wretched
doubt

have
slowly
renew
itself


within

what

to
this
pass

what
weakness

place


she
so
abominably

why
should
Bertha

turn
into
an
enemy
at
the
very
moment

she
so
obviously
need
the


support
of
her
sex

even
while
his
nerve
rage
at
the
subjection
of


husband
to
their
wife
,
and
at
the
cruelty
of
woman
to
their
kind
,


reason
obstinately
harp
on
the
proverbial
relation
between
smoke
and


fire

the
memory
of
Mrs.
Fisher
's
hint
,

the
corroboration
of
his
own


impression
,
while
they
deepen
his
pity
also
increase
his
constraint
,


since
,
whichever
way
he
seek
a
free
outlet
for
sympathy
,
it
be
block


by
the
fear
of
commit
a
blunder
.




suddenly
it
strike
he
that

choose
to
pay
for
three
month
of
luxury
and
freedom
from
care

her


habit
of
resolutely
face
the
fact
,
in
her
rare
moment
of


introspection
,
do
not
now
allow
she
to
put
any
false
gloss
on
the


situation
.
she
have
suffer
for
the
very
faithfulness
with
which
she
have


carry
out
her
part
of
the
tacit
compact
,
but
the
part
be
not
a


handsome
one
at
good
,
and
she
see
it
now
in
all
the
ugliness
of
failure
.




she
see
,
too
,
in
the
same
uncompromising
light
,
the
train
of
consequence


result
from
that
failure
;
and
these
become
clear
to
she
with
every


day
of
her
weary
linger
in
town
.
she
stay
on
partly
for
the
comfort


of
Gerty
Farish
's
nearness
,
and
partly
for
lack
of
know
where
to
go
.


she
understand
well
enough
the
nature
of
the
task
before
she
.
she
must


set
out
to
regain
,
little
by
little
,
the
position
she
have
lose
;
and
the


first
step
in
the
tedious
task
be
to
find
out
,
as
soon
as
possible
,
on


how
many
of
her
friend
she
could
count
.
her
hope
be
mainly
centre
on


Mrs.
Trenor
,
who
have
treasure
of
easy
-
go
tolerance
for
those
who
be


amusing
or
useful
to
she
,
and
in
the
noisy
rush
of
whose
existence
the


still
small
voice
of
detraction
be
slow
to
make
itself
hear
.
but
Judy
,


though
she
must
have
be
apprise
of
Miss
Bart
's
return
,
have
not
even


recognize
it
by
the
formal
note
of
condolence
which
her
friend
's


bereavement
demand
.
 
any
advance
on
Lily
's
side
might
have
be


perilous
:
there
be
nothing
to
do
but
to
trust
to
the
happy
chance
of
an


accidental
meeting
,
and
Lily
know
that
,
even
so
late
in
the
season
,
there


be
always
a
hope
of
run
across
her
friend
in
their
frequent


passage
through

heightening
of
colour

Gerty
's
sense
of
the


fact
betray
itself
in
the
helpless
trepidation
of
her
manner

off

it
be
over
in
a
moment
--
the
waiter
,
MENU
in
hand
,
still
hang
on
the


result
of
the
choice
between
COUPE
JACQUES
and
PECHES
a
LA
MELBA
--
but


Miss
Bart
,
in
the
interval
,
have
take
the
measure
of
her
fate
.
where
Judy


trenor
lead
,
all
the
world
would
follow
;
and
Lily
have
the
doom
sense
of


the
castaway
who
have
signal
in
vain
to
flee
sail
.




in
a
flash
she
remember
Mrs.
Trenor
's
complaint
of
Carry
Fisher
's


rapacity
,
and
see
that
they
denote
an
unexpected
acquaintance
with
she


husband
's
private
affair
.
in
the
large
tumultuous
disorder
of
the
life


at
Bellomont
,
where
no
one
seem
to
have
time
to
observe
any
one
else
,


and
private
aim
and
personal
interest
be
sweep
along
unheeded
in
the


rush
of
collective
activity
,
Lily
have
fancy
herself
shelter
from


inconvenient
scrutiny
;
but
if
Judy
know
when
Mrs.
Fisher
borrow
money


of
her
husband
,
be
she
likely
to
ignore
the
same
transaction
on
Lily
's


part
?
if
she
be
careless
of
his
affection
she
be
plainly
jealous
of


his
pocket
;
and
in
that
fact
Lily
read
the
explanation
of
her
rebuff
.
the


immediate
result
of
these
conclusion
be
the
passionate
resolve
to
pay


back
her
debt
to
Trenor
.
that
obligation
discharge
,
she
would
have
but
a


thousand
dollar
of
Mrs.
Peniston
's
legacy
leave
,
and
nothing
to
live
on


but
her
own
small
income
,
which
be
considerably
less
than
Gerty
Farish
's


wretched
pittance
;
but
this
consideration
give
way
to
the
imperative


claim
of
her
wound
pride
.
 
she
must
be
quit
with
the
Trenors
first
;


after
that
she
would
take
thought
for
the
future
.




in
her
ignorance
of
legal
procrastination
she
have
suppose
that
she


legacy
would
be
pay
over
within
a
few
day
of
the
reading
of
her
aunt
's


will
;
and
after
an
interval
of
anxious
suspense
,
she
write
to
enquire
the


cause
of
the
delay
.
there
be
another
interval
before
Mrs.
Peniston
's


lawyer
,
who
be
also
one
of
the
executor
,
reply
to
the
effect
that
,


some
question
having
arise
relative
to
the
interpretation
of
the
will
,


he
and
his
associate
might
not
be
in
a
position
to
pay
the
legacy
till


the
close
of
the
twelvemonth
legally
allot
for
their
settlement
.


bewildered
and
indignant
,
Lily
resolve
to
try
the
effect
of
a
personal


appeal
;
but
she
return
from
her
expedition
with
a
sense
of
the


powerlessness
of
beauty
and
charm
against
the
unfeeling
process
of
the


law
.
it
seem
intolerable
to
live
on
for
another
year
under
the
weight


of
her
debt
;
and
in
her
extremity
she
decide
to
turn
to
Miss
Stepney
,


who
still
linger
in
town
,
immerse
in
the
delectable
duty
of
"
go


over
"
her
benefactress
's
effect
.
it
be
bitter
enough
for
Lily
to
ask
a


favour
of
Grace
Stepney
,
but
the
alternative
be
bitterer
still
;
and
one


morning
she
present
herself
at
Mrs.
Peniston
's
,
where
Grace
,
for
the


facilitation
of
her
pious
task
,
have
take
up
a
provisional
abode
.




the
strangeness
of
enter
as
a
suppliant
the
house
where
she
have
so


long
command
,
increase
Lily
's
desire
to
shorten
the
ordeal
;
and
when


Miss
Stepney
enter
the
darken
drawing
-
room
,
rustle
with
the
good


quality
of
crape
,

visitor

straight
to
the
point
:
would
she
be


willing
to
advance
the
amount
of
the
expected
legacy
?




Grace
,
in
reply
,
weep
and
wonder
at
the
request
,
bemoan
the


inexorableness
of
the
law
,
and
be
astonish
that
Lily
have
not
realize


the
exact
similarity
of
their
position
.
do
she
think
that
only
the


payment
of
the
legacy

they

beat
about

cause
by

that
be
not
my
way

I

only
say
I

thoroughly
ashamed

what


your

a

of

the

down
there

more
the
merry
.
they
do
thing
awfully
well
,

there
be
to
be
rather
a
jolly
party
there
this
week----

she
break
off
,


check
by
an
undefinable
change
in
Miss
Bart
's
expression
.
"
oh
,
I
do
n't


mean
your
particular
set
,
you
know
:
rather
a
different
crowd
,
but
very


good
fun
.
the
fact
be
,
the
Gormers
have
strike
out
on
a
line
of
their


own
:
what
they
want
be
to
have
a
good
time
,
and
to
have
it
in
their
own


way
.
they
give
the
other
thing
a
few
month
'
trial
,
under
my


distinguished
auspex
,
and
they
be
really
do
extremely


well
--
get
on
a
good
deal
fast
than
the
Brys
,
just
because
they


do
n't
care
as
much
--
but
suddenly
they
decide
that
the
whole
business


bore
they
,
and
that
what
they
want
be
a
crowd
they
could
really
feel


at
home
with
.
rather
original
of
they
,
do
n't
you
think
so
?
Mattie
Gormer


have
get
aspiration
still
;
woman
always
have
;
but
she
be
awfully


easy
-
go
,
and
Sam
wo
n't
be
bother
,
and
they
both
like
to
be
the
most


important
people
in
sight
,
so
they
've
start
a
sort
of
continuous


performance
of
their
own
,

kind
of
social
Coney
Island

make
noise
enough

on

good
fun

radiance

the
Sunday
forenoon

disperse
themselves
over
the


ground

of
the

distraction

from

court
to

from


bridge
and
whiskey

door

Lily
have
the
odd
sense
of
having
be
catch
up
into
the
crowd
as


carelessly
as
a
passenger
be
gather
in
by
an

to

of
traveller

scarcely

whiz
on
with
a


deafen

and
roar
,
in
which
one
traveller
at

find
a


welcome
refuge
from
the
sound
of
her

represent
a
social
out
-
skirt
which
Lily
have
always
fastidiously


avoid
;
but
it
strike
she
,
now
that
she
be
in
it
,
as
only
a
flamboyant


copy
of
her
own
world
,
a
caricature
approximate
the
real
thing
as
the


"
society
play
"
approach
the
manner
of
the
drawing

room
.
the
people


about

be
do
the
same
thing
as
the
Trenors
,
the
Van
Osburghs
and


the
dorset
:
the
difference
lie
in
a
hundred
shade
of
aspect
and
manner
,


from
the
pattern
of
the
man
's
waistcoat
to
the
inflexion
of
the
woman
's


voice
.
everything
be
pitch
in
a
high
key
,
and
there
be
more
of


each
thing
:
more
noise
,
more
colour
,
more
champagne
,
more


familiarity
--
but
also
great
good
-
nature
,
less
rivalry
,
and
a
fresher


capacity
for
enjoyment
.




Miss
Bart
's
arrival
have
be
welcome
with
an
uncritical
friendliness


that
first
irritate
her
pride
and
then
bring
she
to
a
sharp
sense
of


her
own
situation
--
of
the
place
in
life
which
,
for
the
moment
,
she
must


accept
and
make
the
good
of
.
 
these
people
know
her
story
--
of
that
she


first
long
talk
with
Carry
Fisher
have
leave
no
doubt
:
she
be
publicly


brand
as
the
heroine
of
a
"
queer
"
episode
--
but
instead
of
shrink


from
she
as
her
own
friend
have
do
,
they
receive
she
without
question


into
the
easy
promiscuity
of
their
life
.
they
swallow
her
past
as


easily
as
they
do
Miss
Anstell
's
,
and
with
no
apparent
sense
of
any


difference
in
the
size
of
the
mouthful
:
all
they
ask
be
that
she


should
--
in
her
own
way
,
for
they
recognize
a
diversity
of


gift
--
contribute
as
much
to
the
general
amusement
as
that
graceful


actress
,
whose
talent
,
when
off
the
stage
,
be
of
the
most
varied


order
.
Lily
feel
at
once
that
any
tendency
to
be
"
stuck
-
up
,
"
to
mark
a


sense
of
difference
and
distinction
,
would
be
fatal
to
her
continuance


in
the
Gormer
set
.
to
be
take
in
on
such
term
--
and
into
such
a


world!--wa
hard
enough
to
the
linger
pride
in
she
;
but
she
realize
,


with
a
pang
of
self
-
contempt
,
that
to
be
exclude
from
it
would
,
after


all
,
be
hard
still
.
for
,
almost
at
once
,
she
have
feel
the
insidious


charm
of
slip
back
into
a
life
where
every
material
difficulty
be


smooth
away
.
the
sudden
escape
from
a
stifle
hotel
in
a
dusty


deserted
city
to
the
space
and
luxury
of
a
great
country
-
house
fan
by


sea
breeze
,
have
produce
a
state
of
moral
lassitude
agreeable
enough


after
the
nervous
tension
and
physical
discomfort
of
the
past
week
.
for


the
moment
she
must
yield
to
the
refreshment
her
sense
crave
--
after


that
she
would
reconsider
her
situation
,
and
take
counsel
with
she


dignity
.
her
enjoyment
of
her
surrounding
be
,
indeed
,
tinge
by
the


unpleasant
consideration
that
she
be
accept
the
hospitality
and


court
the
approval
of
people
she
have
disdain
under
other
condition
.


but
she
be
grow
less
sensitive
on
such
point
:
a
hard
glaze
of


indifference
be
fast
form
over
her
delicacy
and
susceptibility
,


and
each
concession
to
expediency
harden
the
surface
a
little
more
.




on
the
Monday
,
when
the
party
disband
with
uproarious
adieu
,
the


return
to
town
throw
into
strong
relief
the
charm
of
the
life
she
be


leave
.
the
other
guest
be
disperse
to
take
up
the
same
existence


in
a
different
setting
:
some
at
Newport
,
some
at
Bar
Harbour
,
some
in
the


elaborate
rusticity
of
an
Adirondack
camp
.
even
Gerty
Farish
,
who


welcome
Lily
's
return
with
tender
solicitude
,
would
soon
be
prepare
to


join
the
aunt
with
whom
she
spend
her
summer
on
Lake
George

only
Lily


herself

without
plan
or
purpose
,
strand
in
a
backwater
of
the


great
current
of
pleasure

on

to

own
house

two
on

to

suggestion

look
here
,
Lily

I'll
tell
you
what
it
be

you
to
take
my
place


with
Mattie
Gormer
this
summer
.

a
party
out
to
Alaska

month

an
obscure
conception

have
be

its
consequence
have
establish
a

have
return
to
the
barrenness
of

New

August
,
mitigate
only
by
poor
Gerty

,
her
worldly
wisdom
would


have
counsel
she
against
such
an
act
of
abnegation

she
know
that


Carry
Fisher
be
right
:
that
an
opportune
absence
might
be
the
first
step


toward
rehabilitation
,

that
,
at
any
rate
,
to
linger
on
in
town
out
of


season
be
a
fatal
admission
of
defeat

from
the
Gormers
'

progress
across
their
native
continent

return
with
an
altered
view

the
renew
habit
of
luxury

the
daily
waking
to
an


assure
absence

presence
of
material
ease

gradually
blunt


her
appreciation
of
these
value

leave
she
more
conscious
of
the

all
these
characteristic
note
of
difference


begin
to
wear
upon
her
endurance
;
and
the
more
she
see
to
criticize
in


her
companion

she
find
for

the

it

must
exact
fresh
concession
from

the

the

win
for
she
an
important
place

the
Gormer

if
their


resonant
hilarity
could
never

she
contribute
a
note
of
easy


elegance
more
valuable
to
Mattie
Gormer
than
the
loud
passage
of

band
.
Sam
Gormer
and
his
special
crony
stand
indeed

she

they
prize
she

the
very
quality

most
conspicuously

social
indolence

as
great

artistic
activity

have
abandon
himself
to
the
easy
current
of
the
Gormer
existence
,
where


the
minor
exaction
of
politeness
be
unknown
or
ignore

man


could
either
break
his
engagement
,

keep
they
in
a
painting

his
sense
of

the
rest
of

a

she
'd

though
his
abhorrence
of

have

great


for

thus
form
,

the
tumult
of
her
surrounding

a
little
nucleus


of

mitigate

crudeness
of

course

up
of

season

,

a
first
stare

surprise
,
she
take
Lily
's
presence
almost

much
as
a
matter
of
course

,
appear
frequently
in


the

drive
over
to
impart

give
Lily


what
she
call
the
late
report
from

the


latter
,

have
never

confidence

could
yet
talk


with

more
freely

it
be


impossible
even
to
admit
the
existence

Mrs.

conveniently
take
for
grant
.




Mrs.

no

curiosity

she
do
not
wish
to


probe
the
inwardness
of

situation

simply
to

it
from
the


outside

draw
her
conclusion
accordingly

these
conclusion
,
at


the
end
of
a
confidential
talk

she
sum
up
to
her

succinct
remark

plainly
enough
in

the


twilight
,

she
now
seek
to
pierce
it

be
gradually
light
by
a


faint
spark
of
reassurance
.
under
the
utilitarian
motive
of
Rosedale
's

she
have
feel
,
clearly
enough
,
the
heat
of
personal
inclination

she
would
not
have
detest
he
so
heartily
have
she
not
know
that
he


dare
to
admire
she
.
what
,
then
,
if
the
passion
persist
,

the


other
motive
have
cease
to
sustain
it

she
have
never
even
try

--
he
have
be
draw
to
she
in
spite
of
her
manifest
disdain
.
what
if


she
now
choose
to
exert
the
power
which
,
even
in
its
passive
state
,
he
have


feel
so
strongly

what

it

man

the
extremity

loneliness

humiliation

there

revenge

rehabilitation
might

he
cry
out
on
a
last
note
of
entreaty

Gormer
ground

rapidly
across
the
lawn


toward
the
unfinished
house
,
where
she
fancy
that
her
hostess
might
be


speculate
,
not
too
resignedly
,
on
the
cause
of
her
delay

for
,

many
unpunctual
person

Mrs.

dislike
to
be
keep
wait

as
Miss
Bart
reach
the
avenue

,
she
see
a
smart
phaeton
with
a


high
-
step
pair
disappear
behind
the
shrubbery
in
the
direction
of
the


gate
;
and
on
the
doorstep
stand
Mrs.
Gormer
,
with
a
glow
of
retrospective


pleasure
on
her
open
countenance

at
sight
of
Lily
the
glow
deepen
to


an
embarrassed
red
,

she
say
with
a
slight
laugh
:
"

you
come
back

avenue

Mrs.

she
have
drop
in
to
make
a
neighbourly
call
.
"




Lily
meet
the
announcement
with
her
usual
composure
,
though
her
experience


of
Bertha
's
idiosyncrasy
would
not
have
lead
she
to
include
the


neighbourly
instinct
among
they
;
and
Mrs.
Gormer
,
relieve
to
see
that


she
give
no
sign
of
surprise
,
go
on
with
a
deprecate
laugh
:
"
of


course
what
really
bring
she
be
curiosity
--
she
make
I
take
she
all


over
the
house

but
no
one
could
have
be
nice
--
no
air
,
you
know
,
and


so
good
-
natured
:
I
can
quite
see
why
people
think
she
so
fascinating
.
"




this
surprising
event
,
coincide
too
completely
with
her
meeting
with


dorset
to
be
regard
as
contingent
upon
it
,
have
yet
immediately
strike


lily
with
a
vague
sense
of
foreboding
.
it
be
not
in
Bertha
's
habit
to


be
neighbourly
,
much
less
to
make
advance
to
any
one
outside
the


immediate
circle
of
her
affinity
.
she
have
always
consistently
ignore


the
world
of
outer
aspirant
,
or
have
recognize
its
individual
member


only
when
prompt
by
motive
of
self
-
interest
;
and
the
very


capriciousness
of
her
condescension
have
,
as
Lily
be
aware
,
give
they


special
value
in
the
eye
of
the
person
she
distinguish
.
Lily
see
this


now
in
Mrs.
Gormer
's
unconcealable
complacency
,
and
in
the
happy


irrelevance
with
which
,
for
the
next
day
or
two
,
she
quote
Bertha
's


opinion
and
speculate
on
the
origin
of
her
gown
.
all
the
secret


ambition
which
Mrs.
Gormer
's
native
indolence
,
and
the
attitude
of
she


companion
,
keep
in
habitual
abeyance
,
be
now
germinate
afresh
in
the


glow
of
Bertha
's
advance
;
and
whatever
the
cause
of
the
latter
,
Lily
see


that
,
if
they
be
follow
up
,
they
be
likely
to
have
a
disturbing


effect
upon
her
own
future

she
have
arrange
to
break
the
length
of
her
stay
with
her
new
friend
by


one
or
two
visit
to
other
acquaintance
as
recent
;
and
on
her
return


from
this
somewhat
depressing
excursion
she
be
immediately
conscious


that
Mrs.
Dorset
's
influence
be
still
in
the
air
.
there
have
be
another


exchange
of
visit
,
a
tea
at
a
country
-
club
,
an
encounter
at
a
hunt
ball
;


there
be
even
a
rumour
of
an
approach
dinner
,
which
Mattie
Gormer
,


with
an
unnatural
effort
at
discretion
,
try
to
smuggle
out
of
the


conversation
whenever
Miss
Bart
take
part
in
it
.




the
latter
have
already
plan
to
return
to
town
after
a
farewell
Sunday


with
her
friend
;
and
,
with
Gerty
Farish
's
aid
,
have
discover
a
small


private
hotel
where
she
might
establish
herself
for
the
winter
.
 
the


hotel
be
on
the
edge
of
a
fashionable
neighbourhood
,
the
price
of
the


few
square
foot
she
be
to
occupy
be
considerably
in
excess
of
she


mean
;
but
she
find
a
justification
for
her
dislike
of
poor
quarter


in
the
argument
that
,
at
this
particular
juncture
,
it
be
of
the
utmost


importance
to
keep
up
a
show
of
prosperity
.
in
reality
,
it
be
impossible


for
she
,
while
she
have
the
mean
to
pay
her
way
for
a
week
ahead
,
to


lapse
into
a
form
of
existence
like
Gerty
Farish
's
.
she
have
never
be
so


near
the
brink
of
insolvency
;
but
she
could
at
least
manage
to
meet
she


weekly
hotel
bill
,
and
having
settle
the
heavy
of
her
previous
debt


out
of
the
money
she
have
receive
from
Trenor
,
she
have
a
still
fair


margin
of
credit
to
go
upon
.
the
situation
,
however
,
be
not
agreeable


enough
to
lull
she
to
complete
unconsciousness
of
its
insecurity
.
 
her


room

with
their
cramp
outlook
down
a
sallow
vista

Mrs.

counsel

beat


about
the
question

she

know
the
outcome
of
it

that
she


must
try

in
this
conviction

unexpected
visit

but
the
sight
of


her
seem
to
quiet
he
,
and
he
say
meekly
that
he
have
n't
come
to
bother


she
--
that
he
ask
only
to
be
allow
to
sit
for
half
an
hour
and
talk
of


anything
she
like
.
in
reality
,
as
she
know
,
he
have
but
one
subject
:


himself
and
his
wretchedness
;
and
it
be
the
need
of
her
sympathy
that


have
draw
he
back
.
but
he
begin
with
a
pretence
of
question
she
about


herself
,
and
as
she
reply
,
she
see
that
,
for
the
first
time
,
a
faint


realization
of
her
plight
penetrate
the
dense
surface
of
his


self
-
absorption
.
be
it
possible
that
her
old
beast
of
an
aunt
have


actually
cut
she
off
?
that
she
be
live
alone
like
this
because
there


be
no
one
else
for
she
to
go
to
,
and
that
she
really
have
n't
more
than


enough
to
keep
alive
on
till
the
wretched
little
legacy
be
pay
?
the


fibre
of
sympathy
be
nearly
atrophy
in
he
,
but
he
be
suffer
so


intensely
that
he
have
a
faint
glimpse
of
what
other
suffering
might


mean
--
and
,
as
she
perceive
,
an
almost
simultaneous
perception
of
the
way


in
which
her
particular
misfortune
might
serve
he
.




when
at
length
she
dismiss
he
,
on
the
pretext
that
she
must
dress
for


dinner
,
he
linger
entreatingly
on
the
threshold
to
blurt
out
:
"
it
be


be
such
a
comfort
--
do
say
you
'll
let
I
see
you
again--
"
but
to
this


direct
appeal
it
be
impossible
to
give
an
assent
;
and
she
say
with


friendly
decisiveness
:
"
I
be
sorry
--
but
you
know
why
I
ca
n't

he
colour
to
the
eye
,
push
the
door
shut
,
and
stand
before
she


embarrassed
but
insistent
.
"
I
know
how
you
might
,
if
you
would
--
if
thing


be
different
--
and
it
lie
with
you
to
make
they
so
.
it
be
just
a
word
to


say
,
and
you
put
I
out
of
my
misery
!
"




their
eye
meet
,
and
for
a
second
she
tremble
again
with
the
nearness
of


the
temptation
.
"
you
be
mistaken
;
I
know
nothing
;
I
see
nothing
,
"
she


exclaim
,
strive
,
by
sheer
force
of
reiteration
,
to
build
a
barrier


between
herself
and
her
peril
;
and
as
he
turn
away
,
groan
out
"
you


sacrifice
we
both

she
continue
to
repeat
,
as
if
it
be
a
charm
:
"

absolutely
nothing

Lily
have
see
little
of
Rosedale
since
her
illuminate
talk
with
Mrs.


fisher
,
but
on
the
two
or
three
occasion
when
they
have
meet
she
be


conscious
of
having
distinctly
advance
in
his
favour
.
 
there
could
be
no


doubt
that
he
admire
she
as
much
as
ever
,
and
she
believe
it
rest


with
herself
to
raise
his
admiration
to
the
point
where
it
should
bear


down
the
linger
counsel
of
expediency
.
the
task
be
not
an
easy
one
;


but
neither
be
it
easy
,
in
her
long
sleepless
night
,
to
face
the


think
of
what
George
Dorset
be
so
clearly
ready
to
offer
.
 
Baseness


for
baseness
,
she
hate
the
other
least
:
there
be
even
moment
when
a


marriage
with
Rosedale
seem
the
only
honourable
solution
of
she


difficulty
.
she
do
not
indeed
let
her
imagination
range
beyond
the
day


of
plight
:
after
that
everything
fade
into
a
haze
of
material


well
-
being
,
in
which
the
personality
of
her
benefactor
remain


mercifully
vague
.
she
have
learn
,
in
her
long
vigil
,
that
there
be


certain
thing
not
good
to
think
of
,
certain
midnight
image
that
must
at


any
cost
be
exorcise
--
and
one
of
these
be
the
image
of
herself
as


Rosedale
's
wife
.




Carry
Fisher
,
on
the
strength
,
as
she
frankly
own
,
of
the
Brys
'
Newport


success
,
have
take
for
the
autumn
month
a
small
house
at
Tuxedo
;
and


thither
Lily
be
bind
on
the
Sunday
after
Dorset
's
visit
.
 
though
it
be


nearly
dinner
-
time
when
she
arrive
,
her
hostess
be
still
out
,
and
the


firelit
quiet
of
the
small
silent
house
descend
on
her
spirit
with
a


sense
of
peace
and
familiarity
.
it
may
be
doubted
if
such
an
emotion
have


ever
before
be
evoke
by
Carry
Fisher
's
surrounding
;
but
,
contrast


to
the
world
in
which
Lily
have
lately
live
,
there
be
an
air
of
repose


and
stability
in
the
very
placing
of
the
furniture
,
and
in
the
quiet


competence
of
the
parlour
-
maid
who
lead
she
up
to
her
room
.
Mrs.
Fisher
's


unconventionality
be
,
after
all
,
a
merely
superficial
divergence
from
an


inherit
social
creed
,
while
the
manner
of
the
Gormer
circle


represent
their
first
attempt
to
formulate
such
a
creed
for
themselves
.




it
be
the
first
time
since
her
return
from
Europe
that
Lily
have
find


herself
in
a
congenial
atmosphere
,
and
the
stirring
of
familiar


association
have
almost
prepare
she
,
as
she
descend
the
stair
before


dinner
,
to
enter
upon
a
group
of
her
old
acquaintance
.
but
this


expectation
be
instantly
check
by
the
reflection
that
the
friend
who


remain
loyal
be
precisely
those
who
would
be
least
willing
to
expose


she
to
such
encounter
;
and
it
be
hardly
with
surprise
that
she
find
,


instead
,
Mr.
Rosedale
kneel
domestically
on
the
drawing
-
room
hearth


before
his
hostess
's
little
girl
.




Rosedale
in
the
paternal
role
be
hardly
a
figure
to
soften
Lily
;
yet
she


could
not
but
notice
a
quality
of
homely
goodness
in
his
advance
to
the


child
.
they
be
not
,
at
any
rate
,
the
premeditated
and
perfunctory


endearment
of
the
guest
under
his
hostess
's
eye
,
for
he
and
the
little


girl
have
the
room
to
themselves
;
and
something
in
his
attitude
make
he


seem
a
simple
and
kindly
be
compare
to
the
small
critical
creature


who
endure
his
homage
.
yes
,
he
would
be
kind
--
Lily
,
from
the
threshold
,


have
time
to
feel
--
kind
in
his
gross
,
unscrupulous
,
rapacious
way
,
the
way


of
the
predatory
creature
with
his
mate
.
 
she
have
but
a
moment
in
which


to
consider
whether
this
glimpse
of
the
fireside
man
mitigate
she


repugnance
,
or
give
it
,
rather
,
a
more
concrete
and
intimate
form
;
for
at


sight
of
she
he
be
immediately
on
his
foot
again
,
the
florid
and


dominant
Rosedale
of
Mattie
Gormer
's
drawing

it
be
no
surprise
to
Lily
to
find
that
he
have
be
select
as
she
only


fellow
-
guest

though
she
and
her
hostess
have
not
meet
since
the
latter
's


tentative
discussion
of
her
future
,
Lily
know
that
the
acuteness
which


enable
Mrs.
Fisher
to
lay
a
safe
and
pleasant
course
through
a
world
of


antagonistic
force

not
infrequently
exercise
for
the
benefit
of
she


friend

it
be
,
in
fact
,
characteristic
of
Carry
that
,
while
she


actively
glean
her
own
store
from
the
field
of
affluence
,

real


sympathy

on
the
other
side

with
the
unlucky
,
the
unpopular
,
the


unsuccessful
,
with
all
her
hungry
fellow

toiler

the
shorn
stubble
of


success

she
against
the
mistake
of

lily
,
for
the
first
evening
,

the
unmitigated
impression

she

plan

the
passiveness

sufferer

must
employ
vulgar
mind

draw
the
inference

it
be
easy
for
Lily

have
never

in
the


golden
haze
which
bathe
they

to
Miss

the
September


afternoon

Bellomont

importunate
memory

its
ironic
contrast

she


present
situation

her
walk

Selden
have
represent
an


irresistible
flight

just
such
a
climax

the

skillfully
lead
up

some
malice

that
the
whole
weary
work

rehabilitation

begin
again

by
the
passionate

triumph
over
Bertha

only


wealth

triumph

the

the
Rosedale

it

her
power

would
at

present
an
invulnerable
front
to
her
enemy

she
have
to
draw
upon
this
thought
,

upon
some
fiery
stimulant
,
to
keep


up
her
part
in
the
scene

tell
herself
that
this


momentary
endurance

his
mood

the
price
she
must
pay

the
exact

the
price
he
would
have
to

some
time

rocky
glen

impassioned

foot

up
my

draw
away
with
a
movement
of
quick
disdain

easy

such
resistance

in
spite
of
herself

hold
by
the
note
of
a
new
purpose

his


look

on

his
eye
firmly
upon

astonishment

,

he
move
a
step
close


to
ask
with
low

toned
directness
:

"




Lily
stand
speechless
under
the
shock
of
the
interrogation
.
in
the
word


precede
it
she
have
conjecture
,
at
most
,
an
allusion
to
her
suppose


influence
over
George
Dorset
;
nor
do
the
astonishing
indelicacy
of
the


reference
diminish
the
likelihood
of
Rosedale
's
resort
to
it
.
but
now


she
see
how
far
short
of
the
mark
she
have
fall
;
and
the
surprise
of


learn
that
he
have
discover
the
secret
of
the
letter
leave
she
,
for


the
moment

unconscious
of
the
special
use
to
which
he
be
in
the
act
of


put
his
knowledge

her
temporary
loss
of
self
-
possession
give
he
time
to
press
his
point
;


and
he
go
on
quickly
,
as
though
to
secure
completer
control
of
the


situation

"

stage

talk

n't
it?--but
there
be
a
lot


of
truth
in
some
of
those
old
gag
;

I
do
n't
suppose

collect
autograph

she
continue
to
look
at

with
a
deepening
bewilderment

her
only


clear
impression
resolve
itself
into
a
scared
sense
of
his
power

wonder
how
I

out
about
'em

he
go
on
,
answer
she


look
with
a
note
of
conscious
pride

"
perhaps
you
've
forget
that
I
be


the
owner
of
the
Benedick

but
never
mind
about
that
now
.
get
on
to


thing
be
a
mighty
useful
accomplishment
in
business
,
and
I
've
simply


extend
it
to
my
private
affair
.
for
this
be
partly
my
affair
,
you


see
--
at
least
,
it
depend
on
you
to
make
it
so
.
let
's
look
the
situation


straight
in
the
eye
.
Mrs.
Dorset
,
for
reason
we
need
n't
go
into
,
do
you


a
beastly
bad
turn
last
spring
.
everybody
know
what
Mrs.
Dorset
be
,
and


her
good
friend
would
n't
believe
she
on
oath
where
their
own
interest


be
concern
;
but
as
long
as
they
be
out
of
the
row
it
be
much
easy
to


follow
her
lead
than
to
set
themselves
against
it
,
and
you
've
simply
be


sacrifice
to
their
laziness
and
selfishness
.
be
n't
that
a
pretty
fair


statement
of
the
case?--well
,
some
people
say
you
've
get
the
neat
kind


of
an
answer
in
your
hand
:
that
George
Dorset
would
marry
you
tomorrow
,


if
you
'd
tell
he
all
you
know
,
and
give
he
the
chance
to
show
the
lady


the
door
.
I
daresay
he
would
;
but
you
do
n't
seem
to
care
for
that


particular
form
of
get
even
,
and
,
take
a
purely
business
view
of


the
question
,
I
think
you
be
right
.
in
a
deal
like
that
,
nobody
come
out


with
perfectly
clean
hand
,
and
the
only
way
for
you
to
start
fresh
be
to


get
Bertha
Dorset
to
back
you
up
,
instead
of
try
to
fight
she
.
"




he
pause
long
enough
to
draw
breath
,
but
not
to
give
she
time
for
the


expression
of
her
gathering
resistance
;
and
as
he
press
on
,
expound


and
elucidate
his
idea
with
the
directness
of
the
man
who
have
no
doubt


of
his
cause
,
she
find
the
indignation
gradually
freeze
on
her
lip
,


find
herself
hold
fast
in
the
grasp
of
his
argument
by
the
mere
cold


strength
of
its
presentation
.
there
be
no
time
now
to
wonder
how
he
have


hear
of
she
obtain
the
letter
:
all
her
world
be
dark
outside
the


monstrous
glare
of
his
scheme
for
use
they
.
and
it
be
not
,
after
the


first
moment
,
the
horror
of
the
idea
that
hold
her
spell
-
bind
,
subdue


to
his
will
;
it
be
rather
its
subtle
affinity
to
her
own
inmost


craving
.
he
would
marry
she
tomorrow
if
she
could
regain
Bertha
Dorset
's


friendship
;
and
to
induce
the
open
resumption
of
that
friendship
,
and
the


tacit
retractation
of
all
that
have
cause
its
withdrawal
,
she
have
only
to


put
to
the
lady
the
latent
menace
contain
in
the
packet
so
miraculously


deliver
into
her
hand
.
Lily
see
in
a
flash
the
advantage
of
this


course
over
that
which
poor
Dorset
have
press
upon
she
.
the
other
plan


depend
for
its
success
on
the
infliction
of
an
open
injury
,
while
this


reduce
the
transaction
to
a
private
understanding
,
of
which
no
third


person
need
have
the
remote
hint
.
Put
by
Rosedale
in
term
of


business
-
like
give
-
and
-
take
,
this
understanding
take
on
the
harmless
air


of
a
mutual
accommodation
,
like
a
transfer
of
property
or
a
revision
of


boundary
line
.
it
certainly
simplify
life
to
view
it
as
a
perpetual


adjustment
,
a
play
of
party
politic
,
in
which
every
concession
have
its


recognize
equivalent
:
Lily
's
tired
mind
be
fascinate
by
this
escape


from
fluctuate
ethical
estimate
into
a
region
of
concrete
weight
and


measure
.




Rosedale
,
as
she
listen
,
seem
to
read
in
her
silence
not
only
a


gradual

what

a
voice
that

sudden

exclaim
;

to
her
murmur
of
"
ah

we
do
now
,

he
retort
with
a


sudden
burst
of
violence

a
promptness

scorn
almost

to
herself

not
lose
her
capacity
for
high
flash
of


indignation

she
could
not
breathe
long
on
the
height
;
there
have


be
nothing
in
her
training

develop

moral
strength

what
she
crave

a
situation

noble
attitude

easy

resistance

self

Bertha

the

anxiety

in

urgent

immediate
need
of
money

money
to
meet

up

provisional
hospitality
of
a

an


expedient
which
could
only
postpone
the
problem
confront
she
;

it


seem
wise
as
well
as
more
agreeable
to
remain
where
she
be
and
find


some
mean
of
earn
her
living
.
the
possibility
of
have
to
do
this

one
which
she
have
never

seriously
consider
,

that
,

be
likely
to
prove

a
severe
shock

naturally
fit

any

could
conscientiously
assert


that
she
have
put
several
opportunity
of
this
kind
before
Lily

more


legitimate
method
of

as
much
out

Lily
's
failure
to
profit
by
the
chance

justify
the

in
the


pursuance

she
at
once
start
on
a
voyage
of
discovery
in


Miss

as
the
result
of
her
exploration

distressfully
upon
her
friend
's
plight
,
and


her
own
inability
to
relieve
it

it
be
clear
to
she
that
Lily
,
for
the


present
,
have
no
wish
for
the
kind
of
help
she
could
give
.
Miss
Farish


could
see
no
hope
for
her
friend
but
in
a
life
completely
reorganize
and


detach
from
its
old
association
;
whereas
all
Lily
's
energy
be


centre
in
the
determined
effort
to
hold
fast
to
those
association
,
to


keep
herself
visibly
identify
with
they
,
as
long
as
the
illusion
could


be
maintain
.
pitiable
as
such
an
attitude
seem
to
Gerty
,
she
could


not
judge
it
as
harshly
as
Selden
,
for
instance
,
might
have
do
.
she
have


not
forget
the
night
of
emotion
when
she
and
Lily
have
lain
in
each


other
's
arm
,
and
she
have
seem
to
feel
her
very
heart
's
blood
pass


into
her
friend
.
the
sacrifice
she
have
make
have
seem
unavaile
enough
;


no
trace
remain
in
Lily
of
the
subduing
influence
of
that
hour
;
but


Gerty
's
tenderness
,
discipline
by
long
year
of
contact
with
obscure
and


inarticulate
suffering
,
could
wait
on
its
object
with
a
silent


forbearance
which
take
no
account
of
time
.
she
could
not
,
however
,
deny


herself
the
solace
of
take
anxious
counsel
with
Lawrence
Selden
,
with


whom
,
since
his
return
from
Europe
,
she
have
renew
her
old
relation
of


cousinly
confidence
.




Selden
himself
have
never
be
aware
of
any
change
in
their
relation
.
he


find
Gerty
as
he
have
leave
she
,
simple
,
undemanding
and
devoted
,
but
with


a
quickened
intelligence
of
the
heart
which
he
recognize
without
seek


to
explain
it
.
to
Gerty
herself
it
would
once
have
seem
impossible
that


she
should
ever
again
talk
freely
with
he
of
Lily
Bart
;
but
what
have


pass
in
the
secrecy
of
her
own
breast
seem
to
resolve
itself
,
when


the
mist
of
the
struggle
clear
,
into
a
breaking
down
of
the
bound
of


self
,
a
deflecting
of
the
waste
personal
emotion
into
the
general


current
of
human
understanding
.




it
be
not
till
some
two
week
after
her
visit
from
Lily
that
Gerty
have


the
opportunity
of
communicate
her
fear
to
Selden
.
 
the
latter
,
have


present
himself
on
a
Sunday
afternoon
,
have
linger
on
through
the


dowdy
animation
of
his
cousin
's
tea
-
hour
,
conscious
of
something
in
she


voice
and
eye
which
solicit
a
word
apart
;
and
as
soon
as
the
last


visitor
be
go
Gerty
open
her
case
by
ask
how
lately

have
see


Miss
Bart

perceptible
pause
give
her
time
for
a
slight
stir
of
surprise

this
unexpected
admission
make
Gerty
pause
too
;
and
she
be
still


hesitate
on
the
brink
of
her
subject

his

dark
face
could
assume
when

to
guard
it
against
any
involuntary


change

with
a

the
troubled
appeal

he
add
,

he


rise
to
take
leave
:

still
,
I
'll
do

"




Selden
's
avoidance
of
Miss
Bart
have
not
be
as
unintentional
as
he
have


allow
his
cousin
to
think
.
at
first
,
indeed
,
while
the
memory
of
their


last
hour
at
Monte
Carlo
still
hold
the
full
heat
of
his
indignation
,
he


have
anxiously
watch
for
her
return
;
but
she
have
disappoint
he
by


linger
in
England
,
and
when
she
finally
reappear
it
happen
that


business
have
call
he
to
the
West
,
whence
he
come
back
only
to
learn


that
she
be
start
for
Alaska
with
the
Gormers
.
the
revelation
of
this


suddenly
-
establish
intimacy
effectually
chill
his
desire
to
see
she
.


if
,
at
a
moment
when
her
whole
life
seem
to
be
break
up
,
she
could


cheerfully
commit
its
reconstruction
to
the
Gormers
,
there
be
no
reason


why
such
accident
should
ever
strike
she
as
irreparable
.
 
every
step
she


took
seem
in
fact
to
carry
she
far
from
the
region
where
,
once
or


twice
,
he
and
she
have
meet
for
an
illumined
moment
;
and
the
recognition
of


this
fact
,
when
its
first
pang
have
be
surmount
,
produce
in
he
a


sense
of
negative
relief
.
it
be
much
simple
for
he
to
judge
Miss
Bart


by
her
habitual
conduct
than
by
the
rare
deviation
from
it
which
have


throw
she
so
disturbingly
in
his
way
;
and
every
act
of
hers
which
make


the
recurrence
of
such
deviation
more
unlikely
,
confirm
the
sense
of


relief
with
which
he
return
to
the
conventional
view
of
she
.




but
Gerty
Farish
's
word
have
suffice
to
make
he
see
how
little
this


view
be
really
his
,
and
how
impossible
it
be
for
he
to
live
quietly


with
the
thought
of
Lily
Bart
.
to
hear
that
she
be
in
need
of
help
--
even


such
vague
help
as
he
could
offer
--
be
to
be
at
once
repossess
by
that


think
;
and
by
the
time
he
reach
the
street
he
have
sufficiently


convince
himself
of
the
urgency
of
his
cousin
's
appeal
to
turn
his
step


directly
toward
Lily
's
hotel
.




there
his
zeal
meet
a
check
in
the
unforeseen
news
that
Miss
Bart
have


move
away
;
but
,
on
his
press
his
enquiry
,
the
clerk
remember
that


she
have
leave
an
address
,
for
which
he
presently
begin
to
search
through


his
book
.




it
be
certainly
strange
that
she
should
have
take
this
step
without


let
Gerty
Farish
know
of
her
decision
;
and
Selden
wait
with
a
vague


sense
of
uneasiness
while
the
address
be
seek
for
.
the
process
last


long
enough
for
uneasiness
to
turn
to
apprehension

when
at
length
a


slip
of
paper

it

his

into

incredulous


stare

this
into
the
gesture
of
disgust
with
which
he
tear
the
paper


in

for
the
moment

the


excess
of
the

the
sense

Mrs.

the

her

Socially

Mr.

the
more


dimly

light
region
on
which
Miss

now
find
herself

.
it
be
,


however
,
only
figuratively
that
the
illumination
of
Mrs.
Hatch
's
world


could
be
describe
as
dim

in

ornamental


excrescence
on
a
vast
concavity
of
pink
damask
and
gilding
,
from
which


she
rise
like
Venus
from
her
shell

the
analogy
be
justify
by
the


appearance
of
the
lady
,
whose
large
-

prettiness
have
the
fixity
of


something

this
do
not
preclude
the


immediate
discovery
that
she
be
some
year
young
than
her
visitor
,
and


that
under
her
showiness
,
her
ease
,
the
aggression
of
her
dress

there
persist
that
ineradicable
innocence

in

so
curiously

with
startling
extreme

the
environment
in
which
Lily

from

of
their


sable
,

back
into

somewhere

pallid

Mrs.

from

of

first
development
to
the
high
stage
of

it

Lily

not

its


regulation
be
no

Mr.

often

the


pupil
have
outstrip
the

and
Mrs.

be
already
aware
of


height
of
elegance
as
well
as
depth
of

beyond

of

this
discovery
at
once
produce
in
she
a
craving
for
high


guidance
,
for
the
adroit
feminine
hand
which
should
give
the
right
turn


to

,
the

it

,

ostensible

by
the
fact
that

the
daily
detail
of
Mrs.

's

be
as
strange
to
Lily
as


its
general
tenor
.
the
lady
's
habit
be
mark
by
an
oriental
indolence


and
disorder
peculiarly
try
to
her
companion
.
Mrs.

and
she


friend
seem
to
float
together
outside

of

no

:
night

flow
into
one
another
in
a
blur
of
confused
and
retarded

so
that

the
impression
of

through
this
jumble
of
futile

strange
of
all
to
Lily
be
the
encounter
,
in
this
latter
group
,
of


several
of
her
acquaintance

she
have
suppose

not
without
relief
,


that
she
be
pass
,
for
the
moment
,
completely
out
of

one
of
Lily

first
astonishment
;
but
she
soon
discover
that
he
be


not
Mr.
Stancy
's
most
important
recruit
.
it
be
on
little
Freddy

the
small
slim
heir
of
the
Van

that
the


attention
of
Mrs.

's
group
be
centre
.
freddy
,
barely
out
of


college
,
have
rise
above
the
horizon
since
Lily
's
eclipse
,
and
she
now


see
with
surprise
what
an
effulgence
he
shed
on
the
outer
twilight
of


Mrs.
Hatch
's
existence
.
this
,
then
,
be
one
of
the
thing
that
young
man


"
go
in
"
for
when
release
from
the
official
social
routine
;
this
be


the
kind
of
"
previous
engagement
"
that
so
frequently
cause
they
to


disappoint
the
hope
of
anxious
hostess
.
Lily
have
an
odd
sense
of
be


behind
the
social
tapestry
,
on
the
side
where
the
thread
be
knot


and
the
loose
end
hang
.
for
a
moment
she
find
a
certain
amusement
in


the
show
,
and
in
her
own
share
of
it
:
the
situation
have
an
ease
and


unconventionality
distinctly
refreshing
after
her
experience
of
the
irony


of
convention
.
but
these
flash
of
amusement
be
but
brief
reaction


from
the
long
disgust
of
her
day
.
compare
with
the
vast
gilded
void
of


Mrs.
Hatch
's
existence
,
the
life
of
Lily
's
former
friend
seem
pack


with
ordered
activity
.
even
the
most
irresponsible
pretty
woman
of
she


acquaintance
have
her
inherit
obligation
,
her
conventional


benevolence
,
her
share
in
the
working
of
the
great
civic
machine
;
and


all
hang
together
in
the
solidarity
of
these
traditional
function
.
the


performance
of
specific
duty
would
have
simplify
Miss
Bart
's


position
;
but
the
vague
attendance
on
Mrs.
Hatch
be
not
without
its


perplexity
.




it
be
not
her
employer
who
create
these
perplexity
.
Mrs.
Hatch
show


from
the
first
an
almost
touching
desire
for
Lily
's
approval
.
 
far
from


assert
the
superiority
of
wealth
,
her
beautiful
eye
seem
to
urge


the
plea
of
inexperience
:
she
want
to
do
what
be
"
nice
,
"
to
be
teach


how
to
be
"
lovely
.
"
the
difficulty
be
to
find
any
point
of
contact


between
her
ideal
and
Lily
's
.




Mrs.
Hatch
swam
in
a
haze
of
indeterminate
enthusiasm
,
of
aspiration


cull
from
the
stage
,
the
newspaper
,
the
fashion
journal
,
and
a
gaudy


world
of
sport
still
more
completely
beyond
her
companion
's
ken
.
 
to


separate
from
these
confused
conception
those
most
likely
to
advance
the


lady
on
her
way
,
be
Lily
's
obvious
duty
;
but
its
performance
be


hamper
by
rapidly
-
grow
doubt
.
Lily
be
in
fact
become
more
and


more
aware
of
a
certain
ambiguity
in
her
situation
.
 
it
be
not
that
she


have
,
in
the
conventional
sense
,
any
doubt
of
Mrs.
Hatch
's


irreproachableness
.
the
lady
's
offence
be
always
against
taste
rather


than
conduct
;
her
divorce
record
seem
due
to
geographical
rather
than


ethical
condition
;
and
her
bad
laxity
be
likely
to
proceed
from
a


wandering
and
extravagant
good
-
nature
.
 
but
if
Lily
do
not
mind
she


detain
her
manicure
for
luncheon
,
or
offer
the
"
Beauty
-
Doctor
"
a


seat
in
Freddy
Van
Osburgh
's
box
at
the
play
,
she
be
not
equally
at
ease


in
regard
to
some
less
apparent
lapse
from
convention
.
Ned
Silverton
's


relation
to
Stancy
seem
,
for
instance
,
close
and
less
clear
than
any


natural
affinity
would
warrant
;
and
both
appear
united
in
the
effort


to
cultivate
Freddy
Van
Osburgh
's
grow
taste
for
Mrs.
Hatch
.
there
be


as
yet
nothing
definable
in
the
situation
,
which
might
well
resolve


itself
into
a
huge
joke
on
the
part
of
the
other
two
;
but
Lily
have
a


vague
sense
that
the
subject
of
their
experiment
be
too
young
,
too
rich


and
too
credulous
.
 
her
embarrassment
be
increase
by
the
fact
that


Freddy
seem
to
regard
she
as
cooperate
with
himself
in
the
social


development
of
Mrs.
Hatch
:
a
view
that
suggest
,
on
his
part
,
a


permanent
interest
in
the
lady
's
future
.
there
be
moment
when
Lily


find
an
ironic
amusement
in
this
aspect
of
the
case
.
the
thought
of


launch
such
a
missile
as
Mrs.
Hatch
at
the
perfidious
bosom
of
society


be
not
without
its
charm
:
Miss
Bart
have
even
beguile
her
leisure
with


vision
of
the
fair
Norma
introduce
for
the
first
time
to
a
family


banquet
at
the
Van
Osburghs
'
.
but
the
thought
of
be
personally


connect
with
the
transaction
be
less
agreeable
;
and
her
momentary


flash
of
amusement
be
follow
by
increase
period
of
doubt
.




the
sense
of
these
doubt
be
uppermost
when
,
late
one
afternoon
,
she
be


surprised
by
a
visit
from
Lawrence
Selden
.
he
find
she
alone
in
the


wilderness
of
pink
damask
,
for
in
Mrs.
Hatch
's
world
the
tea
-
hour
be
not


dedicated
to
social
rite
,
and
the
lady
be
in
the
hand
of
her
masseuse
.




Selden
's
entrance
have
cause
Lily
an
inward
start
of
embarrassment
;
but


his
air
of
constraint
have
the
effect
of
restore
her
self
-
possession
,


and
she
take
at
once
the
tone
of
surprise
and
pleasure
,
wonder
frankly


that
he
should
have
trace
she
to
so
unlikely
a
place
,
and
ask
what


have
inspire
he
to
make
the
search
.




Selden
meet
this
with
an
unusual
seriousness
:
she
have
never
see
he
so


little
master
of
the
situation
,
so
plainly
at
the
mercy
of
any


obstruction
she
might
put
in
his
way
.
"
I
want
to
see
you
,
"
he
say
;


and
she
could
not
resist
observe
in
reply
that
he
have
keep
his
wish


under
remarkable
control
.
she
have
in
truth
feel
his
long
absence
as
one


of
the
chief
bitterness
of
the
last
month
:
his
desertion
have
wound


sensibility
far
below
the
surface
of
her
pride
.




Selden
meet
the
challenge
with
directness
.
"
why
should
I
have
come
,
unless


I
think
I
could
be
of
use
to
you
?
it
be
my
only
excuse
for
imagine


you
could
want
I
.
"




this
strike
she
as
a
clumsy
evasion
,
and
the
thought
give
a
flash
of


keenness
to
her
answer
.
"
then
you
have
come
now
because
you
think
you
can


be
of
use
to
I
?
"




he
hesitate
again
.
"
yes
:
in
the
modest
capacity
of
a
person
to
talk


thing
over
with
.
"




for
a
clever
man
it
be
certainly
a
stupid
beginning
;
and
the
idea
that


his
awkwardness
be
due
to
the
fear
of
she
attach
a
personal


significance
to
his
visit
,
chill
her
pleasure
in
see
he
.
even
under


the
most
adverse
condition
,
that
pleasure
always
make
itself
feel
:
she


might
hate
he
,
but
she
have
never
be
able
to
wish
he
out
of
the
room
.


she
be
very
near
hate
he
now
;
yet
the
sound
of
his
voice
,
the
way
the


light
fall
on
his
thin
dark
hair
,
the
way
he
sit
and
move
and
wear
his


clothe
--
she
be
conscious
that
even
these
trivial
thing
be
inweave


with
her
deep
life
.
in
his
presence
a
sudden
stillness
come
upon
she
,


and
the
turmoil
of
her
spirit
cease
;
but
an
impulse
of
resistance
to


this
steal
influence
now
prompt
she
to
say
:
"
it
be
very
good
of
you


to
present
yourself
in
that
capacity
;
but
what
make
you
think
I
have


anything
particular
to
talk
about
?
"




though
she
keep
the
even
tone
of
light
intercourse
,
the
question
be


frame
in
a
way
to
remind
he
that
his
good
office
be
unsought
;
and


for
a
moment
Selden
be
check
by
it
.
the
situation
between
they
be
one


which
could
have
be
clear
up
only
by
a
sudden
explosion
of
feeling
;


and
their
whole
training
and
habit
of
mind
be
against
the
chance
of


such
an
explosion
.
Selden
's
calmness
seem
rather
to
harden
into


resistance
,
and
Miss
Bart
's
into
a
surface
of
glitter
irony
,
as
they


face
each
other
from
the
opposite
corner
of
one
of
Mrs.
Hatch
's


elephantine
sofas
.
the
sofa
in
question
,
and
the
apartment
people
by
its


monstrous
mate
,
serve
at
length
to
suggest
the
turn
of
Selden
's
reply
.




"
Gerty
tell
I
that
you
be
act
as
Mrs.
Hatch
's
secretary
;
and
I
know


she
be
anxious
to
hear
how
you
be
get
on
.
"




Miss
Bart
receive
this
explanation
without
perceptible
softening
.
"
why


do
n't
she
look
I
up
herself
,
then
?
"
she
ask
.




"
because
,
as
you
do
n't
send
she
your
address
,
she
be
afraid
of
be


importunate
.
"
Selden
continue
with
a
smile
:
"
you
see
no
such
scruple


restrain
I
;
but
then
I
have
n't
as
much
to
risk
if
I
incur
your


displeasure
.
"




Lily
answer
his
smile
.
"
you
have
n't
incur
it
as
yet
;
but
I
have
an


idea
that
you
be
go
to
.
"




"
that
rest
with
you
,
do
n't
it
?
you
see
my
initiative
do
n't
go
beyond


put
myself
at
your
disposal
.
"




"
but
in
what
capacity
?
what
be
I
to
do
with
you
?
"
she
ask
in
the
same


light
tone
.




Selden
again
glance
about
Mrs.
Hatch
's
drawing
-
room
;
then
he
say
,
with


a
decision
which
he
seem
to
have
gather
from
this
final
inspection
:


"
you
be
to
let
I
take
you
away
from
here
.
"




Lily
flush
at
the
suddenness
of
the
attack
;
then
she
stiffen
under
it


and
say
coldly
:
"
and
may
I
ask
where
you
mean
I
to
go
?
"




"
back
to
Gerty
in
the
first
place
,
if
you
will
;
the
essential
thing
be


that
it
should
be
away
from
here
.
"




the
unusual
harshness
of
his
tone
might
have
show
she
how
much
the
word


cost
he
;
but
she
be
in
no
state
to
measure
his
feeling
while
her
own


be
in
a
flame
of
revolt
.
to
neglect
she
,
perhaps
even
to

too
late
for
public
vindication
.
 
Freddy
Van
Osburgh


be
not
to
marry
Mrs.
Hatch
;
he
have
be
rescue
at
the
eleventh


hour
--
some
say
by
the
effort
of
Gus
Trenor
and
Rosedale
--
and
despatch


to
Europe
with
old
Ned
Van
Alstyne
;
but
the
risk
he
have
run
would
always


be
ascribe
to
Miss
Bart
's
connivance
,
and
would
somehow
serve
as
a


sum
-
up
and
corroboration
of
the
vague
general
distrust
of
she
.
it
be


a
relief
to
those
who
have
hang
back
from
she
to
find
themselves
thus


justify
,
and
they
be
inclined
to
insist
a
little
on
her
connection


with
the
Hatch
case
in
order
to
show
that
they
have
be
right
.




Gerty
's
quest
,
at
any
rate
,
bring
up
against
a
solid
wall
of


resistance
;
and
even
when
Carry
Fisher
,
momentarily
penitent
for
she


share
in
the
Hatch
affair
,
join
her
effort
to
Miss
Farish
's
,
they
meet


with
no
well
success
.
Gerty
have
try
to
veil
her
failure
in
tender


ambiguity
;
but
Carry
,
always
the
soul
of
candour
,
put
the
case
squarely


to
her
friend
.




"
I
go
straight
to
Judy
Trenor
;
she
have
few
prejudice
than
the


other
,
and
besides
she
be
always
hate
Bertha
Dorset
.
but
what
have
you


do
to
she
,
Lily
?
at
the
very
first
word
about
give
you
a
start
she


flame
out
about
some
money
you
'd
get
from
Gus
;
I
never
know
she
so
hot


before
.
you
know
she
'll
let
he
do
anything
but
spend
money
on
his


friend
:
the
only
reason
she
be
decent
to
I
now
be
that
she
know
I
be
not


hard
up.--He
speculate
for
you
,
you
say
?
well
,
what
be
the
harm
?
he
have


no
business
to
lose
.
he
didn't
lose
?
then
what
on
earth
--
but
I
never


could
understand
you
,
Lily
!
"




the
end
of
it
be
that
,
after
anxious
enquiry
and
much
deliberation
,
Mrs.


Fisher
and
Gerty
,
for
once
oddly
unite
in
their
effort
to
help
their


friend
,
decide
on
place
she
in
the
work
-
room
of
Mme
.
Regina
's
renowned


millinery
establishment
.
even
this
arrangement
be
not
effect
without


considerable
negotiation
,
for
Mme
.
Regina
have
a
strong
prejudice
against


untrained
assistance
,
and
be
induce
to
yield
only
by
the
fact
that
she


owe
the
patronage
of
Mrs.
Bry
and
Mrs.
Gormer
to
Carry
Fisher
's


influence
.
she
have
be
willing
from
the
first
to
employ
Lily
in
the


show
-
room
:
as
a
displayer
of
hat
,
a
fashionable
beauty
might
be
a


valuable
asset
.
but
to
this
suggestion
Miss
Bart
oppose
a
negative
which


Gerty
emphatically
support
,
while
Mrs.
Fisher
,
inwardly
unconvinced
,


but
resign
to
this
late
proof
of
Lily
's
unreason
,
agree
that
perhaps


in
the
end
it
would
be
more
useful
that
she
should
learn
the
trade
.
to


Regina
's
work
-
room
Lily
be
therefore
commit
by
her
friend
,
and
there


Mrs.
Fisher
leave
she
with
a
sigh
of
relief
,
while
Gerty
's
watchfulness


continue
to
hover
over
she
at
a
distance
.




Lily
have
take
up
her
work
early
in
January
:
it
be
now
two
month
later
,


and
she
be
still
be
rebuke
for
her
inability
to
sew
spangle
on
a


hat
-
frame
.
as
she
return
to
her
work
she
hear
a
titter
pass
down
the


table
.
she
know
she
be
an
object
of
criticism
and
amusement
to
the


other
work
-
woman
.
they
be
,
of
course
,
aware
of
her
history
--
the
exact


situation
of
every
girl
in
the
room
be
know
and
freely
discuss
by
all


the
other
--
but
the
knowledge
do
not
produce
in
they
any
awkward
sense


of
class
distinction
:
it
merely
explain
why
her
untutored
finger
be


still
blunder
over
the
rudiment
of
the
trade
.
 
Lily
have
no
desire


that
they
should
recognize
any
social
difference
in
she
;
but
she
have


hope
to
be
receive
as
their
equal
,
and
perhaps
before
long
to
show


herself
their
superior
by
a
special
deftness
of
touch
,
and
it
be


humiliating
to
find
that
,
after
two
month
of
drudgery
,
she
still


betray
her
lack
of
early
training
.
 
Remote
be
the
day
when
she
might


aspire
to
exercise
the
talent
she
feel
confident
of
possess
;
only


experienced
worker
be
entrust
with
the
delicate
art
of
shaping
and


trim
the
hat
,
and
the
forewoman
still
hold
she
inexorably
to
the


routine
of
preparatory
work
.




she
begin
to
rip
the
spangle
from
the
frame
,
listen
absently
to
the


buzz
of
talk
which
rise
and
fall
with
the
come
and
go
of
Miss

's
active
figure
.
the
air
be
close
than
usual
,
because
Miss

,
who
have
a
cold
,
have
not
allow
a
window
to
be
open
even
during


the
noon
recess
;
and
Lily
's
head
be
so
heavy
with
the
weight
of
a


sleepless
night
that
the
chatter
of
her
companion

the
incoherence
of


a
dream

to
return
to
her
narrow
room

with
its
blotched
wallpaper
and


shabby
paint
;
and
she
hate
every
step
of
the
walk
thither
,
through
the


degradation
of
a

have
to

at
the


corner

usually
do
so

today
her
step

irresistibly
draw


toward
the

strike
across

just
opposite

the
eye
of
the
clerk

have
wait
on
she


before

slip
the
prescription
into
his
hand

there
could
be

confident
that
the


clerk
would
fill
it
without
hesitation
;

the
nervous
dread
of
a


refusal
,
or
even
of
an
expression
of
doubt

itself
to

the
clerk
have
read
the
prescription
without
comment
;
but
in
the
act
of


hand
out
the
bottle
he
pause
.




"

keep
the

back
,
choke


the
murmur
of
acquiescence

throat
;

when
at

that

the

when

pause
to
make
sure
of
his


change
they
emerge
from
the
hotel

cross
Sixth

again
.

contemptuous
note

the
neighbourhood

before
the
doorstep
at

look
up
with
an
air

incredulous

with
discolour
lace

the
pompeian
decoration

the
muddy


vestibule

look
back
at

with
a
visible


effort
:

recognize
the
heroism

offer
to
the
point

be

answer
,
in
the
first
sincere
word
she
have
ever
speak
to
he
.








that
evening
in
her
own
room
Miss
Bart

who
have
flee
early
from
the
heavy


fume
of
the
basement

-
table

sit
muse
upon
the
impulse
which
have


lead
she
to
unbosom
herself
to
Rosedale
.
beneath
it
she
discover
an


increase
sense
of
loneliness
--
a
dread
of
return
to
the
solitude
of


her
room
,
while
she
could
be
anywhere
else
,
or
in
any
company
but
she


own
.
circumstance
,
of
late
,
have
combine
to
cut
she
off
more
and
more


from
her
few
remain
friend
.
on
Carry
Fisher
's
part
the
withdrawal
be


perhaps
not
quite
involuntary
.
having
make
her
final
effort
on
Lily
's


behalf
,
and
land
she
safely
in
Mme
.
Regina
's
work
-
room
,
Mrs.
Fisher


seem
disposed
to
rest
from
her
labour
;
and
Lily
,
understand
the


reason
,
could
not
condemn
she
.
Carry
have
in
fact
come
dangerously
near
to


be
involve
in
the
episode
of
Mrs.
Norma
Hatch
,
and
it
have
take
some


verbal
ingenuity
to
extricate
herself
.
she
frankly
own
to
have


bring
Lily
and
Mrs.
Hatch
together
,
but
then
she
do
not
know
Mrs.


Hatch
--
she
have
expressly
warn
Lily
that
she
do
not
know
Mrs.


hatch
--
and
besides
,
she
be
not
Lily
's
keeper
,
and
really
the
girl
be


old
enough
to
take
care
of
herself
.
Carry
do
not
put
her
own
case
so


brutally
,
but
she
allow
it
to
be
thus
put
for
she
by
her
late
bosom


friend
,
Mrs.
Jack
Stepney
:
Mrs.
Stepney
,
tremble
over
the
narrowness
of


her
only
brother
's
escape
,
but
eager
to
vindicate
Mrs.
Fisher
,
at
whose


house
she
could
count
on
the
"
jolly
party
"
which
have
become
a
necessity


to
she
since
marriage
have
emancipate
she
from
the
Van
Osburgh
point
of


view
.




Lily
understand
the
situation
and
could
make
allowance
for
it
.
 
Carry


have
be
a
good
friend
to
she
in
difficult
day
,
and
perhaps
only
a


friendship
like
Gerty
's
could
be
proof
against
such
an
increase
strain
.


Gerty
's
friendship
do
indeed
hold
fast
;
yet
Lily
be
begin
to
avoid


she
also
.
for
she
could
not
go
to
Gerty
's
without
risk
of
meeting
Selden
;


and
to
meet
he
now
would
be
pure
pain
.
it
be
pain
enough
even
to
think


of
he
,
whether
she
consider
he
in
the
distinctness
of
her
waking


thought
,
or
feel
the
obsession
of
his
presence
through
the
blur
of
she


torment
night
.
that
be
one
of
the
reason
why
she
have
turn
again
to


Mrs.
Hatch
's
prescription
.
in
the
uneasy
snatch
of
her
natural
dream


he
come
to
she
sometimes
in
the
old
guise
of
fellowship
and
tenderness
;


and
she
would
rise
from
the
sweet
delusion
mock
and
empty
of
she


courage
.
but
in
the
sleep
which
the
phial
procure
she
sink
far
below


such
half
-
wake
visitation
,
sink
into
depth
of
dreamless
annihilation


from
which
she
wake
each
morning
with
an
obliterate
past
.




gradually
,
to
be
sure
,
the
stress
of
the
old
thought
would
return
;
but


at
least
they
do
not
importune
her
waking
hour
.
the
drug
give
she
a


momentary
illusion
of
complete
renewal
,
from
which
she
draw
strength
to


take
up
her
daily
work
.
the
strength
be
more
and
more
need
as
the


perplexity
of
her
future
increase
.
she
know
that
to
Gerty
and
Mrs.


Fisher
she
be
only
pass
through
a
temporary
period
of
probation
,


since
they
believe
that
the
apprenticeship
she
be
serve
at
Mme
.


Regina
's
would
enable
she
,
when
Mrs.
Peniston
's
legacy
be
pay
,
to


realize
the
vision
of
the
green
-
and
-
white
shop
with
the
full
competence


acquire
by
her
preliminary
training
.
but
to
Lily
herself
,
aware
that
the


legacy
could
not
be
put
to
such
a
use
,
the
preliminary
training
seem
a


waste
effort
.
she
understand
clearly
enough
that
,
even
if
she
could
ever


learn
to
compete
with
hand
form
from
childhood
for
their
special
work
,


the
small
pay
she
receive
would
not
be
a
sufficient
addition
to
she


income
to
compensate
she
for
such
drudgery
.
and
the
realization
of
this


fact
bring
she
recurringly
face
to
face
with
the
temptation
to
use
the


legacy
in
establish
her
business
.
once
instal
,
and
in
command
of


her
own
work
-
woman
,
she
believe
she
have
sufficient
tact
and
ability
to


attract
a
fashionable
clientele
;
and
if
the
business
succeed
she
could


gradually
lie
aside
money
enough
to
discharge
her
debt
to
Trenor
.
but
the


task
might
take
year
to
accomplish
,
even
if
she
continue
to
stint


herself
to
the
utmost
;
and
meanwhile
her
pride
would
be
crush
under
the


weight
of
an
intolerable
obligation
.




these
be
her
superficial
consideration
;
but
under
they
lurk
the


secret
dread
that
the
obligation
might
not
always
remain
intolerable
.


she
know
she
could
not
count
on
her
continuity
of
purpose
,
and
what


really
frighten
she
be
the
thought
that
she
might
gradually


accommodate
herself
to
remain
indefinitely
in

accommodate
herself
to
the
part
allot
she
on
the
Sabrina
,
and
as


she
have
so
nearly
drift
into
acquiescing
with
Stancy
's
scheme
for
the


advancement
of
Mrs.
Hatch
.
her
danger
lie
,
as
she
know
,
in
her
old


incurable
dread
of
discomfort
and
poverty
;
in
the
fear
of
that
mount


tide
of
dinginess
against
which
her
mother
have
so
passionately
warn


she
.
and
now
a
new
vista
of
peril
open
before
she
.
she
understand
that


Rosedale
be
ready
to
lend
her
money
;
and
the
longing
to
take
advantage


of
his
offer
begin
to
haunt
her
insidiously
.
it
be
of
course
impossible


to
accept
a
loan
from
Rosedale
;
but
proximate
possibility
hover


temptingly
before
she
.
she
be
quite
sure
that
he
would
come
and
see
she


again
,
and
almost
sure
that
,
if
he
do
,
she
could
bring
he
to
the
point


of
offer
to
marry
she
on
the
term
she
have
previously
reject
.
 
would


she
still
reject
they
if
they
be
offer
?
More
and
more
,
with
every


fresh
mischance
befall
she
,
do
the
pursue
fury
seem
to
take
the


shape
of
Bertha
Dorset
;
and
close
at
hand
,
safely
lock
among
she


paper
,
lie
the
mean
of
end
their
pursuit
.
the
temptation
,
which
she


scorn
of
Rosedale
have
once
enable
she
to
reject
,
now
insistently


return
upon
she
;
and
how
much
strength
be
leave
she
to
oppose
it
?




what
little
there
be
must
at
any
rate
be
husband
to
the
utmost
;
she


could
not
trust
herself
again
to
the
peril
of
a
sleepless
night
.


through
the
long
hour
of
silence
the
dark
spirit
of
fatigue
and


loneliness
crouch
upon
her
breast
,
leave
she
so
drain
of
bodily


strength
that
her
morning
thought
swam
in
a
haze
of
weakness
.
the
only


hope
of
renewal
lie
in
the
little
bottle
at
her
bed
-
side
;
and
how
much


long
that
hope
would
last
she
dare
not
conjecture

for
a
moment
on
the

out
on
the
afternoon

in

it
mitigate
the
ugliness
of
the

throw
a

veil
over
the


discourage

give

of

to

the

a
few
still
linger

their
departure
for
Europe
,

through

on
their
return
from
the

among
they
be
Mrs.

with

recline
in

lonely
splendour
of


a

later

Judy

by
Lady
Skiddaw

who

come
over
for
she


annual
tarpon
fishing
and
a
dip
into
"
the
street
.
"




this
fleeting
glimpse
of
her
past
serve
to
emphasize
the
sense
of


aimlessness
with
which
Lily
at
length
turn
toward
home
.
she
have
nothing


to
do
for
the
rest
of
the
day
,
nor
for
the

to
come

for
the

over
in

the

of
May
,
and
Miss
Bart
's


attendance
have
of
late
be
so
irregular
--
she
have
so
often
be
unwell
,


and
have
do
so
little
work
when
she
come
--
that
it
be
only
as
a
favour


that
her
dismissal
have
hitherto
be
defer
.




Lily
do
not
question
the
justice
of
the
decision
.
she
be
conscious
of


having
be
forgetful
,
awkward
and
slow
to
learn
.
it
be
bitter
to


acknowledge
her
inferiority
even
to
herself
,
but
the
fact
have
be


bring
home
to
she
that
as
a
bread
-
winner
she
could
never
compete
with


professional
ability
.
 
since
she
have
be
bring
up
to
be
ornamental
,


she
could
hardly
blame
herself
for
fail
to
serve
any
practical


purpose
;
but
the
discovery
put
an
end
to
her
console
sense
of
universal


efficiency
.




as
she
turn
homeward
her
thought
shrink
in
anticipation
from
the
fact


that
there
would
be
nothing
to
get
up
for
the
next
morning
.
the
luxury
of


lie
late
in
bed
be
a
pleasure
belong
to
the
life
of
ease
;
it
have
no


part
in
the
utilitarian
existence
of
the
boarding
-
house
.
she
like
to


leave
her
room
early
,
and
to
return
to
it
as
late
as
possible
;
and
she


be
walk
slowly
now
in
order
to
postpone
the
detest
approach
to
she


doorstep
.




but
the
doorstep
,
as
she
draw
near
it
,
acquire
a
sudden
interest
from


the
fact
that
it
be
occupy
--
and
indeed
fill
--
by
the
conspicuous


figure
of
Mr.
Rosedale
,
whose
presence
seem
to
take
on
an
add


amplitude
from
the
meanness
of
his
surrounding
.




the
sight
stir
Lily
with
an
irresistible
sense
of
triumph
.
 
Rosedale
,


a
day
or
two
after
their
chance
meeting
,
have
call
to
enquire
if
she
have


recover
from
her
indisposition
;
but
since
then
she
have
not
see
or


hear
from
he
,
and
his
absence
seem
to
betoken
a
struggle
to
keep


away
,
to
let
she
pass
once
more
out
of
his
life
.
if
this
be
the
case
,


his
return
show
that
the
struggle
have
be
unsuccessful

for
Lily
know


he
be
not
the
man
to
waste
his
time
in
an
ineffectual
sentimental


dalliance
.
he
be
too
busy
,
too
practical
,
and
above
all
too
much


preoccupy
with
his
own
advancement
,
to
indulge
in
such
unprofitable


aside

arrangement

this
statement

he

the
note

course

however
little
he
penetrate
its
motive

she
see
that
it


unmistakably
tend
to
strengthen
her
hold
over

the


sense
in

of
unexplained
scruple

resistance
have
the
same


attraction
as
the
delicacy
of
feature
,
the
fastidiousness
of
manner
,


which
give
she
an
external
rarity
,
an
air
of
be
impossible
to
match
.


as
he
advance
in
social
experience
this
uniqueness
have
acquire
a


great
value
for
he
,
as
though
he
be
a
collector
who
have
learn
to


distinguish
minor
difference
of
design
and
quality
in
some
long
-
covet


object
.




lily
,
perceive
all
this
,
understand
that
he
would
marry
she
at
once
,
on


the
sole
condition
of
a
reconciliation
with
Mrs.
Dorset
;
and
the


temptation
be
the
less
easy
to
put
aside
because
,
little
by
little
,


circumstance
be
break
down
her
dislike
for
Rosedale
.
the
dislike
,


indeed
,
still
subsist
;
but
it
be
penetrate
here
and
there
by
the


perception
of
mitigate
quality
in
he
:
of
a
certain
gross
kindliness
,


a
rather
helpless
fidelity
of
sentiment
,
which
seem
to
be
struggle


through
the
hard
surface
of
his
material
ambition
.




read
his
dismissal
in
her
eye
,
he
hold
out
his
hand
with
a
gesture


which
convey
something
of
this
inarticulate
conflict
.




"
if
you
'd
only
let
I
,
I
'd
set
you
up
over
they
all
--
I'd
put
you
where


you
could
wipe
your
foot
on
'em
!
"
he
declare
;
and
it
touch
she
oddly


to
see
that
his
new
passion
have
not
alter
his
old
standard
of
value
.








Lily
take
no
sleeping
-
drop
that
night
.
she
lie
awake
view
she


situation
in
the
crude
light
which
Rosedale
's
visit
have
shed
on
it
.
in


fend
off
the
offer
he
be
so
plainly
ready
to
renew
,
have
she
not


sacrifice
to
one
of
those
abstract
notion
of
honour
that
might
be


call
the
conventionality
of
the
moral
life
?
 
what
debt
do
she
owe
to


a
social
order
which
have
condemn
and
banish
she
without
trial
?
 
she


have
never
be
hear
in
her
own
defence
;
she
be
innocent
of
the
charge


on
which
she
have
be
find
guilty
;
and
the
irregularity
of
she


conviction
might
seem
to
justify
the
use
of
method
as
irregular
in


recover
her
lost
right
.
Bertha
Dorset
,
to
save
herself
,
have
not


scruple
to
ruin
she
by
an
open
falsehood
;
why
should
she
hesitate
to


make
private
use
of
the
fact
that
chance
have
put
in
her
way
?
after
all
,


half
the
opprobrium
of
such
an
act
lie
in
the
name
attach
to
it
.
 
call


it
blackmail
and
it
become
unthinkable
;
but
explain
that
it
injure
no


one
,
and
that
the
right
regain
by
it
be
unjustly
forfeit
,
and
he


must
be
a
formalist
indeed
who
can
find
no
plea
in
its
defence
.




the
argument
plead
for
it
with
Lily
be
the
old
unanswerable
one
of


the
personal
situation
:
the
sense
of
injury
,
the
sense
of
failure
,
the


passionate
craving
for
a
fair
chance
against
the
selfish
despotism
of


society
.
she
have
learn
by
experience
that
she
have
neither
the
aptitude


nor
the
moral
constancy
to
remake
her
life
on
new
line
;
to
become
a


worker
among
worker
,
and
let
the
world
of
luxury
and
pleasure
sweep
by


her
unregarded
.
she
could
not
hold
herself
much
to
blame
for
this


ineffectiveness
,
and
she
be
perhaps
less
to
blame
than
she
believe
.


inherit
tendency
have
combine
with
early
training
to
make
she
the


highly
specialized
product
she
be
:
an
organism
as
helpless
out
of
its


narrow
range
as
the
sea
-
anemone
tear
from
the
rock
.
she
have
be


fashion
to
adorn
and
delight
;
to
what
other
end
do
nature
round
the


rise
-
leaf
and
paint
the
humming
-
bird
's
breast
?
 
and
be
it
her
fault
that


the
purely
decorative
mission
be
less
easily
and
harmoniously
fulfil


among
social
being
than
in
the
world
of
nature
?
that
it
be
apt
to
be


hamper
by
material
necessity
or
complicate
by
moral
scruple
?




these
last
be
the
two
antagonistic
force
which
fight
out
their
battle


in
her
breast
during
the
long
watch
of
the
night
;
and
when
she
rise
the


next
morning
she
hardly
know
where
the
victory
lie
.
she
be
exhaust
by


the
reaction
of
a
night
without
sleep
,
come
after
many
night
of
rest


artificially
obtain
;
and
in
the
distort
light
of
fatigue
the
future


stretch
out
before
her
grey
,
interminable
and
desolate
.




she
lie
late
in
bed
,
refuse
the
coffee
and
fry
egg
which
the


friendly
irish
servant
thrust
through
her
door
,
and
hate
the
intimate


domestic
noise
of
the
house
and
the
cry
and
rumbling
of
the
street
.


her
week
of
idleness
have
bring
home
to
she
with
exaggerated
force
these


small
aggravation
of
the
boarding
-
house
world
,
and
she
yearn
for
that


other
luxurious
world
,
whose
machinery
be
so
carefully
conceal
that
one


scene
flow
into
another
without
perceptible
agency
.




at
length
she
rise
and
dress
.
since
she
have
leave
Mme
.
Regina
's
she
have


spend
her
day
in
the
street
,
partly
to
escape
from
the
uncongenial


promiscuity
of
the
boarding
-
house
,
and
partly
in
the
hope
that
physical


fatigue
would
help
she
to
sleep
.
but
once
out
of
the
house
,
she
could
not


decide
where
to
go
;
for
she
have
avoid
Gerty
since
her
dismissal
from


the
milliner
's
,
and
she
be
not
sure
of
a
welcome
anywhere
else
.




the
morning
be
in
harsh
contrast
to
the
previous
day
.
a
cold
grey
sky


threaten
rain
,
and
a
high
wind
drive
the
dust
in
wild
spiral
up
and


down
the
street
.
Lily
walk
up
Fifth
Avenue
toward
the
Park
,
hope
to


find
a
sheltered
nook
where
she
might
sit
;
but
the
wind
chill
she
,
and


after
an
hour
's
wandering
under
the
tossing
bough
she
yield
to
she


increase
weariness
,
and
take
refuge
in
a
little
restaurant
in


fifty
-
ninth
Street
.
she
be
not
hungry
,
and
have
mean
to
go
without


luncheon
;
but
she
be
too
tired
to
return
home
,
and
the
long
perspective


of
white
table
show
alluringly
through
the
window
.




the
room
be
full
of
woman
and
girl
,
all
too
much
engage
in
the
rapid


absorption
of
tea
and
pie
to
remark
her
entrance
.
a
hum
of
shrill
voice


reverberate
against
the
low
ceiling
,
leave
Lily
shut
out
in
a
little


circle
of
silence
.
she
feel
a
sudden
pang
of
profound
loneliness
.
she
have


lose
the
sense
of
time
,
and
it
seem
to
she
as
though
she
have
not
speak


to
any
one
for
day
.
her
eye
seek
the
face
about
she
,
crave
a


responsive
glance
,
some
sign
of
an
intuition
of
her
trouble
.
but
the


sallow
preoccupied
woman
,
with
their
bag
and
note
-
book
and
roll
of


music
,
be
all
engross
in
their
own
affair
,
and
even
those
who
sit
by


themselves
be
busy
run
over
proof
-
sheet
or
devouring
magazine


between
their
hurried
gulp
of
tea
.
 
Lily
alone
be
strand
in
a
great


waste
of
disoccupation
.




she
drink
several
cup
of
the
tea
which
be
serve
with
her
portion
of


stew
oyster
,
and
her
brain
feel
clear
and
lively
when
she
emerge


once
more
into
the
street
.
she
realize
now
that
,
as
she
sit
in
the


restaurant
,
she
have
unconsciously
arrive
at
a
final
decision
.
the


discovery
give
she
an
immediate
illusion
of
activity
:
it
be
exhilarate


to
think
that
she
have
actually
a
reason
for
hurry
home
.
 
to
prolong


her
enjoyment
of
the
sensation
she
decide
to
walk
;
but
the
distance
be


so
great
that
she
find
herself
glance
nervously
at
the
clock
on
the


way
.
one
of
the
surprise
of
her
unoccupied
state
be
the
discovery
that


time
,
when
it
be
leave
to
itself
and
no
definite
demand
be
make
on
it
,


can
not
be
trust
to
move
at
any
recognize
pace
.
 
usually
it
loiter
;


but
just
when
one
have
come
to
count
upon
its
slowness
,
it
may
suddenly


break
into
a
wild
irrational
gallop
.




she
find
,
however
,
on
reach
home
,
that
the
hour
be
still
early


enough
for
she
to
sit
down
and
rest
a
few
minute
before
put
her
plan


into
execution
.
the
delay
do
not
perceptibly
weaken
her
resolve
.
 
she


be
frightened
and
yet
stimulate
by
the
reserve
force
of
resolution


which
she
feel
within
herself
:
she
see
it
be
go
to
be
easy
,
a
great


deal
easy
,
than
she
have
imagine
.




at
five
o'clock
she
rise
,
unlock
her
trunk
,
and
take
out
a
seal


packet
which
she
slip
into
the
bosom
of
her
dress
.
even
the
contact


with
the
packet
do
not
shake
her
nerve
as
she
have
half
-
expect
it


would
.
she
seem
encase
in
a
strong
armour
of
indifference
,
as
though


the
vigorous
exertion
of
she
will
have
finally
benumb
her
fine


sensibility
.




she
dress
herself
once
more
for
the
street
,
lock
her
door
and
go


out
.
when
she
emerge
on
the
pavement
,
the
day
be
still
high
,
but
a


threat
of
rain
darken
the
sky
and
cold
gust
shake
the
sign
project


from
the
basement
shop
along
the
street
.
she
reach
Fifth
Avenue
and


begin
to
walk
slowly
northward
.
she
be
sufficiently
familiar
with
Mrs.


dorset
's
habit
to
know
that
she
could
always
be
find
at
home
after


five
.
 
she
might
not
,
indeed
,
be
accessible
to
visitor
,
especially
to
a


visitor
so
unwelcome
,
and
against
whom
it
be
quite
possible
that
she
have


guard
herself
by
special
order
;
but
Lily
have
write
a
note
which
she


mean
to
send
up
with
her
name
,
and
which
she
think
would
secure
she


admission
.




she
have
allow
herself
time
to
walk
to
Mrs.
Dorset
's
,
think
that
the


quick
movement
through
the
cold
evening
air
would
help
to
steady
she


nerve
;
but
she
really
feel
no
need
of
be
tranquillize
.
her
survey
of


the
situation
remain
calm
and
unwavering
.




as
she
reach
Fiftieth
Street
the
cloud
break
abruptly
,
and
a
rush
of


cold
rain
slant
into
her
face
.
she
have
no
umbrella
and
the
moisture


quickly
penetrate
her
thin
spring
dress
.
she
be
still
half
a
mile
from


her
destination
,
and
she
decide
to
walk
across
to
Madison
Avenue
and


take
the
electric
car
.
as
she
turn
into
the
side
street
,
a
vague
memory


stir
in
she
.
the
row
of
bud
tree
,
the
new
brick
and
limestone


house
-
front
,
the
Georgian
flat
-
house
with
flowerboxe
on
its
balcony
,


be
merge
together
into
the
setting
of
a
familiar
scene
.
 
it
be
down


this
street
that
she
have
walk
with
Selden
,
that
September
day
two
year


ago
;
a
few
yard
ahead
be
the
doorway
they
have
enter
together
.
the


recollection
loosen
a
throng
of
benumbed
sensation
--
longing

regret
,


imagining
,
the
throbbing
brood
of
the
only
spring
her
heart
have
ever


know
.
it
be
strange
to
find
herself
pass
his
house
on
such
an


errand
.
she
seem
suddenly
to
see
her
action
as
he
would
see
it
--
and
the


fact
of
his
own
connection
with
it
,
the
fact
that
,
to
attain
her
end
,
she


must
trade
on
his
name
,
and
profit
by
a
secret
of
his
past
,
chill
she


blood
with
shame
.
what
a
long
way
she
have
travel
since
the
day
of


their
first
talk
together
!
 
even
then
her
foot
have
be
set
in
the
path


she
be
now
follow
--
even
then
she
have
resist
the
hand
he
have
hold


out
.




all
her
resentment
of
his
fancied
coldness
be
sweep
away
in
this


overwhelming
rush
of
recollection
.
twice
he
have
be
ready
to
help


she
--
to
help
she
by
love
she
,
as
he
have
say
--
and
if
,
the
third
time
,


he
have
seem
to
fail
she
,
whom
but
herself
could
she
accuse
?
.
.
.


well
,
that
part
of
her
life
be
over
;
she
do
not
know
why
her
thought


still
clung
to
it
.
but
the
sudden
longing
to
see
he
remain
;
it
grow
to


hunger
as
she
pause
on
the
pavement
opposite
his
door
.
the
street
be


dark
and
empty
,
sweep
by
the
rain
.
she
have
a
vision
of
his
quiet
room
,
of


the
bookshelf
,
and
the
fire
on
the
hearth
.
she
look
up
and
see
a


light
in
his
window
;
then
she
cross
the
street
and
enter
the
house
.

the

look
as
she
have
picture
it
.
the
green

shade
lamp
make


tranquil
circle
of
light
in
the
gathering
dusk
,
a
little

on
the
hearth

Selden
's
easy

chair
,
which
stand
near
it
,
have
be


push
aside
when
he
rise
to
admit
she
.




he
have
check
his
first
movement
of
surprise
,
and
stand
silent
,
wait


for
she
to
speak
,
while
she
pause
a
moment
on
the
threshold
,
assail
by


a
rush
of
memory
.




the
scene
be
unchanged
.
she
recognize
the
row
of
shelf
from
which
he


have
take
down
his
La
Bruyere
,
and
the
worn
arm
of
the
chair
he
have


lean
against
while
she
examine
the
precious
volume
.
but
then
the
wide


September
light
have
fill
the
room
,
make
it
seem
a
part
of
the
outer


world
:
now
the
shaded
lamp
and
the
warm
hearth
,
detach
it
from
the


gather
darkness
of
the
street
,
give
it
a
sweet
touch
of
intimacy
.




become
gradually
aware
of
the
surprise
under
Selden
's
silence
,
Lily


turn
to
he
and
say
simply
:
"
I
come
to
tell
you
that
I
be
sorry
for


the
way
we
part
--
for
what
I
say
to
you
that
day
at
Mrs.
Hatch
's
.
"




the
word
rise
to
her
lip
spontaneously
.
even
on
her
way
up
the
stair
,


she
have
not
think
of
prepare
a
pretext
for
her
visit
,
but
she
now


feel
an
intense
longing
to
dispel
the
cloud
of
misunderstanding
that
hang


between
they
.




Selden
return
her
look
with
a
smile
.
"
I
be
sorry
too
that
we
should


have
part
in
that
way
;
but
I
be
not
sure
I
do
n't
bring
it
on
myself
.


luckily
I
have
foresee
the
risk
I
be
taking----
"




"
so
that
you
really
do
n't
care----
?
"
break
from
she
with
a
flash
of
she


old
irony
.




"
so
that
I
be
prepared
for
the
consequence
,
"
he
correct


good
-
humouredly
.
"
but
we
'll
talk
of
all
this
later
.
do
come
and
sit
by


the
fire
.
I
can
recommend
that
arm
-
chair
,
if
you
'll
let
I
put
a
cushion


behind
you
.
"




while
he
speak
she
have
move
slowly
to
the
middle
of
the
room
,
and
pause


near
his
writing
-
table
,
where
the
lamp
,
strike
upward
,
cast
exaggerated


shadow
on
the
pallour
of
her
delicately
-
hollow
face
.




"
you
look
tired
--
do
sit
down
,
"
he
repeat
gently
.




she
do
not
seem
to
hear
the
request
.
"
I
want
you
to
know
that
I
leave


Mrs.
Hatch
immediately
after
I
see
you
,
"
she
say
,
as
though
continue


her
confession
.




"
yes
--
yes
;
I
know
,
"
he
assent
,
with
a
rise
tinge
of
embarrassment
.




"
and
that
I
do
so
because
you
tell
I
to
.
before
you
come
I
have
already


begin
to
see
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
remain
with
she
--
for
the


reason
you
give
I
;
but
I
would
n't
admit
it
--
I
would
n't
let
you
see
that


I
understand
what
you
mean
.
"




"
ah
,
I
might
have
trust
you
to
find
your
own
way
out
--
don't
overwhelm


I
with
the
sense
of
my
officiousness
!
"




his
light
tone
,
in
which
,
have
her
nerve
be
steady
,
she
would
have


recognize
the
mere
effort
to
bridge
over
an
awkward
moment
,
jar
on


her
passionate
desire
to
be
understand
.
in
her
strange
state
of


extra
-
lucidity
,
which
give
she
the
sense
of
be
already
at
the
heart
of


the
situation
,
it
seem
incredible
that
any
one
should
think
it


necessary
to
linger
in
the
conventional
outskirt
of
word
-
play
and


evasion
.




"
it
be
not
that
--
I
be
not
ungrateful
,
"
she
insist
.
but
the
power
of


expression
fail
she
suddenly
;
she
feel
a
tremor
in
her
throat
,
and
two


tear
gather
and
fall
slowly
from
her
eye
.




Selden
move
forward
and
take
her
hand
.
"
you
be
very
tired
.
why
wo
n't


you
sit
down
and
let
I
make
you
comfortable
?
"




he
draw
she
to
the
arm
-
chair
near
the
fire
,
and
place
a
cushion
behind


her
shoulder
.




"
and
now
you
must
let
I
make
you
some
tea
:
you
know
I
always
have
that


amount
of
hospitality
at
my
command
.
"




she
shake
her
head
,
and
two
more
tear
run
over
.
but
she
do
not
weep


easily
,
and
the
long
habit
of
self
-
control
reassert
itself
,
though
she


be
still
too
tremulous
to
speak
.




"
you
know
I
can
coax
the
water
to
boil
in
five
minute
,
"
Selden


continue
,
speak
as
though
she
be
a
troubled
child
.




his
word
recall
the
vision
of
that
other
afternoon
when
they
have
sit


together
over
his
tea
-
table
and
talk
jestingly
of
her
future
.
there


be
moment
when
that
day
seem
more
remote
than
any
other
event
in
she


life
;
and
yet
she
could
always
relive
it
in
its
minute
detail
.




she
make
a
gesture
of
refusal
.
"
no
:
I
drink
too
much
tea
.
I
would
rather


sit
quiet
--
I
must
go
in
a
moment
,
"
she
add
confusedly
.




Selden
continue
to
stand
near
she
,
lean
against
the
mantelpiece
.
 
the


tinge
of
constraint
be
begin
to
be
more
distinctly
perceptible
under


the
friendly
ease
of
his
manner
.
her
self
-
absorption
have
not
allow
she


to
perceive
it
at
first
;
but
now
that
her
consciousness
be
once
more


put
forth
its
eager
feeler
,
she
see
that
her
presence
be
become


an
embarrassment
to
he
.
such
a
situation
can
be
save
only
by
an


immediate
outrush
of
feeling
;
and
on
Selden
's
side
the
determine


impulse
be
still
lack
.




the
discovery
do
not
disturb
Lily
as
it
might
once
have
do
.
 
she
have


pass
beyond
the
phase
of
well
-
breed
reciprocity
,
in
which
every


demonstration
must
be
scrupulously
proportion
to
the
emotion
it


elicit
,
and
generosity
of
feeling
be
the
only
ostentation
condemn
.


but
the
sense
of
loneliness
return
with
redoubled
force
as
she
see


herself
forever
shut
out
from
Selden
's
inmost
self
.
she
have
come
to
he


with
no
definite
purpose
;
the
mere
longing
to
see
he
have
direct
she
;


but
the
secret
hope
she
have
carry
with
she
suddenly
reveal
itself
in


its
death
-
pang
.




"
I
must
go
,
"
she
repeat
,
make
a
motion
to
rise
from
her
chair
.
"

I


may
not
see
you
again

a
long
time

to

a
change

come
over
Selden
's
face

its
guard
look
have


yield
to
an
expression
still
untinge
by
personal
emotion

full

gentle
understanding

more
completely


master
by
the
inner
urgency

the
moment

the
consciousness

divine
reluctance

I
down

remember
your

she
lay
her

on
his

they
look
at

with
a
kind


of
solemnity

live
between

also

leap


up

in
its
light
everything
else
dwindle
and
fall
away
from

she


understand
now
that
she
could
not
go
forth
and
leave
her
old
self
with


he
:
that
self
must
indeed
live
on
in
his
presence
,

it
must
still


continue
to

Selden
have
retain
her
hand
,
and
continue
to
scrutinize
she
with
a


strange
sense
of
foreboding
.
the
external
aspect
of
the
situation
have


vanish
for
he
as
completely
as
for
she
:
he
feel
it
only
as
one
of


those
rare
moment
which
lift
the
veil
from

afterward
how
the

play
of


the
flame
sharpen
the
depression
of
her
nostril

intensify
the


blackness
of
the

the
rain
have
cease
,

there
be
a


momentary
revival
of
light
in
the
upper
sky
.
Lily
walk
on
unconscious


of
her
surrounding
.
she
be
still
tread
the
buoyant
ether
which


emanate
from
the
high
moment
of
life

gradually
it
shrink
away
from

and
she
feel
the
dull
pavement
beneath

of


weariness
return
with
accumulate
force
,

for
a
moment
she

that

she
have
reach
the
corner

Fifth

that
in

there


be
seat
where
she
might
rest
.




that
melancholy
pleasure
-
ground
be
almost
deserted
when
she
enter
it
,


and
she
sink
down
on
an
empty
bench
in
the
glare
of
an
electric


street

.
the
warmth
of
the
fire
have
pass
out
of
her
vein
,
and
she


tell
herself
that
she
must
not
sit
long
in
the
penetrate
dampness
which


strike
up
from

her
will

seem
to
have
spend


itself
in
a

great
effort

lose
in
the

reaction


which
follow
on
an
unwonted
expenditure

besides
,
what
be


there
to
go
home
to
?
nothing
but
the
silence
of
her
cheerless
room
--
that


silence
of
the
night
which
may
be
more
racking
to
tired
nerve
than
the


most
discordant
noise
:
that
,
and
the
bottle
of
chloral
by
her
bed
.
the


thought
of
the
chloral
be
the
only
spot
of
light
in
the
dark
prospect

she
could
feel
its
lulling
influence
steal
over
she
already

she


be
trouble
by
the
thought
that
it
be
lose
its
power

she
dare
not


go
back
to
it
too
soon
.
of
late
the
sleep
it
have
bring
she
have
be


more
broken
and
less
profound
;
there
have
be
night
when
she
be


perpetually
float
up
through
it
to
consciousness
.
what
if
the
effect


of
the
drug
should
gradually
fail
,
as
all
narcotic
be
say
to
fail

she
remember
the
chemist
's
warning
against
increase
the
dose
;
and
she


have
hear
before
of
the
capricious
and
incalculable
action
of
the
drug
.


her
dread
of
return
to
a
sleepless
night
be
so
great
that
she


linger
on
,
hope
that
excessive
weariness
would
reinforce
the
wane


power
of
the
chloral
.

now
close

a
sense
of
warmth
and
return
life
,
and
she
bend
over
,
wonder


at
the
rosy
blur
of
the
little
face
,
the
empty
clearness
of
the
eye
,
the


vague
tendrilly
motion
of
the
folding
and
unfold
finger
.
at
first


the
burden
in
her
arm
seem
as
light
as
a
pink
cloud
or
a
heap
of
down
,


but
as
she
continue
to
hold
it
the
weight
increase
,
sink
deep
,
and


penetrate
she
with
a
strange
sense
of
weakness
,
as
though
the
child


enter
into
she
and
become
a
part
of
herself
.




she
look
up
,
and
see
Nettie
's
eye
rest
on
she
with
tenderness
and


exultation
.




"
would
n't
it
be
too
lovely
for
anything
if
she
could
grow
up
to
be
just


like
you
?
of
course
I
know
she
never
could
--
but
mother
be
always


dream
the
crazy
thing
for
their
child
.
"




lily
clasp
the
child
close
for
a
moment
and
lay
she
back
in
she


mother
's
arm
.




"
oh
,
she
must
not
do
that
--
I
should
be
afraid
to
come
and
see
she
too


often
!
"
she
say
with
a
smile
;
and
then
,
resist
Mrs.
Struther
's


anxious
offer
of
companionship
,
and
reiterate
the
promise
that
of


course
she
would
come
back
soon
,
and
make
George
's
acquaintance
,
and
see


the
baby
in
her
bath
,
she
pass
out
of
the
kitchen
and
go
alone
down


the
tenement
stair
.








as
she
reach
the
street
she
realize
that
she
feel
strong
and


happy
:
the
little
episode
have
do
she
good
.
it
be
the
first
time
she


have
ever
come
across
the
result
of
her
spasmodic
benevolence
,
and
the


surprised
sense
of
human
fellowship
take
the
mortal
chill
from
her
heart
.




it
be
not
till
she
enter
her
own
door
that
she
feel
the
reaction
of
a


deep
loneliness
.
it
be
long
after
seven
o'clock
,
and
the
light
and


odour
proceed
from
the
basement
make
it
manifest
that
the


boarding
-
house
dinner
have
begin
.
she
hasten
up
to
her
room
,
light
the


gas
,
and
begin
to
dress
.
she
do
not
mean
to
pamper
herself
any
long
,


to
go
without
food
because
her
surrounding
make
it
unpalatable
.
since
it


be
her
fate
to
live
in
a
boarding
-
house
,
she
must
learn
to
fall
in
with


the
condition
of
the
life
.
nevertheless
she
be
glad
that
,
when
she


descend
to
the
heat
and
glare
of
the
dining
-
room
,
the
repast
be
nearly


over
.








in
her
own
room
again
,
she
be
seize
with
a
sudden
fever
of
activity
.


for
week
past
she
have
be
too
listless
and
indifferent
to
set
she


possession
in
order
,
but
now
she
begin
to
examine
systematically
the


content
of
her
drawer
and
cupboard
.
 
she
have
a
few
handsome
dress


leave
--
survival
of
her
last
phase
of
splendour
,
on
the
Sabrina
and
in


London
--
but
when
she
have
be
oblige
to
part
with
her
maid
she
have
give


the
woman
a
generous
share
of
her
cast
-
off
apparel
.
the
remain


dress
,
though
they
have
lose
their
freshness
,
still
keep
the
long


unerre
line
,
the
sweep
and
amplitude
of
the
great
artist
's
stroke
,
and


as
she
spread
they
out
on
the
bed
the
scene
in
which
they
have
be
wear


rise
vividly
before
she
.
an
association
lurk
in
every
fold
:
each
fall


of
lace
and
gleam
of
embroidery
be
like
a
letter
in
the
record
of
she


past
.
she
be
startled
to
find
how
the
atmosphere
of
her
old
life


envelop
she
.
but
,
after
all
,
it
be
the
life
she
have
be
make
for
:


every
dawn
tendency
in
she
have
be
carefully
direct
toward
it
,
all


her
interest
and
activity
have
be
teach
to
centre
around
it
.
 
she


be
like
some
rare
flower
grow
for
exhibition
,
a
flower
from
which
every


bud
have
be
nip
except
the
crown
blossom
of
her
beauty
.




last
of
all
,
she
draw
forth
from
the
bottom
of
her
trunk
a
heap
of
white


drapery
which
fall
shapelessly
across
her
arm
.
it
be
the
Reynolds
dress


she
have
wear
in
the
Bry
tableaux
.
it
have
be
impossible
for
she
to
give


it
away
,
but
she
have
never
see
it
since
that
night
,
and
the
long


flexible
fold
,
as
she
shake
they
out
,
give
forth
an
odour
of
violet


which
come
to
she
like
a
breath
from
the
flower
-
edge
fountain
where
she


have
stand
with
Lawrence
Selden
and
disown
her
fate
.
she
put
back
the


dress
one
by
one
,
lay
away
with
each
some
gleam
of
light
,
some
note


of
laughter
,
some
stray
waft
from
the
rosy
shore
of
pleasure
.
she
be


still
in
a
state
of
highly
-
wrought
impressionability
,
and
every
hint
of


the
past
send
a
linger
tremor
along
her
nerve
.




she
have
just
close
her
trunk
on
the
white
fold
of
the
Reynolds
dress


when
she
hear
a
tap
at
her
door
,
and
the
red
fist
of
the
Irish


maid
-
servant
thrust
in
a
belate
letter
.
carry
it
to
the
light
,
Lily


read
with
surprise
the
address
stamp
on
the
upper
corner
of
the


envelope
.
it
be
a
business
communication
from
the
office
of
her
aunt
's


executor
,
and
she
wonder
what
unexpected
development
have
cause
they


to
break
silence
before
the
appoint
time
.
she
open
the
envelope
and
a


cheque
flutter
to
the
floor
.
as
she
stoop
to
pick
it
up
the
blood


rush
to
her
face
.
 
the
cheque
represent
the
full
amount
of
Mrs.


Peniston
's
legacy
,
and
the
letter
accompany
it
explain
that
the


executor
,
having
adjust
the
business
of
the
estate
with
less
delay


than
they
have
expect
,
have
decide
to
anticipate
the
date
fix
for
the


payment
of
the
bequest
.




Lily
sit
down
beside
the
desk
at
the
foot
of
her
bed
,
and
spread
out


the
cheque
,
read
over
and
over
the
TEN
thousand
dollar
write
across
it


in
a
steely
business
hand
.
ten
month
early
the
amount
it
stand
for
have


represent
the
depth
of
penury
;
but
her
standard
of
value
have
change


in
the
interval
,
and
now
vision
of
wealth
lurk
in
every
flourish
of


the
pen
.
as
she
continue
to
gaze
at
it
,
she
feel
the
glitter
of
the


vision
mount
to
her
brain
,
and
after
a
while
she
lift
the
lid
of


the
desk
and
slip
the
magic
formula
out
of
sight
.
 
it
be
easy
to


think
without
those
five
figure
dance
before
her
eye
;
and
she
have
a


great
deal
of
think
to
do
before
she
sleep
.




she
open
her
cheque
-
book
,
and
plunge
into
such
anxious
calculation
as


have
prolong
her
vigil
at
Bellomont
on
the
night
when
she
have
decide
to


marry
Percy
Gryce
.
poverty
simplifie
book
-
keeping
,
and
her
financial


situation
be
easy
to
ascertain
than
it
have
be
then
;
but
she
have
not


yet
learn
the
control
of
money
,
and
during
her
transient
phase
of


luxury
at
the
Emporium
she
have
slip
back
into
habit
of
extravagance


which
still
impair
her
slender
balance
.
a
careful
examination
of
she


cheque
-
book
,
and
of
the
unpaid
bill
in
her
desk
,
show
that
,
when
the


latter
have
be
settle
,
she
would
have
barely
enough
to
live
on
for
the


next
three
or
four
month
;
and
even
after
that
,
if
she
be
to
continue


her
present
way
of
living
,
without
earn
any
additional
money
,
all


incidental
expense
must
be
reduce
to
the
vanishing
point
.
she
hide
she


eye
with
a
shudder
,
behold
herself
at
the
entrance
of
that


ever
-
narrow
perspective
down
which
she
have
see
Miss
Silverton
's
dowdy


figure
take
its
despondent
way
.




it
be
no
long
,
however
,
from
the
vision
of
material
poverty
that
she


turn
with
the
great
shrinking
.
she
have
a
sense
of
deep


empoverishment
--
of
an
inner
destitution
compare
to
which
outward


condition
dwindle
into
insignificance
.
it
be
indeed
miserable
to
be


poor
--
to
look
forward
to
a
shabby
,
anxious
middle
-
age
,
lead
by
dreary


degree
of
economy
and
self
-
denial
to
gradual
absorption
in
the
dingy


communal
existence
of
the
boarding
-
house
.
but
there
be
something
more


miserable
still
--
it
be
the
clutch
of
solitude
at
her
heart
,
the
sense
of


be
sweep
like
a
stray
uproot
growth
down
the
heedless
current
of
the


year
.
that
be
the
feeling
which
possess
she
now
--
the
feeling
of
be


something
rootless
and
ephemeral
,
mere
spin
-
drift
of
the
whirling
surface


of
existence
,
without
anything
to
which
the
poor
little
tentacle
of
self


could
cling
before
the
awful
flood
submerge
they
.
and
as
she
look
back


she
see
that
there
have
never
be
a
time
when
she
have
have
any
real


relation
to
life
.
her
parent
too
have
be
rootless
,
blow
hither
and


thither
on
every
wind
of
fashion
,
without
any
personal
existence
to


shelter
they
from
its
shift
gust
.
she
herself
have
grow
up
without


any
one
spot
of
earth
be
dearer
to
she
than
another
:
there
be
no


centre
of
early
piety
,
of
grave
endear
tradition
,
to
which
she


heart
could
revert
and
from
which
it
could
draw
strength
for
itself
and


tenderness
for
other
.
in
whatever
form
a
slowly
-
accumulate
past
life


in
the
blood
--
whether
in
the
concrete
image
of
the
old
house
store
with


visual
memory
,
or
in
the
conception
of
the
house
not
build
with
hand
,


but
make
up
of
inherit
passion
and
loyalty
--
it
have
the
same
power
of


broaden
and
deepen
the
individual
existence
,
of
attach
it
by


mysterious
link
of
kinship
to
all
the
mighty
sum
of
human
striving
.




such
a
vision
of
the
solidarity
of
life
have
never
before
come
to
Lily
.


she
have
have
a
premonition
of
it
in
the
blind
motion
of
she


mate
-
instinct
;
but
they
have
be
check
by
the
disintegrating


influence
of
the
life
about
she
.
all
the
man
and
woman
she
know
be


like
atom
whirl
away
from
each
other
in
some
wild
centrifugal
dance
:


her
first
glimpse
of
the
continuity
of
life
have
come
to
she
that
evening


in
Nettie
Struther
's
kitchen
.




the
poor
little
working
-
girl
who
have
find
strength
to
gather
up
the


fragment
of
her
life
,
and
build
herself
a
shelter
with
they
,
seem
to


lily
to
have
reach
the
central
truth
of
existence
.
it
be
a
meagre


enough
life
,
on
the
grim
edge
of
poverty
,
with
scant
margin
for


possibility
of
sickness
or
mischance
,
but
it
have
the
frail
audacious


permanence
of
a
bird
's
nest
build
on
the
edge
of
a
cliff
--
a
mere
wisp
of


leave
and
straw
,
yet
so
put
together
that
the
life
entrust
to
it
may


hang
safely
over
the
abyss
.




yes
--
but
it
have
take
two
to
build
the
nest
;
the
man
's
faith
as
well
as


the
woman
's
courage
.
Lily
remember
Nettie
's
word
:
I
know
he
know
about


I
.
her
husband
's
faith
in
she
have
make
her
renewal
possible
--
it
be
so


easy
for
a
woman
to
become
what
the
man
she
love
believe
she
to
be
!


well
--
Selden
have
twice
be
ready
to
stake
his
faith
on
Lily
Bart
;
but


the
third
trial
have
be
too
severe
for
his
endurance
.
the
very
quality


of
his
love
have
make
it
the
more
impossible
to
recall
to
life
.
 
if
it
have


be
a
simple
instinct
of
the
blood
,
the
power
of
her
beauty
might
have


revive
it
.
but
the
fact
that
it
strike
deep
,
that
it
be
inextricably


wound
up
with
inherit
habit
of
thought
and
feeling
,
make
it
as


impossible
to
restore
to
growth
as
a
deep
-
root
plant
tear
from
its
bed
.


Selden
have
give
she
of
his
good
;
but
he
be
as
incapable
as
herself
of


an
uncritical
return
to
former
state
of
feeling
.




there
remain
to
she
,
as
she
have
tell
he
,
the
uplifting
memory
of
his


faith
in
she
;
but
she
have
not
reach
the
age
when
a
woman
can
live
on


her
memory
.
as
she
hold
Nettie
Struther
's
child
in
her
arm
the
frozen


current
of
youth
have
loose
themselves
and
run
warm
in
her
vein
:
the


old
life
-
hunger
possess
she
,
and
all
she
be
clamour
for
its
share


of
personal
happiness
.
yes
--
it
be
happiness
she
still
want
,
and
the


glimpse
she
have
catch
of
it
make
everything
else
of
no
account
.
one
by


one
she
have
detach
herself
from
the
baser
possibility
,
and
she
see


that
nothing
now
remain
to
she
but
the
emptiness
of
renunciation
.




it
be
grow
late
,
and
an
immense
weariness
once
more
possess
she
.


it
be
not
the
steal
sense
of
sleep
,
but
a
vivid
wakeful
fatigue
,
a


wan
lucidity
of
mind
against
which
all
the
possibility
of
the
future


be
shadow
forth
gigantically
.
she
be
appal
by
the
intense


cleanness
of
the
vision
;
she
seem
to
have
break
through
the
merciful


veil
which
intervene
between
intention
and
action
,
and
to
see
exactly


what
she
would
do
in
all
the
long
day
to
come
.
there
be
the
cheque
in


her
desk
,
for
instance
--
she
mean
to
use
it
in
pay
her
debt
to
Trenor
;


but
she
foresee
that
when
the
morning
come
she
would
put
off
do
so
,


would
slip
into
gradual
tolerance
of
the
debt
.
the
thought
terrify


she
--
she
dread
to
fall
from
the
height
of
her
last
moment
with
Lawrence


Selden
.
but
how
could
she
trust
herself
to
keep
she
foot
?
she
know
the


strength
of
the
oppose
impulse
-
she
could
feel
the
countless
hand
of


habit
drag
she
back
into
some
fresh
compromise
with
fate
.
she
feel
an


intense
longing
to
prolong
,
to
perpetuate
,
the
momentary
exaltation
of


her
spirit
.
if
only
life
could
end
now
--
end
on
this
tragic
yet
sweet


vision
of
lose
possibility
,
which
give
she
a
sense
of
kinship
with
all


the
love
and
forego
in
the
world
!




she
reach
out
suddenly
and
,
draw
the
cheque
from
her
writing
-
desk
,


enclose
it
in
an
envelope
which
she
address
to
her
bank
.
she
then


write
out
a
cheque
for
Trenor
,
and
place
it
,
without
an
accompany


word
,
in
an
envelope
inscribe
with
his
name
,
lay
the
two
letter
side


by
side
on
her
desk
.
after
that
she
continue
to
sit
at
the
table
,


sort
her
paper
and
writing
,
till
the
intense
silence
of
the
house


remind
she
of
the
lateness
of
the
hour
.
in
the
street
the
noise
of


wheel
have
cease
,
and
the
rumble
of
the
"
elevated
"
come
only
at
long


interval
through
the
deep
unnatural
hush
.
in
the
mysterious
nocturnal


separation
from
all
outward
sign
of
life
,
she
feel
herself
more


strangely
confront
with
her
fate
.
the
sensation
make
her
brain
reel
,


and
she
try
to
shut
out
consciousness
by
press
her
hand
against
she


eye
.
but
the
terrible
silence
and
emptiness
seem
to
symbolize
she


future
--
she
feel
as
though
the
house
,
the
street
,
the
world
be
all


empty
,
and
she
alone
leave
sentient
in
a
lifeless
universe
.




but
this
be
the
verge
of
delirium
.
.
.
she
have
never
hang
so
near
the


dizzy
brink
of
the
unreal
.
sleep
be
what
she
want
--
she
remember
that


she
have
not
close
her
eye
for
two
night
.
the
little
bottle
be
at
she


bed
-
side
,
wait
to
lay
its
spell
upon
she
.
she
rise
and
undress


hastily
,
hunger
now
for
the
touch
of
her
pillow
.
she
feel
so


profoundly
tired
that
she
think
she
must
fall
asleep
at
once
;
but
as


soon
as
she
have
lain
down
every
nerve
start
once
more
into
separate


wakefulness
.
it
be
as
though
a
great
blaze
of
electric
light
have
be


turn
on
in
her
head
,
and
her
poor
little
anguished
self
shrink
and


cower
in
it
,
without
know
where
to
take
refuge
.




she
have
not
imagine
that
such
a
multiplication
of
wakefulness
be


possible
:
her
whole
past
be
reenact
itself
at
a
hundred
different


point
of
consciousness
.
where
be
the
drug
that
could
still
this
legion


of
insurgent
nerve
?
the
sense
of
exhaustion
would
have
be
sweet


compare
to
this
shrill
beat
of
activity
;
but
weariness
have
drop


from
she
as
though
some
cruel
stimulant
have
be
force
into
her
vein
.




she
could
bear
it
--
yes
,
she
could
bear
it
;
but
what
strength
would
be


leave
she
the
next
day
?
Perspective
have
disappear
--
the
next
day
press


close
upon
she
,
and
on
its
heel
come
the
day
that
be
to
follow
--
they


swarm
about
she
like
a
shrieking
mob
.
 
she
must
shut
they
out
for
a
few


hour
;
she
must
take
a
brief
bath
of
oblivion
.
she
put
out
her
hand
,
and


measure
the
soothe
drop
into
a
glass
;
but
as
she
do
so
,
she
know


they
would
be
powerless
against
the
supernatural
lucidity
of
her
brain
.


she
have
long
since
raise
the
dose
to
its
high
limit
,
but
tonight
she


feel
she
must
increase
it
.
she
know
she
take
a
slight
risk
in
do


so
--
she
remember
the
chemist
's
warning
.
 
if
sleep
come
at
all
,
it
might


be
a
sleep
without
wake
.
but
after
all
that
be
but
one
chance
in
a


hundred
:
the
action
of
the
drug
be
incalculable
,
and
the
addition
of
a


few
drop
to
the
regular
dose
would
probably
do
no
more
than
procure
for


she
the
rest
she
so
desperately
need
....




she
do
not
,
in
truth
,
consider
the
question
very
closely
--
the
physical


crave
for
sleep
be
her
only
sustained
sensation
.
her
mind
shrink
from


the
glare
of
thought
as
instinctively
as
eye
contract
in
a
blaze
of


light
--
darkness
,
darkness
be
what
she
must
have
at
any
cost
.
she
raise


herself
in
bed
and
swallow
the
content
of
the
glass
;
then
she
blow
out


her
candle
and
lie
down
.




she
lie
very
still
,
wait
with
a
sensuous
pleasure
for
the
first


effect
of
the
soporific
.
she
know
in
advance
what
form
they
would


take
--
the
gradual
cessation
of
the
inner
throb
,
the
soft
approach
of


passiveness
,
as
though
an
invisible
hand
make
magic
pass
over
she
in


the
darkness
.
the
very
slowness
and
hesitancy
of
the
effect
increase
its


fascination
:
it
be
delicious
to
lean
over
and
look
down
into
the
dim


abyss
of
unconsciousness
.
tonight
the
drug
seem
to
work
more
slowly


than
usual
:
each
passionate
pulse
have
to
be
still
in
turn
,
and
it
be


long
before
she
feel
they
drop
into
abeyance
,
like
sentinel
fall


asleep
at
their
post
.
but
gradually
the
sense
of
complete
subjugation


come
over
she
,
and
she
wonder
languidly
what
have
make
she
feel
so


uneasy
and
excited
.
she
see
now
that
there
be
nothing
to
be
excite


about
--
she
have
return
to
her
normal
view
of
life
.
tomorrow
would
not
be


so
difficult
after
all
:
she
feel
sure
that
she
would
have
the
strength
to


meet
it
.
 
she
do
not
quite
remember
what
it
be
that
she
have
be
afraid


to
meet
,
but
the
uncertainty
no
long
trouble
she
.
she
have
be


unhappy
,
and
now
she
be
happy
--
she
have
feel
herself
alone
,
and
now
the


sense
of
loneliness
have
vanish
.




she
stir
once
,
and
turn
on
her
side
,
and
as
she
do
so
,
she
suddenly


understand
why
she
do
not
feel
herself
alone
.
it
be
odd
--
but
Nettie


struther
's
child
be
lie
on
her
arm
:
she
feel
the
pressure
of
its


little
head
against
her
shoulder
.
she
do
not
know
how
it
have
come
there
,


but
she
feel
no
great
surprise
at
the
fact
,
only
a
gentle
penetrating


thrill
of
warmth
and
pleasure
.
 
she
settle
herself
into
an
easy


position
,
hollow
her
arm
to
pillow
the
round
downy
head
,
and
hold


her
breath
lest
a
sound
should
disturb
the
sleep
child
.




as
she
lie
there
she
say
to
herself
that
there
be
something
she
must


tell
Selden
,
some
word
she
have
find
that
should
make
life
clear
between


they
.
she
try
to
repeat
the
word
,
which
linger
vague
and
luminous
on


the
far
edge
of
thought
--
she
be
afraid
of
not
remember
it
when
she


wake
;
and
if
she
could
only
remember
it
and
say
it
to
he
,
she
feel
that


everything
would
be
well
.




slowly
the
thought
of
the
word
fade
,
and
sleep
begin
to
enfold
she
.
 
she


struggle
faintly
against
it
,
feel
that
she
ought
to
keep
awake
on


account
of
the
baby
;
but
even
this
feeling
be
gradually
lose
in
an


indistinct
sense
of
drowsy
peace
,
through
which
,
of
a
sudden
,
a
dark


flash
of
loneliness
and
terror
tear
its
way
.




she
start
up
again
,
cold
and
tremble
with
the
shock
:
for
a
moment
she


seem
to
have
lose
her
hold
of
the
child
.
but
no
--
she
be
mistaken
--
the


tender
pressure
of
its
body
be
still
close
to
hers
:
the
recover
warmth


flow
through
she
once
more
,
she
yield
to
it
,
sink
into
it
,
and
sleep
.








chapter

the
next
morning
rise
mild
and
bright
,
with
a
promise
of
summer
in
the


air
.
the
sunlight
slant
joyously
down
Lily
's
street
,
mellow
the


blister
house

front
,
gild
the
paintless
railing
of
the
door
-
step
,


and
strike
prismatic
glory
from
the
pane
of
her
darken
window
.




when
such
a
day
coincide
with
the
inner
mood
there
be
intoxication
in


its
breath
;
and
Selden
,
hasten
along
the
street
through
the
squalor
of


its
morning
confidence
,
feel
himself
thrill
with
a
youthful
sense
of


adventure
.
he
have
cut
loose
from
the
familiar
shore
of
habit
,
and


launch
himself
on
uncharted
sea
of
emotion
;
all
the
old
test
and


measure
be
leave
behind
,
and
his
course
be
to
be
shape
by
new
star
.




that
course
,
for
the
moment
,
lead
merely
to
Miss
Bart
's
boarding
-
house
;


but
its
shabby
door
-
step
have
suddenly
become
the
threshold
of
the


untried
.
as
he
approach
he
look
up
at
the
triple
row
of
window
,


wonder
boyishly
which
one
of
they
be
hers
.
it
be
nine
o'clock
,
and


the
house
,
be
tenant
by
worker
,
already
show
an
awakened
front
to


the
street
.
he
remember
afterward
having
notice
that
only
one
blind


be
down
.
 
he
notice
too
that
there
be
a
pot
of
pansy
on
one
of
the


window
sill
,
and
at
once
conclude
that
the
window
must
be
her
:
it
be


inevitable
that
he
should
connect
she
with
the
one
touch
of
beauty
in
the


dingy
scene
.




nine
o'clock
be
an
early
hour
for
a
visit
,
but
Selden
have
pass
beyond


all
such
conventional
observance
.
he
only
know
that
he
must
see
Lily


Bart
at
once
--
he
have
find
the
word
he
mean
to
say
to
she
,
and
it
could


not
wait
another
moment
to
be
say
.
it
be
strange
that
it
have
not
come


to
his
lip
soon
--
that
he
have
let
she
pass
from
he
the
evening
before


without
be
able
to
speak
it
.
but
what
do
that
matter
,
now
that
a
new


day
have
come
?
it
be
not
a
word
for
twilight
,
but
for
the
morning
.




Selden
run
eagerly
up
the
step
and
pull
the
bell
;
and
even
in
his


state
of
self
-
absorption
it
come
as
a
sharp
surprise
to
he
that
the
door


should
open
so
promptly
.
it
be
still
more
of
a
surprise
to
see
,
as
he


enter
,
that
it
have
be
open
by
Gerty
Farish
--
and
that
behind
she
,
in


an
agitated
blur
,
several
other
figure
ominously
loom
.




"
Lawrence
!
"
Gerty
cry
in
a
strange
voice
,
"
how
could
you
get
here
so


quickly?"--and
the
tremble
hand
she
lay
on
he
seem
instantly
to


close
about
his
heart
.




he
notice
the
other
face
,
vague
with
fear
and
conjecture
--
he
see
the


landlady
be
impose
bulk
sway
professionally
toward
he
;
but
he
shrink


back
,
put
up
his
hand
,
while
his
eye
mechanically
mount
the
steep


black
walnut
stair
,
up
which
he
be
immediately
aware
that
his
cousin


be
about
to
lead
he
.




a
voice
in
the
background
say
that
the
doctor
might
be
back
at
any


minute
--
and
that
nothing
,
upstairs
,
be
to
be
disturb
.
some
one
else


exclaim
:
"
it
be
the
great
mercy--
"
then
Selden
feel
that
Gerty
have


take
he
gently
by
the
hand
,
and
that
they
be
to
be
suffer
to
go
up


alone
.




in
silence
they
mount
the
three
flight
,
and
walk
along
the
passage


to
a
closed
door
.
Gerty
open
the
door
,
and
Selden
go
in
after
she
.


though
the
blind
be
down
,
the
irresistible
sunlight
pour
a
temper


golden
flood
into
the
room
,
and
in
its
light
Selden
see
a
narrow
bed


along
the
wall
,
and
on
the
bed
,
with
motionless
hand
and
calm


unrecognize
face
,
the
semblance
of
Lily
Bart
.




that
it
be
her
real
self
,
every
pulse
in
he
ardently
deny
.
 
her
real


self
have
lain
warm
on
his
heart
but
a
few
hour
early
--
what
have
he
to


do
with
this
estranged
and
tranquil
face
which
,
for
the
first
time
,


neither
pale
nor
brighten
at
his
come
?




Gerty
,
strangely
tranquil
too
,
with
the
conscious
self
-
control
of
one
who


have
minister
to
much
pain
,
stand
by
the
bed
,
speak
gently
,
as
if


transmit
a
final
message
.




"
the
doctor
find
a
bottle
of
chloral

she
have
be
sleep
badly
for
a


long
time
,
and
she
must
have
take
an
overdose
by
mistake
....
there
be
no


doubt
of
that
--
no
doubt
--
there
will
be
no
question
--
he
have
be
very


kind
.
I
tell
he
that
you
and
I
would
like
to
be
leave
alone
with
she

to


go
over
her
thing
before
any
one
else

it

what

Selden
be
hardly
conscious
of
what
she
say
.
he
stand
look
down
on


the
sleep
face
which
seem
to
lie
like
a
delicate
impalpable
mask


over
the
live
lineament
he
have
know
.
 
he
feel
that
the
real
Lily
be


still
there
,
close
to
he
,
yet
invisible
and
inaccessible
;
and
the


tenuity
of
the
barrier
between
they
mock
he
with
a
sense
of


helplessness
.
there
have
never
be
more
than
a
little
impalpable
barrier


between
they
--
and
yet
he
have
suffer
it
to
keep
they
apart
!
 
and
now
,


though
it
seem
slighter
and
frailer
than
ever
,
it
have
suddenly
harden


to
adamant
,
and
he
might
beat
his
life
out
against
it
in
vain
.




he
have
drop
on
his
knee
beside
the
bed
,
but
a
touch
from
Gerty


arouse
he
.
he
stand
up
,
and
as
their
eye
meet
he
be
strike
by
the


extraordinary
light
in
his
cousin
's
face
.




"
you
understand
what
the
doctor
have
go
for
?
he
have
promise
that
there


shall
be
no
trouble
--
but
of
course
the
formality
must
be
go
through
.


and
I
ask
he
to
give
we
time
to
look
through
her
thing
first----
"




he
nod
,
and
she
glance
about
the
small
bare
room
.
"
it
wo
n't
take


long
,
"
she
conclude
.




"
no
--
it
wo
n't
take
long
,
"
he
agree
.




she
hold
his
hand
in
hers
a
moment
long
,
and
then
,
with
a
last
look
at


the
bed
,
move
silently
toward
the
door
.
on
the
threshold
she
pause
to


add
:
"
you
will
find
I
downstairs
if
you
want
I
.
"




Selden
rouse
himself
to
detain
she
.
"
but
why
be
you
go
?
she
would


have
wished----
"




Gerty
shake
her
head
with
a
smile
.
"
no
:
this
be
what
she
would
have


wished----
"
and
as
she
speak
a
light
break
through
Selden
's
stony
misery
,


and
he
see
deep
into
the
hidden
thing
of
love
.




the
door
close
on
Gerty
,
and
he
stand
alone
with
the
motionless
sleeper


on
the
bed
.
his
impulse
be
to
return
to
her
side
,
to
fall
on
his
knee
,


and
rest
his
throbbing
head
against
the
peaceful
cheek
on
the
pillow
.


they
have
never
be
at
peace
together
,
they
two
;
and
now
he
feel
himself


draw
downward
into
the
strange
mysterious
depth
of
her
tranquillity
.




but
he
remember
Gerty
's
warning
word
--
he
know
that
,
though
time
have


cease
in
this
room
,
its
foot
be
hasten
relentlessly
toward
the


door
.
Gerty
have
give
he
this
supreme
half
-
hour
,
and
he
must
use
it
as


she
will
.




he
turn
and
look
about
he
,
sternly
compel
himself
to
regain
his


consciousness
of
outward
thing
.
there
be
very
little
furniture
in
the


room
.
the
shabby
chest
of
drawer
be
spread
with
a
lace
cover
,
and
set


out
with
a
few
gold
-
top
box
and
bottle
,
a
rise
-
colour


pin
-
cushion
,
a
glass
tray
strew
with
tortoise
-
shell
hair
-
pin
--
he
shrink


from
the
poignant
intimacy
of
these
trifle
,
and
from
the
blank
surface


of
the
toilet
-
mirror
above
they
.




these
be
the
only
trace
of
luxury
,
of
that
cling
to
the
minute


observance
of
personal
seemliness
,
which
show
what
her
other


renunciation
must
have
cost
.
there
be
no
other
token
of
her
personality


about
the
room
,
unless
it
show
itself
in
the
scrupulous
neatness
of
the


scant
article
of
furniture
:
a
washing
-
stand
,
two
chair
,
a
small


writing
-
desk
,
and
the
little
table
near
the
bed
.
on
this
table
stand
the


empty
bottle
and
glass
,
and
from
these
also
he
avert
his
eye
.




the
desk
be
close
,
but
on
its
slanting
lid
lay
two
letter
which
he


take
up
.
one
bore
the
address
of
a
bank
,
and
as
it
be
stamp
and


seal
,
Selden
,
after
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
lay
it
aside
.
on
the
other


letter
he
read
Gus
Trenor
's
name
;
and
the
flap
of
the
envelope
be
still


ungumme
.




temptation
leapt
on
he
like
the
stab
of
a
knife
.
he
stagger
under
it
,


steady
himself
against
the
desk
.
why
have
she
be
write
to


trenor
--
writing
,
presumably
,
just
after
their
parting
of
the
previous


evening
?
the
thought
unhallow
the
memory
of
that
last
hour
,
make
a
mock


of
the
word
he
have
come
to
speak
,
and
defile
even
the
reconciling


silence
upon
which
it
fall
.
he
feel
himself
fling
back
on
all
the
ugly


uncertainty
from
which
he
think
he
have
cast
loose
forever
.
after
all
,


what
do
he
know
of
her
life
?
only
as
much
as
she
have
choose
to
show
he
,


and
measure
by
the
world
's
estimate
,
how
little
that
be
!
by
what


right
--
the
letter
in
his
hand
seem
to
ask
--
by
what
right
be
it
he
who


now
pass
into
her
confidence
through
the
gate
which
death
have
leave


unbarred
?
his
heart
cry
out
that
it
be
by
right
of
their
last
hour


together
,
the
hour
when
she
herself
have
place
the
key
in
his
hand
.


yes
--
but
what
if
the
letter
to
Trenor
have
be
write
afterward
?




he
put
it
from
he
with
sudden
loathing
,
and
set
his
lip
,
address


himself
resolutely
to
what
remain
of
his
task
.
after
all
,
that
task


would
be
easy
to
perform
,
now
that
his
personal
stake
in
it
be


annul
.




he
raise
the
lid
of
the
desk
,
and
see
within
it
a
cheque
-
book
and
a
few


packet
of
bill
and
letter
,
arrange
with
the
orderly
precision
which


characterize
all
her
personal
habit
.
he
look
through
the
letter


first
,
because
it
be
the
most
difficult
part
of
the
work
.
they
prove
to


be
few
and
unimportant
,
but
among
they
he
find
,
with
a
strange
commotion


of
the
heart
,
the
note
he
have
write
she
the
day
after
the
Brys
'


entertainment
.




"
when
may
I
come
to
you?"--his
word
overwhelm
he
with
a
realization


of
the
cowardice
which
have
drive
he
from
she
at
the
very
moment
of


attainment
.
yes
--
he
have
always
fear
his
fate
,
and
he
be
too
honest
to


disown
his
cowardice
now
;
for
have
not
all
his
old
doubt
start
to
life


again
at
the
mere
sight
of
Trenor
's
name
?




he
lay
the
note
in
his
card
-
case
,
fold
it
away
carefully
,
as


something
make
precious
by
the
fact
that
she
have
hold
it
so
;
then
,


grow
once
more
aware
of
the
lapse
of
time
,
he
continue
his


examination
of
the
paper
.




to
his
surprise
,
he
find
that
all
the
bill
be
receipt
;
there
be


not
an
unpaid
account
among
they
.
he
open
the
cheque
-
book
,
and
see


that
,
the
very
night
before
,
a
cheque
of
ten
thousand
dollar
from
Mrs.


Peniston
's
executor
have
be
enter
in
it
.
the
legacy
,
then
,
have
be


pay
soon
than
Gerty
have
lead
he
to
expect
.
but
,
turn
another
page


or
two
,
he
discover
with
astonishment
that
,
in
spite
of
this
recent


accession
of
fund
,
the
balance
have
already
decline
to
a
few
dollar
.
 
a


rapid
glance
at
the
stub
of
the
last
cheque
,
all
of
which
bear
the
date


of
the
previous
day
,
show
that
between
four
or
five
hundred
dollar
of


the
legacy
have
be
spend
in
the
settlement
of
bill
,
while
the
remain


thousand
be
comprehend
in
one
cheque
,
make
out
,
at
the
same
time
,
to


Charles
Augustus
Trenor
.




Selden
lay
the
book
aside
,
and
sink
into
the
chair
beside
the
desk
.
he


lean
his
elbow
on
it
,
and
hide
his
face
in
his
hand
.
the
bitter
water


of
life
surge
high
about
he
,
their
sterile
taste
be
on
his
lip
.
do


the
cheque
to
Trenor
explain
the
mystery
or
deepen
it
?
at
first
his
mind


refuse
to
act
--
he
feel
only
the
taint
of
such
a
transaction
between
a


man
like
Trenor
and
a
girl
like
Lily
Bart
.
then
,
gradually
,
his
troubled


vision
clear
,
old
hint
and
rumour
come
back
to
he
,
and
out
of
the


very
insinuation
he
have
fear
to
probe
,
he
construct
an
explanation


of
the
mystery
.
it
be
true
,
then
,
that
she
have
take
money
from
Trenor
;


but
true
also
,
as
the
content
of
the
little
desk
declare
,
that
the


obligation
have
be
intolerable
to
she
,
and
that
at
the
first
opportunity


she
have
free
herself
from
it
,
though
the
act
leave
her
face
to
face
with


bare
unmitigated
poverty
.




that
be
all
he
know
--
all
he
could
hope
to
unravel
of
the
story
.
 
the


mute
lip
on
the
pillow
refuse
he
more
than
this
--
unless
indeed
they


have
tell
he
the
rest
in
the
kiss
they
have
leave
upon
his
forehead
.
yes
,


he
could
now
read
into
that
farewell
all
that
his
heart
crave
to
find


there
;
he
could
even
draw
from
it
courage
not
to
accuse
himself
for


having
fail
to
reach
the
height
of
his
opportunity
.




he
see
that
all
the
condition
of
life
have
conspire
to
keep
they
apart
;


since
his
very
detachment
from
the
external
influence
which
sway
she


have
increase
his
spiritual
fastidiousness
,
and
make
it
more
difficult


for
he
to
live
and
love
uncritically
.
but
at
least
he
have
love
she
--
have


be
willing
to
stake
his
future
on
his
faith
in
she
--
and
if
the
moment


have
be
fate
to
pass
from
they
before
they
could
seize
it
,
he
see
now


that
,
for
both
,
it
have
be
save
whole
out
of
the
ruin
of
their
life
.




it
be
this
moment
of
love
,
this
fleeting
victory
over
themselves
,
which


have
keep
they
from
atrophy
and
extinction
;
which
,
in
she
,
have
reach
out


to
he
in
every
struggle
against
the
influence
of
her
surrounding
,
and


in
he
,
have
keep
alive
the
faith
that
now
draw
he
penitent
and


reconcile
to
her
side
.




he
kneel
by
the
bed
and
bend
over
she
,
drain
their
last
moment
to
its


lee
;
and
in
the
silence
there
pass
between
they
the
word
which
make


all
clear
.








the
END
