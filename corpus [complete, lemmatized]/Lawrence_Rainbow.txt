how
TOM
BRANGWEN
marry
a
POLISH
LADY






I




the
Brangwens
have
live
for
generation
on
the
Marsh
Farm
,
in
the


meadow
where
the
Erewash
twist
sluggishly
through
alder
tree
,


separate
Derbyshire
from
Nottinghamshire
.
two
mile
away
,
a


church
-
tower
stand
on
a
hill
,
the
house
of
the
little
country
town


climb
assiduously
up
to
it
.
whenever
one
of
the
Brangwens
in
the


field
lift
his
head
from
his
work
,
he
see
the
church
-
tower
at


Ilkeston
in
the
empty
sky
.
so
that
as
he
turn
again
to
the
horizontal


land
,
he
be
aware
of
something
stand
above
he
and
beyond
he
in


the
distance
.




there
be
a
look
in
the
eye
of
the
Brangwens
as
if
they
be
expect


something
unknown
,
about
which
they
be
eager
.
they
have
that
air
of


readiness
for
what
would
come
to
they
,
a
kind
of
surety
,
an
expectancy
,


the
look
of
an
inheritor
.




they
be
fresh
,
blond
,
slow
-
speak
people
,
reveal
themselves


plainly
,
but
slowly
,
so
that
one
could
watch
the
change
in
their
eye


from
laughter
to
anger
,
blue
,
light
-
up
laughter
,
to
a
hard
blue
-
stare


anger
;
through
all
the
irresolute
stage
of
the
sky
when
the
weather
be


change
.




live
on
rich
land
,
on
their
own
land
,
near
to
a
grow
town
,
they


have
forget
what
it
be
to
be
in
straitened
circumstance
.
they
have


never
become
rich
,
because
there
be
always
child
,
and
the


patrimony
be
divide
every
time
.
but
always
,
at
the
Marsh
,
there
be


ample
.




so
the
Brangwens
come
and
go
without
fear
of
necessity
,
work
hard


because
of
the
life
that
be
in
they
,
not
for
want
of
the
money
.


neither
be
they
thriftless
.
they
be
aware
of
the
last
halfpenny
,


and
instinct
make
they
not
waste
the
peeling
of
their
apple
,
for
it


would
help
to
feed
the
cattle
.
but
heaven
and
earth
be
teem
around


they
,
and
how
should
this
cease
?
they
feel
the
rush
of
the
sap
in


spring
,
they
know
the
wave
which
can
not
halt
,
but
every
year
throw


forward
the
seed
to
beget
,
and
,
fall
back
,
leave
the
young
-
bear


on
the
earth
.
they
know
the
intercourse
between
heaven
and
earth
,


sunshine
draw
into
the
breast
and
bowel
,
the
rain
suck
up
in
the


daytime
,
nakedness
that
come
under
the
wind
in
autumn
,
show
the


bird
’
nest
no
long
worth
hide
.
their
life
and
interrelation
be


such
;
feel
the
pulse
and
body
of
the
soil
,
that
open
to
their


furrow
for
the
grain
,
and
become
smooth
and
supple
after
their


plough
,
and
clung
to
their
foot
with
a
weight
that
pull
like


desire
,
lie
hard
and
unresponsive
when
the
crop
be
to
be
shorn


away
.
the
young
corn
wave
and
be
silken
,
and
the
lustre
slide
along


the
limb
of
the
man
who
see
it
.
they
take
the
udder
of
the
cow
,
the


cow
yield
milk
and
pulse
against
the
hand
of
the
man
,
the
pulse
of


the
blood
of
the
teat
of
the
cow
beat
into
the
pulse
of
the
hand
of


the
man
.
they
mount
their
horse
,
and
hold
life
between
the
grip
of


their
knee
,
they
harness
their
horse
at
the
wagon
,
and
,
with
hand


on
the
bridle
-
ring
,
draw
the
heaving
of
the
horse
after
their
will
.




in
autumn
the
partridge
whir
up
,
bird
in
flock
blow
like
spray


across
the
fallow
,
rook
appear
on
the
grey
,
watery
heaven
,
and
fly


caw
into
the
winter
.
then
the
man
sit
by
the
fire
in
the
house
where


the
woman
move
about
with
surety
,
and
the
limb
and
the
body
of
the


man
be
impregnate
with
the
day
,
cattle
and
earth
and
vegetation
and


the
sky
,
the
man
sit
by
the
fire
and
their
brain
be
inert
,
as
their


blood
flow
heavy
with
the
accumulation
from
the
live
day
.




the
woman
be
different
.
on
they
too
be
the
drowse
of
blood
-
intimacy
,


calf
suck
and
hen
run
together
in
drove
,
and
young
geese


palpitating
in
the
hand
while
the
food
be
push
down
their
throttle
.


but
the
woman
look
out
from
the
heated
,
blind
intercourse
of


farm
-
life
,
to
the
spoken
world
beyond
.
they
be
aware
of
the
lip
and


the
mind
of
the
world
speak
and
give
utterance
,
they
hear
the


sound
in
the
distance
,
and
they
strain
to
listen
.




it
be
enough
for
the
man
,
that
the
earth
heave
and
open
its
furrow


to
they
,
that
the
wind
blow
to
dry
the
wet
wheat
,
and
set
the
young


ear
of
corn
wheel
freshly
round
about
;
it
be
enough
that
they


help
the
cow
in
labour
,
or
ferret
the
rat
from
under
the
barn
,
or


break
the
back
of
a
rabbit
with
a
sharp
knock
of
the
hand
.
so
much


warmth
and
generating
and
pain
and
death
do
they
know
in
their
blood
,


earth
and
sky
and
beast
and
green
plant
,
so
much
exchange
and


interchange
they
have
with
these
,
that
they
live
full
and
surcharge
,


their
sense
full
fed
,
their
face
always
turn
to
the
heat
of
the


blood
,
stare
into
the
sun
,
daze
with
look
towards
the
source
of


generation
,
unable
to
turn
round
.




but
the
woman
want
another
form
of
life
than
this
,
something
that
be


not
blood
-
intimacy
.
her
house
face
out
from
the
farm
-
building
and


field
,
look
out
to
the
road
and
the
village
with
church
and
Hall
and


the
world
beyond
.
she
stand
to
see
the
far
-
off
world
of
city
and


government
and
the
active
scope
of
man
,
the
magic
land
to
she
,
where


secret
be
make
known
and
desire
fulfil
.
she
face
outward
to


where
man
move
dominant
and
creative
,
having
turn
their
back
on
the


pulse
heat
of
creation
,
and
with
this
behind
they
,
be
set
out
to


discover
what
be
beyond
,
to
enlarge
their
own
scope
and
range
and


freedom
;
whereas
the
Brangwen
man
face
inward
to
the
teem
life
of


creation
,
which
pour
unresolved
into
their
vein
.




look
out
,
as
she
must
,
from
the
front
of
her
house
towards
the


activity
of
man
in
the
world
at
large
,
whilst
her
husband
look
out
to


the
back
at
sky
and
harvest
and
beast
and
land
,
she
strain
her
eye


to
see
what
man
have
do
in
fight
outward
to
knowledge
,
she


strained
to
hear
how
he
utter
himself
in
his
conquest
,
her
deep


desire
hang
on
the
battle
that
she
hear
,
far
off
,
be
wage
on
the


edge
of
the
unknown
.
she
also
want
to
know
,
and
to
be
of
the
fighting


host
.




at
home
,
even
so
near
as
Cossethay
,
be
the
vicar
,
who
speak
the
other
,


magic
language
,
and
have
the
other
,
fine
bearing
,
both
of
which
she


could
perceive
,
but
could
never
attain
to
.
the
vicar
move
in
world


beyond
where
her
own
menfolk
exist
.
do
she
not
know
her
own
menfolk
:


fresh
,
slow
,
full
-
build
man
,
masterful
enough
,
but
easy
,
native
to
the


earth
,
lack
outwardness
and
range
of
motion
.
whereas
the
vicar
,
dark


and
dry
and
small
beside
her
husband
,
have
yet
a
quickness
and
a
range


of
be
that
make
Brangwen
,
in
his
large
geniality
,
seem
dull
and


local
.
she
know
her
husband
.
but
in
the
vicar
’s
nature
be
that
which


pass
beyond
her
knowledge
.
as
Brangwen
have
power
over
the
cattle
so


the
vicar
have
power
over
her
husband
.
what
be
it
in
the
vicar
,
that


raise
he
above
the
common
man
as
man
be
raise
above
the
beast
?
she


crave
to
know
.
she
crave
to
achieve
this
high
being
,
if
not
in


herself
,
then
in
her
child
.
that
which
make
a
man
strong
even
if
he


be
little
and
frail
in
body
,
just
as
any
man
be
little
and
frail
beside


a
bull
,
and
yet
strong
than
the
bull
,
what
be
it
?
it
be
not
money


nor
power
nor
position
.
what
power
have
the
vicar
over
Tom


brangwen
—
none
.
yet
strip
they
and
set
they
on
a
desert
island
,
and
the


vicar
be
the
master
.
his
soul
be
master
of
the
other
man
’s
.
and


why
—
why
?
she
decide
it
be
a
question
of
knowledge
.




the
curate
be
poor
enough
,
and
not
very
efficacious
as
a
man
,
either
,


yet
he
take
rank
with
those
other
,
the
superior
.
she
watch
his


child
be
bear
,
she
see
they
run
as
tiny
thing
beside
their


mother
.
and
already
they
be
separate
from
her
own
child
,
distinct
.


why
be
her
own
child
mark
below
the
other
?
why
should
the


curate
’s
child
inevitably
take
precedence
over
her
child
,
why


should
dominance
be
give
they
from
the
start
?
it
be
not
money
,
nor


even
class
.
it
be
education
and
experience
,
she
decide
.




it
be
this
,
this
education
,
this
high
form
of
be
,
that
the
mother


wish
to
give
to
her
child
,
so
that
they
too
could
live
the
supreme


life
on
earth
.
for
her
child
,
at
least
the
child
of
her
heart
,


have
the
complete
nature
that
should
take
place
in
equality
with
the


live
,
vital
people
in
the
land
,
not
be
leave
behind
obscure
among
the


labourer
.
why
must
they
remain
obscure
and
stifle
all
their
life
,


why
should
they
suffer
from
lack
of
freedom
to
move
?
how
should
they


learn
the
entry
into
the
fine
,
more
vivid
circle
of
life
?




her
imagination
be
fire
by
the
squire
’s
lady
at
Shelly
Hall
,
who

and
delicate

it
that


Mrs.
Hardy
feel
which
she
,
Mrs.
Brangwen
,
do
not
feel
?
how
be
Mrs.


hardy
’s
nature
different
from
that
of
the
common
woman
of
Cossethay
,
in


what
be
it
beyond
they
?
all
the

talk
eagerly


about
Mrs.

,
of
her
husband
,

life
a
different
thing
,
fine
,
big
?


and
why

he
?
it


be
the

thing
.

fill
in
by
such
man
as
the
vicar
and


Lord
William
,
lean
,
eager
man
with
strange
movement
,
man

command
of
the
further
field
,
whose
life
range
over
a
great
extent
.


ah
,
it
be
something
very
desirable
to
know
,
this
touch
of
the


wonderful
man
who
have
the
power
of
thought
and
comprehension
.
the
woman


of
the
village
might
be
much
fonder
of
Tom
Brangwen
,
and
more
at
their


ease
with
he
,
yet
if
their
life
have
be
rob
of
the
vicar
,
and
of


Lord
William
,
the
lead
shoot
would
have
be
cut
away
from
they
,


they
would
have
be
heavy
and
uninspired
and
incline
to
hate
.
so
long


as
the
wonder
of
the
beyond
be
before
they
,
they
could
get
along
,


whatever
their
lot
.
and
Mrs.
Hardy
,
and
the
vicar
,
and
Lord
William
,


these
move
in
the
wonder
of
the
beyond
,
and
be
visible
to
the
eye


of
Cossethay
in
their
motion
.




II




about
1840
,
a
canal
be
construct
across
the
meadow
of
the
Marsh


farm
,
connect
the
newly
-
open
colliery
of
the
Erewash
Valley
.
a


high
embankment
travel
along
the
field
to
carry
the
canal
,
which


pass
close
to
the
homestead
,
and
,
reach
the
road
,
go
over
in
a


heavy
bridge
.




so
the
Marsh
be
shut
off
from
Ilkeston
,
and
enclose
in
the
small


valley
bed
,
which
end
in
a
bushy
hill
and
the
village
spire
of


Cossethay
.




the
Brangwens
receive
a
fair
sum
of
money
from
this
trespass
across


their
land
.
then
,
a
short
time
afterwards
,
a
colliery
be
sink
on
the


other
side
of
the
canal
,
and
in
a
while
the
Midland
Railway
come
down


the
valley
at
the
foot
of
the
Ilkeston
hill
,
and
the
invasion
be


complete
.
the
town
grow
rapidly
,
the
Brangwens
be
keep
busy
produce


supply
,
they
become
rich
,
they
be
almost
tradesman
.




still
the
Marsh
remain
remote
and
original
,
on
the
old
,
quiet
side
of


the
canal
embankment
,
in
the
sunny
valley
where
slow
water
wind
along


in
company
of
stiff
alder
,
and
the
road
go
under
ash
-
tree
past
the


Brangwens
’
garden
gate
.




but
,
look
from
the
garden
gate
down
the
road
to
the
right
,
there
,


through
the
dark
archway
of
the
canal
’s
square
aqueduct
,
be
a
colliery


spin
away
in
the
near
distance
,
and
far
,
red
,
crude
house


plaster
on
the
valley
in
masse
,
and
beyond
all
,
the
dim
smoking
hill


of
the
town
.




the
homestead
be
just
on
the
safe
side
of
civilization
,
outside
the


gate
.
the
house
stand
bare
from
the
road
,
approach
by
a
straight


garden
path
,
along
which
at
spring
the
daffodil
be
thick
in
green


and
yellow
.
at
the
side
of
the
house
be
bush
of
lilac
and


guelder
-
rose
and
privet
,
entirely
hide
the
farm
building
behind
.




at
the
back
a
confusion
of
shed
spread
into
the
home
-
close
from
out
of


two
or
three
indistinct
yard
.
the
duck
-
pond
lie
beyond
the
furth


wall
,
litter
its
white
feather
on
the
padded
earthen
bank
,
blow


its
stray
soil
feather
into
the
grass
and
the
gorse
bush
below
the


canal
embankment
,
which
rise
like
a
high
rampart
near
at
hand
,
so
that


occasionally
a
man
’s
figure
pass
in
silhouette
,
or
a
man
and
a
tow


horse
traverse
the
sky
.




at
first
the
Brangwens
be
astonish
by
all
this
commotion
around


they
.
the
building
of
a
canal
across
their
land
make
they
stranger
in


their
own
place
,
this
raw
bank
of
earth
shut
they
off
disconcert


they
.
as
they
work
in
the
field
,
from
beyond
the
now
familiar


embankment
come
the
rhythmic
run
of
the
wind
engine
,
startle
at


first
,
but
afterwards
a
narcotic
to
the
brain
.
then
the
shrill
whistle


of
the
train
re
-
echo
through
the
heart
,
with
fearsome
pleasure
,


announce
the
far
-
off
come
near
and
imminent
.




as
they
drive
home
from
town
,
the
farmer
of
the
land
meet
the
blacken


collier
troop
from
the
pit
-
mouth
.
as
they
gather
the
harvest
,
the


west
wind
bring
a
faint
,
sulphurous
smell
of
pit
-
refuse
burning
.
as


they
pull
the
turnip
in
November
,
the
sharp


clink
-
clink
-
clink
-
clink
-
clink
of
empty
truck
shunt
on
the
line
,


vibrate
in
their
heart
with
the
fact
of
other
activity
go
on


beyond
they
.




the
Alfred
Brangwen
of
this
period
have
marry
a
woman
from
Heanor
,
a


daughter
of
the
"
black
Horse
"
.
she
be
a
slim
,
pretty
,
dark
woman
,


quaint
in
her
speech
,
whimsical
,
so
that
the
sharp
thing
she
say
do


not
hurt
.
she
be
oddly
a
thing
to
herself
,
rather
querulous
in
she


manner
,
but
intrinsically
separate
and
indifferent
,
so
that
her
long


lamentable
complaint
,
when
she
raise
her
voice
against
her
husband
in


particular
and
against
everybody
else
after
he
,
only
make
those
who


hear
her
wonder
and
feel
affectionately
towards
she
,
even
while
they


be
irritated
and
impatient
with
she
.
she
rail
long
and
loud
about


her
husband
,
but
always
with
a
balanced
,
easy
-
fly
voice
and
a
quaint


manner
of
speech
that
warm
his
belly
with
pride
and
male
triumph


while
he
scowl
with
mortification
at
the
thing
she
say
.




consequently
Brangwen
himself
have
a
humorous
puckering
at
the
eye
,
a


sort
of
fat
laugh
,
very
quiet
and
full
,
and
he
be
spoil
like
a
lord


of
creation
.
he
calmly
do
as
he
like
,
laugh
at
their
railing
,


excuse
himself
in
a
teasing
tone
that
she
love
,
follow
his
natural


inclination
,
and
sometimes
,
prick
too
near
the
quick
,
frightened
and


break
she
by
a
deep
,
tense
fury
which
seem
to
fix
on
he
and
hold
he


for
day
,
and
which
she
would
give
anything
to
placate
in
he
.
they


be
two
very
separate
being
,
vitally
connect
,
know
nothing
of


each
other
,
yet
live
in
their
separate
way
from
one
root
.




there
be
four
son
and
two
daughter
.
the
eld
boy
run
away
early


to
sea
,
and
do
not
come
back
.
after
this
the
mother
be
more
the
node


and
centre
of
attraction
in
the
home
.
the
second
boy
,
Alfred
,
whom
the


mother
admire
most
,
be
the
most
reserved
.
he
be
send
to
school
in


Ilkeston
and
make
some
progress
.
but
in
spite
of
his
dog
,
yearning


effort
,
he
could
not
get
beyond
the
rudiment
of
anything
,
save
of


draw
.
at
this
,
in
which
he
have
some
power
,
he
work
,
as
if
it
be


his
hope
.
after
much
grumbling
and
savage
rebellion
against
everything
,


after
much
try
and
shift
about
,
when
his
father
be
incense


against
he
and
his
mother
almost
despairing
,
he
become
a
draughtsman


in
a
lace
-
factory
in
Nottingham
.




he
remain
heavy
and
somewhat
uncouth
,
speak
with
broad
Derbyshire


accent
,
adhere
with
all
his
tenacity
to
his
work
and
to
his
town


position
,
make
good
design
,
and
become
fairly
well
-
off
.
but
at


draw
,
his
hand
swing
naturally
in
big
,
bold
line
,
rather
lax
,
so


that
it
be
cruel
for
he
to
pedgill
away
at
the
lace
design
,


work
from
the
tiny
square
of
his
paper
,
count
and
plot
and


niggle
.
he
do
it
stubbornly
,
with
anguish
,
crush
the
bowel


within
he
,
adhere
to
his
choose
lot
whatever
it
should
cost
.
and
he


come
back
into
life
set
and
rigid
,
a
rare
-
speak
,
almost
surly
man
.




he
marry
the
daughter
of
a
chemist
,
who
affect
some
social


superiority
,
and
he
become
something
of
a
snob
,
in
his
dogged
fashion
,


with
a
passion
for
outward
refinement
in
the
household
,
mad
when


anything
clumsy
or
gross
occur
.
later
,
when
his
three
child
be


grow
up
,
and
he
seem
a
staid
,
almost
middle
-
aged
man
,
he
turn


after
strange
woman
,
and
become
a
silent
,
inscrutable
follower
of


forbidden
pleasure
,
neglect
his
indignant
bourgeois
wife
without
a


qualm
.




Frank
,
the
third
son
,
refuse
from
the
first
to
have
anything
to
do


with
learning
.
from
the
first

house
which


stand
away
in
the
third
yard
at
the
back
of
the
farm
.
the
Brangwens
have


always
kill
their
own
meat
,
and
supply
the
neighbourhood
.
out
of


this
grow

in
connection
with
the

.




as
a
child
Frank
have
be
draw
by
the
trickle
of
dark
blood
that
run


across
the
pavement
from
the
slaughter
-
house
to
the
crew

yard
,
by
the

huge
side
of

with
the
kidney

in
their
heavy
lap
of
fat
.




he
be
a
handsome
lad
with
soft
brown
hair
and
regular
feature


something
like
a
later
roman
youth
.
he
be
more
easily
excitable
,
more


readily
carry
away
than
the
rest
,
weak
in
character
.
at
eighteen
he


marry
a
little
factory

,
a
pale

and
a
wheedle
voice
,

into
he
and
bear
he
a

in
his
public

live
for
a


time
stormily
in
Ilkeston
,
before
move
away
to
Yorkshire
with
she


numerous
young
family
.
Effie
,
the
young
,
remain
at
home
.




the
last
child
,
Tom
,
be
considerably
young
than
his
brother
,
so
have


belong
rather
to
the
company
of
his
sister
.
he
be
his
mother
’s


favourite
.
she
rouse
herself
to
determination
,
and
send
he
forcibly


away
to
a
grammar
-
school
in
Derby
when
he
be
twelve
year
old
.
he
do


not
want
to
go
,
and
his
father
would
have
give
way
,
but
Mrs.
Brangwen


have
set
her
heart
on
it
.
her
slender
,
pretty
,
tightly
-
cover
body
,


with
full
skirt
,
be
now
the
centre
of
resolution
in
the
house
,
and


when
she
have
once
set
upon
anything
,
which
be
not
often
,
the
family


fail
before
she
.




so
Tom
go
to
school
,
an
unwilling
failure
from
the
first
.
he
believe


his
mother
be
right
in
decree
school
for
he
,
but
he
know
she
be


only
right
because
she
would
not
acknowledge
his
constitution
.
he
know
,


with
a
child
’s
deep
,
instinctive
foreknowledge
of
what
be
go
to


happen
to
he
,
that
he
would
cut
a
sorry
figure
at
school
.
but
he
take


the
infliction
as
inevitable
,
as
if
he
be
guilty
of
his
own
nature
,


as
if
his
being
be
wrong
,
and
his
mother
’s
conception
right
.
if
he


could
have
be
what
he
like
,
he
would
have
be
that
which
his
mother


fondly
but
deludedly
hope
he
be
.
he
would
have
be
clever
,
and


capable
of
become
a
gentleman
.
it
be
her
aspiration
for
he
,


therefore
he
know
it
as
the
true
aspiration
for
any
boy
.
but
you
ca
n’t


make
a
silk
purse
out
of
a
sow
’s
ear
,
as
he
tell
his
mother
very
early
,


with
regard
to
himself
;
much
to
her
mortification
and
chagrin
.




when
he
get
to
school
,
he
make
a
violent
struggle
against
his
physical


inability
to
study
.
he
sit
grip
,
make
himself
pale
and
ghastly
in


his
effort
to
concentrate
on
the
book
,
to
take
in
what
he
have
to
learn
.


but
it
be
no
good
.
if
he
beat
down
his
first
repulsion
,
and
get
like
a


suicide
to
the
stuff
,
he
go
very
little
far
.
he
could
not
learn


deliberately
.
his
mind
simply
do
not
work
.




in
feel
he
be
develop
,
sensitive
to
the
atmosphere
around
he
,


brutal
perhaps
,
but
at
the
same
time
delicate
,
very
delicate
.
so
he
have


a
low
opinion
of
himself
.
he
know
his
own
limitation
.
he
know
that
his


brain
be
a
slow
hopeless
good
-
for
-
nothing
.
so
he
be
humble
.




but
at
the
same
time
his
feeling
be
more
discriminating
than
those


of
most
of
the
boy
,
and
he
be
confused
.
he
be
more
sensuously


develop
,
more
refined
in
instinct
than
they
.
for
their
mechanical


stupidity
he
hate
they
,
and
suffer
cruel
contempt
for
they
.
but
when


it
come
to
mental
thing
,
then
he
be
at
a
disadvantage
.
he
be
at


their
mercy
.
he
be
a
fool
.
he
have
not
the
power
to
controvert
even
the


most
stupid
argument
,
so
that
he
be
force
to
admit
thing
he
do
not


in
the
least
believe
.
and
having
admit
they
,
he
do
not
know
whether


he
believe
they
or
not
;
he
rather
think
he
do
.




but
he
love
anyone
who
could
convey
enlightenment
to
he
through


feeling
.
he
sat
betray
with
emotion
when
the
teacher
of
literature


read
,
in
a
move
fashion
,
Tennyson
’s
"
Ulysses
"
,
or
Shelley
’s
"
ode
to


the
West
Wind
"
.
his
lip
part
,
his
eye
fill
with
a
strained
,


almost
suffer
light
.
and
the
teacher
read
on
,
fire
by
his
power


over
the
boy
.
Tom
Brangwen
be
move
by
this
experience
beyond
all


calculation
,
he
almost
dread
it
,
it
be
so
deep
.
but
when
,
almost


secretly
and
shamefully
,
he
come
to
take
the
book
himself
,
and
begin


the
word
"
oh
wild
west
wind
,
thou
breath
of
autumn
’s
being
,
"
the
very


fact
of
the
print
cause
a
prickly
sensation
of
repulsion
to
go
over


his
skin
,
the
blood
come
to
his
face
,
his
heart
fill
with
a
bursting


passion
of
rage
and
incompetence
.
he
throw
the
book
down
and
walk


over
it
and
go
out
to
the
cricket
field
.
and
he
hate
book
as
if


they
be
his
enemy
.
he
hate
they
bad
than
ever
he
hate
any


person
.




he
could
not
voluntarily
control
his
attention
.
his
mind
have
no
fix


habit
to
go
by
,
he
have
nothing
to
get
hold
of
,
nowhere
to
start
from
.


for
he
there
be
nothing
palpable
,
nothing
know
in
himself
,
that
he


could
apply
to
learning
.
he
do
not
know
how
to
begin
.
therefore
he
be


helpless
when
it
come
to
deliberate
understanding
or
deliberate


learn
.




he
have
an
instinct
for
mathematic
,
but
if
this
fail
he
,
he
be


helpless
as
an
idiot
.
so
that
he
feel
that
the
ground
be
never
sure


under
his
foot
,
he
be
nowhere
.
his
final
downfall
be
his
complete


inability
to
attend
to
a
question
put
without
suggestion
.
if
he
have
to


write
a
formal
composition
on
the
Army
,
he
do
at
last
learn
to
repeat


the
few
fact
he
know
:
"
you
can
join
the
army
at
eighteen
.
you
have
to


be
over
five
foot
eight
.
"
but
he
have
all
the
time
a
living
conviction


that
this
be
a
dodge
and
that
his
common
-
place
be
beneath
contempt
.


then
he
redden
furiously
,
feel
his
bowel
sink
with
shame
,
scratch


out
what
he
have
write
,
make
an
agonized
effort
to
think
of
something


in
the
real
composition
style
,
fail
,
become
sullen
with
rage
and


humiliation
,
put
the
pen
down
and
would
have
be
tear
to
piece
rather


than
attempt
to
write
another
word
.




he
soon
got
use
to
the
Grammar
School
,
and
the
Grammar
School
got
use


to
he
,
set
he
down
as
a
hopeless
duffer
at
learning
,
but


respect
he
for
a
generous
,
honest
nature
.
only
one
narrow
,


domineering
fellow
,
the
latin
master
,
bully
he
and
make
the
blue


eye
mad
with
shame
and
rage
.
there
be
a
horrid
scene
,
when
the
boy


lay
open
the
master
’s
head
with
a
slate
,
and
then
thing
go
on
as


before
.
the
teacher
get
little
sympathy
.
but
Brangwen
wince
and
could


not
bear
to
think
of
the
deed
,
not
even
long
after
,
when
he
be
a
grown


man
.




he
be
glad
to
leave
school
.
it
have
not
be
unpleasant
,
he
have
enjoy


the
companionship
of
the
other
youth
,
or
have
think
he
enjoy
it
,


the
time
have
pass
very
quickly
,
in
endless
activity
.
but
he
know
all


the
time
that
he
be
in
an
ignominious
position
,
in
this
place
of


learn
.
he
be
aware
of
failure
all
the
while
,
of
incapacity
.
but
he


be
too
healthy
and
sanguine
to
be
wretched
,
he
be
too
much
alive
.
yet


his
soul
be
wretche
almost
to
hopelessness
.




he
have
love
one
warm
,
clever
boy
who
be
frail
in
body
,
a
consumptive


type
.
the
two
have
have
an
almost
classic
friendship
,
David
and
Jonathan
,


wherein
Brangwen
be
the
Jonathan
,
the
server
.
but
he
have
never
feel


equal
with
his
friend
,
because
the
other
’s
mind
outpace
his
,
and
leave


he
ashamed
,
far
in
the
rear
.
so
the
two
boy
go
at
once
apart
on


leave
school
.
but
Brangwen
always
remember
his
friend
that
have


be
,
keep
he
as
a
sort
of
light
,
a
fine
experience
to
remember
.




Tom
Brangwen
be
glad
to
get
back
to
the
farm
,
where
he
be
in
his
own


again
.
"
I
have
get
a
turnip
on
my
shoulder
,
let
I
stick
to
th
'


fallow
,
"
he
say
to
his
exasperated
mother
.
he
have
too
low
an
opinion


of
himself
.
but
he
go
about
at
his
work
on
the
farm
gladly
enough
,


glad
of
the
active
labour
and
the
smell
of
the
land
again
,
have
youth


and
vigour
and
humour
,
and
a
comic
wit
,
have
the
will
and
the
power


to
forget
his
own
shortcoming
,
find
himself
violent
with
occasional


rage
,
but
usually
on
good
term
with
everybody
and
everything
.




when
he
be
seventeen
,
his
father
fall
from
a
stack
and
break
his
neck
.


then
the
mother
and
son
and
daughter
live
on
at
the
farm
,
interrupt


by
occasional
loud
-
mouthed
lamenting
,
jealous
-
spirited
visitation
from


the
butcher
Frank
,
who
have
a
grievance
against
the
world
,
which
he
feel


be
always
give
he
less
than
his
due
.
Frank
be
particularly


against
the
young
Tom
,
whom
he
call
a
mardy
baby
,
and
Tom
return


the
hatred
violently
,
his
face
grow
red
and
his
blue
eye
stare
.


Effie
side
with
Tom
against
Frank
.
but
when
Alfred
come
,
from


Nottingham
,
heavy
jowle
and
lower
,
speak
very
little
,
but


treat
those
at
home
with
some
contempt
,
Effie
and
the
mother
side


with
he
and
put
Tom
into
the
shade
.
it
irritate
the
youth
that
his


eld
brother
should
be
make
something
of
a
hero
by
the
woman
,
just


because
he
do
n’t
live
at
home
and
be
a
lace
-
designer
and
almost
a


gentleman
.
but
Alfred
be
something
of
a
Prometheus
Bound
,
so
the
woman


love
he
.
Tom
come
later
to
understand
his
brother
well
.




as
young
son
,
Tom
feel
some
importance
when
the
care
of
the
farm


devolve
on
to
he
.
he
be
only
eighteen
,
but
he
be
quite
capable
of


do
everything
his
father
have
do
.
and
of
course
,
his
mother


remain
as
centre
to
the
house
.




the
young
man
grow
up
very
fresh
and
alert
,
with
z
for
every
moment


of
life
.
he
work
and
ride
and
drive
to
market
,
he
go
out
with


companion
and
get
tipsy
occasionally
and
play
skittle
and
go
to


the
little
travel
theatre
.
once
,
when
he
be
drunk
at
a
public


house
,
he
go
upstairs
with
a
prostitute
who
seduce
he
.
he
be
then


nineteen
.




the
thing
be
something
of
a
shock
to
he
.
in
the
close
intimacy
of
the


farm
kitchen
,
the
woman
occupy
the
supreme
position
.
the
man
defer


to
she
in
the
house
,
on
all
household
point
,
on
all
point
of
morality


and
behaviour
.
the
woman
be
the
symbol
for
that
further
life
which


comprise
religion
and
love
and
morality
.
the
man
place
in
her
hand


their
own
conscience
,
they
say
to
she
"
be
my
conscience
-
keeper
,
be
the


angel
at
the
doorway
guard
my
outgoing
and
my
incoming
.
"
and
the


woman
fulfil
her
trust
,
the
man
rest
implicitly
in
she
,
receive


her
praise
or
her
blame
with
pleasure
or
with
anger
,
rebel
and


storming
,
but
never
for
a
moment
really
escape
in
their
own
soul


from
her
prerogative
.
they
depend
on
she
for
their
stability
.
without


she
,
they
would
have
feel
like
straw
in
the
wind
,
to
be
blow
hither


and
thither
at
random
.
she
be
the
anchor
and
the
security
,
she
be
the


restrain
hand
of
God
,
at
time
highly
to
be
execrate
.




now
when
Tom
Brangwen
,
at
nineteen
,
a
youth
fresh
like
a
plant
,
root


in
his
mother
and
his
sister
,
find
that
he
have
lain
with
a
prostitute


woman
in
a
common
public
house
,
he
be
very
much
startled
.
for
he


there
be
until
that
time
only
one
kind
of
woman
—
his
mother
and
sister
.




but
now
?
he
do
not
know
what
to
feel
.
there
be
a
slight
wonder
,
a


pang
of
anger
,
of
disappointment
,
a
first
taste
of
ash
and
of
cold
fear


lest
this
be
all
that
would
happen
,
lest
his
relation
with
woman
be


go
to
be
no
more
than
this
nothingness
;
there
be
a
slight
sense
of


shame
before
the
prostitute
,
fear
that
she
would
despise
he
for
his


inefficiency
;
there
be
a
cold
distaste
for
she
,
and
a
fear
of
she
;


there
be
a
moment
of
paralyzed
horror
when
he
feel
he
might
have
take


a
disease
from
she
;
and
upon
all
this
startled
tumult
of
emotion
,
be


lay
the
steadying
hand
of
common
sense
,
which
say
it
do
not
matter


very
much
,
so
long
as
he
have
no
disease
.
he
soon
recover
balance
,
and


really
it
do
not
matter
so
very
much
.




but
it
have
shock
he
,
and
put
a
mistrust
into
his
heart
,
and


emphasize
his
fear
of
what
be
within
himself
.
he
be
,
however
,
in
a


few
day
go
about
again
in
his
own
careless
,
happy
-
go
-
lucky
fashion
,


his
blue
eye
just
as
clear
and
honest
as
ever
,
his
face
just
as
fresh
,


his
appetite
just
as
keen
.




or
apparently
so
.
he
have
,
in
fact
,
lose
some
of
his
buoyant
confidence
,


and
doubt
hinder
his
outgoing
.




for
some
time
after
this
,
he
be
quieter
,
more
conscious
when
he
drink
,


more
backward
from
companionship
.
the
disillusion
of
his
first
carnal


contact
with
woman
,
strengthen
by
his
innate
desire
to
find
in
a


woman
the
embodiment
of
all
his
inarticulate
,
powerful
religious


impulse
,
put
a
bit
in
his
mouth
.
he
have
something
to
lose
which
he
be


afraid
of
lose
,
which
he
be
not
sure
even
of
possess
.
this
first


affair
do
not
matter
much
:
but
the
business
of
love
be
,
at
the
bottom


of
his
soul
,
the
most
serious
and
terrifying
of
all
to
he
.




he
be
torment
now
with
sex
desire
,
his
imagination
revert
always


to
lustful
scene
.
but
what
really
prevent
his
return
to
a
loose


woman
,
over
and
above
the
natural
squeamishness
,
be
the
recollection


of
the
paucity
of
the
last
experience
.
it
have
be
so
nothing
,
so


dribble
and
functional
,
that
he
be
ashamed
to
expose
himself
to
the


risk
of
a
repetition
of
it
.




he
make
a
strong
,
instinctive
fight
to
retain
his
native
cheerfulness


unimpaired
.
he
have
naturally
a
plentiful
stream
of
life
and
humour
,
a


sense
of
sufficiency
and
exuberance
,
give
ease
.
but
now
it
tend
to


cause
tension
.
a
strained
light
come
into
his
eye
,
he
have
a
slight


knitting
of
the
brow
.
his
boisterous
humour
give
place
to
lower


silence
,
and
day
pass
by
in
a
sort
of
suspense
.




he
do
not
know
there
be
any
difference
in
he
,
exactly
;
for
the
most


part
he
be
fill
with
slow
anger
and
resentment
.
but
he
know
he
be


always
think
of
woman
,
or
a
woman
,
day
in
,
day
out
,
and
that


infuriate
he
.
he
could
not
get
free
:
and
he
be
ashamed
.
he
have
one


or
two
sweetheart
,
start
with
they
in
the
hope
of
speedy


development
.
but
when
he
have
a
nice
girl
,
he
find
that
he
be


incapable
of
push
the
desire
development
.
the
very
presence
of
the


girl
beside
he
make
it
impossible
.
he
could
not
think
of
she
like


that
,
he
could
not
think
of
her
actual
nakedness
.
she
be
a
girl
and
he


like
she
,
and
dread
violently
even
the
thought
of
uncover
she
.
he


know
that
,
in
these
last
issue
of
nakedness
,
he
do
not
exist
to
she


nor
she
to
he
.
again
,
if
he
have
a
loose
girl
,
and
thing
begin
to


develop
,
she
offend
he
so
deeply
all
the
time
,
that
he
never
know


whether
he
be
go
to
get
away
from
she
as
quickly
as
possible
,
or


whether
he
be
go
to
take
she
out
of
inflame
necessity
.
again
he


learn
his
lesson
:
if
he
take
she
it
be
a
paucity
which
he
be
force


to
despise
.
he
do
not
despise
himself
nor
the
girl
.
but
he
despise


the
net
result
in
he
of
the
experience
—
he
despise
it
deeply
and


bitterly
.




then
,
when
he
be
twenty
-
three
,
his
mother
die
,
and
he
be
leave
at


home
with
Effie
.
his
mother
’s
death
be
another
blow
out
of
the
dark
.


he
could
not
understand
it
,
he
know
it
be
no
good
his
trying
.
one
have


to
submit
to
these
unforeseen
blow
that
come
unawares
and
leave
a


bruise
that
remain
and
hurt
whenever
it
be
touch
.
he
begin
to
be


afraid
of
all
that
which
be
up
against
he
.
he
have
love
his
mother
.




after
this
,
Effie
and
he
quarrel
fiercely
.
they
mean
a
very
great


deal
to
each
other
,
but
they
be
both
under
a
strange
,
unnatural


tension
.
he
stay
out
of
the
house
as
much
as
possible
.
he
get
a


special
corner
for
himself
at
the
"
Red
Lion
"
at
Cossethay

mostly
silent
,
though
alert
and
attentive
,
very


hearty
in
his
greeting
of
everybody
he

,
shy
of

.
he


tease
all

of
self

and
unsureness
,

,
in


his

state
of

and
he
go

with
rage
.

Brangwen

she
give
he
an
intimate
smile
,
which
make
he
feel
confused
and


gratify
.




he
could
not
tear
himself
away
,
though
he
have
promise
not
to
interfere


with
the
girl
.
he
stay
on
at
the
hotel
over
night
.
he
see
the
other


fellow
at
the
evening
meal
:
a
small
,
middle
-
aged
man
with
iron
-
grey


hair
and
a
curious
face
,
like
a
monkey
’s
,
but
interesting
,
in
its
way


almost
beautiful
.
Brangwen
guess
that
he
be
a
foreigner
.
he
be
in


company
with
another
,
an
Englishman
,
dry
and
hard
.
the
four
sit
at


table
,
two
man
and
two
woman
.
Brangwen
watch
with
all
his
eye
.




he
see
how
the
foreigner
treat
the
woman
with
courteous
contempt
,
as


if
they
be
pleasing
animal
.
Brangwen
’s
girl
have
put
on
a
ladylike


manner
,
but
her
voice
betray
she
.
she
want
to
win
back
her
man
.


when
dessert
come
on
,
however
,
the
little
foreigner
turn
round
from


his
table
and
calmly
survey
the
room
,
like
one
unoccupied
.
Brangwen


marvel
over
the
cold
,
animal
intelligence
of
the
face
.
the
brown


eye
be
round
,
show
all
the
brown
pupil
,
like
a
monkey
’s
,
and
just


calmly
look
,
perceive
the
other
person
without
refer
to
he
at


all
.
they
rest
on
Brangwen
.
the
latter
marvel
at
the
old
face


turn
round
on
he
,
look
at
he
without
consider
it
necessary
to


know
he
at
all
.
the
eyebrow
of
the
round
,
perceive
,
but
unconcerned


eye
be
rather
high
up
,
with
slight
wrinkle
above
they
,
just
as
a


monkey
’s
have
.
it
be
an
old
,
ageless
face
.




the
man
be
most
amazingly
a
gentleman
all
the
time
,
an
aristocrat
.


Brangwen
stare
fascinated
.
the
girl
be
push
her
crumb
about
on


the
cloth
,
uneasily
,
flushed
and
angry
.




as
Brangwen
sit
motionless
in
the
hall
afterwards
,
too
much
move
and


lose
to
know
what
to
do
,
the
little
stranger
come
up
to
he
with
a


beautiful
smile
and
manner
,
offer
a
cigarette
and
say
:




"
will
you
smoke
?
"




Brangwen
never
smoke
cigarette
,
yet
he
take
the
one
offer
,
fumble


painfully
with
thick
finger
,
blush
to
the
root
of
his
hair
.
then


he
look
with
his
warm
blue
eye
at
the
almost
sardonic
,
lidde
eye


of
the
foreigner
.
the
latter
sit
down
beside
he
,
and
they
begin
to


talk
,
chiefly
of
horse
.




Brangwen
love
the
other
man
for
his
exquisite
graciousness
,
for
his


tact
and
reserve
,
and
for
his
ageless
,
monkey
-
like
self
-
surety
.
they


talk
of
horse
,
and
of
Derbyshire
,
and
of
farming
.
the
stranger


warm
to
the
young
fellow
with
real
warmth
,
and
Brangwen
be
excited
.


he
be
transport
at
meet
this
odd
,
middle
-
aged
,
dry
-
skinned
man
,


personally
.
the
talk
be
pleasant
,
but
that
do
not
matter
so
much
.
it


be
the
gracious
manner
,
the
fine
contact
that
be
all
.




they
talk
a
long
while
together
,
Brangwen
flush
like
a
girl
when


the
other
do
not
understand
his
idiom
.
then
they
say
good
night
,
and


shake
hand
.
again
the
foreigner
bow
and
repeat
his
good
night
.




"
good
night
,
and
bon
voyage
.
"




then
he
turn
to
the
stair
.




Brangwen
go
up
to
his
room
and
lie
stare
out
at
the
star
of
the


summer
night
,
his
whole
be
in
a
whirl
.
what
be
it
all
?
there
be
a


life
so
different
from
what
he
know
it
.
what
be
there
outside
his


knowledge
,
how
much
?
what
be
this
that
he
have
touch
?
what
be
he
in


this
new
influence
?
what
do
everything
mean
?
where
be
life
,
in
that


which
he
know
or
all
outside
he
?




he
fall
asleep
,
and
in
the
morning
have
ride
away
before
any
other


visitor
be
awake
.
he
shrink
from
see
any
of
they
again
,
in
the


morning
.




his
mind
be
one
big
excitement
.
the
girl
and
the
foreigner
:
he
know


neither
of
their
name
.
yet
they
have
set
fire
to
the
homestead
of
his


nature
,
and
he
would
be
burn
out
of
cover
.
of
the
two
experience
,


perhaps
the
meeting
with
the
foreigner
be
the
more
significant
.
but


the
girl
—
he
have
not
settle
about
the
girl
.




he
do
not
know
.
he
have
to
leave
it
there
,
as
it
be
.
he
could
not
sum


up
his
experience
.




the
result
of
these
encounter
be
,
that
he
dream
day
and
night
,


absorbedly
,
of
a
voluptuous
woman
and
of
the
meeting
with
a
small
,


withered
foreigner
of
ancient
breeding
.
no
soon
be
his
mind
free
,
no


soon
have
he
leave
his
own
companion
,
than
he
begin
to
imagine
an


intimacy
with
fine
-
texture
,
subtle
-
mannered
people
such
as
the


foreigner
at
Matlock
,
and
amidst
this
subtle
intimacy
be
always
the


satisfaction
of
a
voluptuous
woman
.




he
go
about
absorb
in
the
interest
and
the
actuality
of
this
dream
.


his
eye
glow
,
he
walk
with
his
head
up
,
full
of
the
exquisite


pleasure
of
aristocratic
subtlety
and
grace
,
torment
with
the
desire


for
the
girl
.




then
gradually
the
glow
begin
to
fade
,
and
the
cold
material
of
his


customary
life
to
show
through
.
he
resent
it
.
be
he
cheat
in
his


illusion
?
he
balk
the
mean
enclosure
of
reality
,
stand
stubbornly


like
a
bull
at
a
gate
,
refuse
to
re
-
enter
the
well
-
know
round
of
his


own
life
.




he
drink
more
than
usual
to
keep
up
the
glow
.
but
it
fade
more
and


more
for
all
that
.
he
set
his
tooth
at
the
commonplace
,
to
which
he


would
not
submit
.
it
resolve
itself
starkly
before
he
,
for
all
that
.




he
want
to
marry
,
to
get
settle
somehow
,
to
get
out
of
the
quandary


he
find
himself
in
.
but
how
?
he
feel
unable
to
move
his
limb
.
he
have


see
a
little
creature
catch
in
bird
-
lime
,
and
the
sight
be
a


nightmare
to
he
.
he
begin
to
feel
mad
with
the
rage
of
impotency
.




he
want
something
to
get
hold
of
,
to
pull
himself
out
.
but
there
be


nothing
.
steadfastly
he
look
at
the
young
woman
,
to
find
a
one
he


could
marry
.
but
not
one
of
they
do
he
want
.
and
he
know
that
the
idea


of
a
life
among
such
people
as
the
foreigner
be
ridiculous
.




yet
he
dream
of
it
,
and
stick
to
his
dream
,
and
would
not
have
the


reality
of
Cossethay
and
Ilkeston
.
there
he
sit
stubbornly
in
his


corner
at
the
"
Red
Lion
"
,
smoking
and
musing
and
occasionally
lift


his
beer
-
pot
,
and
say
nothing
,
for
all
the
world
like
a
gorping


farm
-
labourer
,
as
he
say
himself
.




then
a
fever
of
restless
anger
come
upon
he
.
he
want
to
go


away
—
right
away
.
he
dream
of
foreign
part
.
but
somehow
he
have
no


contact
with
they
.
and
it
be
a
very
strong
root
which
hold
he
to
the


Marsh
,
to
his
own
house
and
land
.




then
Effie
got
marry
,
and
he
be
leave
in
the
house
with
only
Tilly
,


the
cross
-
eyed
woman
-
servant
who
have
be
with
they
for
fifteen
year
.


he
feel
thing
come
to
a
close
.
all
the
time
,
he
have
hold
himself


stubbornly
resistant
to
the
action
of
the
commonplace
unreality
which


want
to
absorb
he
.
but
now
he
have
to
do
something
.




he
be
by
nature
temperate
.
be
sensitive
and
emotional
,
his
nausea


prevent
he
from
drink
too
much
.




but
,
in
futile
anger
,
with
the
great
of
determination
and
apparent


good
humour
,
he
begin
to
drink
in
order
to
get
drunk
.
"
damn
it
,
"
he


say
to
himself
,
"
you
must
have
it
one
road
or
another
—
you
ca
n’t
hitch


your
horse
to
the
shadow
of
a
gate
-
post
—
if
you
’ve
get
leg
you
’ve
get


to
rise
off
your
backside
some
time
or
other
.
"




so
he
rise
and
go
down
to
Ilkeston
,
rather
awkwardly
take
his
place


among
a
gang
of
young
blood
,
stand
drink
to
the
company
,
and


discover
he
could
carry
it
off
quite
well
.
he
have
an
idea
that


everybody
in
the
room
be
a
man
after
his
own
heart
,
that
everything


be
glorious
,
everything
be
perfect
.
when
somebody
in
alarm
tell
he


his
coat
pocket
be
on
fire
,
he
could
only
beam
from
a
red
,
blissful


face
and
say
"

and
he
laugh
with
pleasure
,
and
be
rather
indignant


that
the
other
should
think
it
unnatural
for
his
coat
pocket
to


burn:—it
be
the
happy
and
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
—
what
?




he
go
home
talk
to
himself
and
to
the
moon
,
that
be
very
high
and


small
,
stumble
at
the
flash
of
moonlight
from
the
puddle
at
his


foot
,
wonder
what
the
Hanover

then

confidently
to
the


moon

in
the
morning
he
wake
up
and
think
about
it
,
and
for
the
first
time


in
his
life
,
know
what
it
be
to
feel
really
acutely
irritable
,
in
a


misery
of
real
bad
temper
.
after
bawl
and
snarl
at
Tilly
,
he
take


himself
off
for
very
shame
,
to
be
alone
.
and
look
at
the
ashen


field
and
the
putty
road
,
he
wonder
what
in
the
name
of
Hell
he


could
do
to
get
out
of
this
prickly
sense
of
disgust
and
physical


repulsion
.
and
he
know
that
this
be
the
result
of
his
glorious


evening
.




and
his
stomach
do
not
want
any
more
brandy
.
he
go
doggedly
across


the
field
with
his
terri
,
and
look
at
everything
with
a
jaundice


eye
.




the
next
evening
find
he
back
again
in
his
place
at
the
"
Red
Lion
"
,


moderate
and
decent
.
there
he
sit
and
stubbornly
wait
for
what
would


happen
next
.




do
he
,
or
do
he
not
believe
that
he
belong
to
this
world
of


Cossethay
and
Ilkeston
?
there
be
nothing
in
it
he
want
.
yet
could
he


ever
get
out
of
it
?
be
there
anything
in
himself
that
would
carry
he


out
of
it
?
or
be
he
a
dunderheaded
baby
,
not
man
enough
to
be
like
the


other
young
fellow
who
drink
a
good
deal
and
wench
a
little
without


any
question
,

be
satisfied
.




he
go
on
stubbornly
for
a
time
.
then
the
strain
become
too
great
for


he
.
a
hot
,
accumulate
consciousness
be
always
awake
in
his
chest
,


his
wrist
feel
swell
and
quiver
,
his
mind
become
full
of
lustful


image
,
his
eye
seem
blood
-
flush
.
he
fight
with
himself


furiously
,
to
remain
normal
.
he
do
not
seek
any
woman
.
he
just
go
on


as
if
he
be
normal
.
till
he
must
either
take
some
action
or
beat
his


head
against
the
wall
.




then
he
go
deliberately
to
Ilkeston
,
in
silence
,
intent
and
beat
.


he
drink
to
get
drunk
.
he
gulp
down
the
brandy
,
and
more
brandy
,
till


his
face
become
pale
,
his
eye
burn
.
and
still
he
could
not
get


free
.
he
go
to
sleep
in
drunken
unconsciousness
,
wake
up
at
four


o’clock
in
the
morning
and
continued
drinking
.
he
_
would
_
get
free
.


gradually
the
tension
in
he
begin
to
relax
.
he
begin
to
feel
happy
.


his
riveted
silence
be
unfastened
,
he
begin
to
talk

.
he
be


happy
and
at
one
with
all
the
world
,
he
be
unite
with
all
flesh
in
a


hot

relationship
.
so
,
after
three
day
of
incessant


brandy
-
drinking
,
he
have
burn
out
the
youth
from

,
he
have


achieve
this
kindle
state
of
oneness
with
all
the

,
which
be
the


end
of

he
have

,
that
which
it


depend

resentment
burn
in
he
.
he
keep


aloof
from
any

,
antagonistic
.




when
he

be
a
time
when

everything


and
aware
of
nothing

coil
in
himself

it
be
early
in
the
year
.




he
walk
steadily
beside
the
horse
,
the
load
clank
behind
as
the


hill
descend
steeper
.
the
road
curve
down

hill
before
he
,
under


bank
and
hedge
,
see
only
for
a
few
yard
ahead
.




slowly
turn

curve
at
the
steep
part
of
the
slope
,
his
horse


britche
between
the
shaft
,
he
see
a
woman
approach
.
but
he
be


think
for
the
moment
of
the
horse
.




then
he
turn
to
look
at
she
.
she
be
dress
in
black
,
be
apparently


rather
small
and
slight
,
beneath
her
long
black
cloak
,
and
she
wear
a


black
bonnet
.
she
walk
hastily
,
as
if
unseee
,
her
head
rather


forward
.
it
be
she
curious
,
absorb
,
flit
motion
,
as
if
she
be


pass
unseen
by
everybody
,
that
first
arrest
he
.




she
have
hear
the
cart
,
and
look
up
.
her
face
be
pale
and
clear
,
she


have
thick
dark
eyebrow
and
a
wide
mouth
,
curiously
hold
.
he
see
she


face
clearly
,
as
if
by
a
light
in
the
air
.
he
see
her
face
so


distinctly
,
that
he
cease
to
coil
on
himself
,
and
be
suspend
.




"
that
’
she
,
"
he
say
involuntarily
.
as
the
cart
pass
by
,
splash


through
the
thin
mud
,
she
stand
back
against
the
bank
.
then
,
as
he


walk
still
beside
his
britching
horse
,
his
eye
meet
hers
.
he
look


quickly
away
,
press
back
his
head
,
a
pain
of
joy
run
through


he
.
he
could
not
bear
to
think
of
anything
.




he
turn
round
at
the
last
moment
.
he
see
her
bonnet
,
her
shape
in
the


black
cloak
,
the
movement
as
she
walk
.
then
she
be
go
round
the


bend
.




she
have
pass
by
.
he
feel
as
if
he
be
walk
again
in
a
far
world
,


not
Cossethay
,
a
far
world
,
the
fragile
reality
.
he
go
on
,
quiet
,


suspend
,
rarefied
.
he
could
not
bear
to
think
or
to
speak
,
nor
make


any
sound
or
sign
,
nor
change
his
fix
motion
.
he
could
scarcely
bear


to
think
of
her
face
.
he
move
within
the
knowledge
of
she
,
in
the


world
that
be
beyond
reality
.




the
feeling
that
they
have
exchange
recognition
possess
he
like
a


madness
,
like
a
torment
.
how
could
he
be
sure
,
what
confirmation
have


he
?
the
doubt
be
like
a
sense
of
infinite
space
,
a
nothingness
,


annihilate
.
he
keep
within
his
breast
the
will
to
surety
.
they
have


exchange
recognition
.




he
walk
about
in
this
state
for
the
next
few
day
.
and
then
again


like
a
mist
it
begin
to
break
to
let
through
the
common
,
barren
world
.


he
be
very
gentle
with
man
and
beast
,
but
he
dread
the
starkness
of


disillusion
cropping
through
again
.




as
he
be
stand
with
his
back
to
the
fire
after
dinner
a
few
day


later
,
he
see
the
woman
pass
.
he
want
to
know
that

that
she
be
aware
.
he
want
it
say
that
there
be
something
between


they
.
so
he
stand
anxiously

at
she

fineness
about

about

it
poignantly

a
pang
of
fear
for
his
own
concrete


life

of
ecstasy

a
new
birth

lull


between

by
his
native
good
humour

her
confidence
,
even


her
affection
,
set
she
on
a
horse
to
ride
,

her
corn
for

a
vagueness
,
like
a
soft
mist
over
all
of
they
,


and
a
silence
as
if
their
will
be
suspend
.
only
he
see
her
hand
,


ungloved
,
fold
in
her
lap
,
and
he
notice
the
wedding
-
ring
on
she


finger
.
it
exclude
he
:
it
be
a
closed
circle
.
it
bind
her
life
,
the


wedding
-
ring
,
it
stand
for
her
life
in
which
he
could
have
no
part
.


nevertheless
,
beyond
all
this
,
there
be
herself
and
himself
which


should
meet
.




as
he
help
she
down
from
the
trap
,
almost
lift
she
,
he
feel
he
have


some
right
to
take
she
thus
between
his
hand
.
she
belong
as
yet
to


that
other
,
to
that
which
be
behind
.
but
he
must
care
for
she
also
.


she
be
too
live
to
be
neglect
.




sometimes
her
vagueness
,
in
which
he
be
lose
,
make
he
angry
,
make
he


rage
.
but
he
hold
himself
still
as
yet
.
she
have
no
response
,
no
being


towards
he
.
it
puzzle
and
enrage
he
,
but
he
submit
for
a
long


time
.
then
,
from
the
accumulate
troubling
of
she
ignore
he
,


gradually
a
fury
break
out
,
destructive
,
and
he
want
to
go
away
,
to


escape
she
.




it
happen
she
come
down
to
the
Marsh
with
the
child
whilst
he
be
in


this
state
.
then
he
stand
over
against
she
,
strong
and
heavy
in
his


revolt
,
and
though
he
say
nothing
,
still
she
feel
his
anger
and
heavy


impatience
grip
hold
of
she
,
she
be
shake
again
as
out
of
a
torpor
.


again
her
heart
stir
with
a
quick
,
out
-
run
impulse
,
she
look


at
he
,
at
the
stranger
who
be
not
a
gentleman
yet
who
insist
on


come
into
her
life
,
and
the
pain
of
a
new
birth
in
herself
string
all


her
vein
to
a
new
form
.
she
would
have
to
begin
again
,
to
find
a
new


be
,
a
new
form
,
to
respond
to
that
blind
,
insistent
figure
standing


over
against
she
.




a
shiver
,
a
sickness
of
new
birth
pass
over
she
,
the
flame
leap
up


he
,
under
his
skin
.
she
want
it
,
this
new
life
from
he
,
with
he
,


yet
she
must
defend
herself
against
it
,
for
it
be
a
destruction
.




as
he
work
alone
on
the
land
,
or
sit
up
with
his
ewe
at
lamb


time
,
the
fact
and
material
of
his
daily
life
fall
away
,
leave
the


kernel
of
his
purpose
clean
.
and
then
it
come
upon
he
that
he
would


marry
she
and
she
would
be
his
life
.




gradually
,
even
without
see
she
,
he
come
to
know
she
.
he
would
have


like
to
think
of
she
as
of
something
give
into
his
protection
,
like
a


child
without
parent
.
but
it
be
forbid
he
.
he
have
to
come
down


from
this
pleasant
view
of
the
case
.
she
might
refuse
he
.
and
besides
,


he
be
afraid
of
she
.




but
during
the
long
February
night
with
the
ewe
in
labour
,
look


out
from
the
shelter
into
the
flash
star
,
he
know
he
do
not
belong


to
himself
.
he
must
admit
that
he
be
only
fragmentary
,
something


incomplete
and
subject
.
there
be
the
star
in
the
dark
heaven


travel
,
the
whole
host
pass
by
on
some
eternal
voyage
.
so
he
sit


small
and
submissive
to
the
great
ordering
.




unless
she
would
come
to
he
,
he
must
remain
as
a
nothingness
.
it
be
a


hard
experience
.
but
,
after
her
repeat
obliviousness
to
he
,
after
he


have
see
so
often
that
he
do
not
exist
for
she
,
after
he
have
rage
and


try
to
escape
,
and
say
he
be
good
enough
by
himself
,
he
be
a
man
,


and
could
stand
alone
,
he
must
,
in
the
starry
multiplicity
of
the
night


humble
himself
,
and
admit
and
know
that
without
she
he
be
nothing
.




he
be
nothing
.
but
with
she
,
he
would
be
real
.
if
she
be
now
walk


across
the
frosty
grass
near
the
sheep
-
shelter
,
through
the
fretful


bleat
of
the
ewe
and
lamb
,
she
would
bring
he
completeness
and


perfection
.
and
if
it
should
be
so
,
that
she
should
come
to
he
!
it


should
be
so
—
it
be
ordain
so
.




he
be
a
long
time
resolve
definitely
to
ask
she
to
marry
he
.
and
he


know
,
if
he
ask
she
,
she
must
really
acquiesce
.
she
must
,
it
could


not
be
otherwise
.




he
have
learn
a
little
of
she
.
she
be
poor
,
quite
alone
,
and
have
have


a
hard
time
in
London
,
both
before
and
after
her
husband
die
.
but
in


Poland
she
be
a
lady
well
bear
,
a
landowner
’s
daughter
.




all
these
thing
be
only
word
to
he
,
the
fact
of
her
superior


birth
,
the
fact
that
her
husband
have
be
a
brilliant
doctor
,
the
fact


that
he
himself
be
her
inferior
in
almost
every
way
of
distinction
.


there
be
an
inner
reality
,
a
logic
of
the
soul
,
which
connect
she


with
he
.




one
evening
in
March
,
when
the
wind
be

outside
,
come
the


moment
to

bubble
out

the
slight
crunch
of

rocker
of

he
hear
the
low
,


monotonous
murmur
of
a
song
in

with
such
an
insinuation

in
the

oblivion
,


the
fecund
darkness
.

gradually
,

newly
create
,
as
after
a
gestation
,
a
new


birth
,

be


so
good
,
that
it
be
almost
like
a
passing
-
away
,
a
trespass
.
he
draw


her
suddenly
close
to
he
.




for
soon

light
begin
to
fade
in

be
in


his
arm
,

head
sink
,
she
lean
it
against

a
little
tired
,
efface
because
she
be
tired
.
and
in
she


tiredness
be
a
certain
negation
of

out
of
the
long
silence

he
do
not
understand
.
it
be
a
long
time
since
he
have
hear
a
voice
.


now
also
he
hear
the
wind
roar
,
as
if
it
have
just
begin
again
.




"
yes
,
"
he
say
,
not
understanding
.
there
be
a
slight
contraction
of


pain
at
his
heart
,
a
slight
tension
on
his
brow
.
something
he
want


to
grasp
and
could
not
.




"
you
will
love
she

.




the
quick
contraction
,
like
pain
,
go
over
he
again
.




"
I
love
she
now
,
"
he
say
.




she
lie
still
against
he
,
take
his
physical
warmth
without
heed
.
it


be
great
confirmation
for
he
to
feel
she
there
,
absorb
the
warmth


from
he
,
give
he
back
her
weight
and
her
strange
confidence
.
but


where
be
she
,
that
she
seem
so
absent
?
his
mind
be
open
with


wonder
.
he
do
not
know
she
.




"
but
I
be
much
old
than

she
say
.




"
how
old
?
"
he
ask
.




"
I

four

.




"
I

eight
,
"
he
say
.




"
six
year

"




she
be
oddly
concerned
,
even
as
if
it
please
she
a
little
.
he
sit
and


listen
and
wonder
.
it
be
rather
splendid
,
to
be
so
ignore
by
she
,


whilst
she
lie
against
he
,
and
he
lift
she
with
his
breathing
,
and


feel
her
weight
upon
his
living
,
so
he
have
a
completeness
and
an


inviolable
power
.
he
do
not
interfere
with
she
.
he
do
not
even
know


she
.
it
be
so
strange
that
she
lie
there
with
her
weight
abandon


upon
he
.
he
be
silent
with
delight
.
he
feel
strong
,
physically
,


carry
she
on
his
breathing
.
the
strange
,
inviolable
completeness
of


the
two
of
they
make
he
feel
as
sure
and
as
stable
as
God
.
amused
,
he


wonder
what
the
vicar
would
say
if
he
know
.




"
you
need
n’t
stop
here
much
long

he
say
.




"
I

she

.
"
when

very
nice
here
.

he
be
silent
again
at
this
.
so
close
on
he
she
lie
,
and
yet
she


answer
he
from
so
far
away
.
but
he

he
be


back
at
his
work
.
a
darkness
have
come
over
Lydia
’s
mind
.
she
walk


always
in
a
shadow
,
silence
,
with
a
strange
,
deep
terror
having
hold


of
she
,
her
desire
be
to
seek
satisfaction
in
dread
,
to
enter
a


nunnery
,
to
satisfy
the
instinct
of
dread
in
she
,
through

of
a


dark
religion
.
but
she
could
not
.




then

flight
to

.
Lensky
,
the
little
,
thin
man
,
have
get


all
his
life
lock
into
a
resistance
and
could
not
relax

.
he


live
in
a
sort
of
insane
irritability
,
touchy
,
haughty
to
the
last


degree
,
fractious
,
so
that
as
assistant
doctor
in
one
of
the
hospital


he
soon
become
impossible
.
they
be
almost
beggar
.
but
he
keep
still


his
great
idea
of
himself
,
he
seem
to
live
in
a
complete


hallucination
,
where
he
himself
figure
vivid
and
lordly
.
he
guard


his
wife
jealously
against
the
ignominy
of
her
position
,
rush
round


she
like
a
brandish
weapon
,
an
amazing
sight
to
the
english
eye
,
have


she
in
his
power
,
as
if
he
hypnotize
she
.
she
be
passive
,
dark
,


always
in
shadow
.




he
be
waste
away
.
already
when
the
child
be
bear
he
seem
nothing


but
skin
and
bone
and
fix
idea
.
she
watch
he
die
,
nurse
he
,


nurse
the
baby
,
but
really
take
no
notice
of
anything
.
a
darkness
be


on
she
,
like
remorse
,
or
like
a
remembering
of
the
dark
,
savage
,
mystic


ride
of
dread
,
of
death
,
of
the
shadow
of
revenge
.
when
her
husband


die
,
she
be
relieve
.
he
would
no
long
dart
about
she
.




England
fit
her
mood
,
its
aloofness
and
foreignness
.
she
have
know
a


little
of
the
language
before
come
,
and
a
sort
of
parrot
-
mind
make


her
pick
it
up
fairly
easily
.
but
she
know
nothing
of
the
English
,
nor


of
english
life
.
indeed
,
these
do
not
exist
for
she
.
she
be
like
one


walk
in
the
Underworld
,
where
the
shade
throng
intelligibly
but


have
no
connection
with
one
.
she
feel
the
english
people
as
a
potent
,


cold
,
slightly
hostile
host
amongst
whom
she
walk
isolated
.




the
english
people
themselves
be
almost
deferential
to
she
,
the


church
see
that
she
do
not
want
.
she
walk
without
passion
,
like
a


shade
,
torment
into
moment
of
love
by
the
child
.
her
die
husband


with
his
tortured
eye
and
the
skin
draw
tight
over
his
face
,
he
be


as
a
vision
to
she
,
not
a
reality
.
in
a
vision
he
be
bury
and
put


away
.
then
the
vision
cease
,
she
be
untroubled
,
time
go
on
grey
,


uncoloured
,
like
a
long
journey
where
she
sit
unconscious
as
the


landscape
unrolled
beside
she
.
when
she
rock
her
baby
at
evening
,


maybe
she
fall
into
a
polish
slumber
song
,
or
she
talk
sometimes
to


herself
in
Polish
.
otherwise
she
do
not
think
of
Poland
,
nor
of
that


life
to
which
she
have
belong
.
it
be
a
great
blot
loom
blank
in


its
darkness
.
in
the
superficial
activity
of
her
life
,
she
be
all


english
.
she
even
think
in
English
.
but
her
long
blank
and


darkness
of
abstraction
be
polish
.




so
she
live
for
some
time
.
then
,
with
slight
uneasiness
,
she
use
half


to
awake
to
the
street
of
London
.
she
realize
that
there
be


something
around
she
,
very
foreign
,
she
realize
she
be
in
a
strange


place
.
and
then
,
she
be
send
away
into
the
country
.
there
come
into


her
mind
now
the
memory
of
her
home
where
she
have
be
a
child
,
the
big


house
among
the
land
,
the
peasant
of
the
village
.




she
be
send
to
Yorkshire
,
to
nurse
an
old
rector
in
his
rectory
by
the


sea
.
this
be
the
first
shake
of
the
kaleidoscope
that
bring
in
front


of
her
eye
something
she
must
see
.
it
hurt
her
brain
,
the
open
country


and
the
moor
.
it
hurt
she
and
hurt
she
.
yet
it
force
itself
upon
she


as
something
live
,
it
rouse
some
potency
of
her
childhood
in
she
,
it


have
some
relation
to
she
.




there
be
green
and
silver
and
blue
in
the
air
about
she
now
.
and
there


be
a
strange
insistence
of
light
from
the
sea
,
to
which
she
must


attend
.
primrose
glimmer
around
,
many
of
they
,
and
she
stoop
to


the
disturbing
influence
near
her
foot
,
she
even
pick
one
or
two


flower
,
faintly
remember
in
the
new
colour
of
life
,
what
have
be
.


all
the
day
long
,
as
she
sit
at
the
upper
window
,
the
light
come
off


the
sea
,
constantly
,
constantly
,
without
refusal
,
till
it
seem
to


bear
she
away
,
and
the
noise
of
the
sea
create
a
drowsiness
in
she
,
a


relaxation
like
sleep
.
her
automatic
consciousness
give
way
a
little
,


she
stumble
sometimes
,
she
have
a
poignant
,
momentary
vision
of
she


live
child
,
that
hurt
she
unspeakably
.
her
soul
rouse
to
attention
.




very
strange
be
the
constant
glitter
of
the
sea
unsheathe
in
heaven
,


very
warm
and
sweet
the
graveyard
,
in
a
nook
of
the
hill
catch
the


sunshine
and
hold
it
as
one
hold
a
bee
between
the
palm
of
the


hand
,
when
it
be
benumb
.
Grey
grass
and
lichen
and
a
little
church
,


and
snowdrop
among
coarse
grass
,
and
a
cupful
of
incredibly
warm


sunshine
.




she
be
trouble
in
spirit
.
hear
the
rushing
of
the
beck
away
down


under
the
tree
,
she
be
startled
,
and
wonder
what
it
be
.
walk


down
,
she
find
the
bluebell
around
she
glow
like
a
presence
,
among


the
tree
.




summer
come
,
the
moor
be
tangle
with
harebell
like
water
in
the


rut
of
the
road
,
the
heather
come
rosy
under
the
sky
,
set
the


whole
world
awake
.
and
she
be
uneasy
.
she
go
past
the
gorse
bush


shrink
from
their
presence
,
she
step
into
the
heather
as
into
a


quicken
bath
that
almost
hurt
.
her
finger
move
over
the
clasped


finger
of
the
child
,
she
hear
the
anxious
voice
of
the
baby
,
as
it


try
to
make
her
talk
,
distraught
.




and
she
shrink
away
again
,
back
into
her
darkness
,
and
for
a
long
while


remained
blot
safely
away
from
living
.
but
autumn
come
with
the


faint
red
glimmer
of
robin
singing
,
winter
darken
the
moor
,
and


almost
savagely
she
turn
again
to
life
,
demand
her
life
back


again
,
demand
that
it
should
be
as
it
have
be
when
she
be
a
girl
,


on
the
land
at
home
,
under
the
sky
.
snow
lie
in
great
expanse
,
the


telegraph
post
stride
over
the
white
earth
,
away
under
the
gloom
of


the
sky
.
and
savagely
her
desire
rise
in
she
again
,
demand
that
this


be
Poland
,
her
youth
,
that
all
be
her
own
again
.




but
there
be
no
sledge
nor
bell
,
she
do
not
see
the
peasant


come
out
like
new
people
,
in
their
sheepskin
and
their
fresh
,
ruddy
,


bright
face
,
that
seem
to
become
new
and
vivid
when
the
snow
light
up


the
ground
.
it
do
not
come
to
she
,
the
life
of
her
youth
,
it
do
not


come
back
.
there
be
a
little
agony
of
struggle
,
then
a
relapse
into


the
darkness
of
the
convent
,
where
Satan
and
the
devil
rage
round
the


wall
,
and
Christ
be
white
on
the
cross
of
victory
.




she
watch
from
the
sick
-
room
the
snow
whirl
past
,
like
flock
of


shadow
in
haste
,
fly
on
some
final
mission
out
to
a
leaden


inalterable
sea
,
beyond
the
final
whiteness
of
the
curve
shore
,
and


the
snow
-
speckle
blackness
of
the
rock
half
submerge
.
but
near
at


hand
on
the
tree
the
snow
be
soft
in
bloom
.
only
the
voice
of
the


die
vicar
speak
grey
and
querulous
from
behind
.




by
the
time
the
snowdrop
be
out
,
however
,
he
be
dead
.
he
be
dead
.


but
with
curious
equanimity
the
return
woman
watch
the
snowdrop


on
the
edge
of
the
grass
below
,
blow
white
in
the
wind
,
but
not
to
be


blow
away
.
she
watch
they
flutter
and
bob
,
the
white
,
shut


flower
,
anchor
by
a
thread
to
the
grey
-
green
grass
,
yet
never
blow


away
,
not
drift
with
the
wind
.




as
she
rise
in
the
morning
,
the
dawn
be
beat
up
white
,
gust
of


light
blow
like
a
thin
snowstorm
from
the
east
,
blow
strong
and


fiercer
,
till
the
rose
appear
,
and
the
gold
,
and
the
sea
light
up


below
.
she
be
impassive
and
indifferent
.
yet
she
be
outside
the


enclosure
of
darkness
.




there
pass
a
space
of
shadow
again
,
the
familiarity
of
dread
-
worship
,


during
which
she
be
move
,
oblivious
,
to
Cossethay
.
there
,
at
first
,


there
be
nothing
—
just
grey
nothing
.
but
then
one
morning
there
be
a


light
from
the
yellow
jasmine
catch
she
,
and
after
that
,
morning
and


evening
,
the
persistent
ringing
of
thrush
from
the
shrubbery
,
till


her
heart
,
beat
upon
,
be
force
to
lift
up
its
voice
in
rivalry
and


answer
.
little
tune
come
into
her
mind
.
she
be
full
of
trouble
almost


like
anguish
.
resistant
,
she
know
she
be
beat
,
and
from
fear
of


darkness
turn
to
fear
of
light
.
she
would
have
hide
herself


indoor
,
if
she
could
.
above
all
,
she
crave
for
the
peace
and
heavy


oblivion
of
her
old
state
.
she
could
not
bear
to
come
to
,
to
realize
.


the
first
pang
of
this
new
parturition
be
so
acute
,
she
know
she


could
not
bear
it
.
she
would
rather
remain
out
of
life
,
than
be
tear
,


mutilate
into
this
birth
,
which
she
could
not
survive
.
she
have
not
the


strength
to
come
to
life
now
,
in
England
,
so
foreign
,
sky
so
hostile
.


she
know
she
would
die
like
an
early
,
colourless
,
scentless
flower
that


the
end
of
the
winter
put
forth
mercilessly
.
and
she
want
to
harbour


her
modicum
of
twinkle
life
.




but
a
sunshiny
day
come
full
of
the
scent
of
a
mezereon
tree
,
when
bee


be
tumble
into
the
yellow
crocus
,
and
she
forgot
,
she
feel
like


somebody
else
,
not
herself
,
a
new
person
,
quite
glad
.
but
she
know
it


be
fragile
,
and
she
dread
it
.
the
vicar
put
pea
-
flower
into
the


crocus
,
for
his
bee
to
roll
in
,
and
she
laugh
.
then
night
come
,


with
brilliant
star
that
she
know
of
old
,
from
her
girlhood
.
and
they


flash
so
bright
,
she
know
they
be
victor
.




she
could
neither
wake
nor
sleep
.
as
if
crush
between
the
past
and


the
future
,
like
a
flower
that
come
above
-
ground
to
find
a
great
stone


lie
above
it
,
she
be
helpless
.




the
bewilderment
and
helplessness
continue
,
she
be
surround
by


great
move
masse
that
must
crush
she
.
and
there
be
no
escape
.
save


in
the
old
obliviousness
,
the
cold
darkness
she
strove
to
retain
.
but


the
vicar
show
her
egg
in
the
thrush
’s
nest
near
the
back
door
.
she


see
herself
the
mother
-
thrush
upon
the
nest
,
and
the
way
her
wing
be


spread
,
so
eager
down
upon
her
secret
.
the
tense
,
eager
,
nesting
wing


move
she
beyond
endurance
.
she
think
of
they
in
the
morning
,
when


she
hear
the
thrush
whistle
as
he
get
up
,
and
she
think
,
"
why


do
n’t
I
die
out
there
,
why
be
I
bring
here
?
"




she
be
aware
of
people
who
pass
around
she
,
not
as
person
,
but
as


loom
presence
.
it
be
very
difficult
for
she
to
adjust
herself
.
in


Poland
,
the
peasantry
,
the
people
,
have
be
cattle
to
she
,
they
have


be
her
cattle
that
she
own
and
use
.
what
be
these
people
?
now


she
be
come
awake
,
she
be
lose
.




but
she
have
feel
Brangwen
go
by
almost
as
if
he
have
brush
she
.
she


have
tingle
in
body
as
she
have
go
on
up
the
road
.
after
she
have
be


with
he
in
the
Marsh
kitchen
,
the
voice
of
her
body
have
rise
strong


and
insistent
.
soon
,
she
want
he
.
he
be
the
man
who
have
come


near
to
she
for
her
awakening
.




always
,
however
,
between
-
while
she
lapse
into
the
old


unconsciousness
,
indifference
and
there
be
a
will
in
she
to
save


herself
from
live
any
more
.
but
she
would
wake
in
the
morning
one
day


and
feel
her
blood
run
,
feel
herself
lie
open
like
a
flower


unsheathe
in
the
sun
,
insistent
and
potent
with
demand
.




she
get
to
know
he
well
,
and
her
instinct
fix
on
he
—
just
on
he
.


her
impulse
be
strong
against
he
,
because
he
be
not
of
her
own
sort
.


but
one
blind
instinct
lead
she
,
to
take
he
,
to
leave
he
,
and
then
to


relinquish
herself
to
he
.
it
would
be
safety
.
she
feel
the
root


safety
of
he
,
and
the
life
in
he
.
also
he
be
young
and
very
fresh
.


the
blue
,
steady
livingness
of
his
eye
she
enjoy
like
morning
.
he


be
very
young
.




then
she
lapse
again
to
stupor
and
indifference
.
this
,
however
,
be


bind
to
pass
.
the
warmth
flow
through
she
,
she
feel
herself
open
,


unfold
,
ask
,
as
a
flower
open
in
full
request
under
the
sun
,
as


the
beak
of
tiny
bird
open
flat
,
to
receive
,
to
receive
.
and
unfold


she
turn
to
he
,
straight
to
he
.
and
he
come
,
slowly
,
afraid
,
hold


back
by
uncouth
fear
,
and
drive
by
a
desire
big
than
himself
.




when
she
open
and
turn
to
he
,
then
all
that
have
be
and
all
that


be
,
be
go
from
she
,
she
be
as
new
as
a
flower
that
unsheathe


itself
and
stand
always
ready
,
wait
,
receptive
.
he
could
not


understand
this
.
he
force
himself
,
through
lack
of
understanding
,
to


the
adherence
to
the
line
of
honourable
courtship
and
sanction
,


license
marriage
.
therefore
,
after
he
have
go
to
the
vicarage
and


ask
for
she
,
she
remain
for
some
day
hold
in
this
one
spell
,
open
,


receptive
to
he
,
before
he
.
he
be
rouse
to
chaos
.
he
speak
to
the


vicar
and
give
in
the
banns
.
then
he
stand
to
wait
.




she
remain
attentive
and
instinctively
expectant
before
he
,


unfold
,
ready
to
receive
he
.
he
could
not
act
,
because
of
self
-
fear


and
because
of
his
conception
of
honour
towards
she
.
so
he
remain
in


a
state
of
chaos
.




and
after
a
few
day
,
gradually
she
close
again
,
away
from
he
,
be


sheathe
over
,
impervious
to
he
,
oblivious
.
then
a
black
,
bottomless


despair
become
real
to
he
,
he
know
what
he
have
lose
.
he
feel
he
have


lose
it
for
good
,
he
know
what
it
be
to
have
be
in
communication


with
she
,
and
to
be
cast
off
again
.
in
misery
,
his
heart
like
a
heavy


stone
,
he
go
about
unliving
.




till
gradually
he
become
desperate
,
lose
his
understanding
,
be
plunge


in
a
revolt
that
know
no
bound
.
inarticulate
,
he
move
with
she
at
the


Marsh
in
violent
,
gloomy
,
wordless
passion
,
almost
in
hatred
of
she
.


till
gradually
she
become
aware
of
he
,
aware
of
herself
with
regard
to


he
,
her
blood
stir
to
life
,
she
begin
to
open
towards
he
,
to
flow


towards
he
again
.
he
wait
till
the
spell
be
between
they
again
,


till
they
be
together
within
one
rushing
,
hasten
flame
.
and
then


again
he
be
bewildered
,
he
be
tie
up
as
with
cord
,
and
could
not


move
to
she
.
so
she
come
to
he
,
and
unfasten
the
breast
of
his


waistcoat
and
his
shirt
,
and
put
her
hand
on
he
,
need
to
know
he
.


for
it
be
cruel
to
she
,
to
be
open
and
offer
to
he
,
yet
not
to


know
what
he
be
,
not
even
that
he
be
there
.
she
give
herself
to
the


hour
,
but
he
could
not
,
and
he
bungle
in
take
she
.




so
that
he
live
in
suspense
,
as
if
only
half
his
faculty
work
,


until
the
wedding
.
she
do
not
understand
.
but
the
vagueness
come
over


she
again
,
and
the
day
lapse
by
.
he
could
not
get
definitely
into


touch
with
she
.
for
the
time
being
,
she
let
he
go
again
.




he
suffer
very
much
from
the
thought
of
actual
marriage
,
the
intimacy


and
nakedness
of
marriage
.
he
know
she
so
little
.
they
be
so
foreign


to
each
other
,
they
be
such
stranger
.
and
they
could
not
talk
to


each
other
.
when
she
talk
,
of
Poland
or
of
what
have
be
,
it
be
all


so
foreign
,
she
scarcely
communicate
anything
to
he
.
and
when
he


look
at
she
,
an
over
-
much
reverence
and
fear
of
the
unknown
change


the
nature
of
his
desire
into
a
sort
of
worship
,
hold
her
aloof
from


his
physical
desire
,
self
-
thwarting
.




she
do
not
know
this
,
she
do
not
understand
.
they
have
look
at
each


other
,
and
have
accept
each
other
.
it
be
so
,
then
there
be
nothing


to
balk
at
,
it
be
complete
between
they
.




at
the
wedding
,
his
face
be
stiff
and
expressionless
.
he
want
to


drink
,
to
get
rid
of
his
forethought
and
afterthought
,
to
set
the


moment
free
.
but
he
could
not
.
the
suspense
only
tighten
at
his


heart
.
the
jesting
and
joviality
and
jolly
,
broad
insinuation
of
the


guest
only
coil
he
more
.
he
could
not
hear
.
that
which
be


impend
obsess
he
,
he
could
not
get
free
.




she
sit
quiet
,
with
a
strange
,
still
smile
.
she
be
not
afraid
.
have


accept
he
,
she
want
to
take
he
,

altogether
to
the


hour
,
now
.
no

,
only

,
her
hour
.
she
do
not

proud
,

grey
eye

and


dilate
,
so
that
the

,
and
the
woman
be


elate
by
she
,
they
serve

.
very
wonderful
she
be
,
as
she

with
pride
and
recognition
,

hearty
handshake
to
his


friend
,
receive
their
regard
gratefully
,
glad
of
their
attention
.


his
heart
be
torment
within
he
,
he
do
not
try
to
smile
.
the
time


of
his
trial
and
his
admittance
,
his
Gethsemane
and
his
Triumphal
Entry


in
one
,
have
come
now
.




behind
she
,
there

so
much
unknown
to

when
he

to
such
a
terrible
painful
unknown
.
how
could
he
embrace
it
and

it
?
how
could
he
close
his
arm
round
all
this
darkness
and
hold


it
to
his
breast
and
give
himself
to
it
?
what
might
not
happen
to
he

if
he

to
yield
himself
naked
out
of
his
own
hand
into
the


unknown
power
!
how
could

strong
enough
to
take
she
,
put
his


arm
round
she
and
have
she

and
be
sure

a
sort
of
sombre
exclusion

a
curious


communion
with
mysterious
power

sort
of
mystic
,
dark

come
at
last

then
he
burst
into
flame


for
she
,

lose
himself

look
at
each
other

deep
laugh
at


the
bottom
of
their
eye

inexhaustible
exploration

should
it
chime
again
,

be
ready
for
it
,
ready
to
renew
the
game


at
the
point
where
it
be
leave
off

on
the
edge
of
the
outer
darkness

his
anger


break
on
she

to
he
.
he
have
sense
enough
,


premonition
enough
in
himself
,
to
be
aware
of
this
and
to
measure


himself
accordingly
.
for
he
do
not
want
to
lose
she
:
he
do
not
want


she
to
lapse
away
.




cold
,
he
call
she
,
selfish
,
only
care
about
herself
,
a
foreigner


with
a
bad
nature
,
care
really
about
nothing
,
have
no
proper


feeling
at
the
bottom
of
she
,
and
no
proper
niceness
.
he
rage
,
and


pile
up
accusation
that
have
some
measure
of
truth
in
they
all
.
but
a


certain
grace
in
he
forbid
he
from
go
too
far
.
he
know
,
and
he


quiver
with
rage
and
hatred
,
that
she
be
all
these
vile
thing
,
that


she
be
everything
vile
and
detestable
.
but
he
have
grace
at
the
bottom


of
he
,
which
tell
he
that
,
above
all
thing
,
he
do
not
want
to
lose


she
,
he
be
not
go
to
lose
she
.




so
he
keep
some
consideration
for
she
,
he
preserve
some
relationship
.


he
go
out
more
often
,
to
the
"
Red
Lion
"
again
,
to
escape
the
madness


of
sit
next
to
she
when
she
do
not
belong
to
he
,
when
she
be
as


absent
as
any
woman
in
indifference
could
be
.
he
could
not
stay
at


home
.
so
he
go
to
the
"
Red
Lion
"
.
and
sometimes
he
get
drunk
.
but
he


preserve
his
measure
,
some
thing
between
they
he
never
forfeit
.




a
torment
look
come
into
his
eye
,
as
if
something
be
always


dog
he
.
he
glance
sharp
and
quick
,
he
could
not
bear
to
sit
still


do
nothing
.
he
have
to
go
out
,
to
find
company
,
to
give
himself
away


there
.
for
he
have
no
other
outlet
,
he
could
not
work
to
give
himself


out
,
he
have
not
the
knowledge
.




as
the
month
of
her
pregnancy
go
on
,
she
leave
he
more
and
more


alone
,
she
be
more
and
more
unaware
of
he
,
his
existence
be


annul
.
and
he
feel
bind
down
,
bind
,
unable
to
stir
,
begin
to


go
mad
,
ready
to
rave
.
for
she
be
quiet
and
polite
,
as
if
he
do
not


exist
,
as
one
be
quiet
and
polite
to
a
servant
.




nevertheless
she
be
great
with
his
child
,
it
be
his
turn
to
submit
.


she
sit
opposite
he
,
sewing
,
her
foreign
face
inscrutable
and


indifferent
.
he
feel
he
want
to
break
she
into
acknowledgment
of
he
,


into
awareness
of
he
.
it
be
insufferable
that
she
have
so
obliterate


he
.
he
would
smash
she
into
regard
he
.
he
have
a
rage
agony
of


desire
to
do
so
.




but
something
big
in
he
withhold
he
,
keep
he
motionless
.
so
he


go
out
of
the
house
for
relief
.
or
he
turn
to
the
little
girl
for


her
sympathy
and
her
love
,
he
appeal
with
all
his
power
to
the
small


Anna
.
so
soon
they
be
like
lover
,
father
and
child
.




for
he
be
afraid
of
his
wife
.
as
she
sit
there
with
bent
head
,
silent
,


work
or
read
,
but
so
unutterably
silent
that
his
heart
seem


under
the
millstone
of
it
,
she
become
herself
like
the
upper
millstone


lie
on
he
,
crush
he
,
as
sometimes
a
heavy
sky
lie
on
the
earth
.




yet
he
know
he
could
not
tear
she
away
from
the
heavy
obscurity
into


which
she
be
merge
.
he
must
not
try
to
tear
she
into
recognition
of


himself
,
and
agreement
with
himself
.
it
be
disastrous
,
impious
.
so
,


let
he
rage
as
he
might
,
he
must
withhold
himself
.
but
his
wrist


tremble
and
seem
mad
,
seem
as
if
they
would
burst
.




when
,
in
November
,
the
leave
came
beat
against
the
window
shutter
,


with
a
lash
sound
,
he
start
,
and
his
eye
flicker
with
flame
.


the
dog
look
up
at
he
,
he
sink
his
head
to
the
fire
.
but
his
wife


be
startled
.
he
be
aware
of
her
listen
.




"
they
blow
up
with
a
rattle
,
"
he
say
.




"
what
?
"
she
ask
.




"
the
leave
.
"




she
sink
away
again
.
the
strange
leave
beat
in
the
wind
on
the
wood


have
come
near
than
she
.
the
tension
in
the
room
be
overpower
,
it


be
difficult
for
he
to
move
his
head
.
he
sit
with
every
nerve
,
every


vein
,
every
fibre
of
muscle
in
his
body
stretch
on
a
tension
.
he
feel


like
a
broken
arch
thrust
sickeningly
out
from
support
.
for
she


response
be
go
,
he
thrust
at
nothing
.
and
he
remain
himself
,
he


save
himself
from
crash
down
into
nothingness
,
from
be


squander
into
fragment
,
by
sheer
tension
,
sheer
backward
resistance
.




during
the
last
month
of
her
pregnancy
,
he
go
about
in
a
surcharged
,


imminent
state
that
do
not
exhaust
itself
.
she
be
also
depressed
,
and


sometimes
she
cry
.
it
need
so
much
life
to
begin
afresh
,
after
she


have
lose
so
lavishly
.
sometimes
she
cry
.
then
he
stand
stiff
,
feel


his
heart
would
burst
.
for
she
do
not
want
he
,
she
do
not
want
even


to
be
make
aware
of
he
.
by
the
very
puckering
of
her
face
he
know
that


he
must
stand
back
,
leave
she
intact
,
alone
.
for
it
be
the
old
grief


come
back
in
she
,
the
old
loss
,
the
pain
of
the
old
life
,
the
dead


husband
,
the
dead
child
.
this
be
sacred
to
she
,
and
he
must
not


violate
she
with
his
comfort
.
for
what
she
want
she
would
come
to


he
.
he
stand
aloof
with
turgid
heart
.




he
have
to
see
her
tear
come
,
fall
over
her
scarcely
move
face
,
that


only
pucker
sometimes
,
down
on
to
her
breast
,
that
be
so
still
,


scarcely
move
.
and
there
be
no
noise
,
save
now
and
again
,
when
,
with


a
strange
,
somnambulant
movement
,
she
take
her
handkerchief
and
wipe


her
face
and
blow
her
nose
,
and
go
on
with
the
noiseless
weeping
.
he


know
that
any
offer
of
comfort
from
himself
would
be
bad
than


useless
,
hateful
to
she
,
jangle
she
.
she
must
cry
.
but
it
drive
he


insane
.
his
heart
be
scald
,
his
brain
hurt
in
his
head
,
he
go


away
,
out
of
the
house
.




his
great
and
chief
source
of
solace

the
child
.
she
have
be
at


first

.
however
friendly
she
might
seem
one


day
,
the
next
she

original
disregard

,
in
the

cow

with
the
door
shut

warm
by
the
light
of
the
hang
lantern

above
the
branching
horn
of

about

on
the
floor


beside

sit
in
the
emptiness
of
the
downstairs
room
,


smoking
,
scarcely
conscious
even
of
his
own
misery
.

out
to

blue
flash
in

Brangwen
go
out
into
a
morning
like
crystal
,

sound
ring


again
,
and
the
bird
be
many
and
sudden
and
brusque
in
the
hedge
.


then
an
elation
come
over
he
in
spite
of
everything
,
whether
his
wife


be
strange
or
sad
,
or
whether
he
crave
for
she
to
be
with

noise

sky
be
like


crystal
,
like
a
bell
,
and
the
earth
be
hard
.
then
he
work
and
be


happy
,
his
eye
shine
,
his
cheek
flush
.
and
the
z
of
life
be


strong
in
he
.




the
bird
pecked
busily
round

,

horse

fresh
and
ready

bare
branch
of

up

with
energy

off
into

clear
light

alive

full
of

for
it
all
.
and
if

thing


would
be
as
they
would

meanwhile
he
hear
the
ring
crow
of
a


cockerel
in
the
distance
,
he
see
the
pale
shell
of
the
moon
efface
on


a
blue
sky
.




so
he
shout
to
the
horse
,
and
be
happy
.

he
hail
she
,


and
rein
in
his
horse
,
and
pick

up
.
then
he
be
glad
to
have


she
near
he
,
his
eye
shine
,
his
voice
,
laugh
,
tease
in
a
warm


fashion
,
make
the
poise
of
her
head
more
beautiful
,

be
at
the
bottom
,

it
stop
at
the
bottom
.

but
he


be
out
of
door
,
full
in
life
,
and
it
would
be
ridiculous
,
indecent
,


to
pull
a
long
face
and
to
insist
on

miserable
.
he

hoofs
of
the
horse

hard

happy
,

at
the


funeral
of
the
other
half

evening
arrive
later
very
beautiful
,
with
a
rosy
flush
hover


above
the
sunset
,
and
pass
away
into
violet
and
lavender
,
with


turquoise
green
north
and
south
in
the
sky
,
and
in
the
east
,
a
great
,


yellow
moon
hang
heavy
and
radiant
.
it
be
magnificent
to
walk


between
the
sunset
and
the
moon
,
on
a
road
where

holly

right
enough
,
later
on
,

Tom
Brangwen
never
love
his
own
son
as
he
love
his
stepchild
Anna
.


when
they
tell
he
it
be
a
boy
,
he
have
a
thrill
of
pleasure
.
he
like


the
confirmation
of
fatherhood
.
it
give
he
satisfaction
to
know
he
have


a
son
.
but
he
feel
not
very
much
outgoing
to
the
baby
itself
.
he
be


its
father
,
that
be
enough
.




he
be
glad
that
his
wife
be
mother
of
his
child
.
she
be
serene
,
a


little
bit
shadowy
,
as
if
she
be
transplant
.
in
the
birth
of
the


child
she
seem
to
lose
connection
with
her
former
self
.
she
become


now
really
English
,
really
Mrs.
Brangwen
.
her
vitality
,
however
,
seem


lower
.




she
be
still
,
to
Brangwen
,
immeasurably
beautiful
.
she
be
still


passionate
,
with
a
flame
of
be
.
but
the
flame
be
not
robust
and


present
.
her
eye
shine
,
her
face
glow
for
he
,
but
like
some
flower


open
in
the
shade
,
that
could
not
bear
the
full
light
.
she
love
the


baby
.
but
even
this
,
with
a
sort
of
dimness
,
a
faint
absence
about
she
,


a
shadowiness
even
in
her
mother
-
love
.
when
Brangwen
see
her
nursing


his
child
,
happy
,
absorb
in
it
,
a
pain
go
over
he
like
a
thin


flame
.
for
he
perceive
how
he
must
subdue
himself
in
his
approach
to


she
.
and
he
want
again
the
robust
,
moral
exchange
of
love
and
passion


such
as
he
have
have
at
first
with
she
,
at
one
time
and
another
,
when


they
be
match
at
their
high
intensity
.
this
be
the
one


experience
for
he
now
.
and
he
want
it
,
always
,
with
remorseless


crave
.




she
come
to
he
again
,
with
the
same
lifting
of
her
mouth
as
have
drive


he
almost
mad
with
trammelle
passion
at
first
.
she
come
to
he
again
,


and
,
his
heart
delirious
in
delight
and
readiness
,
he
take
she
.
and
it


be
almost
as
before
.




perhaps
it
be
quite
as
before
.
at
any
rate
,
it
make
he
know


perfection
,
it
establish
in
he
a
constant
eternal
knowledge
.




but
it
die
down
before
he
want
it
to
die
down
.
she
be
finish
,
she


could
take
no
more
.
and
he
be
not
exhausted
,
he
want
to
go
on
.
but


it
could
not
be
.




so
he
have
to
begin
the
bitter
lesson
,
to
abate
himself
,
to
take
less


than
he
want
.
for
she
be
woman
to
he
,
all
other
woman
be
she


shadow
.
for
she
have
satisfy
he
.
and
he
want
it
to
go
on
.
and
it


could
not
.
however
he
rage
,
and
,
fill
with
suppression
that
become


hot
and
bitter
,
hate
she
in
his
soul
that
she
do
not
want
he
,


however
he
have
mad
outburst
,
and
drank
and
make
ugly
scene
,
still
he


know
,
he
be
only
kick
against
the
prick
.
it
be
not
,
he
have
to


learn
,
that
she
would
not
want
he
enough
,
as
much
as
he
demand
that


she
should
want
he
.
it
be
that
she
could
not
.
she
could
only
want
he


in
her
own
way
,
and
to
her
own
measure
.
and
she
have
spend
much
life


before
he
find
she
as
she
be
,
the
woman
who
could
take
he
and
give


he
fulfilment
.
she
have
take
he
and
give
he
fulfilment
.
she
still


could
do
so
,
in
her
own
time
and
way
.
but
he
must
control
himself
,


measure
himself
to
she
.




he
want
to
give
she
all
his
love
,
all
his
passion
,
all
his
essential


energy
.
but
it
could
not
be
.
he
must
find
other
thing
than
she
,
other


centre
of
living
.
she
sit
close
and
impregnable
with
the
child
.
and
he


be
jealous
of
the
child
.




but
he
love
she
,
and
time
come
to
give
some
sort
of
course
to
his


troublesome
current
of
life
,
so
that
it
do
not
foam
and
flood
and
make


misery
.
he
form
another
centre
of
love
in
her
child
,
Anna
.
gradually


a
part
of
his
stream
of
life
be
divert
to
the
child
,
relieve
the


main
flood
to
his
wife
.
also
he
seek
the
company
of
man
,
he
drink


heavily
now
and
again
.




the

to
have
so
much

more
childish
,


not
so

.
the


charge
of
the
mother
,
the
satisfying
of
the
mother
,
have
devolve


elsewhere

,
and
a
courtly
naïve
manner
that
again
be
new
and


strange
to
Brangwen
,
so
suave
,
so
merry
,
so
innocent
.




his
brother

too
amazing
.

a
boor
,
dull
,
stick
in
the
mud
.
More
than

want
to
clamber
out
,
to
this
visionary
polite
world
.




he
be
well
off
.
he
be
as
well
off
as
Alfred
,
who
could
not
have
above


six
hundred
a
year
,
all
tell
.
he
himself
make
about
four
hundred
,
and


could
make
more
.
his
investment
get
well
every
day
.
why
do
he
not


do
something
?
his
wife
be
a
lady
also
.




but
when
he
get
to
the
Marsh
,
he
realize
how
fix
everything
be
,
how


the
other
form
of
life
be
beyond
he
,
and
he
regret
for
the
first


time
that
he
have
succeed
to
the
farm
.
he
feel
a
prisoner
,
sit


safe
and
easy
and
unadventurous
.
he
might
,
with
risk
,
have
do
more


with
himself
.
he
could
neither
read
Browning
nor
Herbert
Spencer
,
nor


have
access
to
such
a
room
as
Mrs.
Forbes
’s
.
all
that
form
of
life
be


outside
he
.




but
then
,
he
say
he
do
not
want
it
.
the
excitement
of
the
visit
begin


to
pass
off
.
the
next
day
he
be
himself
,
and
if
he
think
of
the


other
woman
,
there
be
something
about
she
and
her
place
that
he
do


not
like
,
something
cold
something
alien
,
as
if
she
be
not
a
woman
,


but
an
inhuman
being
who
use
up
human
life
for
cold
,
unliving


purpose
.




the
evening
come

close
and
narrow

within
the
darkness

swallow
he
and

be
the
baptism
to
another
life
,
it
be


the
complete
confirmation

foot
trod
strange
ground

they
have
pass
through
the
doorway
into
the
further
space
,
where


movement
be
so
big
,
that
it
contain
bond
and
constraint
and


labour

complete
liberty

the
doorway
to

have
stand
in

light
flood


out
from
behind
on
to
each
of

be
the
transfiguration

to
the
two
of

to
avoid
his
parishioner
.




Anna
be
very
much
impressed
by
he
.
he
be
a
smallish
man
with
a


rugged
,
rather
crumpled
face
and
blue
eye
set
very
deep
and
glowing
.

Anna
love
to
watch
he
.
she
like
the
big
,
new
,
ramble
vicarage
,


desolate
and
stark
on
its
hill
.
it
be
so
exposed
,
so
bleak
and
bold


after
the
Marsh
.
the
Baron
talk
endlessly
in
Polish
to
Mrs.
Brangwen
;


he
make
furious
gesture
with
his
hand
,
his
blue
eye
be
full
of


fire
.
and
to
Anna
,
there
be
a
significance
about
his
sharp
,
fling


movement
.
something
in
she
respond
to
his
extravagance
and
his


exuberant
manner
.
she
think
he
a
very
wonderful
person
.
she
be
shy


of
he
,
she
like
he
to
talk
to
she
.
she
feel
a
sense
of
freedom
near


he
.




she
never
could
tell
how
she
know
it
,
but
she
do
know
that
he
be
a


knight
of
Malta
.
she
could
never
remember
whether
she
have
see
his


star
,
or
cross
,
of
his
order
or
not
,
but
it
flash
in
her
mind
,
like
a


symbol
.
he
at
any
rate
represent
to
the
child
the
real
world
,
where


king
and
lord
and
prince
move
and
fulfil
their
shine
life
,


whilst
queen
and
lady
and
princess
uphold
the
noble
order
.




she
have
recognize
the
Baron
Skrebensky
as
a
real
person
,
he
have
have


some
regard
for
she
.
but
when
she
do
not
see
he
any
more
,
he
fade


and
become
a
memory
.
but
as
a
memory
he
be
always
alive
to
she
.




Anna
become
a
tall
,
awkward
girl
.
her
eye
be
still
very
dark
and


quick
,
but
they
have
grow
careless
,
they
have
lose
their
watchful
,


hostile
look
.
her
fierce
,
spin
hair
turn
brown
,
it
grow
heavy
and


be
tie
back
.
she
be
send
to
a
young
lady
’
school
in
Nottingham
.




and
at
this
period
she
be
absorb
in
become
a
young
lady
.
she
be


intelligent
enough
,
but
not
interested
in
learn
.
at
first
,
she


think
all
the
girl
at
school
very
ladylike
and
wonderful
,
and
she


want
to
be
like
they
.
she
come
to
a
speedy
disillusion
:
they
gall


and
madden
she
,
they
be
petty
and
mean
.
after
the
loose
,
generous


atmosphere
of
her
home
,
where
little
thing
do
not
count
,
she
be


always
uneasy
in
the
world
,
that
would
snap
and
bite
at
every
trifle
.




a
quick
change
come
over
she
.
she
mistrust
herself
,
she
mistrust


the
outer
world
.
she
do
not
want
to
go
on
,
she
do
not
want
to
go
out


into
it
,
she
want
to
go
no
far
.




"
what
do
_
I
_
care
about
that
lot
of
girl
?
"
she
would
say
to
she


father
,
contemptuously
;
"
they
be
nobody
.
"




the
trouble
be
that
the
girl
would
not
accept
Anna
at
her
measure
.


they
would
have
she
accord
to
themselves
or
not
at
all
.
so
she
be


confuse
,
seduce
,
she
become
as
they
be
for
a
time
,
and
then
,
in


revulsion
,
she
hate
they
furiously
.




"
why
do
n’t
you
ask
some
of
your
girl
here
?
"
her
father
would
say
.




"
they
’re
not
come
here
,
"
she
cry
.




"
and
why
not
?
"




"
they
’re
bagatelle
,
"
she
say
,
use
one
of
her
mother
’s
rare
phrase
.




"
bagatelle
or
billiard
,
it
make
no
matter
,
they
’re
nice
young
lass


enough
.
"




but
Anna
be
not
to
be
win
over
.
she
have
a
curious
shrinking
from


commonplace
people
,
and
particularly
from
the
young
lady
of
her
day
.


she
would
not
go
into
company
because
of
the
ill
-
at
-
ease
feel
other


people
bring
upon
she
.
and
she
never
could
decide
whether
it
be
she


fault
or
theirs
.
she
half
respect
these
other
people
,
and
continuous


disillusion
madden
she
.
she
want
to
respect
they
.
still
she
think


the
people
she
do
not
know
be
wonderful
.
those
she
know
seem


always
to
be
limit
she
,
tie
she
up
in
little
falsity
that


irritated
she
beyond
bearing
.
she
would
rather
stay
at
home
and
avoid


the
rest
of
the
world
,
leave
it
illusory
.




for
at
the
Marsh
life
have
indeed
a
certain
freedom
and
largeness
.
there


be
no
fret
about
money
,
no
mean
little
precedence
,
nor
care
for
what


other
people
think
,
because
neither
Mrs.
Brangwen
nor
Brangwen
could


be
sensible
of
any
judgment
pass
on
they
from
outside
.
their
life


be
too
separate
.




so
Anna
be
only
easy
at
home
,
where
the
common
sense
and
the
supreme


relation
between
her
parent
produce
a
free
standard
of
be
than


she
could
find
outside
.
where
,
outside
the
Marsh
,
could
she
find
the


tolerant
dignity
she
have
be
bring
up
in
?
her
parent
stand


undiminished
and
unaware
of
criticism
.
the
people
she
meet
outside


seem
to
begrudge
she
her
very
existence
.
they
seem
to
want
to


belittle
she
also
.
she
be
exceedingly
reluctant
to
go
amongst
they
.


she
depend
upon
her
mother
and
her
father
.
and
yet
she
want
to
go


out
.




at
school
,
or
in
the
world
,
she
be
usually
at
fault
,
she
feel
usually


that
she
ought
to
be
slink
in
disgrace
.
she
never
feel
quite
sure
,


in
herself
,
whether
she
be
wrong
,
or
whether
the
other
be
wrong
.


she
have
not
do
her
lesson
:
well
,
she
do
not
see
any
reason
why
she


_
should
_
do
her
lesson
,
if
she
do
not
want
to
.
be
there
some
occult


reason
why
she
should
?
be
these
people
,
schoolmistress
,


representative
of
some
mystic
right
,
some
high
good
?
they
seem
to


think
so
themselves
.
but
she
could
not
for
her
life
see
why
a
woman


should
bully
and
insult
she
because
she
do
not
know
thirty
line
of
as


you
like
it
.
after
all
,
_
what
_
do
it
matter
if
she
know
they
or
not
?


nothing
could
persuade
she
that
it
be
of
the
slight
importance
.


because
she
despise
inwardly
the
coarsely
work
nature
of
the


mistress
.
therefore
she
be
always
at
out
with
authority
.
from


constant
telling
,
she
come
almost
to
believe
in
her
own
badness
,
she


own
intrinsic
inferiority
.
she
feel
that
she
ought
always
to
be
in
a


state
of
slink
disgrace
,
if
she
fulfil
what
be
expect
of
she
.


but
she
rebel
.
she
never
really
believe
in
her
own
badness
.
at
the


bottom
of
her
heart
she
despise
the
other
people
,
who
carp
and
be


loud
over
trifle
.
she
despise
they
,
and
want
revenge
on
they
.
she


hate
they
whilst
they
have
power
over
she
.




still
she
keep
an
ideal
:
a
free
,
proud
lady
absolve
from
the
petty


tie
,
exist
beyond
petty
consideration
.
she
would
see
such
lady


in
picture
:
Alexandra
,
Princess
of
Wales
,
be
one
of
her
model
.
this


lady
be
proud
and
royal
,
and
step
indifferently
over
all
small
,


mean
desire
:
so
think
Anna
,
in
her
heart
.
and
the
girl
do
up
she


hair
high
under
a
little
slanting
hat
,
her
skirt
be
fashionably


bunch
up
,
she
wear
an
elegant
,
skin
-
fit
coat
.




her
father
be
delighted
.
Anna
be
very
proud
in
her
bearing
,
too


naturally
indifferent
to
small
bond
to
satisfy
Ilkeston
,
which
would


have
like
to
put
she
down
.
but
Brangwen
be
have
no
such
thing
.
if


she
choose
to
be
royal
,
royal
she
should
be
.
he
stand
like
a
rock


between
she
and
the
world
.




after
the
fashion
of
his
family
,
he
grow
stout
and
handsome
.
his
blue


eye
be
full
of
light
,
twinkle
and
sensitive
,
his
manner
be


deliberate
,
but
hearty
,
warm
.
his
capacity
for
live
his
own
life


without
attention
from
his
neighbour
make
they
respect
he
.
they
would


run
to
do
anything
for
he
.
he
do
not
consider
they
,
but
be


open
-
handed
towards
they
,
so
they
make
profit
of
their
willingness
.
he


like
people
,
so
long
as
they
remain
in
the
background
.




Mrs.
Brangwen
go
on
in
her
own
way
,
follow
her
own
device
.
she


have
her
husband
,
her
two
son
and
Anna
.
these
stake
out
and
mark
she


horizon
.
the
other
people
be
outsider
.
inside
her
own
world
,
she


life
pass
along
like
a
dream
for
she
,
it
lapse
,
and
she
live
within


its
lapse
,
active
and
always
pleased
,
intent
.
she
scarcely
notice
the


outer
thing
at
all
.
what
be
outside
be
outside
,
non

existent
.
she


do
not
mind
if
the
boy
fight
,
so
long
as
it
be
out
of
her
presence
.


but
if
they
fight
when
she
be
by
,
she
be
angry
,
and
they
be
afraid


of
she
.
she
do
not
care
if
they
break
a
window
of
a
railway
carriage


or
sell
their
watch
to
have
a
revel
at
the
Goose
Fair
.
Brangwen
be


perhaps
angry
over
these
thing
.
to
the
mother
they
be
insignificant
.


it
be
odd
little
thing
that
offend
she
.
she
be
furious
if
the
boy


hang
around
the
slaughter
-
house
,
she
be
displeased
when
the
school


report
be
bad
.
it
do
not
matter
how
many
sin
her
boy
be
accuse


of
,
so
long
as
they
be
not
stupid
,
or
inferior
.
if
they
seem
to


brook
insult
,
she
hate
they
.
and
it
be
only
a
certain
_
gaucherie
_
,
a


gawkiness
on
Anna
’s
part
that
irritate
she
against
the
girl
.
certain


form
of
clumsiness
,
grossness
,
make
the
mother
’s
eye
glow
with


curious
rage

otherwise

she
be
still
a
foreigner
,
unsure
of
her
ground
.
but
alone
with


her
own
child
and
husband
at
the
Marsh
,
she
be
mistress
of
a

a
matter
of
indifference

yet
she

some


fundamental
religion

be
as
if

in
the

to

so

there
,
on
the


farm
with

he
live
through
a
mystery
of
life
and
death
and


creation
,
strange
,
profound
ecstasy
and
incommunicable
satisfaction
,


of
which
the
rest
of
the
world
know
nothing

which
make
the
pair

silver
,
when
she
have
it
between
her
finger
,
fill
she
with

learn
an
Ave

a
Pater

she
be
seventeen
,
touchy
,
full
of
spirit
,
and
very
moody
:
quick
to


flush
,
and
always
uneasy
,
uncertain
.
for
some
reason
or
other
,
she


turn
more
to
her
father
,
she
feel
almost
flash
of
hatred
for
she


mother
.
her
mother
’s
dark
muzzle
and
curiously
insidious
way
,
she


mother
’s
utter
surety
and
confidence
,
her
strange
satisfaction
,
even


triumph
,
her
mother
’s
way
of
laugh
at
thing
and
her
mother
’s
silent


override
of
vexatious
proposition
,
most
of
all
her
mother
’s


triumphant
power
madden
the
girl
.




she
become
sudden
and
incalculable
.
often
she
stand
at
the
window
,


look
out
,
as
if
she
want
to
go
.
sometimes
she
go
,
she
mix
with


people
.

always
she
come
home
in
anger

belittle
,
almost
degrade

there
be
over
the
house
a
kind
of
dark
silence
and
intensity
,
in
which


passion
work
its
inevitable
conclusion
.
there
be
in
the
house
a


sort
of
richness
,
a
deep
,
inarticulate
interchange
which
make
other


place
seem
thin
and
unsatisfying
.
Brangwen
could
sit
silent
,
smoke


in
his
chair
,
the
mother
could
move
about
in
she
quiet
,
insidious
way
,


and
the
sense
of
the
two

be
powerful
,
sustain

the
whole


intercourse
be
wordless

and
close

Anna
be
uneasy

she
want
to
get
away
.

wherever
she
go

there
come
upon
she

she
hasten
home
.




there
she
rage
and
interrupt
the
strong
,
settle
interchange
.


sometimes
her
mother
turn
on
she
with
a
fierce
,
destructive
anger
,
in


which
be
no
pity
or
consideration
.
and
Anna
shrink
,
afraid
.
she
go


to
her
father
.




he
would
still
listen
to
the
spoken
word
,
which
fall
sterile
on
the


unheede
mother
.
sometimes
Anna
talk
to
her
father
.
she
try
to


discuss
people
,
she
want
to
know
what
be
mean
.
but
her
father


become
uneasy
.
he
do
not
want
to
have
thing
drag
into


consciousness
.
only
out
of
consideration
for
she
he
listen
.
and
there


be
a
kind
of
bristle
rousedness
in
the
room
.
the
cat
get
up
and


stretch
itself
,
go
uneasily
to
the
door
.
Mrs.
Brangwen
be
silent
,


she
seem
ominous
.
Anna
could
not
go
on
with
her
fault
-
finding
,
she


criticism
,
her
expression
of
dissatisfaction
.
she
feel
even
her
father


against
she
.
he
have
a
strong
,
dark
bond
with
her
mother
,
a
potent


intimacy
that
exist
inarticulate
and
wild
,
follow
its
own
course
,


and
savage
if
interrupt
,
uncover
.




nevertheless
Brangwen
be
uneasy
about
the
girl
,
the
whole
house


continue
to
be
disturb
.
she
have
a
pathetic
,
baffled
appeal
.
she
be


hostile
to
her
parent
,
even
whilst
she
live
entirely
with
they
,


within
their
spell
.




many
way
she
try
,
of
escape
.
she
become
an
assiduous
church
-
goer
.


but
the
_
language
_
mean
nothing
to
she
:
it
seem
false
.
she
hate
to


hear
thing
express
,
put
into
word
.
whilst
the
religious
feeling


be
inside
she
they
be
passionately
move
.
in
the
mouth
of
the


clergyman
,
they
be
false
,
indecent
.
she
try
to
read
.
but
again
the


tedium
and
the
sense
of
the
falsity
of
the
spoken
word
put
she
off
.
she


go
to
stay
with
girl
friend
.
at
first
she
think
it
splendid
.
but


then
the
inner
boredom
come
on
,
it
seem
to
she
all
nothingness
.
and


she
felt
always
belittle
,
as
if
never
,
never
could
she
stretch
she


length
and
stride
her
stride
.




her
mind
revert
often
to
the
torture
cell
of
a
certain
Bishop
of


France
,
in
which
the
victim
could
neither
stand
nor
lie
stretch
out
,


never
.
not
that
she
think
of
herself
in
any
connection
with
this
.
but


often
there
come
into
her
mind
the
wonder
,
how
the
cell
be
build
,
and


she
could
feel
the
horror
of
the
crampedness
,
as
something
very
real
.




she
be
,
however
,
only
eighteen
when
a
letter
come
from
Mrs.
Alfred


Brangwen
,
in
Nottingham
,
say
that
her
son
William
be
come
to


Ilkeston
to
take
a
place
as
junior
draughtsman
,
scarcely
more
than


apprentice
,
in
a
lace
factory
.
he
be
twenty
year
old
,
and
would
the


Marsh
Brangwens
be
friendly
with
he
.




Tom
Brangwen
at
once
write
offer
the
young
man
a
home
at
the
Marsh
.


this
be
not
accept
,
but
the
Nottingham
Brangwens
express


gratitude
.




there
have
never
be
much
love
lose
between
the
Nottingham
Brangwens


and
the
Marsh
.
indeed
,
Mrs.
Alfred
,
having
inherit
three
thousand


pound
,
and
have
occasion
to
be
dissatisfy
with
her
husband
,
hold


aloof
from
all
the
Brangwens
whatsoever
.
she
affect
,
however
,
some


esteem
of
Mrs.
Tom
,
as
she
call
the
polish
woman
,
say
that
at
any


rate
she
be
a
lady
.




Anna
Brangwen
be
faintly
excited
at
the
news
of
her
Cousin
Will
’s


come
to
Ilkeston
.
she
know
plenty
of
young
man
,
but
they
have
never


become
real
to
she
.
she
have
see
in
this
young
gallant
a
nose
she


like
,
in
that
a
pleasant
moustache
,
in
the
other
a
nice
way
of
wear


clothe
,
in
one
a
ridiculous
fringe
of
hair
,
in
another
a
comical
way


of
talk
.
they
be
object
of
amusement
and
faint
wonder
to
she
,


rather
than
real
being
,
the
young
man
.




the
only
man
she
know
be
her
father
;
and
,
as
he
be
something
large
,


loom
,
a
kind
of
Godhead
,
he
embrace
all
manhood
for
she
,
and
other


man
be
just
incidental
.




she
remember
her
cousin
Will
.
he
have
town

and
be
thin
,
with


a
very
curious
head
,
black
as
jet
,
with
hair
like
sleek
,
thin
fur
.
it


be
a
curious
head
:
it
remind
she
she
know
not
of
what
:
of
some


animal
,
some
mysterious
animal
that
live
in
the
darkness
under
the


leave
and
never
come
out
,
but
which
live
vividly
,
swift
and
intense
.


she
always
think
of
he
with
that
black
,
keen
,
blind
head
.
and
she


consider
he
odd
.




he
appear
at
the
Marsh
one
Sunday
morning
:
a
rather
long
,
thin
youth


with
a
bright
face
and
a
curious
self
-
possession
among
his
shyness
,
a


native
unawareness
of
what
other
people
might
be
,
since
he
be
himself
.




when
Anna
come
downstairs
in

ready
for

,
he

she
of
the
thin
,
fine
fur
of


his
hair

of
something
strange
in
he
.

voice

rather
high
upper
note
,
and
very
resonant
middle
note

it
be
queer
.
she

bright
.

coloured
light


through
which
something
take
place
obscurely

a
hatred


that

with
a


love
that

clumsy
,
he

only
half
articulate

but
he

that
could
ring
its
vibration
through
the
girl
’s
soul
,
transport
she


into
his
feeling
.

voice

hot
and
declamatory
,


sometimes
it
have
a
strange
,
twanging
,
almost
cat
-
like
sound
,
sometimes


it
hesitate
,
puzzle
,
sometimes
there
be
the
break
of
a
little
laugh
.


Anna
be
take
by
he
.
she
love
the
running
flame
that
course
through


she
as
she
listen
to
he
.
and
his
mother
and
his
father
become
to
she


two
separate
people
in
her
life
.




for
some
week
the
youth
come
frequently
,
and
be
receive
gladly
by


they
all
.
he
sit
amongst
they
,
his
dark
face
glow
,
an
eagerness
and


a
touch
of
derisiveness
on
his
wide
mouth
,
something
grin
and


twisted
,
his
eye
always
shine
like
a
bird
’s
,
utterly
without
depth
.


there
be
no
get
hold
of
the
fellow
,
Brangwen
irritably
think
.
he


be
like
a
grin
young
tom
-
cat
,
that
come
when
he
think
he
would
,


and
without
cognizance
of
the
other
person
.




at
first
the
youth
have
look
towards
Tom
Brangwen
when
he
talk
;
and


then
he
look
towards
his
aunt
,
for
her
appreciation
,
value
it
more


than
his
uncle
’s
;
and
then
he
turn
to
Anna
,
because
from
she
he
get


what
he
want
,
which
be
not
in
the
eld
people
.




so
that
the
two
young
people
,
from
be
always
attendant
on
the
elder
,


begin
to
draw
apart
and
establish
a
separate
kingdom
.
sometimes
Tom


Brangwen
be
irritated
.
his
nephew
irritate
he
.
the
lad
seem
to
he


too
special
,
self
-
contain
.
his
nature
be
fierce
enough
,
but
too
much


abstracted
,
like
a
separate
thing
,
like
a
cat
’s
nature
.
a
cat
could
lie


perfectly
peacefully
on
the
hearthrug
whilst
its
master
or
mistress


writhe
in
agony
a
yard
away
.
it
have
nothing
to
do
with
other
people
’s


affair
.
what
do
the
lad
really
care
about
anything
,
save
his
own


instinctive
affair
?




Brangwen
be
irritated
.
nevertheless
he
like
and
respect
his
nephew
.


Mrs.
Brangwen
be
irritated
by
Anna
,
who
be
suddenly
change
,
under


the
influence
of
the
youth
.
the
mother
like
the
boy
:
he
be
not
quite


an
outsider
.
but
she
do
not
like
her
daughter
to
be
so
much
under
the


spell
.




so
that
gradually
the
two
young
people
draw
apart
,
escape
from
the


elder
,
to
create
a
new
thing
by
themselves
.
he
work
in
the
garden
to


propitiate
his
uncle
.
he
talk
church
to
propitiate
his
aunt
.
he


follow
Anna
like
a
shadow
:
like
a
long
,
persistent
,
unswerve
black


shadow
he
go
after
the
girl
.
it
irritate
Brangwen
exceedingly
.
it


exasperate
he
beyond
bearing
,
to
see
the
light
-
up
grin
,
the
cat
-
grin
as


he
call
it
,
on
his
nephew
’s
face
.




and
Anna
have
a
new
reserve
,
a
new
independence
.
suddenly
she
begin
to


act
independently
of
her
parent
,
to
live
beyond
they
.
her
mother
have


flash
of
anger
.




but
the
courtship
go
on
.
Anna
would
find
occasion
to
go
shop
in


Ilkeston
at
evening
.
she
always
return
with
her
cousin
;
he
walk


with
his
head
over
her
shoulder
,
a
little
bit
behind
she
,
like
the


Devil
look
over
Lincoln
,
as
Brangwen
note
angrily
and
yet
with


satisfaction
.




to
his
own
wonder
,
will
Brangwen
find
himself
in
an
electric
state
of


passion
.
to
his
wonder
,
he
have
stop
she
at
the
gate
as
they
come


home
from
Ilkeston
one
night
,
and
have
kiss
she
,
block
her
way
and


kiss
she
whilst
he
feel
as
if
some
blow
be
strike
at
he
in
the


dark
.
and
when
they
go
indoor
,
he
be
acutely
angry
that
her
parent


look
up
scrutinize
at
he
and
she
.
what
right
have
they
there
:
why


should
they
look
up
!
let
they
remove
themselves
,
or
look
elsewhere
.




and
the
youth
go
home
with
the
star
in
heaven
whirl
fiercely


about
the
blackness
of
his
head
,
and
his
heart
fierce
,
insistent
,
but


fierce
as
if
he
feel
something
baulk
he
.

want
to
smash
through


something
.




a
spell
be
cast
over
she
.
and
how
uneasy

,
as
she
go


about
the
house
unnoticing
,
not

invisible
to
they
.

intensely
active
,
but
without
his
aid
or
attention
.
his

obscure
.

dark
place
of
her
being
.




they
very
rarely
touch
each
other
.
they
like
to

she
do
not

.
suddenly
,
with


an
incredibly
quick
,
delicate
movement
,
he
put
his
arm
round
she
and


draw
she
to
he
.
it
be
quick
,
cleanly
do
,
like
a
bird
that

and
sink

with
fire
.

eye
be
hard
and
bright
with
a
fierce


purpose
and
gladness
,
like
a
hawk
’s
.
she
feel
he
fly
into
the
dark


space
of
her
flame
,
like
a
brand
,
like
a
gleaming
hawk
.




they
have
look
at
each
other
,
and
see
each
other
strange
,
yet
near
,


very
near
,
like
a
hawk
stooping
,
swooping
,
drop
into
a
flame
of


darkness
.
so
she

the
candle
and
they
go
back
to
the
kitchen
.




they
go
on
in
this
way
for
some
time
,
always
come
together
,
but


rarely
touching
,
very
seldom
do
they
kiss
.
and
then
,
often
,
it
be


merely
a
touch
of
the
lip
,
a
sign
.
but
her
eye

to
waken
with
a


constant
fire
,
she
pause
often
in
the
midst
of
her
transit
,
as
if
to


recollect
something
,
or
to
discover
something
.




and
his
face

sombre
,
intent
,

do
not

.




one
evening
in

and
definite
,
come
out
of
the
chill
rain
,

suddenly
blind
with
love
for
he
.
yet
he
sit
and
talk
with
she

man
see
they
,
blur
through
the
rain
,
but
light
up
.
they
think


themselves
so
bury
in
the
night
.
he
even
see
the
light
dryness
of


the
loft
behind
,
and
shadow
and
bunche
of
roost
fowl
,
up
in
the


night
,
strange
shadow
cast
from
the
lantern
on
the
floor
.




and
a
black
gloom
of
anger
,
and
a
tenderness
of
self
-
effacement
,
fight


in
his
heart
.
she
do
not
understand
what
she
be
do
.
she
betray


herself
.
she
be
a
child
,
a
mere
child
.
she
do
not
know
how
much
of


herself
she
be
squander
.
and
he
be
blackly
and
furiously


miserable
.
be
he
then
an
old
man
,
that
he
should
be
give
she
away
in


marriage
?
be
he
old
?
he
be
not
old
.
he
be
young
than
that
young


thoughtless
fellow
in
whose
arm
she
lie
.
who
know
she
—
he
or
that


blind
-
headed
youth
?
to
whom
do
she
belong
,
if
not
to
himself
?




he
think
again
of
the
child
he
have
carry
out
at
night
into
the


barn
,
whilst
his
wife
be
in
labour
with
the
young
Tom
.
he
remember


the
soft
,
warm
weight
of
the
little
girl
on
his
arm
,
round
his
neck
.


now
she
would
say
he
be
finish
.
she
be
go
away
,
to
deny
he
,
to


leave
an
unendurable
emptiness
in
he
,
a
void
that
he
could
not
bear
.


almost
he
hate
she
.
how
dare
she
say
he
be
old
.
he
walk
on
in
the


rain
,
sweat
with
pain
,
with
the
horror
of
be
old
,
with
the
agony


of
have
to
relinquish
what
be
life
to
he
.




will
Brangwen
go
home
without
having
see
his
uncle
.
he
hold
his
hot


face
to
the
rain
,
and
walk
on
in
a
trance
.
"
I
love
you
,
will
,
I
love


you
.
"
the
word
repeat
themselves
endlessly
.
the
veil
have
rip
and


issue
he
naked
into
the
endless
space
,
and
he
shudder
.
the
wall


have
thrust
he
out
and
give
he
a
vast
space
to
walk
in
.
whither
,


through
this
darkness
of
infinite
space
,
be
he
walk
blindly
?
where
,


at
the
end
of
all
the
darkness
,
be
God
the
Almighty
still
darkly
,


seat
,
thrust
he
on
?
"
I
love
you
,
will
,
I
love
you
.
"
he
tremble


with
fear
as
the
word
beat
in
his
heart
again
.
and
he
dared
not
think


of
her
face
,
of
her
eye
which
shine
,
and
of
her
strange
,
transfigure


face
.
the
hand
of
the
Hidden
Almighty
,
burn
bright
,
have
thrust
out


of
the
darkness
and
grip

.
he
go
on
subject
and
in
fear
,
his


heart
grip
and
burn
from
the
touch
.




the
day
go
by
,
they
run
on
dark
-
padded
foot
in
silence
.
he
go
to


see
Anna
,
but
again
there
have
come
a
reserve
between
they
.
Tom
Brangwen


be
gloomy
,
his
blue
eye
sombre
.
Anna
be
strange
and
deliver
up
.


her
face
in
its
delicate
colouring
be
mute
,
touch
dumb
and
poignant
.


the
mother
bow
her
head
and
move
in
her
own
dark
world
,
that
be


pregnant
again
with
fulfilment
.




will
Brangwen
work
at
his
wood
-
carving
.
it
be
a
passion
,
a
passion


for
he
to
have
the
chisel
under
his
grip
.
verily
the
passion
of
his


heart
lift
the
fine
bite
of
steel
.
he
be
carve
,
as
he
have
always


want
,
the
Creation
of
Eve
.
it
be
a
panel
in
low
relief
,
for
a


church
.
Adam
lie
asleep
as
if
suffer
,
and
God
,
a
dim
,
large
figure
,


stoop
towards
he
,
stretch
forward
his
unveiled
hand
;
and
Eve
,
a


small
vivid
,
naked
female
shape
,
be
issue
like
a
flame
towards
the


hand
of
God
,
from
the
torn
side
of
Adam
.




now
,
Will
Brangwen
be
work
at
the
Eve
.
she
be
thin
,
a
keen
,
unripe


thing
.
with
tremble
passion
,
fine
as
a
breath
of
air
,
he
send
the


chisel
over
her
belly
,
her
hard
,
unripe
,
small
belly
.
she
be
a
stiff


little
figure
,
with
sharp
line
,
in
the
throe
and
torture
and
ecstasy


of
her
creation
.
but
he
tremble
as
he
touch
she
.
he
have
not
finish


any
of
his
figure
.
there
be
a
bird
on
a
bough
overhead
,
lift
its


wing
for
flight
,
and
a
serpent
wreathe
up
to
it
.
it
be
not
finish


yet
.
he
tremble
with
passion
,
at
last
able
to
create
the
new
,
sharp


body
of
his
Eve
.




at
the
side
,
at
the
far
side
,
at
either
end
,
be
two
Angels
cover


their
face
with
their
wing
.
they
be
like
tree
.
as
he
go
to
the


Marsh
,
in
the
twilight
,
he
feel
that
the
Angels
,
with
cover
face
,


be
stand
back
as
he
go
by
.
the
darkness
be
of
their
shadow
and


the
covering
of
their
face
.
when
he
go
through
the
Canal
bridge
,
the


evening
glow
in
its
last
deep
colour
,
the
sky
be
dark
blue
,
the


star
glitter
from
afar
,
very
remote
and
approach
above
the


darken
cluster
of
the
farm
,
above
the
path
of
crystal
along
the


edge
of
the
heaven
.




she
wait
for
he
like
the
glow
of
light
,
and
as
if
his
face
be


cover
.
and
he
dare
not
lift
his
face
to
look
at
she
.




corn
harvest
come
on
.
one
evening
they
walk
out
through
the
farm


building
at
nightfall
.
a
large
gold
moon
hang
heavily
to
the
grey


horizon
,
tree
hover
tall
,
stand
back
in
the
dusk
,
wait
.
Anna


and
the
young
man
go
on
noiselessly
by
the
hedge
,
along
where
the


farm
-
cart
have
make
dark
rut
in
the
grass
.
they
come
through
a
gate


into
a
wide
open
field
where
still
much
light
seem
to
spread
against


their
face
.
in
the
under
-
shadow
the
sheaf
lie
on
the
ground
where


the
reaper
have
leave
they
,
many
sheaf
like
body
prostrate
in


shadowy
bulk
;
other
be
ride
hazily
in
shock
,
like
ship
in
the


haze
of
moonlight
and
of
dusk
,
far
off
.




they
do
not
want
to
turn
back
,
yet
whither
be
they
to
go
,
towards


the
moon
?
for
they
be
separate
,
single
.




"
we
will
put
up
some
sheaf
,
"
say
Anna
.
so
they
could
remain
there
in


the
broad
,
open
place
.




they
go
across
the
stubble
to
where
the
long
row
of
upreared
shock


end
.
curiously
populous
that
part
of
the
field
look
,
where
the


shock
ride
erect
;
the
rest
be
open
and
prostrate
.




the
air
be
all
hoary
silver
.
she
look
around
she
.
tree
stand


vaguely
at
their
distance
,
as
if
wait
like
herald
,
for
the
signal


to
approach
.
in
this
space
of
vague
crystal
her
heart
seem
like
a


bell
ringing
.
she
be
afraid
lest
the

in
the
morning
,

obscurely
through

one
be
sever
from

world
,
one
shut
oneself
off
in
tacit
denial
of


the

there
seem
no


space
between
the
hour
,
just
a
moment
,
golden
and
still
,
whilst
she


trace
his
feature
with
her
finger
-
tip
,
utterly
careless
and
happy
,


and
he
love
she
to
do
it
.




but
he

strange
and
unused
.
so
suddenly
,

shed
away
and

one
day

the
world
.
the
next
day
,
he
be
with
she
,
as
remote
from
the
world
as


if
the
two
of
they
be
bury
like
a
seed
in
darkness
.
suddenly
,
like


a
chestnut
fall
out
of
a
burr
,
he
be
shed
naked
and
glisten
on


to
a
soft
,
fecund
earth
,
leave
behind
he
the
hard
rind
of
worldly


knowledge
and
experience
.
he
hear
it
in
the
huckster
’s
cry
,
the


noise
of
cart
,
the
calling
of
child
.
and
it
be
all
like
the
hard
,


shed
rind
,
discard
.
inside
,
in
the
softness
and
stillness
of
the


room
,

the
naked
kernel
,
that
palpitate
in
silent
activity
,


absorb
in
reality

inside
the
room
be
a
great
steadiness
,
a
core
of
living
eternity
.
only


far
outside
,
at
the
rim
,
go
on
the
noise
and
the
destruction
.
here
at


the
centre
the
great
wheel
be
motionless
,
centre
upon
itself
.
here


be
a
poise
,
unflawed
stillness
that
be
beyond
time
,
because
it


remain
the
same
,
inexhaustible
,
unchanging
,
unexhausted
.




as
they
lie
close
together
,
complete
and
beyond
the
touch
of
time
or


change
,
it
be
as
if
they
be
at
the
very
centre
of
all
the
slow


wheel
of
space
and
the
rapid
agitation
of
life
,
deep
,
deep
inside


they
all
,
at
the
centre
where
there
be
utter
radiance
,
and
eternal


be
,
and
the
silence
absorb
in
praise
:
the
steady
core
of
all


movement
,
the
unawakened
sleep
of
all
wakefulness
.
they
find


themselves
there
,
and
they
lie
still
,
in
each
other
’s
arm
;
for
their


moment
they
be
at
the
heart
of
eternity
,
whilst
time
roar
far
off
,


for
ever
far
off
,
towards
the
rim
.




then
gradually
they
be
pass
away
from
the
supreme
centre
,
down
the


circle
of
praise
and
joy
and
gladness
,
far
and
far
out
,


towards
the
noise
and
the
friction
.
but
their
heart
have
burn
and


be
temper
by
the
inner
reality
,
they
be
unalterably
glad
.




gradually
they
begin
to
wake
up
,
the
noise
outside
become
more
real
.


they
understand
and
answer
the
call
outside
.
they
count
the
stroke


of
the
bell
.
and
when
they
count
midday
,
they
understand
that
it
be


midday
,
in
the
world
,
and
for
themselves
also
.




it
dawn
upon
she
that
she
be
hungry
.
she
have
be
get
hungry


for
a
lifetime
.
but
even
yet
it
be
not
sufficiently
real
to
rouse
she
.


a
long
way
off
she
could
hear
the
word
,
"
I
be

of
hunger
.
"
yet


she
lie
still
,
separate
,
at
peace
,
and
the
word
be
unuttered
.
there


be
still
another
lapse
.




and
then
,
quite
calmly
,
even
a
little
surprised
,
she
be
in
the


present
,
and
be
say
:

he
say
calmly
,
as
if
it
be
of
not
the
slight


significance
.
and
they
relapse
into
the
warm
,
golden
stillness
.
and


the
minute
flow
unheeded
past
the
window
outside
.




then
suddenly
she
stir
against

it
be
a
slight
pain

"

he

and
she
sink
her
head
on
to

they
lie
still
,

.


half
consciously
,

the
hour

she
lie
with
she


face
on
he

they
be
faintly
astonish
that
they
do
not

minute
rustle
louder
at
the
window
.




"

to
the
fire
,

back
to
his
Creation

panel
again
,

would
finish
his
Eve
,


tender
and
sparkling
.
it
do
not
satisfy
he
yet
.
the
Lord
should


labour
over
she
in
a
silent
passion
of
Creation
,
and
Adam
should
be


tense
as
if
in
a
dream
of
immortality
,
and
Eve
should
take
form


glimmeringly
,
shadowily
,
as
if
the
Lord
must
wrestle
with
his
own
soul


for
she
,
yet
she
be
a
radiance
.




"
what
be

think
about
?
"
she
ask
.




he
find
it
difficult
to
say
.
his
soul
become
shy
when
he
try
to


communicate
it
.




"
I
be
think
my
Eve
be
too
hard
and
lively
.
"




"
why
?
"




"
I
do
n’t
know
.
she
should
be
more

make
a
gesture
of
infinite


tenderness
.




there
be
a
stillness
with
a
little
joy
.
he
could
not

.




her
father
come
,
and
find
they
both
very
glowing
,
like
an
open
flower
.


he
love
to
sit
with
they
.
where
there
be
a
perfume
of
love
,
anyone


who
come
must
breathe
it
.
they
be
both
very
quick
and
alive
,
light
up


from
the
other
-
world
,
so
that
it
be
quite
an
experience
for
they
,
that


anyone
else
could
exist
.




but
still
it
trouble
will
Brangwen
a
little
,
in
his
orderly
,


conventional
mind
,
that
the
establish
rule
of
thing
have
go
so


utterly
.
one
ought
to
get
up
in
the
morning
and
wash
oneself
and
be
a


decent
social
being
.
instead
,
the
two
of
they
stay
in
bed
till


nightfall
,
and
then
get
up
,
she
never
wash
her
face
,
but
sit
there


talk
to
her
father
as
bright
and
shameless
as
a
daisy
open
out
of


the
dew
.
or
she
get
up
at
ten
o’clock
,
and
quite
blithely
go
to
bed


again
at
three
,
or
at
half
-
past
four
,
strip
he
naked
in
the


daylight
,
and
all
so
gladly
and
perfectly
,
oblivious
quite
of
his


qualm
.
he
let
she
do
as
she
like
with
he
,
and
shine
with
strange


pleasure
.

be
to
dispose
of
he
as
she
would
.
he
be
translate


with
gladness
to
be
in
her
hand
.
and
down
go
his
qualm
,
his
maxim
,


his
rule
,
his
small
belief
,
she
scatter
they
like
an
expert


skittle
-
player
.
he
be
very
much
astonish
and
delight
to
see
they


scatter
.




he
stand
and
gaze
and
grin
with
wonder
whilst
his
Tablets
of
Stone


go
bound
and
bump
and
splinter
down
the
hill
,
dislodge
for


ever
.
indeed
,
it
be
true
as
they
say
,
that
a
man
be

,
the


discard
rind
;
people
scurry
about
,
work
go
on
,
all
on
the


discard
surface
.
an
earthquake
have
burst
it
all
from
inside
.
it
be


as
if
the
surface
of
the
world
have
be
break
away
entire
:
Ilkeston
,


street
,
church
,
people
,
work
,
rule
-
of
-
the
-
day
,
all
intact
;
and
yet


peel
away
into
unreality
,
leave
here
expose
the
inside
,
the


reality
:
one
’s
own
being
,
strange
feeling
and
passion
and
yearning


and
belief
and
aspiration
,
suddenly
become
present
,
reveal
,
the


permanent
bedrock
,
knit
one
rock
with
the
woman
one
love
.
it
be


confound
.
thing
be
not
what
they
seem
!
when
he
be
a
child
,
he
have


think
a
woman
be
a
woman
merely
by
virtue
of
her
skirt
and


petticoat
.
and
now
,
lo
,
the
whole
world
could
be
divest
of
its


garment
,
the
garment
could
lie
there
shed
away
intact
,
and
one
could


stand
in
a
new
world
,
a
new
earth
,
naked
in
a
new
,
naked
universe
.
it


be
too
astounding
and
miraculous
.




this
then
be
marriage
!
the
old
thing
do
n’t
matter
any
more
.

up
at
four
o’clock
,
and
have
broth
at
tea

time
and
make
toffee
in
the


middle
of
the
night
.

.
he
still
be
not
quite
sure
it
be
not
criminal
.
but
it


be
a
discovery
to
find
one
might
be
so
supremely
absolve
.
all
that


matter

so


newly
come
into
:
like
the
youth
in
the
fairy
tale
,
who
be
king
for
one


day
in
the
year
,
and
for
the
rest

beat
herd
:
like
Cinderella

one
reality
,
for
all
that

she
carelessly
take
off
her
crown
to
be
an


artificial
figure

other
artificial
woman
to
tea

when
she
might


have

perfect
with
he
,
and
keep
he
perfect
,
in
the
land
of


intimate
connection
?
now
he
must
be
depose
,
his
joy
must
be
destroy
,


he
must
put
on
the
vulgar
,

death
of
an
outward
existence
.




he
grind
his
soul
in
uneasiness
and
fear

the

almost
tenderly
.




in
the
kitchen

only
the

with
dread
lest

he

in
shrink
dread
,

flash
with
certainty
that

alone
.




but
he
see
she
on
the
bed
,
lie
very
still
and
scarcely
noticeable
,


with

put
his

,
in
a
great
fear

still

a
curl
up
,
oblivious
creature
.
his


heart
beat
with
strange
throe
of
pain
.
then
,
by
a
motion
under
his

with


anguish
of
thankfulness
,

be
mad
with
gratefulness
,
he

there
could

only


acquiescence

submission
,
and
tremulous
wonder
of
consummation
.




the
next
morning
,
when
they
wake
up
,
it
have
snow
.
he
wonder
what


be
the
strange
pallor
in
the
air
,
and
the
unusual
tang
.
Snow
be
on


the
grass
and
the
window
-
sill
,
it
weigh
down
the
black
,
rag


branch
of
the
yews
,
and
smooth
the
grave
in
the
churchyard
.




soon
,
it
begin
to
snow
again
,
and
they
be
shut
in
.
he
be
glad
,
for


then
they
be
immune
in
a
shadowy
silence
,
there
be
no
world
,
no


time
.




the
snow
last
for
some
day
.
on
the
Sunday
they
go
to
church
.
they


make
a
line
of
footprint
across
the
garden
,
he
leave
a
flat
snowprint


of
his
hand
on
the
wall
as
he
vault
over
,
they
trace
the
snow
across


the
churchyard
.
for
three
day
they
have
be
immune
in
a
perfect
love
.




there
be
very
few
people
in
church
,
and
she
be
glad
.
she
do
not


care
much
for
church
.
she
have
never
question
any
belief
,
and
she


be
,
from
habit
and
custom
,
a
regular
attendant
at
morning
service
.
but


she
have
cease
to
come
with
any
anticipation
.
to
-
day
,
however
,
in
the


strangeness
of
snow
,
after
such
consummation
of
love
,
she
feel


expectant
again
,
and
delight
.
she
be
still
in
the
eternal
world
.




she
use
,
after
she
go
to
the
High
School
,
and
want
to
be
a
lady
,


want
to
fulfil
some
mysterious
ideal
,
always
to
listen
to
the
sermon


and
to
try
to
gather
suggestion
.
that
be
all
very
well
for
a
while
.


the
vicar
tell
she
to
be
good
in
this
way
and
in
that
.
she
go
away


feel
it
be
her
high
aim
to
fulfil
these
injunction
.




but
quickly
this
palled
.
after
a
short
time
,
she
be
not
very
much


interested
in
be
good
.
her
soul
be
in
quest
of
something
,
which
be


not
just
be
good
,
and
do
one
’s
good
.
no
,
she
want
something


else
:
something
that
be
not
her
ready
-
make
duty
.
everything
seem
to


be
merely
a
matter
of
social
duty
,
and
never
of
her
self
.
they
talk


about
her
soul
,
but
somehow
never
manage
to
rouse
or
to
implicate
she


soul
.
as
yet
her
soul
be
not
bring
in
at
all
.




so
that
whilst
she
have
an
affection
for
Mr.
Loverseed
,
the
vicar
,
and
a


protective
sort
of
feeling
for
Cossethay
church
,
want
always
to
help


it
and
defend
it
,
it
count
very
small
in
her
life
.




not
but
that
she
be
conscious
of
some
unsatisfaction
.
when
her
husband


be
rouse
by
the
thought
of
the
church
,
then
she
become
hostile
to


the
ostensible
church
,
she
hate
it
for
not
fulfil
anything
in
she
.


the
Church
tell
she
to
be
good
:
very
well
,
she
have
no
idea
of


contradict
what
it
say
.
the
Church
talk
about
her
soul
,
about
the


welfare
of
mankind
,
as
if
the
saving
of
her
soul
lie
in
her
perform


certain
act
conducive
to
the
welfare
of
mankind
.
well
and
good
—
it
be


so
,
then
.




nevertheless
,
as
she
sit
in
church
her
face
have
a
pathos
and
poignancy
.


be
this
what
she
have
come
to
hear
:
how
by
do
this
thing
and
by
not


do
that
,
she
could
save
her
soul
?
she
do
not
contradict
it
.
but
the


pathos
of
her
face
give
the
lie
.
there
be
something
else
she
want
to


hear
,
it
be
something
else
she
ask
for
from
the
Church
.




but
who
be
_
she
_
to
affirm
it
?
and
what
be
she
do
with
unsatisfied


desire
?
she
be
ashamed
.
she
ignore
they
and
leave
they
out
of
count


as
much
as
possible
,
her
underneath
yearning
.
they
anger
she
.
she


want
to
be
like
other
people
,
decently
satisfied
.




he
anger
she
more
than
ever
.
church
have
an
irresistible
attraction


for
he
.
and
he
pay
no
more
attention
to
that
part
of
the
service


which
be
Church
to
she
,
than
if
he
have
be
an
angel
or
a
fabulous


beast
sit
there
.
he
simply
pay
no
heed
to
the
sermon
or
to
the


meaning
of
the
service
.
there
be
something
thick
,
dark
,
dense
,


powerful
about
he
that
irritate
she
too
deeply
for
she
to
speak
of


it
.
the
Church
teaching
in
itself
mean
nothing
to
he
.
"
and
forgive
we


our
trespass
as
we
forgive
they
that
trespass
against
us”—it
simply


do
not
touch
he
.
it
might
have
be
more
sound
,
and
it
would
have


act
upon
he
in
the
same
way
.
he
do
not
want
thing
to
be


intelligible
.
and
he
do
not
care
about
his
trespass
,
neither
about


the
trespass
of
his
neighbour
,
when
he
be
in
church
.
leave
that
care


for
weekday
.
when
he

want
a
dark
,


nameless
emotion
,
the
emotion
of
all
the
great
mystery
of
passion

he

beyond
measure
.
she
could
not
get
out
of
the
Church


the
satisfaction
he
get
.
the
thought
of

soul
be
intimately
mixed


up
with
the
thought
of
her
own
self

indeed
,
her
soul
and
her
own
self


be
one
and
the
same
in
she
.
whereas
he
seem
simply
to
ignore
the


fact
of
his
own
self
,
almost
to
refute
it
.
he
have
a
soul
—
a
dark
,


inhuman
thing
care
nothing
for
humanity
.
so
she
conceive
it
.
and
in


the
gloom
and
the
mystery
of
the
Church
his
soul
live
and
run
free
,


like
some
strange
,
underground
thing
,
abstract
.




he
be
very
strange
to
she
,
and
,
in
this
church
spirit
,
in
conceive


himself
as
a
soul
,
he
seem
to
escape
and
run
free
of
she
.
in
a
way
,


she
envy
it
he
,
this
dark
freedom
and
jubilation
of
the
soul
,
some


strange
entity
in
he
.
it
fascinate
she
.
again
she
hate
it
.
and


again
,
she
despise
he
,
want
to
destroy
it
in
he
.




this
snowy
morning
,
he
sit
with
a
dark
-
bright
face
beside
she
,
not


aware
of
she
,
and
somehow
,
she
feel
he
be
convey
to
strange
,
secret


place
the
love
that
spring
in
he
for
she
.
he
sit
with
a
dark
-
rapt
,


half
-
delighted
face
,
look
at
a
little
stained
window
.
she
see
the


ruby
-
colour
glass
,
with
the
shadow
heap
along
the
bottom
from
the


snow
outside
,
and
the
familiar
yellow
figure
of
the
lamb
hold
the


banner
,
a
little
darken
now
,
but
in
the
murky
interior
strangely


luminous
,
pregnant
.




she
have
always
like
the
little
red
and
yellow
window
.
the
lamb
,


look
very
silly
and
self
-
conscious
,
be
hold
up
a
forepaw
,
in
the


cleft
of
which
be
dangerously
perch
a
little
flag
with
a
red
cross
.


very
pale
yellow
,
the
lamb
,
with
greenish
shadow
.
since
she
be
a


child
she
have
like
this
creature
,
with
the
same
feeling
she
feel
for


the
little
woolly
lamb
on
green
leg
that
child
carry
home
from


the
fair
every
year
.
she
have
always
like
these
toy
,
and
she
have
the


same
amused
,
childish
liking
for
this
church
lamb
.
yet
she
have
always


be
uneasy
about
it
.
she
be
never
sure
that
this
lamb
with
a
flag
do


not
want
to
be
more
than
it
appear
.
so
she
half
mistrust
it
,
there


be
a
mixture
of
dislike
in
her
attitude
to
it
.




now
,
by
a
curious
gathering
,
knitting
of
his
eye
,
the
faint
tension


of
ecstasy
on
his
face
,
he
give
she
the
uncomfortable
feeling
that
he


be
in
correspondence
with
the
creature
,
the
lamb
in
the
window
.
a
cold


wonder
come
over
she
—
her
soul
be
perplex
.
there
he
sit
,
motionless
,


timeless
,
with
the
faint
,
bright
tension
on
his
face
.
what
be
he


do
?
what
connection
be
there
between
he
and
the
lamb
in
the
glass
?




suddenly
it
gleam
to
she
dominant
,
this
lamb
with
the
flag
.
suddenly


she
have
a
powerful
mystic
experience
,
the
power
of
the
tradition
seize


on
she
,
she
be
transport
to
another
world
.
and
she
hate
it
,


resist
it
.




instantly
,
it
be
only
a
silly
lamb
in
the
glass
again
.
and
dark
,


violent
hatred
of
her
husband
sweep
up
in
she
.
what
be
he
do
,


sit
there
gleam
,
carry
away
,
soulful
?




she
shift
sharply
,
she
knock
he
as
she
pretend
to
pick
up
she


glove
,
she
grope
among
his
foot
.




he
come
to
,
rather
bewildered
,
expose
.
anybody
but
she
would
have


pity
he
.
she
want
to
rend
he
.
he
do
not
know
what
be
amiss
,


what
he
have
be
do
.




as
they
sit
at
dinner
,
in
their
cottage
,
he
be
daze
by
the
chill
of


antagonism
from
she
.
she
do
not
know
why
she
be
so
angry
.
but
she
be


incense
.




"
why
do
you
never
listen
to
the
sermon
?
"
she
ask
,
seethe
with


hostility
and
violation
.




"

.




"

"




he
retire
into
himself
,
to
enjoy
his
own
sensation
.
there
be


something
subterranean
about
he
,
as
if
he
have
an
underworld
refuge
.


the
young
girl
hate
to
be
in
the
house
with
he
when
he
be
like
this
.




after
dinner
,
he
retire
into
the
parlour
,
continue
in
the
same
state


of
abstraction
,
which
be
a
burden
intolerable
to
she
.
then
he
go
to


the
book

shelf
and
take
down
book
to
look
at
,

scarcely


glance
over
.




he
sat

over
a
book
on
the
illumination
in
old
missal
,
and


then

for
a

the
lamb

the
mystic


picture
of
the
Eucharist

a
violent

like
anger

walk
through


the

bitter
recurrence

more
easy

break
a
little
of


something
in

at
length
he
be
glad
to
forfeit
from
his
soul


all
his
symbol
,
to
have
she
make
love
to
he

he
love
it

put
her
head
on
his
knee

he
have
not
ask
she
to

want
she
to
,


he
love

than
to
hang
out
the


wash
in
a
high
wind
that
come
full
-
butt
over
the
round
of
the
hill
,

solitary
day
.




then
he
come
home
at
night
,
and
she
knit
her
brow
because
of
some


endless
contest
between

doorway

itself
.
the
laughter
and
z
of
the
day


disappear
from
she
.
she
be
stiffen
.




they
fight
an
unknown
battle
,
unconsciously
.
still
they
be
in
love


with
each
other
,
the
passion
be
there
.
but
the
passion

a
battle

clothe
and
be


awful
,
with
new
,
primal
nakedness
.




Sunday
come
when
the
strange
spell
be
cast
over
she
by
he
.
half

the
week
-
day
,
there
be


a
glint
of
sky
and
field
,
the
little
church
seem
to
babble
away
to


the
cottage
the
morning
through
.
but
on
Sundays
,
when
he
stay
at


home
,
a
deeply
-
coloured
,
intense
gloom
seem
to
gather
on
the
face
of


the
earth
,
the
church
seem
to
fill
itself
with
shadow
,
to
become
big
,


a
universe
to
she
,
there
be
a
burning
of
blue
and
ruby
,
a
sound
of


worship
about
she
.
and
when
the
door
be
open
,
and
she
come
out


into
the
world
,
it
be
a
world
new
-
create
,
she
step
into
the


resurrection
of
the
world
,
her
heart
beat
to
the
memory
of
the


darkness
and
the
Passion
.




if
,
as
very
often
,
they
go
to
the
Marsh
for
tea
on
Sundays
,
then
she


regain
another
,
light
world
,
that
have
never
know
the
gloom
and
the


stained
glass
and
the
ecstasy
of
chant
.
her
husband
be
obliterate
,


she
be
with
her
father
again
,
who
be
so
fresh
and
free
and
all


daylight
.
her
husband
,
with
his
intensity
and
his
darkness
,
be


obliterate
.
she
leave
he
,
she
forget
he
,
she
accept
her
father
.




yet
,
as
she
go
home
again
with
the
young
man
,
she
put
her
hand
on
his


arm
tentatively
,
a
little
bit
ashamed
,
her
hand
plead
that
he
would


not
hold
it
against
she
,
her
recusancy
.
but
he
be
obscure
.
he
seem


to
become
blind
,
as
if
he
be
not
there
with
she
.




then
she
be
afraid
.
she
want
he
.
when
he
be
oblivious
of
she
,
she


almost
go
mad
with
fear
.
for
she
have
become
so
vulnerable
,
so


expose
.
she
be
in
touch
so
intimately
.
all
thing
about
she
have


become
intimate
,
she
have
know
they
near
and
lovely
,
like
presence


hover
upon
she
.
what
if
they
should
all
go
hard
and
separate
again
,


stand
back
from
her
terrible
and
distinct
,
and
she
,
having
know


they
,
should
be
at
their
mercy
?




this
frighten
she
.
always
,
her
husband
be
to
she
the
unknown
to


which
she
be
deliver
up
.
she
be
a
flower
that
have
be
tempt


forth
into
blossom
,
and
have
no
retreat
.
he
have
her
nakedness
in
his


power
.
and
who
be
he
,
what
be
he
?
a
blind
thing
,
a
dark
force
,


without
knowledge
.
she
want
to
preserve
herself
.




then
she
gather
he
to
herself
again
and
be
satisfied
for
a
moment
.


but
as
time
go
on
,
she
begin
to
realize
more
and
more
that
he
do
not


alter
,
that
he
be
something
dark
,
alien
to
herself
.
she
have
think


he
just
the
bright
reflex
of
herself
.
as
the
week
and
month
go
by


she
realize
that
he
be
a
dark
opposite
to
she
,
that
they
be


opposite
,
not
complement
.




he
do
not
alter
,
he
remain
separately
himself
,
and
he
seem
to


expect
she
to
be
part
of
himself
,
the
extension
of
his
will
.
she
feel


he
try
to
gain
power
over
she
,
without
know
she
.
what
do
he


want
?
be
he
go
to
bully
she
?




what
do
she
want
herself
?
she
answer
herself
,
that
she
want
to
be


happy
,
to
be
natural
,
like
the
sunlight
and
the
busy
daytime
.
and
,
at


the
bottom
of
her
soul
,
she
feel
he
want
she
to
be
dark
,
unnatural
.


sometimes
,
when
he
seem
like
the
darkness
cover
and
smother


she
,
she
revolt
almost
in
horror
,
and
strike
at
he
.
she
strike
at


he
,
and
make
he
bleed
,
and
he
become
wicked
.
because
she
dread
he


and
hold
he
in
horror
,
he
become
wicked
,
he
want
to
destroy
.
and


then
the
fight
between
they
be
cruel
.




she
begin
to
tremble
.
he
want
to
impose
himself
on
she
.
and
he
begin


to
shudder
.
she
want
to
desert
he
,
to
leave
he
a
prey
to
the
open
,


with
the
unclean
dog
of
the
darkness
set
on
to
devour
he
.
he
must


beat
she
,
and
make
she
stay
with
he
.
whereas
she
fight
to
keep


herself
free
of
he
.




they
go
their
way
now
shadow
and
stain
with
blood
,
feel
the


world
far
off
,
unable
to
give
help
.
till
she
begin
to
get
tired
.
after


a
certain
point
,
she
become
impassive
,
detach
utterly
from
he
.
he


be
always
ready
to
burst
out
murderously
against
she
.
her
soul
get
up


and
leave
he
,
she
go
her
way
.
nevertheless
in
her
apparent


blitheness
,
that
make
his
soul
black
with
opposition
,
she
tremble
as


if
she
bleed
.




and
ever
and
again
,
the
pure
love
come
in
sunbeam
between
they
,
when


she
be
like
a
flower
in
the
sun
to
he
,
so
beautiful
,
so
shining
,
so


intensely
dear
that
he
could
scarcely
bear
it
.
then
as
if
his
soul
have


six
wing
of
bliss
he
stand
absorb
in
praise
,
feel
the
radiance


from
the
Almighty
beat
through
he
like
a
pulse
,
as
he
stand
in
the


upright
flame
of
praise
,
transmit
the
pulse
of
Creation
.




and
ever
and
again
he
appear
to
she
as
the
dread
flame
of
power
.


sometimes
,
when
he
stand
in
the
doorway
,
his
face
light
up
,
he
seem


like
an
Annunciation
to
she
,
her
heart
beat
fast
.
and
she
watch
he
,


suspend
.
he
have
a
dark
,
burn
be
that
she
dread
and
resist
.


she
be
subject
to
he
as
to
the
Angel
of
the
Presence
.
she
wait
upon


he
and
hear
his
will
,
and
she
tremble
in
his
service
.




then
all
this
pass
away
.
then
he
love
she
for
her
childishness
and


for
her
strangeness
to
he
,
for
the
wonder
of
her
soul
which
be


different
from
his
soul
,
and
which
make
he
genuine
when
he
would
be


false
.
and
she
love
he
for
the
way
he
sit
loosely
in
a
chair
,
or
for


the
way
he
come
through
a
door
with
his
face
open
and
eager
.
she
love


his
ringing
,
eager
voice
,
and
the
touch
of
the
unknown
about
he
,
his


absolute
simplicity
.




yet
neither
of
they
be
quite
satisfied
.
he
feel
,
somewhere
,
that
she


do
not
respect
he
.
she
only
respect
he
as
far
as
he
be
relate
to


herself
.
for
what
he
be
,
beyond
she
,
she
have
no
care
.
she
do
not
care


for
what
he
represent
in
himself
.
it
be
true
,
he
do
not
know
himself


what
he
represent
.
but
whatever
it
be
she
do
not
really
honour
it
.


she
do
no
service
to
his
work
as
a
lace
-
designer
,
nor
to
himself
as


bread
-
winner
.
because
he
go
down
to
the
office
and
work
every


day
—
that
entitle
he
to
no
respect
or
regard
from
she
,
he
know
.
rather


she
despise
he
for
it
.
and
he
almost
love
she
for
this
,
though
at


first
it
madden
he
like
an
insult
.




what
be
much
deep
,
she
soon
come
to
combat
his
deep
feeling
.


what
he
think
about
life
and
about
society
and
mankind
do
not
matter


very
much
to
she
:
he
be
right
enough
to
be
insignificant
.
this
be


again
gall
to
he
.
she
would
judge
beyond
he
on
these
thing
.
but


at
length
he
come
to
accept
her
judgment
,
discover
they
as
if
they


be
his
own
.
it
be
not
here
the
deep
trouble
lie
.
the
deep
root
of


his
enmity
lie
in
the
fact
that
she
jeer
at
his
soul
.
he
be


inarticulate
and
stupid
in
thought
.
but
to
some
thing
he
cling


passionately
.
he
love
the
Church
.
if
she
try
to
get
out
of
he
,
what


he
_
believe
_
,
then
they
be
both
soon
in
a
white
rage
.




do
he
believe
the
water
turn
to
wine
at
Cana
?
she
would
drive
he
to


the
thing
as
a
historical
fact
:
so
much
rain
-
water
—
look
at
it
—
can
it


become
grape
-
juice
,
wine
?
for
an
instant
,
he
see
with
the
clear
eye
of


the
mind
and
say
no
,
his
clear
mind
,
answer
she
for
a
moment
,


reject
the
idea
.
and
immediately
his
whole
soul
be
cry
in
a
mad
,


inchoate
hatred
against
this
violation
of
himself
.

be
true
for
he
.


his
mind
be

at
once
,
his

the
scene
,
the
wedding
,
the
water
bring
forward


from
the
firkin
as

:
and
Christ
say
to
his
mother
:

white
,
blear
,
the
night

uneasy
.


suddenly
the
moon
would
appear
at
a
clear
window
in
the
sky
,
look


down
from
far
above
,
like
a
captive
.
and
Anna

not
sleep
.
there
be


a
strange
,
dark
tension
about
her

aware
that
he
be
try

and


tense
.
and
her
soul
sigh
in
weariness
.




everything
be
so
vague
and
lovely
,
and
he
want
to
wake
she
up
to
the


hard
,
hostile
reality
.
she
draw
back
in
resistance
.
still
he
say


nothing
.
but
she
feel
his
power
persist
on
she
,
till
she
become


aware
of
the
strain
,
she
cry
out
against
the
exhaustion
.

force
she
,

.
and
she
want
so
much
the
joy
and
the


vagueness
and
the
innocence
of
her
pregnancy
.
she
do
not
want
his


bitter
-
corrosive
love
,
she
do
not
want
it
pour
into
she
,
to
burn


she
.

many
hour
by
the
window
,
in
those
day
when
he
drive
her
most


with
the
black
constraint
of
his
will
,
and
she
watch
the
rain
fall


on
the
yew
tree
.
she
be
not
sad
,
only
wistful
,
blanched
.

child


under
her
heart

a
perpetual
warmth
.
and
she

only
upon
she
from
the
outside
,

a
yearning
in

a
fulness
of
peace
and
blessedness
.


what

heavy
yearning

great
pain
to
she
.

the
trouble
,

pleasure
.
when

no
one
to

and
the
unsatisfied
soul
must
dance
and

,
then
one
dance


before
the
Unknown
.




suddenly

he
_
must
_
take
his


stand
on
she
,
he
must
depend
on
she
.




what
have
he
in
life
,
save
she
?
nothing
.
the
rest
be
a
great
heaving


flood
.
the
terror
of
the
night
of
heaving
,
overwhelm
flood
,
which


be
his
vision
of
life
without
she
,
be
too
much
for
he
.
he
cling
to


her
fiercely
and
abjectly
.




and
she
beat
he
off
,
she
beat
he
off
.
where
could
he
turn
,
like
a


swimmer
in
a
dark
sea
,
beat
off
from
his
hold
,
whither
could
he
turn
?


he
want
to
leave
she
,
he
want
to
be
able
to
leave
she
.
for
his


soul
’s
sake
,
for
his
manhood
’s
sake
,
he
must
be
able
to
leave
she
.




but
for
what
?
she
be
the
ark
,
and
the
rest
of
the
world
be
flood
.
the


only
tangible
,
secure
thing
be
the
woman
.
he
could
leave
she
only
for


another
woman
.
and
where
be
the
other
woman
,
and
who
be
the
other


woman
?
besides
,
he
would
be
just
in
the
same
state
.
another
woman
would


be
woman
,
the
case
would
be
the
same
.




why
be
she
the
all
,
the
everything
,
why
must
he
live
only
through
she
,


why
must
he
sink
if
he
be
detach
from
she
?
why
must
he
cleave
to


she
in
a
frenzy
as
for
his
very
life
?




the
only
other
way
to
leave
she
be
to
die
.
the
only
straight
way
to


leave
she
be
to
die
.
his
dark
,
rage
soul
know
that
.
but
he
have
no


desire
for
death
.




why
could
he
not
leave
she
?
why
could
he
not
throw
himself
into
the


hide
water
to
live
or
die
,
as
might
be
?
he
could
not
,
he
could
not
.


but
suppose
he
go
away
,
right
away
,
and
find
work
,
and
have
a


lodge
again
.
he
could
be
again
as
he
have
be
before
.




but
he
know
he
could
not
.
a
woman
,
he
must
have
a
woman
.
and
have
a


woman
,
he
must
be
free
of
she
.
it
would
be
the
same
position
.
for
he


could
not
be
free
of
she
.




for
how
can
a
man
stand
,
unless
he
have
something
sure
under
his
foot
.


can
a
man
tread
the
unstable
water
all
his
life
,
and
call
that


stand
?
well
give
in
and
drown
at
once
.




and
upon
what
could
he
stand
,
save
upon
a
woman
?
be
he
then
like
the


old
man
of
the
sea
,
impotent
to
move
save
upon
the
back
of
another


life
?
be
he
impotent
,
or
a
cripple
,
or
a
defective
,
or
a
fragment
?




it
be
black
,
mad
,
shameful
torture
,
the
frenzy
of
fear
,
the
frenzy
of


desire
,
and
the
horrible
,
grasp
back
-
wash
of
shame
.




what
be
he
afraid
of
?
why
do
life
,
without
Anna
,
seem
to
he
just
a


horrible
welter
,
everything
jostle
in
a
meaningless
,
dark
,
fathomless


flood
?
why
,
if
Anna
leave
he
even
for
a
week
,
do
he
seem
to
be


cling
like
a
madman
to
the
edge
of
reality
,
and
slip
surely
,


surely
into
the
flood
of
unreality
that
would
drown
he
.
this
horrible


slip
into
unreality
drive
he
mad
,
his
soul
scream
with
fear
and


agony
.




yet

he
off
from
she
,
push
he
away
,
break
his


finger
from
their
hold
on
she
,
persistently
,
ruthlessly
.
he
want
she


to
have
pity
.
and
sometimes
for
a
moment
she
have
pity
.
but
she
always


begin
again
,
thrust
he
off
,
into
the
deep
water
,
into
the
frenzy


and
agony
of
uncertainty
.




she
become
like
a
fury
to
he
,
without
any
sense
of
he
.
her
eye
be


bright
with
a
cold
,
unmove
hatred
.
then
his
heart
seem
to
die
in


its
last
fear
.
she
might
push
he
off
into
the
deep
.




she
would
not
sleep
with
he
any
more
.
she
say
he
destroy
her
sleep
.

all
his
frenzy
and
madness
of
fear
and

in
his
moment
of
intense
suffering
,
she
seem
to
he


inconceivable
,
a
monster
,
the
principle
of
cruelty
.




however
her
pity
might
give
way
for
moment
,
she
be
hard
and
cold
as
a


jewel
.
he
must
be
put
off
from
she
,
she
must
sleep
alone
.
she
make
he


a

unchanged
.
he

in
agony
of
suffering
,
throw
back
into
unreality
,


like
a
man
throw
overboard
into
a
sea
,
to
swim
till
he
sink
,
because


there
be
no

,
only
a
wide
,
welter
sea
.




he
do
not

for
the
white
sleep
when
a
thin
veil
be
draw


over
the
mind
.
it
be
not

awake
,
and
he

.
he


could
not

.
he
need
to
be
able

his

through
endless
space
,
into

the
morning
grey
and

she
be
.
he
could
be
alone
now
.
he
have


just
learn
what
it
be
to
be
able
to
be
alone
.
it
be
right
and


peaceful
.
she
have
give
he
a
new
,
deep
freedom
.
the
world
might
be
a


welter
of
uncertainty
,
but
he
be
himself
now
.
he
have
come
into
his
own


existence
.
he
be
bear
for
a
second
time
,
bear
at
last
unto
himself
,


out
of
the
vast
body
of
humanity
.
now
at
last
he
have
a
separate


identity
,
he
exist
alone
,
even
if
he
be
not
quite
alone
.
before
he


have
only
exist
in
so
far
as
he
have
relation
with
another
being
.
now


he
have
an
absolute
self
—
as
well
as
a
relative
self
.




but
it
be
a
very
dumb
,
weak
,
helpless
self
,
a
crawling
nursling
.
he


go
about
very
quiet
,
and
in
a
way
,
submissive
.
he
have
an
unalterable


self
at
last
,
free
,
separate
,
independent
.




she
be
relieve
,
she
be
free
of
he
.
she
have
give
he
to
himself
.


she
weep
sometimes
with
tiredness
and
helplessness
.
but
he
be
a


husband
.
and
she
seem
,
in
the
child
that
be
come
,
to
forget
.
it


seem
to
make
she
warm
and
drowsy
.
she
lapse
into
a
long
muse
,


indistinct
,
warm
,
vague
,
unwilling
to
be
take
out
of
her
vagueness
.


and
she
rest
on
he
also
.




sometimes
she
come
to
he
with
a
strange
light
in
her
eye
,
poignant
,


pathetic
,
as
if
she
be
ask
for
something
.
he
look
and
he
could


not
understand
.
she
be
so
beautiful
,
so
visionary
,
the
ray
seem
to


go
out
of
his
breast
to
she
,
like
a
shining
.
he
be
there
for
she
,
all


for
she
.
and
she
would
hold
his
breast
,
and
kiss
it
,
and
kiss
it
,


kneel
beside
he
,
she
who
be
wait
for
the
hour
of
her
delivery
.


and
he
would
lie
look
down
at
his
breast
,
till
it
seem
that
his


breast
be
not
himself
,
that
he
have
leave
it
lie
there
.
yet
it
be


himself
also
,
and
beautiful
and
bright
with
her
kiss
.
he
be
glad


with
a
strange
,
radiant
pain
.
whilst
she
kneel
beside
he
,
and
kiss


his
breast
with
a
slow
,
rapt
,
half
-
devotional
movement
.




he
know
she
want
something
,
his
heart
yearn
to
give
it
she
.
his


heart
yearn
over
she
.
and
as
she
lift
her
face
,
that
be
radiant


and
rosy
as
a
little
cloud
,
his
heart
still
yearn
over
she
,
and
,
now


from
the
distance
,
adore
she
.
she
have
a
flower
-
like
presence
which
he


adore
as
he
stand
far
off
,
a
stranger
.




the
week
pass
on
,
the
time
draw
near
,
they
be
very
gentle
,
and


delicately
happy
.
the
insistent
,
passionate
,
dark
soul
,
the
powerful


unsatisfaction
in
he
seem
still
and
tame
,
the
lion
lie
down
with


the
lamb
in
he
.




she
love
he
very
much
indeed
,
and
he
wait
near
she
.
she
be
a


precious
,
remote
thing
to
he
at
this
time
,
as
she
wait
for
she


child
.
her
soul
be
glad
with
an
ecstasy
because
of
the
come
infant
.


she
want
a
boy
:
oh
,
very
much
she
want
a
boy
.




but
she
seem
so
young
and
so
frail
.
she
be
indeed
only
a
girl
.
as


she
stand
by
the
fire
washing
herself
—
she
be
proud
to
wash
herself
at


this
time
—
and
he
look
at
she
,
his
heart
be
full
of
extreme


tenderness
for
she
.
such
fine
,
fine
limb
,
her
slim
,
round
arm
like


chasing
light
,
and
her
leg
so
simple
and
childish
,
yet
so
very
proud
.


oh
,
she
stand
on
proud
leg
,
with
a
lovely
reckless
balance
of
her
full


belly
,
and
the
adorable
little
roundness
,
and
the
breast
become


important
.
above
it
all
,
her
face
be
like
a
rosy
cloud
shine
.




how
proud
she
be
,
what
a
lovely
proud
thing
her
young
body
!
and
she


love
he
to
put
his
hand
on
her
ripe
fullness
,
so
that
he
should


thrill
also
with
the
stir
and
the
quickening
there
.
he
be
afraid
and


silent
,
but
she
fling
her
arm
round
his
neck
with
proud
,
impudent
joy
.




the
pain
come
on
,
and
oh
—
how
she
cry
!
she
would
have
he
stay
with


she
.
and
after
her
long
cry
she
would
look
at
he
,
with
tear
in
she


eye
and
a
sob
laugh
on
her
face
,
say
:




"
I
do
n’t
mind
it
really
.
"




it
be
bad
enough
.
but
to
she
it
be
never
deathly
.
even
the
fierce
,


tear
pain
be
exhilarate
.
she
scream
and
suffer
,
but
be
all


the
time
curiously
alive
and
vital
.
she
feel
so
powerfully
alive
and
in


the
hand
of
such
a
masterly
force
of
life
,
that
her
bottom
-
most


feeling
be
one
of
exhilaration
.
she
know
she
be
win
,
win
,
she


be
always
win
,
with
each
onset
of
pain
she
be
near
to
victory
.




probably
he
suffer
more
than
she
do
.
he
be
not
shock
or


horrify
.
but
he
be
screw
very
tight
in
the
vise
of
suffering
.




it
be
a
girl
.
the
second
of
silence
on
her
face
when
they
say
so


show
he
she
be
disappointed
.
and
a
great
blaze
passion
of


resentment
and
protest
spring
up
in
his
heart
.
in
that
moment
he


claim
the
child
.




but
when
the
milk
come
,
and
the
infant
suck
her
breast
,
she
seem
to


be
leap
with
extravagant
bliss
.




"
it
suck
I
,
it
suck
I
,
it
like
I
—
oh
,
it
love
it
!
"
she
cry
,


hold
the
child
to
her
breast
with
her
two
hand
cover
it
,


passionately
.




and
in
a
few
moment
,
as
she
become
used
to
her
bliss
,
she
look
at


the
youth
with
glow
,
unseee
eye
,
and
say
:




"
Anna
Victrix
.
"




he
go
away
,
tremble
,
and
sleep
.
to
she
,
her
pain
be
the


wound
-
smart
of
a
victor
,
she
be
the
prouder
.




when
she
be
well
again
she
be
very
happy
.
she
call
the
baby
Ursula
.


both
Anna
and
her
husband
feel
they
must
have
a
name
that
give
they


private
satisfaction
.
the
baby
be
tawny
skin
,
it
have
a
curious


downy
skin
,
and
wisp
of
bronze
hair
,
and
the
yellow
grey
eye
that


waver
,
and
then
become
golden
-
brown
like
the
father
’s
.
so
they
call


her
Ursula
because
of
the
picture
of
the
saint
.




it
be
a
rather
delicate
baby
at
first
,
but
soon
it
become
strong
,


and
be
restless
as
a
young
eel
.
Anna
be
wear
out
with
the
day
-
long


wrestle
with
its
young
vigour
.




as
a
little
animal
,
she
love
and
adore
it
and
be
happy
.
she
love


her
husband
,
she
kiss
his
eye
and
nose
and
mouth
,
and
make
much
of


he
,
she
say
his
limb
be
beautiful
,
she
be
fascinate
by
the


physical
form
of
he
.




and
she
be
indeed
Anna
Victrix
.
he
could
not
combat
she
any
more
.
he


be
out
in
the
wilderness
,
alone
with
she
.
have
occasion
to
go
to


London
,
he
marvel
,
as
he
return
,
thinking
of
naked
,
lurk


savage
on
an
island
,
how
these
have
build
up
and
create
the
great
mass


of
Oxford
Street
or
Piccadilly
.
how
have
helpless
savage
,
run
with


their
spear
on
the
riverside
,
after
fish
,
how
have
they
come
to
rear
up


this
great
London
,
the
ponderous
,
massive
,
ugly
superstructure
of
a


world
of
man
upon
a
world
of
nature
!
it
frighten
and
awe
he
.
Man


be
terrible
,
awful
in
his
work
.
the
work
of
man
be
more
terrible


than
man
himself
,
almost
monstrous
.




and
yet
,
for
his
own
part
,
for
his
private
being
,
Brangwen
feel
that


the
whole
of
the
man
’s
world
be
exterior
and
extraneous
to
his
own


real
life
with
Anna
.
sweep
away
the
whole
monstrous
superstructure
of


the
world
of
to
-
day
,
city
and
industry
and
civilization
,
leave
only


the
bare
earth
with
plant
grow
and
water
run
,
and
he
would
not


mind
,
so
long
as
he
be
whole
,
have
Anna
and
the
child
and
the
new
,


strange
certainty
in
his
soul
.
then
,
if
he
be
naked
,
he
would
find


clothing
somewhere
,
he
would
make
a
shelter
and
bring
food
to
his
wife
.




and
what
more
?
what
more
would
be
necessary
?
the
great
mass
of
activity


in
which
mankind
be
engage
mean
nothing
to
he
.
by
nature
,
he
have
no


part
in
it
.
what
do
he
live
for
,
then
?
for
Anna
only
,
and
for
the
sake


of
living
?
what
do
he
want
on
this
earth
?
Anna
only
,
and
his
child
,


and
his
life
with
his
child
and
she
?
be
there
no
more
?




he
be
attend
by
a
sense
of
something
more
,
something
far
,
which


give
he
absolute
being
.
it
be
as
if
now
he
exist
in
Eternity
,
let


time
be
what
it
might
.
what
be
there
outside
?
the
fabricated
world
,


that
he
do
not
believe
in
?
what
should
he
bring
to
she
,
from
outside
?


nothing
?
be
it
enough
,
as
it
be
?
he
be
trouble
in
his
acquiescence
.


she
be
not
with
he
.
yet
he
scarcely
believe
in
himself
,
apart
from


she
,
though
the
whole
Infinite
be
with
he
.
let
the
whole
world
slide


down
and
over
the
edge
of
oblivion
,
he
would
stand
alone
.
but
he
be


unsure
of
she
.
and
he
exist
also
in
she
.
so
he
be
unsure
.




he
hover
near
to
she
,
never
quite
able
to
forget
the
vague
,
haunt


uncertainty
,
that
seem
to
challenge
he
,
and
which
he
would
not
hear
.


a
pang
of
dread
,
almost
guilt
,
as
of
insufficiency
,
would
go
over
he


as
he
hear
she
talk
to
the
baby
.
she
stand
before
the
window
,
with


the
month
-
old
child
in
her
arm
,
talk
in
a
musical
,
young
sing
-
song


that
he
have
not
hear
before
,
and
which
ring
on
his
heart
like
a
claim


from
the
distance
,
or
the
voice
of
another
world
sound
its
claim
on


he
.
he
stand
near
,
listen
,
and
his
heart
surge
,
surge
to
rise
and


submit
.
then
it
shrink
back
and
stay
aloof
.
he
could
not
move
,
a


denial
be
upon
he
,
as
if
he
could
not
deny
himself
.

from

she
have
attain
,


what
could
she

?
a

,
a

off

on
the


journey
?
she
stand
so
safely
on
the
Pisgah
mountain
.




in
the
winter
,

with
the
sunrise
,

out

back


window

the
east

when
,
at
evening
,
the
sunset
come
in

glare
through
the

the
hope
,
the
promise
.
why
should
she
travel
any
far
?




yet
she
always
ask
the
question
.
as
the
sun
go
down
in
his
fiery


winter
haste
,
she

so
busy
about
,
that
you
will
not
let
we
alone

"




she
do
not
turn
to
her
husband
,
for
he
to
lead
she
.
he

apart
from


she
,

she
,

to
her
different
conception
of
he

she
might
hold
up
,

might
toss
the

roar
of
heat
,
as
the
three

have
keep
a
slight
connection
with
Anna
’s
mother
,


and
have
always
preserve
some
officious
interest
in
the
young
girl
,


because
she
be
a
pure
Pole
.




when

since
then
she

and
terrify
she
,
whilst

most


strangely

in
a
foreign
language
.




the
little
Baron

quite
approve
of
Anna
,
because
she

still
,
he
consider

old
,
heavy
russian


jewellery
,
the
least
valuable
of
his

then
he
lapse
out


of
the

life
again
,
though

"

a
curious
book

dedicate
:

little
,
creamy
-
skinned
,
insidious
thing
with
red
-
brown
hair
and
a
mouth


that
one
must
always
watch
,
because
it
curve
back
continually
in
an


incomprehensible
,
strange
laugh
that
expose
she
rather
prominent


tooth
.
she
be
not
beautiful
,
yet
Tom
Brangwen
be
immediately
under


her
spell
.
she
seem
to
snuggle
like
a
kitten
within
his
warmth
,

be
at
the
same
time
elusive
and
ironical
,

the


fine
steel
of
her
claws
.




the
Baron
be
almost
dotingly
courteous
and
attentive
to
she
.

almost
mockingly
,

quite
happy

.
curious
little
thing


she
be
,
she
have
the
soft
,
creamy
,
elusive
beauty
of
a
ferret
.
Tom


Brangwen
be
quite
at
a
loss
,
at
her
mercy
,
and

little


breathlessly
,
as

.
she
do
put
fine
torment
on


the
elderly

later

.
the
little
baron
be
now


quite
white
-
haired
,
very
brittle
.
he
be
wizene
and
wrinkle
,
yet


fiery
,
unsubdue
.
Anna
look
at
his
lean
body
,
at
his
small
,
fine
lean


leg
and
lean
hand
as
he
sat
talk
,
and
she
flush
.
she
recognize


the
quality
of
the
male
in
he
,
his
lean
,
concentrated
age
,
his


informed
fire
,
his
faculty
for
sharp
,
deliberate
response
.
he
be
so


detach
,
so
purely
objective
.
a
woman
be
thoroughly
outside
he
.


there
be
no
confusion
.
so
he
could
give
that
fine
,
deliberate


response
.




he
be
something
separate
and
interesting
;
his
hard
,
intrinsic
being
,


whittle
down
by
age
to
an
essentiality
and
a
directness
almost


death
-
like
,
cruel
,
be
yet
so
unswervingly
sure
in
its
action
,
so


distinct
in
its
surety
,
that
she
be
attract
to
he
.
she
watch
his


cool
,
hard
,
separate
fire
,
fascinate
by
it
.
would
she
rather
have
it


than
her
husband
’s
diffuse
heat
,
than
his
blind
,
hot
youth
?




she
seem
to
be
breathe
high
,
sharp
air
,
as
if
she
have
just
come
out


of
a
hot
room
.
these
strange
Skrebenskys
make
she
aware
of
another
,


free
element
,
in
which
each
person
be
detach
and
isolate
.
be
not


this
her
natural
element
?
be
not
the
close
Brangwen
life
stifle
she
?




meanwhile
the
little
baroness
,
with
always
a
subtle
light
stirring
of


her
full
,
lustrous
,
hazel
eye
,
be
play
with
Will
Brangwen
.
he
be


not
quick
enough
to
see
all
her
movement
.
yet
he
watch
she
steadily
,


with
unchanging
,
light
-
up
eye
.
she
be
a
strange
creature
to
he
.
but


she
have
no
power
over
he
.
she
flush
,
and
be
irritated
.
yet
she


glance
again
and
again
at
his
dark
,
living
face
,
curiously
,
as
if
she


despise
he
.
she
despise
his
uncritical
,
unironical
nature
,
it
have


nothing
for
she
.
yet
it
anger
she
as
if
she
be
jealous
.
he
watch


she
with
deferential
interest
as
he
would
watch
a
stoat
playing
.
but
he


himself
be
not
implicate
.
he
be
different
in
kind
.
she
be
all


lambent
,
bite
flame
,
he
be
a
red
fire
glow
steadily
.
she
could


get
nothing
out
of
he
.
so
she
make
he
flush
darkly
by
assume
a


biting
,
subtle
class
-
superiority
.
he
flush
,
but
still
he
do
not


object
.
he
be
too
different
.




her
little
boy
come
in
with
the
nurse
.
he
be
a
quick
,
slight
child
,


with
fine
perceptiveness
,
and
a
cool
transitoriness
in
his
interest
.
at


once
he
treat
Will
Brangwen
as
an
outsider
.
he
stay
by
Anna
for
a


moment
,
acknowledge
she
,
then
be
go
again
,
quick
,
observant
,


restless
,
with
a
glance
of
interest
at
everything
.




the
father
adore
he
,
and
speak
to
he
in
Polish
.
it
be
queer
,
the


stiff
,
aristocratic
manner
of
the
father
with
the
child
,
the
distance


in
the
relationship
,
the
classic
fatherhood
on
the
one
hand
,
the
filial


subordination
on
the
other
.
they
play
together
,
in
their
different


degree
very
separate
,
two
different
being
,
differ
as
it
be
in


rank
rather
than
in
relationship
.
and
the
baroness
smile
,
smile
,


smile
,
always
smile
,
show
she
rather
protrude
tooth
,
have


always
a
mysterious
attraction
and
charm
.




Anna
realize
how
different
her
own
life
might
have
be
,
how
different


her
own
living
.
her
soul
stir
,
she
become
as
another
person
.
she


intimacy
with
her
husband
pass
away
,
the
curious
envelop
Brangwen


intimacy
,
so
warm
,
so
close
,
so
stifle
,
when
one
seem
always
to
be


in
contact
with
the
other
person
,
like
a
blood
-
relation
,
be
annul
.


she
deny
it
,
this
close
relationship
with
her
young
husband
.
he
and


she
be
not
one
.
his
heat
be
not
always
to
suffuse
she
,
suffuse
she
,


through
her
mind
and
her
individuality
,
till
she
be
of
one
heat
with


he
,
till
she
have
not
her
own
self
apart
.
she
want
her
own
life
.
he


seem
to
lap
she
and
suffuse
she
with
his
being
,
his
hot
life
,
till


she
do
not
know
whether
she
be
herself
,
or
whether
she
be
another


creature
,
unite
with
he
in
a
world
of
close
blood
-
intimacy
that


close
over
she
and
exclude
she
from
all
the
cool
outside
.




she
want
her
own
,
old
,
sharp
self
,
detach
,
detach
,
active
but
not


absorb
,
active
for
her
own
part
,
take
and
give
,
but
never


absorb
.
whereas
he
want
this
strange
absorption
with
she
,
which


still
she
resist
.
but
she
be
partly
helpless
against
it
.
she
have


live
so
long
in
Tom
Brangwen
’s
love
,
beforehand
.




from
the
Skrebensky
’s
,
they
go
to
Will
Brangwen
’s
beloved
Lincoln


Cathedral
,
because
it
be
not
far
off
.
he
have
promise
she
,
that
one
by


one
,
they
should
visit
all
the
cathedral
of
England
.
they
begin
with


Lincoln

he
begin
to

near
to
set
off
.
what
be

she
be
almost
angry
,
come
as
she
do
from


the
Skrebensky
’s
.
but
now
he
run
on
alone
.
his
very
breast
seem
to


open
its
door
to
watch
for
the
great
church
brood
over
the
town
.


his
soul
run
ahead
.




when
he
see
the
cathedral
in
the
distance
,
dark
blue
lift
watchful
in


the
sky
,
his
heart
leap
.
it
be
the
sign
in

,
it
be
the
Spirit


hover
like
a

,
like
an
eagle
over

his
mouth
open
with
a
strange
,


ecstatic

excite
he


to
such
a
pitch
?
she

to
stir
herself
to
readiness
.




they

up
the
steep
hill
,

the
arch
.




she
too
be
overcome
,
but
silence
rather
than
tune
to
the
place
.
she


love
it
as
a
world
not
quite
her
own
,
she
resent
his
transport
and


ecstasy
.
his
passion
in
the
cathedral
at
first
awe
she
,
then
make


her
angry
.
after
all
,
there
be
the
sky
outside
,
and
in
here
,
in
this


mysterious
half
-
night
,
when
his
soul
leap
with
the
pillar
upwards
,
it


be
not
to
the
star
and
the
crystalline
dark
space
,
but
to
meet
and


clasp
with
the
answer
impulse
of
leap
stone
,
there
in
the
dusk


and
secrecy
of
the
roof
.
the
far
-
off
clinching
and
mating
of
the


arch
,
the
leap
and
thrust
of
the
stone
,
carry
a
great
roof


overhead
,
awed
and
silence
she
.




but
yet
—
yet
she
remember
that
the
open
sky
be
no
blue
vault
,
no
dark


dome
hang
with
many
twinkle
lamp
,
but
a
space
where
star
be


wheel
in
freedom
,
with
freedom
above
they
always
higher
.




the
cathedral
rouse
she
too
.
but
she
would
never
consent
to
the


knitting
of
all
the
leap
stone
in
a
great
roof
that
close
she
in
,


and
beyond
which
be
nothing
,
nothing
,
it
be
the
ultimate
confine
.
his


soul
would
have
like
it
to
be
so
:
here
,
here
be
all
,
complete
,


eternal
:
motion
,
meeting
,
ecstasy
,
and
no
illusion
of
time
,
of
night


and
day
pass
by
,
but
only
perfectly
proportion
space
and
movement


clinch
and
renew
,
and
passion
surge
its
way
into
great
wave
to


the
altar
,
recurrence
of
ecstasy
.




her
soul
too
be
carry
forward
to
the
altar
,
to
the
threshold
of


eternity
,
in
reverence
and
fear
and
joy
.
but
ever
she
hang
back
in
the


transit
,
mistrust
the
culmination
of
the
altar
.
she
be
not
to
be


fling
forward
on
the
lift
and
lift
of
passionate
flight
,
to
be
cast
at


last
upon
the
altar
step
as
upon
the
shore
of
the
unknown
.
there
be
a


great
joy
and
a
verity
in
it
.
but
even
in
the
daze
swoon
of
the


cathedral
,
she
claim
another
right
.
the
altar
be
barren
,
its
light


go
out
.
God
burn
no
more
in
that
bush
.
it
be
dead
matter
lie


there
.
she
claim
the
right
to
freedom
above
she
,
high
than
the


roof
.
she
have
always
a
sense
of
be
roof
in
.




so
that
she
catch
at
little
thing
,
which
save
she
from
be
sweep


forward
headlong
in
the
tide
of
passion
that
leap
on
into
the
Infinite


in
a
great
mass
,
triumphant
and
fling
its
own
course
.
she
want
to


get
out
of
this
fix
,
leap
,
forward
-
travel
movement
,
to
rise


from
it
as
a
bird
rise
with
wet
,
limp
foot
from
the
sea
,
to
lift


herself
as
a
bird
lift
its
breast
and
thrust
its
body
from
the
pulse


and
heave
of
a
sea
that
bear
it
forward
to
an
unwilling
conclusion
,


tear
herself
away
like
a
bird
on
wing
,
and
in
open
space
where
there


be
clarity
,
rise
up
above
the
fix
,
surcharge
motion
,
a
separate


speck
that
hang
suspend
,
move
this
way
and
that
,
see
and


answer
before
it
sink
again
,
having
choose
or
find
the
direction


in
which
it
shall
be
carry
forward
.




and
it
be
as
if
she
must
grasp
at
something
,
as
if
her
wing
be
too


weak
to
lift
her
straight
off
the
heaving
motion
.
so
she
catch
sight


of
the
wicked
,
odd
little
face
carve
in
stone
,
and

stand
before

these
sly
little
face
peep
out
of
the
grand
tide
of
the
cathedral

something
that

the
cathedral
be
not

he
would
be


stark
,
stark
,
without
one
place
wherein
to
stand
,
without
one
belief
in


which
to
rest
.




yet
somewhere
in
he
he
respond
more
deeply
to
the
sly
little
face


that
know
well
,
than
he
have
do
before
to
the
perfect
surge
of
his


cathedral
.




nevertheless
for
the
time
be
his
soul
be
wretched
and
homeless
,
and


he
could
not
bear
to
think
of
Anna
’s
oust
he
from
his
beloved


reality
.
he
want
his
cathedral
;
he
want
to
satisfy
his
blind


passion
.
and
he
could
not
any
more
.
something
intervene
.




they
go
home
again
,
both
of
they
alter
.
she
have
some
new
reverence


for
that
which
he
want
,
he
feel
that
his
cathedral
would
never
again


be
to
he
as
they
have
be
.
before
,
he
have
think
they
absolute
.
but


now
he
see
they
crouch
under
the
sky
,
with
still
the
dark
,


mysterious
world
of
reality
inside
,
but
as
a
world
within
a
world
,
a


sort
of
side
show
,
whereas
before
they
have
be
as
a
world
to
he


within
a
chaos
:
a
reality
,
an
order
,
an
absolute
,
within
a
meaningless


confusion
.




he
have
feel
,
before
,
that
could
he
but
go
through
the
great
door
and


look
down
the
gloom
towards
the
far
-
off
,
conclude
wonder
of
the


altar
,
that
then
,
with
the
window
suspend
around
like
tablet
of


jewel
,
emanate
their
own
glory
,
then
he
have
arrive
.
here
the


satisfaction
he
have
yearn
after
come
near
,
towards
this
,
the
porch
of


the
great
Unknown
,
all
reality
gather
,
and
there
,
the
altar
be
the


mystic
door
,
through
which
all
and
everything
must
move
on
to
eternity
.




but
now
,
somehow
,
sadly
and
disillusioned
,
he
realize
that
the
doorway


be
no
doorway
.
it
be
too
narrow
,
it
be
false
.
outside
the
cathedral


be
many
fly
spirit
that
could
never
be
sift
through
the


jewel
gloom
.
he
have
lose
his
absolute
.




he
listen
to
the
thrush
in
the
garden
and
hear
a
note
which
the


cathedral
do
not
include
:
something
free
and
careless
and
joyous
.
he


cross
a
field
that
be
all
yellow
with
dandelion
,
on
his
way
to


work
,
and
the
bath
of
yellow
glowing
be
something
at
once
so
sumptuous


and
so
fresh
,
that
he
be
glad
he
be
away
from
his
shadowy
cathedral
.




there
be
life
outside
the
Church
.
there
be
much
that
the
Church
do


not
include
.
he
think
of
God
,
and
of
the
whole
blue
rotunda
of
the


day
.
that
be
something
great
and
free
.
he
think
of
the
ruin
of
the


grecian
worship
,
and
it
seem
,
a
temple
be
never
perfectly
a
temple
,


till
it
be
ruin
and
mix
up
with
the
wind
and
the
sky
and
the


herb
.




still
he
love
the
Church
.
as
a
symbol
,
he
love
it
.
he
tend
it
for


what
it
try
to
represent
,
rather
than
for
that
which
it
do


represent
.
still
he
love
it
.
the
little
church
across
his
garden
-
wall


draw
he
,
he
give
it
love
attention
.
but
he
go
to
take
charge
of


it
,
to
preserve
it
.
it
be
as
an
old
,
sacred
thing
to
he
.
he
look


after
the
stone
and
woodwork
,
mend
the
organ
and
restore
a
piece


of
broken
carving
,
repair
the
church
furniture
.
later
,
he
become


choir
-
master
also
.




his
life
be
shift
its
centre
,
become
more
superficial
.
he
have


fail
to
become
really
articulate
,
fail
to
find
real
expression
.
he


have
to
continue
in
the
old
form
.
but
in
spirit
,
he
be
uncreated
.




Anna
be
absorb
in
the
child
now
,
she
leave
her
husband
to
take
his


own
way
.

wind
seem
to
sweep
out
of
existence
everything
that

.
she
could
feel
herself
,
everything

be
annihilate


by
he
.




at
first
she
fight
he
.
at
night
,
in
this
state
,
he
would
kneel
down


to
say
his
prayer
.
she
look
at
his

figure
.




"

.


"

"




he
still
remain
motionless
,
seethe
with
inchoate
rage
,
when
his


whole
nature
seem
to
disintegrate
.
he
seem
to
live
with
a
strain


upon
himself
,
and
occasionally
come
these
dark
,
chaotic
rage
,
the
lust


for
destruction
.
she
then
fight
with
he
,
and
their
fight
be


horrible
,
murderous
.
and
then
the
passion
between
they
come
just
as


black
and
awful
.




but
little
by
little
,
as
she
learn
to
love
he
well
,
she
would
put


herself
aside
,
and
when
she
feel
one
of
his
fit
upon
he
,
would
ignore


he
,
successfully
leave
he
in
his
world
,
whilst
she
remain
in
she


own
.
he
have
a
black
struggle
with
himself
,
to
come
back
to
she
.
for
at


last
he
learn
that
he
would
be
in
hell
until
he
come
back
to
she
.
so


he
struggle
to
submit
to
she
,
and
she
be
afraid
of
the
ugly
strain
in


his
eye
.
she
make
love
to
he
,
and
take
he
.
then
he
be
grateful
to


her
love
,
humble
.




he
make
himself

the
woodwork
,
and
his

,
all

he
.
if


only
there
be
not
some
limit
to
he
,
some
darkness
across
his
eye
!


he
have
to
give
in
to
it
at
last
himself
.
he
must
submit
to
his
own


inadequacy

quieter

unfold
whilst

to
stop
the
crying
.
but
something


arrest
his
hand
:
the
very
inhumanness
of
the
intolerable
,
continuous


cry
arrest
he
.
it
be
so
impersonal
,
without
cause
or
object
.
yet


he
echo
to
it
directly
,
his
soul
answer
its
madness
.
it
fill
he


with
terror
,
almost
with
frenzy
.




he
learn
to
acquiesce
to
this
,
to
submit
to
the
awful
,
obliterate


source
which
be
the
origin
of
his
living
tissue
.
he
be
not
what
he


conceive
himself
to
be
!
then
he
be
what
he
be
,
unknown
,
potent
,


dark
.




he
become
accustomed
to
the
child
,
he
know
how
to
lift
and
balance
the


little
body
.
the
baby
have
a
beautiful
,
rounded
head
that
move
he


passionately
.
he
would
have
fight
to
the
last
drop
to
defend
that


exquisite
,
perfect
round
head
.




he
learn
to
know
the
little
hand
and
foot
,
the
strange
,
unseeing
,


golden
-
brown
eye
,
the
mouth
that
open
only
to
cry
,
or
to
suck
,
or
to


show
a
queer
,
toothless
laugh
.
he
could
almost
understand
even
the


dangle
leg
,
which
at
first
have
create
in
he
a
feeling
of
aversion
.


they
could
kick
in
their
queer
little
way
,
they
have
their
own
softness
.




one
evening
,
suddenly
,
he
see
the
tiny
,
live
thing
roll
naked
in


the
mother
’s
lap
,
and
he
be
sick
,
it
be
so
utterly
helpless
and


vulnerable
and
extraneous
;
in
a
world
of
hard
surface
and
vary


altitude
,
it
lie
vulnerable
and
naked
at
every
point
.
yet
it
be
quite


blithe
.
and
yet
,
in
its
blind
,
awful
crying
,
be
there
not
the
blind
,


far
-
off
terror
of
its
own
vulnerable
nakedness
,
the
terror
of
be
so


utterly
deliver
over
,
helpless
at
every
point
.
he
could
not
bear
to


hear
it
cry
.
his
heart
strain
and
stand
on
guard
against
the
whole


universe
.




but
he
wait
for
the
dread
of
these
day
to
pass
;
he
see
the
joy


come
.
he
see
the
lovely
,
creamy
,
cool
little
ear
of
the
baby
,
a
bit


of
dark
hair
rub
to
a
bronze
floss
,
like
bronze
-
dust
.
and
he
wait
,


for
the
child
to
become
his
,
to
look
at
he
and
answer
he
.




it
have
a
separate
being
,
but
it
be
his
own
child
.
his
flesh
and
blood


vibrate
to
it
.
he
catch
the
baby
to
his
breast
with
his
passionate
,


clapping
laugh
.
and
the
infant
know

as

open
,
newly
-

at
he
,
he
want
they
to


perceive
he
,
to
recognize
he
.
then
he
be
verify
.
the
child
know


he
,
a
queer
contortion
of
laughter
come
on
its
face
for
he
.
he
catch


it
to
his
breast
,
clap
with
a
triumphant
laugh
.




the
golden
-
brown
eye
of
the
child
gradually
light
up
and
dilate
at
the


sight
of
the
dark
-
glow
face
of
the
youth
.
it
know
its
mother
well
,


it
want
its
mother
more
.
but
the
bright
,
sharp
little
ecstasy


be
for
the
father
.




it
begin
to
be
strong
,
to
move
vigorously
and
freely
,
to
make
sound


like
word
.
it
be
a
baby
girl
now
.
already
it
know
his
strong
hand
,


it
exult
in
his
strong
clasp
,
it
laugh
and
crow
when
he
play


with
it
.




and
his
heart
grow
red
-
hot
with
passionate
feeling
for
the
child
.
she


be
not
much
more
than
a
year
old
when
the
second
baby
be
bear
.
then


he
take
Ursula
for
his
own
.
she
his
first
little
girl
.
he
have
set
his


heart
on
she
.




the
second
have
dark
blue
eye
and
a
fair
skin
:
it
be
more
a
Brangwen
,


people
say
.
the
hair
be
fair
.
but
they
forget
Anna
’s
stiff
blonde


fleece
of
childhood
.
they
call
the
newcomer
Gudrun
.




this
time
,
Anna
be
strong
,
and
not
so
eager
.
she
do
not
mind
that


the
baby
be
not
a
boy
.
it
be
enough
that
she
have
milk
and
could


suckle
her
child
:
oh
,
oh
,
the
bliss
of
the
little
life
suck
the
milk


of
her
body
!
oh
,
oh
,
oh
the
bliss
,
as
the
infant
grow
strong
,
of
the


two
tiny
hand
clutch
,
catch
blindly
yet
passionately
at
she


breast
,
of
the
tiny
mouth
seek
she
in
blind
,
sure
,
vital
knowledge
,


of
the
sudden
consummate
peace
as
the
little
body
sink
,
the
mouth
and


throat
suck
,
suck
,
suck
,
drink
life
from
she
to
make
a
new


life
,
almost
sob
with
passionate
joy
of
receive
its
own


existence
,
the
tiny
hand
clutch
frantically
as
the
nipple
be
draw


back
,
not
to
be
gainsay
.
this
be
enough
for
Anna
.
she
seem
to
pass


off
into
a
kind
of
rapture
of
motherhood
,
her
rapture
of
motherhood
be


everything
.




so
that
the
father
have
the
eld
baby
,
the
wean
child
,
the


golden
-
brown
,
wonder
vivid
eye
of
the
little
Ursula
be
for
he
,


who
have
wait
behind
the
mother
till
the
need
be
for
he
.
the
mother


feel
a
sharp
stab
of
jealousy
.
but
she
be
still
more
absorb
in
the


tiny
baby
.
it
be
entirely
her
,
its
need
be
direct
upon
she
.




so
Ursula
become
the
child
of
her
father
’s
heart
.
she
be
the
little


blossom
,
he
be

sun
.
he
be
patient
,
energetic
,
inventive
for
she
.


he
teach
she
all
the
funny
little
thing
,
he
fill
she
and
rouse
she


to
her
full
tiny
measure
.
she
answer
he
with
her
extravagant


infant
’s
laughter
and
her
call
of
delight
.




now
there
be
two
baby
,
a
woman
come
in
to
do
the
housework
.
Anna


be
wholly
nurse
.
two

,
now
her

she
be
an
absorb
,
busy
child
,
always


amuse
herself
,
need
not
much
attention
from
other
people
.
at


evening
,
towards
six
o’clock
,
Anna
very
often
go
across
the
lane
to

,
lift
Ursula
over
into
the
field
,
with
a
:
"

.
"
then
Brangwen
,
come
up
the
steep
round
of
the
hill
,
would
see


before
he
on
the
brow
of
the
path
a
tiny
,
tottering
,
windblown
little


mite
with
a
dark
head
,
who
,
as
soon
as
she
see
he
,
would
come
run


in
tiny
,
wild
,
windmill
fashion
,
lift
her
arm
up
and
down
to
he
,


down
the
steep
hill
.
his
heart
leap
up
,
he
run
his
fast
to
she
,
to


catch
she
,
because
he
know
she
would
fall
.
she
came
flutter
on
,


wildly
,
with
her
little
limb
fly
.
and
he
be
glad
when
he
catch


she
up
in
his
arm
.
once
she
fall
as
she
came

,
he
see
she


pitch
forward
suddenly
as
she
be
run
with
her
hand
lift
to
he
;


and
when
he
pick
she
up
,
her
mouth
be
bleed
.
he
could
never
bear


to
think
of
it
,
he
always
want
to
cry
,
even
when
he
be
an
old
man


and
she
have
become
a
stranger
to

.
how
he
love
that
little


ursula!—his

have
be
sharply
sear
for
she
,
when
he
be
a
youth
,


first
married
.




when
she
be
a
little
old
,
he
would
see
she
recklessly
climb
over


the
bar
of
the
stile
,
in
her
red
pinafore
,
swinge
in
peril
and


tumble
over
,
pick
herself
up
and
flit
towards
he
.
sometimes


she
like
to
ride
on
his
shoulder
,
sometimes
she
prefer
to
walk
with


his
hand
,
sometimes
she
would
fling
her
arm
round
his
leg
for
a


moment
,
then
race
free
again
,
whilst
he
went
shout
and
call
to


she
,
a
child
along
with
she
.
he
be
still
only
a
tall
,

it
be
he
who
would
swing

he


that
he
compel
she
with
his
strength
and
decision
.
he
be


all
-
powerful
,
the
tower
of
strength
which
rise
out
of
her
sight
.




when
the
child
be
in
bed
,
sometimes
Anna
and
he
sit
and
talk
,


desultorily
,
both
of
they
idle
.
he
read
very
little
.
anything
he
be


draw
to
read
become
a
burn
reality
to
he
,
another
scene
outside


his
window
.
whereas
Anna
skim
through
a
book
to
see
what
happen
,


then
she
have
enough
.




therefore
they
would
often
sit
together
,
talk
desultorily
.
what
be


really
between
they
they
could
not
utter
.
their
word
be
only


accident
in
the
mutual
silence
.
when
they
talk
,
they
gossip
.
she


do
not
care
for
sew
.




she
have
a
beautiful
way
of
sit
musing
,
gratefully
,
as
if
her
heart


be
light
up
.
sometimes
she
would
turn
to
he
,
laugh
,
to
tell
he


some
little
thing
that
have
happen
during
the
day
.
then
he
would


laugh
,
they
would
talk
awhile
,
before
the
vital
,
physical
silence
be


between
they
again
.




she
be
thin
but
full
of
colour
and
life
.
she
be
perfectly
happy
to
do


just
nothing
,
only
to
sit
with
a
curious
,
languid
dignity
,
so
careless


as
to
be
almost
regal
,
so
utterly
indifferent
,
so
confident
.
the
bond


between
they
be
undefinable
,
but
very
strong
.
it
keep
everyone
else
at


a
distance
.




his
face
never
change
whilst
she
know
he
,
it
only
become
more


intense
.
it
be
ruddy
and
dark
in
its
abstraction
,
not
very
human
,
it


have
a
strong
,
intent
brightness
.
sometimes
,
when
his
eye
meet
hers
,
a


yellow
flash
from
they
cause
a
darkness
to
swoon
over
she


consciousness
,
electric
,
and
a
slight
strange
laugh
come
on
his
face
.


her
eye
would
turn
languidly
,
then
close
,
as
if
hypnotize
.
and
they


lapse
into
the
same
potent
darkness
.
he
have
the
quality
of
a
young


black
cat
,
intent
,
unnoticeable
,
and
yet
his
presence
gradually
make


itself
feel
,
stealthily
and
powerfully
take
hold
of
she
.
he
call
,
not


to
she
,
but
to
something
in
she
,
which
respond
subtly
,
out
of
she


unconscious
darkness
.




so
they
be
together
in
a
darkness
,
passionate
,
electric
,
for
ever


haunt
the
back
of
the
common
day
,
never
in
the
light
.
in
the
light
,


he
seem
to
sleep
,
unknowing
.
only
she
know
he
when
the
darkness
set


he
free
,
and
he
could
see
with
his
gold
-
glow
eye
his
intention
and


his
desire
in
the
dark
.
then
she
be
in
a
spell
,
then
she
answer
his


harsh
,
penetrate
call
with
a
soft
leap
of
her
soul
,
the
darkness
wake


up
,
electric
,
bristle
with
an
unknown
,
overwhelming
insinuation
.




by
now
they
know
each
other
;
she
be
the
daytime
,
the
daylight
,
he
be


the
shadow
,
put
aside
,
but
in
the
darkness
potent
with
an
overwhelming


voluptuousness
.




she
learn
not
to
dread
and
to
hate
he
,
but
to
fill
herself
with
he
,


to
give
herself
to
his
black
,
sensual
power
,
that
be
hide
all
the


daytime
.
and
the
curious
rolling
of
the
eye
,
as
if
she
be
lapse
in


a
trance
away
from
her
ordinary
consciousness
become
habitual
with
she
,


when
something
threaten
and
oppose
she
in
life
,
the
conscious
life
.




so
they
remain
as
separate
in
the
light
,
and
in
the
thick
darkness
,


married
.
he
support
her
daytime
authority
,
keep
it
inviolable
at


last
.
and
she
,
in
all
the
darkness
,
belong
to
he
,
to
his
close
,


insinuate
,
hypnotic
familiarity
.




all
his
daytime
activity
,
all
his
public
life
,
be
a
kind
of
sleep
.
she


want
to
be
free
,
to
belong
to
the
day
.
and
he
run
avoid
the
day
in


work
.
after
tea
,
he
go
to
the
shed
to
his
carpentry
or
his


woodcarve
.
he
be
restore
the
patched
,
degraded
pulpit
to
its


original
form
.




but
he
love
to
have
the
child
near
he
,
play
by
his
foot
.
she
be
a


piece
of
light
that
really
belong
to
he
,
that
play
within
his


darkness
.
he
leave
the
shed
door
on
the
latch
.
and
when
,
with
his
second


sense
of
another
presence
,
he
know
she
be
come
,
he
be
satisfied
,
he


be
at
rest
.
when
he
be
alone
with
she
,
he
do
not
want
to
take


notice
,
to
talk
.
he
want
to
live
unthinking
,
with
her
presence


flicker
upon
he
.




he
always
go
in
silence
.
the
child
would
push
open
the
shed
door
,
and


see
he
work
by
lamplight
,
his
sleeve
roll
back
.
his
clothe
hang


about
he
,
carelessly
,
like
mere
wrapping
.
inside
,
his
body
be


concentrate
with
a
flexible
,
charge
power
all
of
its
own
,
isolated
.


from
when
she
be
a
tiny
child
Ursula
could
remember
his
forearm
,
with


its
fine
black
hair
and
its
electric
flexibility
,
work
at
the
bench


through
swift
,
unnoticeable
movement
,
always
ambush
in
a
sort
of


silence
.




she
hang
a
moment
in
the
door
of
the
shed
,
wait
for
he
to
notice


she
.
he
turn
,
his
black
,
curved
eyebrow
arch
slightly
.




"
Hullo
,
Twittermiss
!
"




and
he
close
the
door
behind
she
.
then
the
child
be
happy
in
the
shed


that
smell
of
sweet
wood
and
resound
to
the
noise
of
the
plane
or


the
hammer
or
the
saw
,
yet
be
charge
with
the
silence
of
the
worker
.


she
play
on
,
intent
and
absorb
,
among
the
shaving
and
the
little


nog
of
wood
.
she
never
touch
he
:
his
foot
and
leg
be
near
,
she


do
not
approach
they
.




she
like
to
flit
out
after
he
when
he
be
go
to
church
at
night
.


if
he
be
go
to
be
alone
,
he
swing
she
over
the
wall
,
and
let
she


come
.




again
she
be
transport
when
the
door
be
shut
behind
they
,
and
they


two
inherit
the
big
,
pale
,
void
place
.
she
would
watch
he
as
he
light


the
organ
candle
,
wait
whilst
he
begin
his
practice
his
tune
,
then


she
run
forage
here
and
there
,
like
a
kitten
playing
by
herself
in


the
darkness
with
eye
dilate
.
the
rope
hang
vaguely
,
twine
on
the


floor
,
from
the
bell
in
the
tower
,
and
Ursula
always
want
the


fluffy
,
red
-
and
-
white
,
or
blue
-
and
-
white
rope
-
grip
.
but
they
be


above
she
.




sometimes
her
mother
come
to
claim
she
.
then
the
child
be
seize
with


resentment
.
she
passionately
resent
her
mother
’s
superficial


authority
.
she
want
to
assert
her
own
detachment
.




he
,
however
,
also
give
her
occasional
cruel
shock
.
he
let
she
play


about
in
the
church
,
she
rifle
foot
-
stool
and
hymn
-
book
and


cushion
,
like
a
bee
among
flower
,
whilst
the
organ
echo
away
.
this


continue
for
some
week
.
then
the
charwoman
work
herself
up
into
a


frenzy
of
rage
,
to
dare
to
attack
Brangwen
,
and
one
day
descend
on


he
like
a
harpy
.
he
wilt
away
,
and
want
to
break
the
old
beast
’s


neck
.




instead
he
came
glower
in
fury
to
the
house
,
and
turn
on
Ursula
.




"

his
voice
be
harsh
and
cat

the
child

she
shrink


away

childish
anguish
and
dread

already
come
over
the
child
the


cold
sense
of
the
impersonal
world
.
there
she
know
her
mother
be


right
.
but
still
her
heart
clamour
after
her
father

for
he
to
be


right

in
his
dark
,
sensuous
underworld

but
he
be
angry
,
and
go
his


way
in
blackness
and
brutal
silence
again

the

run
about
absorb
in
life

quiet
,
full
of
amusement
.
she
do


not
notice
thing
,
nor
change
nor
alteration
.
one
day
she
would
find


daisy
in
the
grass
,
another
day
,
apple
-
blossom
would
be
sprinkle


white
on
the
ground
,
and
she
would
run
among
it
,
for
pleasure
because


it
be
there
.
yet
again
bird
would
be
peck
at
the
cherry
,
she


father
would
throw
cherry
down
from
the
tree
all
round
she
on
the


garden

then
the
field
be
full
of
hay

she
do
not
remember
what
have
be
nor
what
would
be
,
the
outside


thing
be
there
each
day
.
she
be
always
herself
,
the
world
outside


be
accidental
.
even
her
mother
be
accidental
to
she
:
a
condition
that


happen
to
endure
.




only
her
father
occupy
any
permanent
position
in
the
childish


consciousness
.
when
he
come
back
she
remember
vaguely
how
he
have
go


away
,
when
he
go
away
she
know
vaguely
that
she
must
wait
for
his


come
back

the
return

the
departure
of
the
father
be
the
one
event

the


child

be
out
of
joint
or
irritable
or
tired
:
then


she
be
uneasy
,
she
could
not
rest
.




when
he
be
in
the
house
,
the
child
feel
full
and
warm
,
rich
like
a


creature
in
the
sunshine
.
when
he
be
go
,
she
be
vague
,
forgetful
.


when
he
scold
she
even
,
she
be
often
more
aware
of
he
than
of


herself
.
he
be
her
strength
and
her
great
self
.




Ursula
be
three
year
old
when
another
baby
girl
be
bear
.
then
the


two
small
sister
be
much
together
,
Gudrun
and
Ursula
.
Gudrun
be
a


quiet
child
who
play
for
hour
alone
,
absorb
in
her
fancy
.
she


be
brown
-
haired
,
fair
-
skinned
,
strangely
placid
,
almost
passive
.
yet


her
will
be
indomitable
,
once
set
.
from
the
first
she
follow


Ursula
’s
lead
.
yet
she
be
a
thing
to
herself
,
so
that
to
watch
the
two


together
be
strange
.
they
be
like
two
young
animal
play
together


but
not
take
real
notice
of
each
other
.
Gudrun
be
the
mother
’s


favourite
—
except
that
Anna
always
live
in
her
late
baby
.




the
burden
of
so
many
life
depend
on
he
wear
the
youth
down
.
he


have
his
work
in
the
office
,
which
be
do
purely
by
effort
of
will
:
he


have
his
barren
passion
for
the
church
;
he
have
three
young
child
.


also
at
this
time
his
health
be
not
good
.
so
he
be
haggard
and


irritable
,
often
a
pest
in
the
house
.
then
he
be
tell
to
go
to
his


woodwork
,
or
to
the
church
.




between
he
and
the
little
Ursula
there
come
into
be
a
strange


alliance
.
they
be
aware
of
each
other
.
he
know
the
child
be
always


on
his
side
.
but
in
his
consciousness
he
count
it
for
nothing
.
she


be
always
for
he
.
he
take
it
for
grant
.
yet
his
life
be
base
on


she
,
even
whilst
she
be
a
tiny
child
,
on
her
support
and
her
accord
.




Anna
continue
in
her
violent
trance
of
motherhood
,
always
busy
,
often


harass
,
but
always
contain
in
her
trance
of
motherhood
.
she
seem


to
exist
in
her
own
violent
fruitfulness
,
and
it
be
as
if
the
sun


shine
tropically
on
she
.
her
colour
be
bright
,
her
eye
full
of
a


fecund
gloom
,
her
brown
hair
tumble
loosely
over
her
ear
.
she
have
a


look
of
richness
.
no
responsibility
,
no
sense
of
duty
trouble
she
.
the


outside
,
public
life
be
less
than
nothing
to
she
,
really
.




whereas
when
,
at
twenty
-
six
,
he
find
himself
father
of
four
child
,


with
a
wife
who
live
intrinsically
like
the
ruddiest
lily
of
the


field
,
he
let
the
weight
of
responsibility
press
on
he
and
drag
he
.


it
be
then
that
his
child
Ursula
strove
to
be
with
he
.
she
be
with


he
,
even
as
a
baby
of
four
,
when
he
be
irritable
and
shout
and
make


the
household
unhappy
.
she
suffer
from
his
shouting
,
but
somehow
it


be
not
really
he
.
she
want
it
to
be
over
,
she
want
to
resume
she


normal
connection
with
he
.
when
he
be
disagreeable
,
the
child
echo


to
the
crying
of
some
need
in
he
,
and
she
respond
blindly
.
her
heart


follow
he
as
if
he
have
some
tie
with
she
,
and
some
love
which
he


could
not
deliver
.
her
heart
follow
he
persistently
,
in
its
love
.




but
there
be
the
dim
,
childish
sense
of
her
own
smallness
and


inadequacy
,
a
fatal
sense
of
worthlessness
.
she
could
not
do
anything
,


she
be
not
enough
.
she
could
not
be
important
to
he
.
this
knowledge


deaden
she
from
the
first
.




still
she
set
towards
he
like
a
quiver
needle
.
all
her
life
be


direct
by
her
awareness
of
he
,
her
wakefulness
to
his
being
.
and
she


be
against
her
mother
.




her
father
be
the
dawn
wherein
her
consciousness
wake
up
.
but
for
he
,


she
might
have
go
on
like
the
other
child
,
Gudrun
and
Theresa
and


Catherine
,
one
with
the
flower
and
insect
and
plaything
,
have
no


existence
apart
from
the
concrete
object
of
her
attention
.
but
she


father
come
too
near
to
she
.
the
clasp
of
his
hand
and
the
power
of


his
breast
wake
she
up
almost
in
pain
from
the
transient


unconsciousness
of
childhood
.
wide
-
eyed
,
unseee
,
she
be
awake
before


she
know
how
to
see
.
she
be
waken
too
soon
.
too
soon
the
call
have


come
to
she
,
when
she
be
a
small
baby
,
and
her
father
hold
her
close


to
his
breast
,
her
sleep
-
live
heart
be
beat
into
wakefulness
by


the
striving
of
his
big
heart
,
by
his
clasp
she
to
his
body
for


love
and
for
fulfilment
,
ask
as
a
magnet
must
always
ask
.
from
she


the
response
have
struggle
dimly
,
vaguely
into
being
.




the

when
she

if


across
the
garden
she
see
the
hedge
have
bud
,
and
if
she
want
these


greeny

at
teaparty
with

go
for
they
.




then
suddenly
,
perhaps
the
next
day
,
her
soul
would
almost
start
out
of


her
body
as
her
father
turn
on
she
,
shout
:




"

your
own
greedy
nose
.
"




it
have
shock
he
in
his
intent
world
to
see
the
zigzag
line
of


deep
little
foot
-
print
across
his
work
.
the
child
be
infinitely
more


shocked
.
her
vulnerable
little
soul
be
flay
and
trample
.
_
why
_
be


the
foot
-
print
there
?
she
have
not
want
to
make
they
.
she
stand


dazzle
with
pain
and
shame
and
unreality
.




her
soul
,
her
consciousness
seem
to
die
away
.
she
become
shut
off
and


senseless
,
a
little
fixed
creature
whose
soul
have
go
hard
and


unresponsive
.
the
sense
of
her
own
unreality
harden
she
like
a
frost
.


she
care
no
long
.




and
the
sight
of
her
face
,
shut
and
superior
with
self
-
assert


indifference
,
make
a
flame
of
rage
go
over
he
.
he
want
to
break
she
.




"
I
’ll
break
your
obstinate
little
face
,
"
he
say
,
through
shut
tooth
,


lift
his
hand
.




the
child
do
not
alter
in
the
least
.
the
look
of
indifference
,


complete
glancing
indifference
,
as
if
nothing
but
herself
exist
to


she
,
remain
fix
.




yet
far
away
in
she
,
the
sob
be
tear
her
soul
.
and
when
he
have


go
,
she
would
go
and
creep
under
the
parlour
sofa
,
and
lie
clinch


in
the
silent
,
hidden
misery
of
childhood
.




when
she
crawl
out
,
after
an
hour
or
so
,
she
go
rather
stiffly
to


play
.
she
will
to
forget
.
she
cut
off
her
childish
soul
from
memory
,


so
that
the
pain
,
and
the
insult
should
not
be
real
.
she
assert


herself
only
.
there
be
not
nothing
in
the
world
but
her
own
self
.
so


very
soon
,
she
come
to
believe
in
the
outward
malevolence
that
be


against
she
.
and
very
early
,
she
learn
that
even
her
adore
father


be
part
of
this
malevolence
.
and
very
early
she
learn
to
harden
she


soul
in
resistance
and
denial
of
all
that
be
outside
she
,
harden


herself
upon
her
own
being
.




she
never
feel
sorry
for
what
she
have
do
,
she
never
forgave
those
who


have
make
she
guilty
.
if
he
have
say
to
she
,
"
why
,
Ursula
,
do
you


trample
my
carefully
-
make
bed
?
"
that
would
have
hurt
she
to
the
quick
,


and
she
would
have
do
anything
for
he
.
but
she
be
always
torment


by
the
unreality
of
outside
thing
.
the
earth
be
to
walk
on
.
why
must


she
avoid
a
certain
patch
,
just
because
it
be
call
a
seed
-
bed
?
it


be
the
earth
to
walk
on
.
this
be
her
instinctive
assumption
.
and
when


he
bully
she
,
she
become
hard
,
cut
herself
off
from
all
connection
,


live
in
the
little
separate
world
of
her
own
violent
will
.




as
she
grow
old
,
five
,
six
,
seven
,
the
connection
between
she
and
she


father
be
even
strong
.
yet
it
be
always
strain
to
break
.
she
be


always
relapse
on
her
own
violent
will
into
her
own
separate
world
of


herself
.
this
make
he
grind
his
tooth
with
bitterness
,
for
he
still


want
she
.
but
she
could
harden
herself
into
her
own
self
’s
universe
,


impregnable
.




he
be
very
fond
of
swimming
,
and
in
warm
weather
would
take
she
down


to
the
canal
,
to
a
silent
place
,
or
to
a
big
pond
or
reservoir
,
to


bathe
.
he
would
take
she
on
his
back
as
he
went
swim
,
and
she
cling


close
,
feel
his
strong
movement
under
she
,
so
strong
,
as
if
it
would


uphold
all
the
world
.
then
he
teach
she
to
swim
.




she
be
a
fearless
little
thing
,
when
he
dare
she
.
and
he
have
a


curious
craving
to
frighten
she
,
to
see
what
she
would
do
with
he
.
he


say
,
would
she
ride
on
his
back
whilst
he
jump
off
the
canal
bridge


down
into
the
water
beneath
.




she
would
.
he
love
to
feel
the
naked
child
cling
on
to
his


shoulder
.
there
be
a
curious
fight
between
their
two
will
.
he


mount
the
parapet
of
the
canal
bridge
.
the
water
be
a
long
way
down
.


but
the
child
have
a
deliberate
will
set
upon
his
.
she
hold
herself


fix
to
he
.




he
leap
,
and
down
they
go
.
the
crash
of
the
water
as
they
go
under


strike
through
the
child
’s
small
body
,
with
a
sort
of
unconsciousness
.


but
she
remain
fixed
.
and
when
they
come
up
again
,
and
when
they
go


to
the
bank
,
and
when
they
sit
on
the
grass
side
by
side
,
he
laugh
,


and
say
it
be
fine
.
and
the
dark
-
dilate
eye
of
the
child
look
at


he
wonderingly
,
darkly
,
wonder
from
the
shock
,
yet
reserved
and


unfathomable
,
so
he
laugh
almost
with
a
sob
.




in
a
moment
she
be
cling
safely
on
his
back
again
,
and
he
be


swim
in
deep
water
.
she
be
use
to
his
nakedness
,
and
to
she


mother
’s
nakedness
,
ever
since
she
be
bear
.
they
be
cling
to
each


other
,
and
make
up
to
each
other
for
the
strange
blow
that
have
be


strike
at
they
.
yet
still
,
on
other
day
,
he
would
leap
again
with
she


from
the
bridge
,
daringly
,
almost
wickedly
.
till
at
length
,
as
he


leapt
,
once
,
she
drop
forward
on
to
his
head
,
and
nearly
break
his


neck
,
so
that
they
fall
into
the
water
in
a
heap
,
and
fight
for
a
few


moment
with
death
.
he
save
she
,
and
sit
on
the
bank
,
quiver
.
but


his
eye
be
full
of
the
blackness
of
death
.
it
be
as
if
death
have


cut
between
their
two
life
,
and
separate
they
.




still
they
be
not
separate
.
there
be
this
curious
taunting
intimacy


between
they
.
when
the
fair
come
,
she
want
to
go
in
the
swingboat
.


he
take
she
,
and
,
stand
up
in
the
boat
,
hold
on
to
the
iron
,


begin
to
drive
high
,
perilously
high
.
the
child
clung
fast
on
she


seat
.




"
do
you
want
to
go
any
high
?
"
he
say
to
she
,
and
she
laugh
with


her
mouth
,
her
eye
wide
and
dilate
.
they
be
rush
through
the


air
.




"
yes
,
"
she
say
,
feel
as
if
she
would
turn
into
vapour
,
lose
hold
of


everything
,
and
melt
away
.
the
boat
swing
far
up
,
then
down
like
a


stone
,
only
to
be
catch
sickeningly
up
again
.




"

high
?
"
he
call
,
look
at
she
over
his
shoulder
,
his
face


evil
and
beautiful
to
she
.




she
laugh
with
white
lip
.




he
send
the
swingboat
sweeping
through
the
air
in
a
great
semi
-
circle
,


till

jerk
and
sway
at
the
high
horizontal

the

have
do
what
he
could
—
and
he


be

censure
.
he
sit
down
,
and
let
the
swingboat
swing
itself


out
.




People
in
the
crowd
cry
shame
on
he
as
he
come
out
of
the
swingboat
.


he

.
the
child
clung
to

and
mute
.
in
a
while

he

.
there

.
when

,
the
child
creep
away
under
the
parlour


sofa
,
like
a

the
first
time

but
ever
more
coldly
.

at
this
time
,
when

and


violent

,
over


everybody

to


assert
its
be
within
he
.
he
be
still
silent
and
separate
.
but
she


could
feel
he
all
the
while
come
near
upon
she
,
as
if
his
breast
and


his
body
be
threaten
she
,
and
he
be
always
come

indifferent
of

.
he
would
do
what

and

with
their
tiny
black


pupil
,

all
the
people
,
everything
that
happen
,
and
he


wait
.




in
the
Empire
one
evening
he
sit
next
to
two

.
he
be
aware
of
the


one
beside

.
she
be
rather
small
,
common
,
with
a
fresh
complexion


and
an
upper
lip
that
lift
from
her
tooth
,
so
that
,
when
she
be
not


conscious
,
her
mouth
be
slightly
open
and
her
lip
press
outward
in


a
kind
of
blind
appeal
.
she
be
strongly
aware
of
the
man
next
to
she
,


so
that
all
her

stage
.

down
into
her
lap
,
very
self
-
conscious
and
still
.




a
gleam
light
up
in
he
:
should
he
begin
with
she
?
should
he
begin
with


she
to
live
the
other
,
the
unadmitted
life
of
his
desire
?
why
not
?

have
always
be
so
good
.
save
for
his
wife
,

a
virgin
.
and
why

?
he


want
the
other
life
.
his
own
life

barren
,
not
enough
.

want


the
other
.




her

a
kind
of
amusement

with
an
almost

his
first
kiss
be
very
gentle
,
and
soft
,
and
assure
,
so
assuring
.
so

he
be
quiet
to
more

sometimes
he
be


ready
to

satisfied
of

he
be
go
mad
with
a
sense
of
Absolute
Beauty
,
perceive
by
he
in


she
through
his
sense
.
it
be
something
too
much
for
he
.
and
in


everything
,
be
this
same
,
almost
sinister
,
terrifying
beauty
.
but
in


the
revelation
of
her
body
through
contact
with
his
body
,
be
the


ultimate
beauty
,
to
know
which
be
almost
death
in
itself
,
and
yet
for


the
knowledge
of
which
he
would
have
undergo
endless
torture
.
he


would
have
forfeit
anything
,
anything
,
rather
than
forego
his
right


even
to
the
instep
of
her
foot
,
and
the
place
from
which
the
toe


radiate
out
,
the
little
,
miraculous
white
plain
from
which
run
the


little
hillock
of
the
toe
,
and
the
folded
,
dimple
hollow
between


the
toe
.
he
feel
he
would
have
die
rather
than
forfeit
this
.




this
be
what
their
love
have
become
,
a
sensuality
violent
and
extreme


as
death
.
they
have
no
conscious
intimacy
,
no
tenderness
of
love
.
it
be


all
the
lust
and
the
infinite
,
madden
intoxication
of
the
sense
,
a


passion
of
death
.




he
have
always
,
all
his
life
,
have
a
secret
dread
of
Absolute
Beauty
.
it


have
always
be
like
a
fetish
to
he
,
something
to
fear
,
really
.
for
it


be
immoral
and
against
mankind
.
so
he
have
turn
to
the
gothic
form
,


which
always
assert
the
broken
desire
of
mankind
in
its
pointed


arch
,
escape
the
rolling
,
absolute
beauty
of
the
round
arch
.




but
now
he
have
give
way
,
and
with
infinite
sensual
violence
give


himself
to
the
realization
of
this
supreme
,
immoral
,
Absolute
Beauty
,


in
the
body
of
woman
.
it
seem
to
he
,
that
it
come
to
be
in
the


body
of
woman
,
under
his
touch
.
under
his
touch
,
even
under
his
sight
,


it
be
there
.
but
when
he
neither
see
nor
touch
the
perfect
place
,
it


be
not
perfect
,
it
be
not
there
.
and
he
must
make
it
exist
.




but
still
the
thing
terrify
he
.
awful
and
threaten
it
be
,


dangerous
to
a
degree
,
even
whilst
he
give
himself
to
it
.
it
be
pure


darkness
,
also
.
all
the
shameful
thing
of
the
body

themselves


to
he
now
with
a
sort
of
sinister
,
tropical
beauty
.
all
the
shameful
,


natural
and
unnatural
act
of
sensual
voluptuousness
which
he
and
the


woman
partook
of
together
,
create
together
,
they
have
their
heavy


beauty
and
their
delight
.
shame
,
what
be
it
?
it
be
part
of
extreme


delight
.
it
be
that
part
of

the
secret
,
shameful

be
most
terribly
beautiful
.




they
accept
shame
,
and
be
one
with
it
in
their
most
unlicensed


pleasure
.

be
incorporate
.

a
bud
that
blossom
into

a


quick
intelligence
.
from
the
High
School
he
go
to
London
to
study
.
he


have
an
instinct
for
attract
people
of
character
and
energy
.
he
give


place
entirely
to
the
other
person
,
and
at
the
same
time
keep
himself


independent
.
he
scarcely
exist
except
through
other
people
.
when
he


be
alone
he
be
unresolved
.
when
he
be
with
another
man
,
he
seem
to


add
himself
to
the
other
,
make
the
other
big
than
life
size
.
so
that


a
few
people
love
he
and
attain
a
sort
of
fulfilment
in
he
.
he


carefully
choose
these
few
.




he
have
a
subtle
,
quick
,
critical
intelligence
,
a
mind
that
be
like
a


scale
or
balance
.
there
be
something
of
a
woman
in
all
this
.




in
London
he
have
be
the
favourite
pupil
of
an
engineer
,
a
clever
man
,


who
become
well
-
know
at
the
time
when
Tom
Brangwen
have
just
finish


his
study
.
through
this
master
the
youth
keep
acquaintance
with


various
individual
,
outstanding
character
.
he
never
assert
himself
.


he
seem
to
be
there
to
estimate
and
establish
the
rest
.
he
be
like
a


presence
that
make
we
aware
of
our
own
being
.
so
that
he
be
while


still
young
connect
with
some
of
the
most
energetic
scientific
and


mathematical
people
in
London
.
they
take
he
as
an
equal
.
quiet
and


perceptive
and
impersonal
as
he
be
,
he
keep
his
place
and
learn
how


to
value
other
in
just
degree
.
he
be
there
like
a
judgment
.
besides
,


he
be
very
good
-
look
,
of
medium
stature
,
but
beautifully


proportion
,
dark
,
with
fine
colouring
,
always
perfectly
healthy
.




his
father
allow
he
a
liberal
pocket
-
money
,
besides
which
he
have
a


sort
of
post
as
assistant
to
his
chief
.
then
from
time
to
time
the


young
man
appear
at
the
Marsh
,
curiously
attractive
,
well
-
dress
,


reserved
,
have
by
nature
a
subtle
,
refined
manner
.
and
he
set
the


change
in
the
farm
.




Fred
,
the
young
brother
,
be
a
Brangwen
,
large
-
boned
,
blue
-
eyed
,


english
.
he
be
his
father
’s
very
son
,
the
two
man
,
father
and
son
,


be
supremely
at
ease
with
one
another
.
Fred
be
succeed
to
the


farm
.




between
the
elder
brother
and
the
young
exist
an
almost
passionate


love
.
Tom
watch
over
Fred
with
a
woman
’s
poignant
attention
and


self
-
less
care
.
Fred
look
up
to
Tom
as
to
something
miraculous
,
that


which
he
himself
would
aspire
to
be
,
be
he
great
also
.




so
that
after
Anna
’s
departure
,
the
Marsh
begin
to
take
on
a
new
tone
.


the
boy
be
gentleman
;
Tom
have
a
rare
nature
and
have
rise
high
.
Fred


be
sensitive
and
fond
of
reading
,
he
ponder
Ruskin
and
then
the


agnostic
writing
.
like
all
the
Brangwens
,
he
be
very
much
a
thing
to


himself
,
though
fond
of
people
,
and
indulgent
to
they
,
have
an


exaggerated
respect
for
they
.




there
be
a
rather
uneasy
friendship
between
he
and
one
of
the
young


hardys
at
the
Hall
.
the
two
household
be
different
,
yet
the
young


man
meet
on
shy
term
of
equality
.




it
be
young
Tom
Brangwen
,
with
his
dark
lash
and
beautiful


colour
,
his
soft
,
inscrutable
nature
,
his
strange
repose
and
his


informed
air
,
add
to
his
position
in
London
,
who
seem
to
emphasize


the
superior
foreign
element
in
the
Marsh
.
when
he
appear
,
perfectly


dress
,
as
if
soft
and
affable
,
and
yet
quite
remove
from
everybody
,


he
create
an
uneasiness
in
people
,
he
be
reserve
in
the
mind
of
the


Cossethay
and
Ilkeston
acquaintance
to
a
different
,
remote
world
.




he
and
his
mother
have
a
kind
of
affinity
.
the
affection
between
they


be
of
a
mute
,
distant
character
,
but
radical
.
his
father
be
always


uneasy
and
slightly
deferential
to
his
eld
son
.
Tom
also
form
the


link
that
keep
the
Marsh
in
real
connection
with
the
Skrebenskys
,
now


quite
important
people
in
their
own
district
.




so
a
change
in
tone
come
over
the
Marsh
.
Tom
Brangwen
the
father
,
as
he


grow
old
,
seem
to
mature
into
a
gentleman
-
farmer
.
his
figure
lend


itself
:
burly
and
handsome
.
his
face
remain
fresh
and
his
blue
eye


as
full
of
light
,
his
thick
hair
and
beard
have
turn
gradually
to
a


silky
whiteness
.
it
be
his
custom
to
laugh
a
great
deal
,
in
his


acquiescent
,
wilful
manner
.
thing
have
puzzle
he
very
much
,
so
he
have


take
the
line
of
easy
,
good
-
humour
acceptance
.
he
be
not


responsible
for
the
frame
of
thing
.
yet
he
be
afraid
of
the
unknown


in
life
.




he
be
fairly
well
-
off
.
his
wife
be
there
with
he
,
a
different
being


from
himself
,
yet
somewhere
vitally
connect
with
him:—who
be
he
to


understand
where
and
how
?
his
two
son
be
gentleman
.
they
be
man


distinct
from
himself
,
they
have
separate
being
of
their
own
,
yet
they


be
connect
with
himself
.
it
be
all
adventurous
and
puzzling
.
yet


one
remain
vital
within
one
’s
own
existence
,
whatever
the
off
-
shoot
.




so
,
handsome
and
puzzle
,
he
laugh
and
stick
to
himself
as
the
only


thing
he
could
stick
to
.
his
youngness
and
the
wonder
remain
almost


the
same
in
he
.
he
become
indolent
,
he
develop
a
luxuriant
ease
.


Fred
do
most
of
the
farm
-
work
,
the
father
see
to
the
more
important


transaction
.
he
drive
a
good
mare
,
and
sometimes
he
ride
his
cob
.
he


drink
in
the
hotel
and
the
inn
with
well
-
class
farmer
and


proprietor
,
he
have
well
-
to
-
do
acquaintance
among
man
.
but
one
class


suit
he
no
well
than
another
.




his
wife
,
as
ever
,
have
no
acquaintance
.
her
hair
be
thread
now
with


grey
,
her
face
grow
old
in
form
without
change
in
expression
.
she


seem
the
same
as
when
she
have
come
to
the
Marsh
twenty
-
five
year


ago
,
save
that
her
health
be
more
fragile
.
she
seem
always
to
haunt


the
Marsh
rather
than
to
live
there
.
she
be
never
part
of
the
life
.


something
she
represent
be
alien
there
,
she
remain
a
stranger


within
the
gate
,
in
some
way
fix
and
impervious
,
in
some
way


curiously
refining
.
she
cause
the
separateness
and
individuality
of


all
the
Marsh
inmate
,
the
friability
of
the
household
.




when
young
Tom
Brangwen
be
twenty
-
three
year
old
there
be
some


breach
between
he
and
his
chief
which
be
never
explain
,
and
he
go


away
to
Italy
,
then
to
America
.
he
come
home
for
a
while
,
then
go
to


Germany
;
always
the
same
good
-
look
,
carefully
-
dress
,
attractive


young
man
,
in
perfect
health
,
yet
somehow
outside
of
everything
.
in
his


dark
eye
be
a
deep
misery
which
he
wear
with
the
same
ease
and


pleasantness
as
he
wear
his
close
-
sit
clothe
.




to
Ursula
he
be
a
romantic
,
alluring
figure
.
he
have
a
grace
of


bring
beautiful
present
:
a
box
of
expensive
sweet
,
such
as


Cossethay
have
never
see
;
or
he
give
she
a
hair
-
brush
and
a
long
slim


mirror
of
mother
-
of
-
pearl
,
all
pale
and
glimmering
and
exquisite
;
or
he


send
she
a
little
necklace
of
rough
stone
,
amethyst
and
opal
and


brilliant
and
garnet
.
he
speak
other
language
easily
and
fluently
,


his
nature
be
curiously
gracious
and
insinuate
.
with
all
that
,
he


be
undefinably
an
outsider
.
he
belong
to
nowhere
,
to
no
society
.




Anna
Brangwen
have
leave
her
intimacy
with
her
father
undeveloped
since


the
time
of
her
marriage
.
at
her
marriage
it
have
be
abandon
.
he
and


she
have
draw
a
reserve
between
they
.
Anna
go
more
to
her
mother
.




then
suddenly
the
father
die
.




it
happen
one
springtime
when
Ursula
be
about
eight
year
old
,
he
,


Tom
Brangwen
,
drive
off
on
a
Saturday
morning
to
the
market
in


Nottingham
,
say
he
might
not
be
back
till
late
,
as
there
be
a


special
show
and
then
a
meeting
he
have
to
attend
.
his
family
understand


that
he
would
enjoy
himself
.




the
season
have
be
rainy
and
dreary
.
in
the
evening
it
be
pour


with
rain
.
Fred
Brangwen
,
unsettle
,
uneasy
,
do
not
go
out
,
as
be
his


wo
nt
.
he
smoke
and
read
and
fidget
,
hear
always
the
trickling
of


water
outside
.
this
wet
,
black
night
seem
to
cut
he
off
and
make
he


unsettle
,
aware
of
himself
,
aware
that
he
want
something
else
,
aware


that
he
be
scarcely
live
.
there
seem
to
he
to
be
no
root
to
his


life
,
no
place
for
he
to
get
satisfied
in
.
he
dream
of
go
abroad
.


but
his
instinct
know
that
change
of
place
would
not
solve
his
problem
.


he
want
change
,
deep
,
vital
change
of
living
.
and
he
do
not
know
how


to
get
it
.




Tilly
,
an
old
woman
now
,
come
in
say
that
the
labourer
who
have

.
he


hear
in
indifference
.
but
he
hate
a
desolate
,
raw
wetness
in
the


world
.
he
would
leave
the
Marsh
.




his
mother
be
in

.
at
last
he
shut
his

,
his

,
he


walk
upstairs
intoxicate
with

a
mad
,
over
-
whelm
passion
for
his

.
she


seem
so
strange
and
winsome
.
he
be
almost
beside
himself
with
desire


for
she
.




and

while
at

,
and

into
the
work
of

farm
.
that
his
father
be

,
seem
to
make
it
only
the
more


intimate
and
the
more
inevitably
his
own
place
.




there
be
a
saying
that
the
Brangwens
always
die
a
violent
death
.
to


they
all
,
except
perhaps
Tom
,
it
seem
almost
natural
.
yet
Fred
go


about
obstinate
,
his
heart
fix
.
he
could
never
forgive
the
unknown


this
murder
of
his
father
.




after
the
death
of
the
father
,
the
Marsh
be
very
quiet
.
Mrs.
Brangwen


be
unsettled
.
she
could
not
sit
all
the
evening
peacefully
,
as
she


could
before
,
and
during
the
day
she
be
always
rise
to
her
foot
and


hesitate
,
as
if
she
must
go
somewhere
,
and
be
not
quite
sure


whither
.




she
be
see
loitering
about
the
garden
,
in
her
little
woollen
jacket
.


she
be
often
drive
out
in
the
gig
,
sit
beside
her
son
and


watch
the
countryside
or
the
street
of
the
town
,
with
a
childish
,


candid
,
uncanny
face
,
as
if
it
all
be
strange
to
she
.




the
child
,
Ursula
and
Gudrun
and
Theresa
go
by
the
garden
gate
on


their
way
to
school
.
the
grandmother
would
have
they
call
in
each
time


they
pass
,
she
would
have
they
come
to
the
Marsh
for
dinner
.
she


want
child
about
she
.




of
her
son
,
she
be
almost
afraid
.
she
could
see
the
sombre
passion


and
desire
and
dissatisfaction
in
they
,
and
she
want
not
to
see
it


any
more
.
even
Fred
,
with
his
blue
eye
and
his
heavy
jaw
,
trouble


she
.
there
be
no
peace
.
he
want
something
,
he
want
love
,
passion
,


and
he
could
not
find
they
.
but
why
must
he
trouble
she
?
why
must
he


come
to
she
with
his
seething
and
suffering
and
dissatisfaction
?
she


be
too
old
.




Tom
be
more
restrained
,
reserved
.
he
keep
his
body
very
still
.
but
he


trouble
she
even
more
.
she
could
not
but
see
the
black
depth
of


disintegration
in
his
eye
,
the
sudden
glance
upon
she
,
as
if
she
could


save
he
,
as
if
he
would
reveal
himself
.




and
how
could
age
save
youth
?
Youth
must
go
to
youth
.
always
the
storm
!


could
she
not
lie
in
peace
,
these
year
,
in
the
quiet
,
apart
from
life
?


no
,
always
the
swell
must
heave
upon
she
and
break
against
the


barrier
.
always
she
must
be
embroil
in
the
seethe
and
rage
and


passion
,
endless
,
endless
,
go
on
for
ever
.
and
she
want
to
draw


away
.
she
want
at
last
her
own
innocence
and
peace
.
she
do
not
want


her
son
to
force
upon
she
any
more
the
old
brutal
story
of
desire
and


offering
and
deep
,
deep
-
hide
rage
of
unsatisfied
man
against
woman
.


she
want
to
be
beyond
it
all
,
to
know
the
peace
and
innocence
of
age
.




she
have
never
be
a
woman
to
work
much
.
so
that
now
she
would
stand


often
at
the
garden
-
gate
,
watch
the
scant
world
go
by
.
and
the
sight


of
child
please
she
,
make
she
happy
.
she
have
usually
an
apple
or
a


few
sweet
in
her
pocket
.
she
like
child
to
smile
at
she
.




she
never
go
to
her
husband
’s
grave
.
she
speak
of
he
simply
,
as
if


he
be
alive
.
sometimes
the
tear
would
run
down
her
face
,
in
helpless


sadness
.
then
she
recover
,
and
be
herself
again
,
happy
.




on
wet
day
,
she
stay
in
bed
.
her
bedroom
be
her
city
of
refuge
,


where
she
could
lie
down
and
muse
and
muse
.
sometimes
Fred
would
read


to
she
.
but
that
do
not
mean
much
.
she
have
so
many
dream
to
dream


over
,
such
an
unsifted
store
.
she
want
time
.




her
chief
friend
at
this
period
be
Ursula
.
the
little
girl
and
the


musing
,
fragile
woman
of
sixty
seem
to
understand
the
same
language
.


at
Cossethay
all
be
activity
and
passion
,
everything
move
upon
pole


of
passion
.
then
there
be
four

Ursula
,
a
throng


of
baby
,
all
the
time
many
life
beat
against
each
other
.




so
that
for
the
eld
child
,
the
peace
of
the
grandmother
’s
bedroom


be
exquisite
.
here
Ursula
come
as
to
a
hush
,
paradisal
land
,
here


her
own
existence
become
simple
and
exquisite
to
she
as
if
she
be
a


flower
.




always
on
Saturdays
she
come
down
to
the
Marsh
,
and
always
clutch
a


little
offering
,
either

little
mat
make
of
strip
of
coloured
,
weave


paper
,
or
a
tiny
basket
make
in
the
kindergarten
lesson
,
or
a
little


crayon
drawing
of
a
bird
.




when
she
appear
in
the
doorway
,
Tilly
,
ancient
but
still
in


authority
,
would
crane

skinny
neck
to
see

it
be

the
Marsh

mystic

become
a
sort
of
Bible
to
the

and
Ursula
ask
her
deep
childish
question
of

somebody
who
will
love
you
for
what
you
be
,
and
not


for
what

you

we
have
a
right
to
what
we

"




Ursula

frightened
,
hear
these
thing
.
her
heart
sink
,
she
feel


she
have
no
ground
under
her
foot

she
clung
to
her
grandmother

here


be
peace
and
security
.
here
,
from
her
grandmother
’s
peaceful
room

the


door
open
on
to
the
great
space

the
past

which
be
so
big

that


all
it

seem
tiny

love
and
birth
and
death
,
tiny
unit


and
feature
within
a
vast
horizon
.
that
be
a
great
relief
,
to
know


the
tiny
importance

the
widening
CIRCLE






it
be
very
burdensome
to
Ursula
,
that
she
be
the
eld
of
the


family
.
by
the
time
she
be
eleven
,
she
have
to
take
to
school
Gudrun


and
Theresa
and
Catherine
.
the
boy
,
William
,
always
call
Billy
,
so


that
he
should
not
be
confuse
with
his
father
,
be
a
lovable
,
rather


delicate
child
of
three
,
so
he
stay
at
home
as
yet
.
there
be
another


baby
girl
,
call
Cassandra
.




the
child
go
for
a
time
to
the
little
church
school
just
near
the


Marsh
.
it
be
the
only
place
within
reach
,
and
be
so
small
,
Mrs.

feel
safe
in
send
her

,
though

"

Gudrun
and

.
the
second
child
,
with
her
long
,


sleepy
body
and
her
endless
chain
of
fancy

have
nothing

she
be
for
her
own
fancy
.


Ursula
be
the
one

so
Gudrun
leave
all

it

she

along

it

a
joy

to

the
Brangwen

.




then
there
be
an
outcry
.
Mrs.

no

she


would
not

all
her

up
.
then


there
be
the
vicar
lecture
the
school
.
"
it
be
a
sad
thing
that
the

of
Cossethay
could
not
behave
more
like
gentleman
to
the
girl

indeed
,
what
kind
of
boy
be
it
that
should

much
virtue
in


the
Brangwen

,
particularly
in
Theresa
’s
.
and
the
feud
continue
,


with
period
of
extraordinary
amity
,
when
Ursula
be
Clem
Phillips

sweetheart
,
and
Gudrun
be
Walter
’s

even


the
tiny
Katie
have
to
be
Eddie

’s
sweetheart
.
there
be
the


close
union
.
at
every
possible
moment
the
little
gang
of
Brangwens


and
phillipse
fly
together
.
yet
neither
Ursula
nor
Gudrun
would
have


any
real
intimacy
with
the
Phillips
boy
.
it
be
a
sort
of
fiction
to


they
,
this
alliance

this
dubbing
of
sweetheart

the
rest
will

"




how
Ursula
_
hate
_
always
to
represent
the
little
Brangwen
club
.
she


could
never

no

she
be

and
later
even
Billy

she

moreover
,
she
do
not
want
the
phillipse
either
.
she
be
out
of


taste
with
they
.




however
,
the
Brangwen
-
Pillins
coalition
readily
break
down
,
owe
to


the
unfair
superiority
of
the
Brangwens
.
the
Brangwens
be
rich
.
they


have
free
access
to
the
Marsh
Farm
.
the
school
teacher
be
almost


respectful
to
the
girl
,
the
vicar
speak
to
they
on
equal
term
.
the


brangwen
girl
presume
,
they
toss
their
head

"

"

Urtler

"

he
begin
to
jeer
,
try
to
set
all
the
other
in
cry
against
she
.
then


there
be
hostility
again
.
how
she
_
hate
_
their
jeering
.
she
become


cold
against
the
Phillipses
.
Ursula
be
very
proud
in
her
family
.
the


Brangwen
girl
have
all
a
curious
blind
dignity
,
even
a
kind
of
nobility


in
their
bearing
.
by
some
result
of
breed
and
upbringing
,
they
seem


to
rush
along
their
own
life
without
care
that
they
exist
to
other


people
.
never
from
the
start
do
it
occur
to
Ursula
that
other
people


might
hold
a
low
opinion
of
she
.
she
think
that
whosoever
know
she
,


know
she
be
enough
and
accept
she
as
such
.
she
think
it
be
a


world
of
people
like
herself
.
she
suffer
bitterly
if
she
be
force


to
have
a
low
opinion
of
any
person
,
and
she
never
forgave
that
person
.




this
be
madden
to
many
little
people
.
all
their
life
,
the


Brangwens
be
meet
folk
who
try
to
pull
they
down
to
make
they


seem
little
.
curiously
,
the
mother
be
aware
of
what
would
happen
,
and


be
always
ready
to
give
her
child
the
advantage
of
the
move
.




when
Ursula
be
twelve
,
and
the
common
school
and
the
companionship
of


the
village
child
,
niggardly
and
begrudge
,
be
begin
to
affect


she
,
Anna
send
she
with
Gudrun
to
the
Grammar
School
in
Nottingham
.


this
be
a
great
release
for
Ursula
.
she
have
a
passionate
craving
to


escape
from
the
belittling
circumstance
of
life
,
the
little


jealousy
,
the
little
difference
,
the
little
meanness
.
it
be
a


torture
to
she
that
the
Phillipses
be
poor
and
mean
than
herself
,


that
they
use
mean
little
reservation
,
take
petty
little
advantage
.


she
want
to
be
with
her
equal
:
but
not
by
diminish
herself
.
she


_
do
_
want
Clem
Phillips
to
be
she
equal
.
but
by
some
puzzling
,
painful


fate
or
other
,
when
he
be
really
there
with
she
,
he
produce
in
she
a


tight
feeling
in
the
head
.
she
want
to
beat
her
forehead
,
to
escape
.




then
she
find
that
the
way
to
escape
be
easy
.
one
depart
from
the


whole
circumstance
.
one
go
away
to
the
Grammar
School
,
and
leave
the


little
school
,
the
meagre
teacher
,
the
Phillipses
whom
she
have
try


to
love
but
who
have
make
she
fail
,
and
whom
she
could
not
forgive
.
she


have
an
instinctive
fear
of
petty
people
,
as
a
deer
be
afraid
of
dog
.


because
she
be
blind
,
she
could
not
calculate
nor
estimate
people
.
she


must
think
that
everybody
be
just
like
herself
.




she
measure
by
the
standard
of
her
own
people
:
her
father
and
mother
,


her
grandmother
,
her
uncle
.
her
beloved
father
,
so
utterly
simple
in


his
demeanour
,
yet
with
his
strong
,
dark
soul
fix
like
a
root
in


unexpressed
depth
that
fascinated
and
terrify
she
:
her
mother
,
so


strangely
free
of
all
money
and
convention
and
fear
,
entirely


indifferent
to
the
world
,
stand
by
herself
,
without
connection
:
she


grandmother
,
who
have
come
from
so
far
and
be
centre
in
so
wide
an


horizon
:
people
must
come
up
to
these
standard
before
they
could
be


Ursula
’s
people
.




so
even
as
a
girl
of
twelve
she
be
glad
to
burst
the
narrow
boundary


of
Cossethay
,
where
only
limited
people
live
.
outside
,
be
all


vastness
,
and
a
throng
of
real
,
proud
people
whom
she
would
love
.




go
to
school
by
train
,
she
must
leave
home
at
a
quarter
to
eight

ah
,
if

she
do
not
bite
her

!
if
only
she

not


this

she

—
without

,


live
the
high
,
noble
life
.




it
be
a
grief
to
she
that
her
father
make
such
a
poor
introduction
.
he


be
brief
as
ever
,
like
a
boy
say
his
errand
,
and
his
clothe
look


ill
-
fitting
and
casual
.
whereas
Ursula
would
have
like
robe
and
a


ceremonial
of
introduction
to
this
,
her
new
estate
.




she
make
a
new
illusion
of
school
.
Miss

,
have
a


certain

.
Dark
,

separate
it


from
the
dark
,
select
avenue
.
but
its
room
be
large
and
of
good


appearance
,
and
from
the
back
,
one
look
over
lawn
and
shrubbery
,


over
the
tree
and
the
grassy
slope
of
the
Arboretum
,
to
the
town
which


heap
the
hollow
with
its
roof
and
cupola
and
its
shadow
.




so
Ursula
seat
herself
upon
the
hill
of

,
look
down
on
the


smoke
and

of
the

.
she
be

.
up
here
,
in
the

School
,
she
fancy
the

be
fine
,
beyond

.
she
want
to
learn
Latin
and


greek
and
french
and
mathematic
.
she
tremble
like
a
postulant
when


she
write
the
greek
alphabet
for
the
first
time
.




she
be
upon
another
hill
-
slope
,
whose
summit
she
have
not
scale
.
there


be
always
the
marvellous
eagerness
in
her
heart
,
to
climb
and
to
see


beyond
.
a
latin
verb
be
virgin
soil
to
she
:
she
sniff
a
new
odour
in


it
;
it
mean
something
,
though
she
do
not
know
what
it
mean
.
but
she


gather
it
up
:
it
be
significant
.
when
she

y2
=
(
x
+
y
)
(

then
she
feel
that
she
have
grasp
something
,
that
she
be
liberate


into
an
intoxicate
air
,
rare
and
unconditioned
.
and
she
be
very
glad


as
she
write
her

in

of
a

and
then

then


ensue
a
long

she
receive
the

Gudrun
be
easy
in

nevertheless
Sunday
remain
the
maximum
day
of
the
week
for
both
.


Ursula
turn
passionately
to
it
,
to
the
sense
of
eternal
security
it


give
.
she
suffer
anguish
of
fear
during
the
week
-
day
,
for
she
feel


strong
power
that
would
not
recognize
she
.
there
be
upon
she
always
a


fear
and
a
dislike
of
authority
.
she
feel
she
could
always
do
as
she


want
if
she
manage
to
avoid
a
battle
with
Authority
and
the


authorise
Powers
.
but
if
she
give
herself
away
,
she
would
be
lose
,


destroy
.
there
be
always
the
menace
against
she
.




this
strange
sense
of
cruelty
and
ugliness
always
imminent
,
ready
to


seize
hold
upon
she
this
feeling
of
the
grudging
power
of
the
mob
lie


in
wait
for
she
,
who
be
the
exception
,
form
one
of
the
deep


influence
of
her
life
.
wherever
she
be
,
at
school
,
among
friend
,
in


the
street
,
in
the
train
,
she
instinctively
abate
herself
,
make


herself
small
,
feign
to
be
less
than
she
be
,
for
fear
that
she


undiscovered
self
should
be
see
,
pounce
upon
,
attack
by
brutish


resentment
of
the
commonplace
,
the
average
Self
.




she
be
fairly
safe
at
school
,
now
.
she
know
how
to
take
her
place


there
,
and
how
much
of
herself
to
reserve
.
but
she
be
free
only
on


sunday
.
when
she
be
but
a
girl
of
fourteen
,
she
begin
to
feel
a


resentment
grow
against
she
in
her
own
home
.
she
know
she
be
the


disturb
influence
there
.
but
as
yet
,
on
Sundays
,
she
be
free
,


really
free
,
free
to
be
herself
,
without
fear
or
misgiving
.




even
at
its
stormiest
,
Sunday
be
a
blessed
day
.
Ursula
wake
to
it
with


a
feeling
of
immense
relief
.
she
wonder
why
her
heart
be
so
light
.


then
she
remember
it
be
Sunday
.
a
gladness
seem
to
burst
out


around
she
,
a
feeling
of
great
freedom
.
the
whole

twenty

the
creation
of
a


new

,
there
be
a
thudding
of
quick
little
foot
,
and
the
child


be
up
and

,
scamper
in
their

,
with
pink
leg
and


glisten
,
flossy

with
ruffled
black

amazing
how
the

voice
could
ring
out
like
a
gong
,


without
his
being
in
the

move
,
and
how
the

could
speak

her
blouse

watch
the
bare
little

the

do
not
exclude
that
he
be


also
one
of
the
unhistoried
,
unaccountable
Sons
of
God
.
as
yet
,
she
be


confused
,
but
not
deny
.




again
she
hear
the
Voice
:




"
it
be
easy
for
a
camel
to
go
through
the
eye
of
a
needle
,
than
for
a


rich
man
to
enter
into
heaven
.
"




but
it
be
explain
,
the
needle
’s
eye
be
a
little
gateway
for
foot


passenger
,
through
which
the
great
,
humped
camel
with
his
load
could


not
possibly
squeeze
himself
:
or
perhaps
at
a
great
risk
,
if
he
be
a


little
camel
,
he
might
get
through
.
for
one
could
not
absolutely


exclude
the
rich
man
from
heaven
,
say
the
Sunday
school
teacher
.




it
please
she
also
to
know
,
that
in
the
East
one
must
use
hyperbole
,


or
else
remain
unheard
;
because
the
eastern
man
must
see
a
thing


swell
to
fill
all
heaven
,
or
dwindle
to
a
mere
nothing
,
before
he


be
suitably
impressed
.
she
immediately
sympathize
with
this
Eastern


mind
.




yet
the
word
continue
to
have
a
meaning
that
be
untouched
either
by


the
knowledge
of
gateway
or
hyperbole
.
the
historical
,
or
local
,
or


psychological
interest
in
the
word
be
another
thing
.
there
remain


unaltered
the
inexplicable
value
of
the
saying
.
what
be
this
relation


between
a
needle
’s
eye
,
a
rich
man
,
and
heaven
?
what
sort
of
a
needle
’s


eye
,
what
sort
of
a
rich
man
,
what
sort
of
heaven
?
who
know
?
it
mean


the
Absolute
World
,
and
can
never
be
more
than
half
interpret
in


term
of
the
relative
world
.




but
must
one
apply
the
speech
literally
?
be
her
father
a
rich
man
?


could
n’t
he
get
to
heaven
?
or
be
he
only
a
half
-
rich
man
?
or
be
he


merely
a
poor
man
?
at
any
rate
,
unless
he
give
everything
away
to
the


poor
,
he
would
find
it
much
hard
to
get
to
heaven
.
the
needle
’s
eye


would
be
too
tight
for
he
.
she
almost
wish
he
be
penniless
poor
.


if
one
be
come
to
the
base
of
it
,
any
man
be
rich
who
be
not
as


poor
as
the
poor
.




she
have
her
qualm
,
when
in
imagination
she
see
her
father
give
away


their
piano
and
the
two
cow
,
and
the
capital
at
the
bank
,
to
the


labourer
of
the
district
,
so
that
they
,
the
Brangwens
,
should
be
as


poor
as
the
Wherrys
.
and
she
do
not
want
it
.
she
be
impatient
.




"
very
well
,
"
she
think
,
"
we
’ll
forego
that
heaven
,
that
’
all
—
at
any


rate
the
needle
’s
eye
sort
.
"
and
she
dismiss
the
problem
.
she
be
not


go
to
be
as
poor
as
the
Wherrys
,
not
for
all
the
saying
on


earth
—
the
miserable
squalid
Wherrys
.




so
she
revert
to
the
non
-
literal
application
of
the
scripture
.
she


father
very
rarely
read
,
but
he
have
collect
many
book
of


reproduction
,
and
he
would
sit
and
look
at
these
,
curiously
intent
,


like
a
child
,
yet
with
a
passion
that
be
not
childish
.
he
love
the


early
italian
painter
,
but
particularly
Giotto
and
Fra
Angelico
and


Filippo
Lippi
.
the
great
composition
cast
a
spell
over
he
.
how
many


time
have
he
turn
to
Raphael
’s
"
dispute
of
the
Sacrament
"
or
Fra


Angelico
’s
"
last
Judgment
"
or
the
beautiful
,
complicated
rendering
of


the
adoration
of
the
Magi
,
and
always
,
each
time
,
he
receive
the
same


gradual
fulfilment
of
delight
.
it
have
to
do
with
the
establishment
of
a


whole
mystical
,
architectural
conception
which
use
the
human
figure
as


a
unit
.
sometimes
he
have
to
hurry
home
,
and
go
to
the
Fra
Angelico


"
last
Judgment
"
.
the
pathway
of
open
grave
,
the
huddle
earth
on


either
side
,
the
seemly
heaven
arrange
above
,
the
singing
process
to


paradise
on
the
one
hand
,
the
stuttering
descent
to
hell
on
the
other
,


complete
and
satisfy
he
.
he
do
not
care
whether
or
not
he
believe


in
devil
or
angel
.
the
whole
conception
give
he
the
deep


satisfaction
,
and
he
want
nothing
more
.




Ursula

accustom
to
these

from

childhood

out


their

she
like

.
the

of
the
most
High
bore
she
,
and
rouse
her
resentment
.


be
this
the
culmination
and
the
meaning
of
it
all
,
this
drape
,
null


figure
?
the
angel
be
so
lovely

the
light
so
beautiful
.

only


for
this
,

surround
such
a
banality
for
God

she
be
dissatisfied
,

not
fit
as
yet
to
criticize
.
there
be
yet
so


much
to
wonder
over

across

troubled

dark

upon

the
cycle
of


creation
still
wheel
in
the
Church
year
.
after
Christmas
,
the

slowly
sink
and
change
.
Sunday
follow
Sunday
,
trail
a
fine


movement
,
a
finely
develop
transformation
over
the
heart
of
the


family
.
the
heart
that
be
big
with
joy
,
that
have
see
the
star
and
have


follow
to
the
inner
wall
of
the
Nativity
,
that
there
have
swoon
in


the
great
light
,
must
now
feel
the
light
slowly
withdraw
,
a
shadow


fall
,
darken
.
the
chill
creep
in
,
silence
come
over
the
earth
,


and
then
all
be
darkness
.
the
veil
of
the
temple
be
rent
,
each
heart


give
up
the
ghost
,
and
sink
dead
.




they
move
quietly
,
a
little
wanness
on
the
lip
of
the
child
,
at


good
Friday
,
feel
the
shadow
upon
their
heart
.
then
,
pale
with
a


deathly
scent
,
come
the
lily
of
resurrection
,
that
shine
coldly
till


the
Comforter
be
give
.




but
why
the
memory
of
the
wound
and
the
death
?
surely
Christ
rise
with


heal
hand
and
foot
,
sound
and
strong
and
glad
?
surely
the
passage
of


the
cross
and
the
tomb
be
forget
?
but
no
—
always
the
memory
of
the


wound
,
always
the
smell
of
grave
-
clothe
?
a
small
thing
be


Resurrection
,
compare
with
the
Cross
and
the
death
,
in
this
cycle
.




so
the
child
live
the
year
of
christianity
,
the
epic
of
the
soul
of


mankind
.
year
by
year
the
inner
,
unknown
drama
go
on
in
they
,
their


heart
be
bear
and
come
to
fulness
,
suffer
on
the
cross
,
give
up


the
ghost
,
and
rise
again
to
unnumbered
day
,
untire
,
have
at
least


this
rhythm
of
eternity
in
a
ragged
,
inconsequential
life
.




but
it
be
become
a
mechanical
action
now
,
this
drama
:
birth
at


Christmas
for
death
at
Good
Friday
.
on
Easter
Sunday
the
life
-
drama
be


as
good

.


first
LOVE






as
Ursula
pass
from
girlhood
towards
womanhood
,
gradually
the
cloud


of
self
-
responsibility
gather
upon
she
.
she
become
aware
of
herself
,


that
she
be
a
separate
entity
in
the
midst
of
an
unseparated


obscurity
,
that
she
must
go
somewhere
,
she
must
become
something
.
and


she
be
afraid
,
troubled
.
why
,
oh
why
must
one
grow
up
,
why
must
one


inherit
this
heavy
,
numb
responsibility
of
live
an
undiscovered


life
?
out
of
the
nothingness
and
the
undifferentiated
mass
,
to
make


something
of
herself
!
but
what
?
in
the
obscurity
and
pathlessness
to


take
a
direction
!
but
whither
?
how
take
even
one
step
?
and
yet
,
how


stand
still
?
this
be
torment
indeed
,
to
inherit
the
responsibility
of


one
’s
own
life
.




the
religion
which
have
be
another
world
for
she
,
a
glorious
sort
of


play
-
world
,
where
she
live
,
climb
the
tree
with
the
short
-
stature


man
,
walk
shakily
on
the
sea
like
the
disciple
,
break
the
bread


into
five
thousand
portion
,
like
the
Lord
,
give
a
great
picnic
to


five
thousand
people
,
now
fall
away
from
reality
,
and
become
a
tale
,
a


myth
,
an
illusion
,
which
,
however
much
one
might
assert
it
to
be
true


an
historical
fact
,
one
know
be
not
true
—
at
least
,
for
this


present
—
day
life
of
ours
.
there
could
,
within
the
limit
of
this
life


we
know
,
be
no
feeding
of
the
Five
Thousand
.
and
the
girl
have
come
to


the
point
where
she
hold
that
that
which
one
can
not
experience
in
daily


life
be
not
true
for
oneself
.




so
,
the
old
duality
of
life
,
wherein
there
have
be
a
weekday
world
of


people
and
train
and
duty
and
report
,
and
besides
that
a
Sunday


world
of
absolute
truth
and
living
mystery
,
of
walk
upon
the
water


and
be
blind
by
the
face
of
the
Lord
,
of
follow
the
pillar
of


cloud
across
the
desert
and
watch
the
bush
that
crackle
yet
do
not


burn
away
,
this
old
,
unquestioned
duality
suddenly
be
find
to
be


break
apart
.
the
weekday
world
have
triumph
over
the
Sunday
world
.


the
Sunday
world
be
not
real
,
or
at
least
,
not
actual
.
and
one
live


by
action
.




only
the
weekday
world
matter
.
she
herself
,
Ursula
Brangwen
,
must


know
how
to
take
the
weekday
life
.
her
body
must
be
a
weekday
body
,


hold
in
the
world
’s
estimate
.
her
soul
must
have
a
weekday
value
,
know


accord
to
the
world
’s
knowledge
.




well
,
then
,
there
be
a
weekday
life
to
live
,
of
action
and
deed
.
and


so
there
be
a
necessity
to
choose
one
’s
action
and
one
’s
deed
.
one


be
responsible
to
the
world
for
what
one
do
.




nay
,
one
be
more
than
responsible
to
the
world
.
one
be
responsible
to


oneself
.
there
be
some
puzzling
,
torment
residue
of
the
Sunday


world
within
she
,
some
persistent
Sunday
self
,
which
insist
upon
a


relationship
with
the
now
shed
-
away
vision
world
.
how
could
one
keep
up


a
relationship
with
that
which
one
deny
?
her
task
be
now
to
learn


the
week
-
day
life
.




how
to
act
,
that
be
the
question
?
whither
to
go
,
how
to
become


oneself
?
one
be
not
oneself
,
one
be
merely
a
half
-
state
question
.


how
to
become
oneself
,
how
to
know
the
question
and
the
answer
of


oneself
,
when
one
be
merely
an
unfixed
something
—
nothing
,
blow


about
like
the
wind
of
heaven
,
undefined
,
unstated
.




she
turn
to
the
vision
,
which
have
speak
far
-
off
word
that
run


along
the
blood
like
ripple
of
an
unseen
wind
,
she
hear
the
word


again
,
she
deny
the
vision
,
for
she
must
be
a
weekday
person
,
to
whom


vision
be
not
true
,
and
she
demand
only
the
weekday
meaning
of
the


word
.




there
_
be
_
word
speak
by
the
vision
:
and
word
must
have
a
weekday


meaning
,
since
word
be
weekday
stuff
.
let
they
speak
now
:
let
they


bespeak
themselves
in
weekday
term
.
the
vision
should
translate
itself


into
weekday
term
.




"

on
Sunday


morning

enough
for
Monday
morning

she
do

the
thought
be
a
horror
to


she
:
to
live
like
the
Wherrys
,
so
ugly
,
to
be
at

Theresa
slap
Ursula
on
the

Ursula
,
in
a
mood
of
christian
humility
,
silently
present
the
other


side
of
her
face

Theresa
,
in
exasperation
at

Whereupon

go
away
,
unchristian
but
clean
.




there
be
something
unclean
and
degrading
about
this
humble
side
of


christianity
.
Ursula
suddenly
revolt
to
the
other
extreme
.




"
I
hate
the
Wherrys

what
right

_
I

crawl
along

if

right


I
should
be

in
a
green
riding

habit
,

my
groom


would
be
behind

I
should
stop
at
the
gate

the
cottage

enquire
of
the
cottage
woman

out
with
a

in
her
arm
,
how

her
husband

who
have
hurt
his
foot

I
would
pat
the
flaxen
head


of
the
child

stoop
from
my
horse
,

I
would
give

sometimes

dash
into
flame
to


rescue
a

she
dive
into
the
canal
lock
and


support
a
boy
who
be
seize
with
cramp
;
or
she
sweep
up
a
toddle


infant
from
the
foot
of
a
runaway
horse
:
always
imaginatively
,
of


course
.




but
in
the
end
there
return
the
poignant
yearning
from
the
Sunday


world
.
as
she
go
down
in
the
morning
from
Cossethay
and
see
Ilkeston


smoke
blue
and
tender
upon
its
hill
,
then
her
heart
surge
with


far
-
off
word
:




"
oh
,
Jerusalem
,
Jerusalem
—
how
often
would
I
have
gather
thy
child


together
as
a
hen
gathereth
her
chicken
under
her
wing
,
and
ye
would


not
—
"




the
passion
rise
in
she
for
Christ
,
for
the
gathering
under
the
wing


of
security
and
warmth
.
but
how
do
it
apply
to
the
weekday
world
?
what


could
it
mean
,
but
that
Christ
should
clasp
she
to
his
breast
,
as
a


mother
clasp
her
child
?
and
oh
,
for
Christ
,
for
he
who
could
hold
she


to
his
breast
and
lose
she
there
.
oh
,
for
the
breast
of
man
,
where
she


should
have
refuge
and
bliss
for
ever
!
all
her
sense
quiver
with


passionate
yearning
.




vaguely
she
know
that
Christ
mean
something
else
:
that
in
the


vision
-
world
he
speak
of
Jerusalem
,
something
that
do
not
exist
in
the


everyday
world
.
it
be
not
house
and
factory
he
would
hold
in
his


bosom
:
nor
householder
nor
factory
-
worker
nor
poor
people
:
but


something
that
have
no
part
in
the
weekday
world
,
nor
see
nor
touch


with
weekday
hand
and
eye
.




yet
she
_
must
_
have
it
in
weekday
term
—
she
must
.
for
all
her
life
be


a
weekday
life
,
now
,
this
be
the
whole
.
so
he
must
gather
her
body
to


his
breast
,
that
be
strong
with
a
broad
bone
,
and
which
sound
with


the
beating
of
the
heart
,
and
which
be
warm
with
the
life
of
which
she


partook
,
the
life
of
the
run
blood
.




so
she
crave
for
the
breast
of
the
Son
of
Man
,
to
lie
there
.
and
she


be
ashamed
in
her
soul
,
ashamed
.
for
whereas
Christ
speak
for
the


vision
to
answer
,
she
answer
from
the
weekday
fact
.
it
be
a


betrayal
,
a
transference
of
meaning
,
from
the
vision
world
,
to
the


matter
-
of
-
fact
world
.
so
she
be
ashamed
of
her
religious
ecstasy
,
and


dread
lest
any
one
should
see
it
.




early
in
the
year
,
when
the
lamb
come
,
and
shelter
be
build
of


straw
,
and
on
her
uncle
’s
farm
the
man
sit
at
night
with
a
lantern
and


a
dog
,
then
again
there
sweep
over
she
this
passionate
confusion


between
the
vision
world
and
the
weekday
world
.
again
she
feel
Jesus
in


the
countryside
.
ah
,
he
would
lift
up
the
lamb
in
his
arm
!
ah
,
and


she
be
the
lamb
.
again
,
in
the
morning
,
go
down
the
lane
,
she
hear


the
ewe
call
,
and
the
lamb
came
run
,
shake
and
twinkle
with


new
-
bear
bliss
.
and
she
see
they
stoop
,
nuzzle
,
grope
to
the


udder
,
to
find
the
teat
,
whilst
the
mother
turn
her
head
gravely
and


sniff
her
own
.
and
they
be
suck
,
vibrate
with
bliss
on
their


little
,
long
leg
,
their
throat
stretch
up
,
their
new
body


quiver
to
the
stream
of
blood
-
warm
,
love
milk
.




oh
,
and
the
bliss
,
the
bliss
!
she
could
scarcely
tear
herself
away
to


go
to
school
.
the
little
nose
nuzzle
at
the
udder
,
the
little
body


so
glad
and
sure
,
the
little
black
leg
,
crooked
,
the
mother
stand


still
,
yield
herself
to
their
quiver
attraction
—
then
the
mother


walk
calmly
away
.




Jesus
—
the
vision
world
—
the
everyday
world
—
all
mix
inextricably
in
a


confusion
of
pain
and
bliss
.
it
be
almost
agony
,
the
confusion
,
the


inextricability
.
Jesus
,
the
vision
,
speak
to
she
,
who
be


non
-
visionary
!
and
she
would
take
his
word
of
the
spirit
and
make
they


to
pander
to
her
own
carnality
.




this
be
a
shame
to
she
.
the
confusing
of
the
spirit
world
with
the


material
world
,
in
her
own
soul
,
degrade
she
.
she
answer
the
call
of


the
spirit
in
term
of
immediate
,
everyday
desire
.




"
come
unto
I
,
all
ye
that
labour
and
be
heavy
-
laden
,
and
I
will
give


you
rest
.
"




it
be
the
temporal
answer
she
give
.
she
leapt
with
sensuous
yearning


to
respond
to
Christ
.
if
she
could
go
to
he
really
,
and
lie
her
head


on
his
breast
,
to
have
comfort
,
to
be
make
much
of
,
caress
like
a


child
!




all
the
time
she
walk
in
a
confused
heat
of
religious
yearning
.
she


want
Jesus
to
love
she
deliciously
,
to
take
her
sensuous
offering
,
to


give
her
sensuous
response
.
for
week
she
go
in
a
muse
of
enjoyment
.




and
all
the
time
she
know
underneath
that
she
be
play
false
,


accept
the
passion
of
Jesus
for
her
own
physical
satisfaction
.
but


she
be
in
such
a
daze
,
such
a
tangle
.
how
could
she
get
free
?




she
hate
herself
,
she
want
to
trample
on
herself
,
destroy
herself
.


how
could
one
become
free
?
she
hate
religion
,
because
it
lend
itself


to
her
confusion
.
she
abuse
everything
.
she
want
to
become
hard
,


indifferent
,
brutally
callous
to
everything
but
just
the
immediate


need
,
the
immediate
satisfaction
.
to
have
a
yearning
towards
Jesus
,


only
that
she
might
use
he
to
pander
to
her
own
soft
sensation
,
use


he
as
a
means
of
react
upon
herself
,
madden
she
in
the
end
.
there


be
then
no
Jesus
,
no
sentimentality
.
with
all
the
bitter
hatred
of


helplessness
she
hate
sentimentality
.




at
this
period
come
the
young
Skrebensky
.
she
be
nearly
sixteen
year


old
,
a
slim
,
smoulder
girl
,
deeply
reticent
,
yet
lapse
into


unreserved
expansiveness
now
and
then
,
when
she
seem
to
give
away
she


whole
soul
,
but
when
in
fact
she
only
make
another
counterfeit
of
she


soul
for
outward
presentation
.
she
be
sensitive
in
the
extreme
,
always


torture
,
always
affect
a
callous
indifference
to
screen
herself
.




she
be
at
this
time
a
nuisance
on
the
face
of
the
earth
,
with
she


spasmodic
passion
and
her
slumberous
torment
.
she
seem
to
go
with
all


her
soul
in
her
hand
,
yearning
,
to
the
other
person
.
yet
all
the


while
,
deep
at
the
bottom
of
she
be
a
childish
antagonism
of
distrust
.


she
think
she
love
everybody
and
believe
in
everybody
.
but
because


she
could
not
love
herself
nor
believe
in
herself
,
she
mistrust


everybody
with
the
mistrust
of
a
serpent
or
a
capture
bird
.
her
start


of
revulsion
and
hatred
be
more
inevitable
than
her
impulse
of
love
.




so
she
wrestle
through
her
dark
day
of
confusion
,
soulless
,


uncreated
,
unformed
.




one
evening
,
as
she
be
study
in
the
parlour
,
her
head
bury
in
she


hand
,
she
hear
new
voice
in
the
kitchen
speak
.
at
once
,
from
its


apathy
,
her
excitable
spirit
start
and
strain
to
listen
.
it
seem


to
crouch
,
to
lurk
under
cover
,
tense
,
glare
forth
unwilling
to
be


see
.




there
be
two
strange
man
’s
voice
,
one
soft
and
candid
,
veil
with


soft
candour
,

other

with
easy
mobility

quickly

of
her

listen


all
the
time
to
the
sound
of
the
voice
,
scarcely

first
speaker

Uncle
Tom
.
she
know
the
naïve
candour

the
girding
and
savage
misery
of
his
soul
.
who
be
the
other


speaker
?
whose
voice
run
on
so
easy
,
yet
with
an
inflamed
pulse
?
it


seem
to
hasten
and
urge
she
forward
,
that
other
voice
.




"

simply
acquiescent

beyond
any

there
be
a
sense


of

in
its
isolation
it
make
no
excuse

.
her
Uncle
Tom
be
always


more
or
less
what
the
other

have
he
.
in
consequence
,
one


never
know
the
real
Uncle

,
only
a
fluid
,
unsatisfactory
flux
with
a


more

less
consistent
appearance

but
,
let
Skrebensky
do
what
he
would
,
betray

he
permit
no


question
about
himself
.
he
be
irrevocable
in
his
isolation
.




so
Ursula
think
he
wonderful
,
he
be

finely

overhead

clothe
with
leave
,
and

walk
with
their
body

in
complex
unity
,
close
together

he
hold
her

they
go
the
long
way
round

the
road
,

far
.
always

he
would
kiss

not
again
that
night
with
the
same


deep
—
reach
kiss
.
she
be
aware
now
,
aware
of
what
a
kiss
might
be
.


and
so
,
it
be
more
difficult
to

the
two

hostile

as

Skrebensky

why

but
then
,

Ursula
know
,
he
do
not
have
the
perpetual
tyranny
of


young

between

there
be
an
unbridgeable
silence
.
sometimes
the
two
man
make
a
slight


conversation
,

there
be
no
interchange
.
Ursula
rejoice
to
see
she


father

into
himself
against
the
young
man

and
yet
cast
a
spell
over

positive
attraction
and

and
his
courtesy
and


his
agreement
might
be
all
her
mother
’s

but
the
lambent
flicker
of

to
want


to
agree
with
her
parent
.




"

face
all
laugh
,


like
a
challenge
.
and
he
accept
the
challenge
at
once
.
he
twine
his


hand
full
of
her
hair
,
and
gently
,
with
his
hand
wrap
round
with


hair
behind
her
head
,
gradually
bring
she
face
near
to
his
,
whilst


she
laugh
breathless
with
challenge
,
and
his
eye
gleam
with


answer
,
with
enjoyment
of
the
game
.
and
he
kiss

,
assert
his


will
over
she
,
and
she
kiss
he
back
,
assert
her
deliberate


enjoyment
of
he
.
dare
and
reckless
and
dangerous
they
know
it
be
,


their
game
,
each
play
with
fire
,
not

a
sort
of
defiance


of
all
the
world
possess
she
in
it
—
she
would
kiss
he
just
because


she
want
to

and
a
dare
-
devilry
in
he
,
like
a
cynicism
,
a
cut
at


everything

to
serve
,
retaliate
in
he

very
beautiful
then
,
so
wide
open
,
so
radiant
,
so


palpitating

wrongly
,
throw


herself
to
risk
.
it
rouse
a
sort
of
madness
in
he
.
like
a
flower


shake
and
wide
-
open
in
the
sun
,
she
tempt
he
and
challenge
he
,


and
he
accept
the
challenge
,
something
went
fix
in
he
.
and
under


all
her
laugh
,
poignant
recklessness
be
the
quiver
of
tear
.
that


almost
send
he
mad
,
mad
with
desire
,
with
pain
,
whose
only
issue
be


through
possession
of
her
body
.




so
,
shake
,
afraid
,
they
go
back
to
her
parent
in
the
kitchen
,
and


dissimulate
.
but
something
be
rouse
in
both
of
they
that
they
could


not
now
allay
.
it
intensify
and
heighten
their
sense
,
they
be


more
vivid
,
and
powerful
in
their
being
.
but
under
it
all
be
a


poignant
sense
of
transience
.
it
be
a
magnificent
self
-
assertion
on


the
part
of
both
of
they
,
he
assert
himself
before
she
,
he
feel


himself
infinitely
male
and
infinitely
irresistible
,
she
assert


herself
before
he
,
she
know
herself
infinitely
desirable
,
and
hence


infinitely
strong
.
and
after
all
,
what
could
either
of
they
get
from


such
a
passion
but
a
sense
of
his
or
of
her
own
maximum
self
,
in


contradistinction
to
all
the
rest
of
life
?
Wherein
be
something
finite


and
sad
,
for
the
human
soul
at
its
maximum
want
a
sense
of
the


infinite
.




nevertheless
,
it
be
begin
now
,
this
passion
,
and
must
go
on
,
the


passion
of
Ursula
to
know
her
own
maximum
self
,
limited
and
so
define


against
he
.
she
could
limit
and
define
herself
against
he
,
the
male
,


she
could
be
her
maximum
self
,
female
,
oh
female
,
triumphant
for
one


moment
in
exquisite
assertion
against
the
male
,
in
supreme


contradistinction
to
the
male
.




the
next
afternoon
,
when
he
come
,
prowl
,
she
go
with
he
across
to


the
church
.

father
be
gradually
gather
in
anger
against
he
,


her
mother
be
harden
in
anger
against
she
.
but
the
parent
be


naturally
tolerant
in
action
.




they
go
together
across
the
churchyard
,
Ursula
and
Skrebensky
,
and


run
to
hiding
in
the
church
.
it
be
dimmer
in
there
than
the
sunny


afternoon
outside
,
but
the
mellow
glow
among
the
bowed
stone
be
very


sweet
.
the
window
burn
in
ruby
and
in
blue
,
they
make
magnificent


arra
to
their
bower
of
secret
stone
.




"
what
a
perfect
place
for
a
_
rendezvous
,
"
_
he
say
,
in
a
hushed
voice
,


glance
round
.




she
too
glanced
round
the
familiar
interior
.
the
dimness
and
stillness


chill
she
.
but
her
eye
light
up
with
daring
.
here
,
here
she
would


assert
her
indomitable
gorgeous
female
self
,
here
.
here
she
would
open


her
female
flower
like
a
flame
,
in
this
dimness
that
be
more


passionate
than
light
.




they
hang
apart
a
moment
,
then
wilfully
turn
to
each
other
for
the


desire
contact
.
she
put
her
arm
round

cleave
her
body

shoulder
,
on
his
back
,
she


seem
to

young
,
tense
body
right


through
.
and

so
fine
,
so
hard
,
yet
so
exquisitely
subject
and


under
her

mouth
and
drank
his
full
kiss
,

and
it
be
so
good
,

.
she
seem
to
be

with
his
kiss
,

and
look
at
he

,
so
full
of
her
own
bliss
,
never


doubt
but
that

in
a
soft
,
wild
rush


from
the
wheel
,

blackish
green
,
with
the
silver
of
new


hay
here
and
there
,
and
masse
of
tree
under
a
silver
-
gleam

a
new
consciousness
,
troubled
.

some
time
,
but
sit
,

-
fast
,
with
avert
,
shine


face
.




and
every
now
and
then

she
against
he
.
and
they
wait


for
the
motion
to
bring
they

.
yet
they
stare
out
of
the


window
,
mute
.

by
.
but
now
,

on
its


grassy
hill
.
strange

evening
,


remote
,
in
a
magic
land
.
some
rook
be

out
of
the
tree
.




ah
,
if
only
she
and

out
,
dismount
into
this


enchant
land
where
nobody

before
!
then
they
would
be


enchant
people
,
they
would
put
off
the
dull
,
customary
self
.
if
she


be
wander
there
,
on
that
hill
-
slope
under
a
silvery
,
change
sky
,


in
which
many
rook
melt
like
hurry
shower
of

if
they


could
walk
past
the
wet
hay
-
swath
,
smell
the
early
evening
,
and


pass
in
to
the
wood
where
the
honeysuckle
scent

sweet
on
the
cold

and
virgin
.
he


want
to

desire
to

in
clear
pain
of


magnificence
.

herself
into
all
the
hidden
brightness
of
the
air

come
up

away
coat

with
his
womanish
colouring
and
dark
eye
and
black
close
-
cut


moustache
.
but
there
be
something
subtly
coarse
and
suggestive
about


he
for
all
his
beauty
;
his
strange
,
bestial
nostril
open
so
hard


and
wide
,
and
his
well

shape
head
almost
disquiet
in
its
nakedness
,


rather
bald
from
the
front
,

all
its
soft
fulness
betray
.




Skrebensky
see
the
man
rather
than

only
the
slender
,


unchangeable
youth
wait
there
inscrutable
,
like
her
fate
.
he
be


beyond
she
,
with
his
loose
,
slightly
horsey
appearance
,
that
make
he


seem
very
manly
and
foreign
.
yet
his
face
be
smooth
and
soft
and


impressionable
.
she
shake
hand
with
he
,
and
her
voice
be
like
the


rouse
of
a
bird
startle
by
the
dawn
.

bit
of

over

lose
himself
and


become
all
vague
,
undefined
,
inchoate
.
yet
he
want
to
be
hard
,


manly
,
horsey
.
and
he
follow
she
.




there
be
a
light
tea

for

consummation
.
but
Skrebensky
put
his
arm
round

,
and
lead

.
he
put
a
big
,
dark
cloak

,
under
the
cloak
,
with
Skrebensky

her
hand
.
but
her
naked
self
be
away
there
beat
upon
the


moonlight
,
dash
the
moonlight
with
her
breast
and
her
knee
,
in


meeting
,
in
communion
.
she
half
start
,
to
go
in
actuality
,
to
fle


away
her
clothing
and
flee
away
,
away
from
this
dark
confusion
and


chaos
of
people
to
the
hill
and
the
moon
.
but
the
people
stand
round


she
like
stone
,
like
magnetic
stone
,
and
she
could
not
go
,
in


actuality
.
Skrebensky
,
like
a
load
-
stone

weight
of


his
presence

the
burden
of
he
,
the
blind
,


persistent
,
inert
burden
.
he
be
inert
,
and
he
weigh
upon
she
.
she


sigh
in
pain
.
oh
,
for
the
coolness
and
entire
liberty
and
brightness


of
the
moon
.
oh
,
for
the
cold
liberty
to
be
herself
,
to
do
entirely
as


she
like
.
she
want
to
get
right
away
.
she
feel
like
bright
metal


weight
down
by
dark
,
impure
magnetism
.
he
be
the
dross
,
people
be


the
dross
.
if
she
could
but
get
away
to
the
clean
free
moonlight
.




"
do
n’t
you
like
I
to
-
night
?
"
say
his
low
voice
,
the
voice
of
the


shadow
over
her
shoulder
.
she
clench
her
hand
in
the
dewy
brilliance


of
the
moon
,
as
if
she
be
mad
.




"
do
n’t
you
like
I
to
-
night
?
"
repeat
the
soft
voice
.




and
she
know
that
if
she
turn
,
she
would
die
.
a
strange
rage
fill


she
,
a
rage
to
tear
thing
asunder
.
her
hand
feel
destructive
,
like


metal
blade
of
destruction
.




"
let
I
alone
,
"
she
say
.




a
darkness
,
an
obstinacy
settle
on
he
too
,
in
a
kind
of
inertia
.
he


sit
inert
beside
she
.
she
throw
off
her
cloak
and
walk
towards
the


moon
,
silver
-
white
herself
.
he
follow
she
closely
.




the
music
begin
again
and
the
dance
.
he
appropriate
she
.
there
be
a


fierce
,
white
,
cold
passion
in
her
heart
.
but
he
hold
she
close
,
and


dance
with
she
.
always
present
,
like
a
soft
weight
upon
she
,
bear


she
down
,
be
his
body
against
she
as
they
dance
.
he
hold
she
very


close
,
so
that
she
could
feel
his
body
,
the
weight
of
he
sink
,


settle
upon
she
,
overcome
her
life
and
energy
,
make
her
inert


along
with
he
,
she
feel
his
hand
press
behind
she
,
upon
she
.
but


still
in
her
body
be
the
subdue
,
cold
,
indomitable
passion
.
she
like


the
dance
:
it
ease
she
,
put
she
into
a
sort
of
trance
.
but
it
be
only


a
kind
of
waiting
,
of
use
up
the
time
that
intervene
between
she
and


her
pure
being
.
she
leave
herself
against
he
,
she
let
he
exert
all
his


power
over
she
,
to
bear
she
down
.
she
receive
all
the
force
of
his


power
.
she
even
wish
he
might
overcome
she
.
she
be
cold
and
unmoved


as
a
pillar
of
salt
.




his
will
be
set
and
strain
with
all
its
tension
to
encompass
he


and
compel
she
.
if
he
could
only
compel
she
.
he
seem
to
be


annihilate
.
she
be
cold
and
hard
and
compact
of
brilliance
as
the


moon
itself
,
and
beyond
he
as
the
moonlight
be
beyond
he
,
never
to


be
grasp
or
know
.
if
he
could
only
set
a
bond
round
she
and
compel


she
!




so
they
dance
four
or
five
dance
,
always
together
,
always
his
will


become
more
tense
,
his
body
more
subtle
,
play
upon
she
.
and
still


he
have
not
get
she
,
she
be
hard
and
bright
as
ever
,
intact
.
but
he


must
weave
himself
round
she
,
enclose
she
,
enclose
she
in
a
net
of


shadow
,
of
darkness
,
so
she
would
be
like
a
bright
creature
gleaming
in


a
net
of
shadow
,
catch
.
then
he
would
have
she
,
he
would
enjoy
she
.


how
he
would
enjoy
she
,
when
she
be
catch
.




at
last
,
when
the
dance
be
over
,
she
would
not
sit
down
,
she
walk


away
.
he
come
with
his
arm
round
she
,
keep
she
upon
the
movement
of


his
walking
.
and
she
seem
to
agree
.
she
be
bright
as
a
piece
of


moonlight
,
as
bright
as
a
steel
blade
,
he
seem
to
be
clasp
a
blade


that
hurt
he
.
yet
he
would
clasp
she
,
if
it

he
.




they
go
towards
the
stackyard
.
there
he

,
with
something
like


terror
,

great
new
stack
of
corn

and
gleam


transfigure
,
silvery
and
present
under
the
night
-
blue

,
throw


dark
,
substantial
shadow
,
but
themselves
majestic
and
dimly
present
.


she
,
like
glimmering
gossamer
,
seem
to
burn
among
they
,
as
they
rise


like
cold
fire
to
the
silvery
-
bluish
air
.
all
be
intangible
,
a


burn
of
cold
,
glimmering
,
whitish
-
steely
fire
.
he
be
afraid
of
the


great
moon
-
conflagration
of
the
cornstack
rise
above
he
.
his
heart


grow
small
,
it
begin
to
fuse
like
a
bead
.
he
know
he
would
die
.




she
stand
for
some
moment
out
in
the
overwhelming
luminosity
of
the


moon
.
she
seem

beam
of
gleaming
power
.

at
he
,
at
his
shadowy
,

sudden


lust

she
,
to
lay
hold
of
he
and
tear
he
and
make
he
into


nothing
.
her
hand
and
wrist
feel
immeasurably
hard
and
strong
,
like


blade
.
he
wait
there
beside
she
like
a
shadow
which
she
want
to


dissipate
,
destroy
as

its
abstraction

it

a
sort

romantic
situation
that
she
know


so
well
in
fiction
she
hardly
understand
it
in
fact
.
underneath
a
top


elation

a
sort
of
dreariness

deep
,
ashy
disappointment

secrete
the

wake
in
the
morning

all


the
time
she
feel
very
guilty
and
ashamed
,

that
box

—
she
only
know
she
ought
to
feel
guilty
.
and
she
could
not
make


up
her
mind
.
curiously
monumental
that
box
of
sweet
stand
up
,
now
it


be
empty
.
it
be
a
crux
for
she
.
what
be
she
to
think
of
it
?




the
idea
of
war
altogether
make
she
feel
uneasy
,
uneasy
.
when
man
begin


organized
fighting
with
each
other
it
seem
to
she
as
if
the
pole
of


the
universe
be
crack
,
and
the
whole
might
go
tumble
into
the


bottomless
pit
.
a
horrible
bottomless
feeling
she
have
.
yet
of
course


there
be
the
mint
superscription
of
romance
and
honour
and
even


religion
about
war
.
she
be
very
confused
.




skrebensky
be
busy
,
he
could
not
come
to
see
she
.
she
ask
for
no


assurance
,
no
security
.
what
be
between
they
,
be
,
and
could
not
be


alter
by
avowal
.
she
know
that
by
instinct
,
she
trust
to
the


intrinsic
reality
.




but
she
feel
an
agony
of
helplessness
.
she
could
do
nothing
.
vaguely


she
know
the
huge
power
of
the
world
roll
and
crash
together
,


darkly
,
clumsily
,
stupidly
,
yet
colossal
,
so
that
one
be
brush
along


almost
as
dust
.
helpless
,
helpless
,
swirl
like
dust
!
yet
she
want


so
hard
to
rebel
,
to
rage
,
to
fight
.
but
with
what
?




could
she
with
her
hand
fight
the
face
of
the
earth
,
beat
the
hill
in


their
place
?
yet
her
breast
want
to
fight
,
to
fight
the
whole
world
.


and
these
two
small
hand
be
all
she
have
to
do
it
with
.




the
month
go
by
,
and
it
be
Christmas
—
the
snowdrop
come
.
there
be


a
little
hollow
in
the
wood
near
Cossethay
,
where
snowdrop
grow
wild
.


she
send
he
some
in
a
box
,
and
he
write
she
a
quick
little
note
of


thank
—
very
grateful
and
wistful
he
seem
.
her
eye
grow
childlike
and


puzzle
.
puzzle
from
day
to
day
she
go
on
,
helpless
,
carry
along


by
all
that
must
happen
.




he
go
about
at
his
duty
,
give
himself
up
to
they
.
at
the
bottom


of
his
heart
his
self
,
the
soul
that
aspire
and
have
true
hope
of


self
-
effectuation
lie
as
dead
,
still
-
bear
,
a
dead
weight
in
his
womb
.


who
be
he
,
to
hold
important
his
personal
connection
?
what
do
a
man


matter
personally
?
he
be
just
a
brick
in
the
whole
great
social


fabric
,
the
nation
,
the
modern
humanity
.
his
personal
movement
be


small
,
and
entirely
subsidiary
.
the
whole
form
must
be
ensure
,
not


rupture
,
for
any
personal
reason
whatsoever
,
since
no
personal
reason


could
justify
such
a
breaking
.
what
do
personal
intimacy
matter
?
one


have
to
fill
one
’s
place
in
the
whole
,
the
great
scheme
of
man
’s


elaborate
civilization
,
that
be
all
.
the
Whole
matter
—
but
the
unit
,


the
person
,
have
no
importance
,
except
as
he
represent
the
Whole
.




so
Skrebensky
leave
the
girl
out
and
go
his
way
,
serve
what
he
have


to
serve
,
and
endure
what
he
have
to
endure
,
without
remark
.
to
his


own
intrinsic
life
,
he
be
dead
.
and
he
could
not
rise
again
from
the


dead
.
his
soul
lie
in
the
tomb
.
his
life
lie
in
the
establish
order


of
thing
.
he
have
his
five
sense
too
.
they
be
to
be
gratify
.
apart


from
this
,
he
represent
the
great
,
establish
,
extant
Idea
of
life
,


and
as
this
he
be
important
and
beyond
question
.




the
good
of
the
great
number
be
all
that
matter
.
that
which
be


the
great
good
for
they
all
,
collectively
,
be
the
great
good
for


the
individual
.
and
so
,
every
man
must
give
himself
to
support
the


state
,
and
so
labour
for
the
great
good
of
all
.
one
might
make


improvement
in
the
state
,
perhaps
,
but
always
with
a
view
to


preserve
it
intact
.




no
high
good
of
the
community
,
however
,
would
give
he
the
vital


fulfilment
of
his
soul
.
he
know
this
.
but
he
do
not
consider
the
soul


of
the
individual
sufficiently
important
.
he
believe
a
man
be


important
in
so
far
as
he
represent
all
humanity
.




he
could
not
see
,
it
be
not
bear
in
he
to
see
,
that
the
high
good


of
the
community
as
it
stand
be
no
long
the
high
good
of
even
the


average
individual
.
he
think
that
,
because
the
community
represent


million
of
people
,
therefore
it
must
be
million
of
time
more


important
than
any
individual
,
forget
that
the
community
be
an


abstraction
from
the
many
,
and
be
not
the
many
themselves
.
now
when
the


statement
of
the
abstract
good
for
the
community
have
become
a
formula


lack
in
all
inspiration
or
value
to
the
average
intelligence
,
then


the
"
common
good
"
become
a
general
nuisance
,
represent
the
vulgar
,


conservative
materialism
at
a
low
level
.




and
by
the
high
good
of
the
great
number
be
chiefly
mean
the


material
prosperity
of
all
class
.
Skrebensky
do
not
really
care


about
his
own
material
prosperity
.
if
he
have
be
penniless
—
well
,
he


would
have
take
his
chance
.
therefore
how
could
he
find
his
high


good
in
give
up
his
life
for
the
material
prosperity
of
everybody


else
!
what
he
consider
an
unimportant
thing
for
himself
he
could
not


think
worthy
of
every
sacrifice
on
behalf
of
other
people
.
and
that


which
he
would
consider
of
the
deep
importance
to
himself
as
an


individual
—
oh
,
he
say
,
you
must
n’t
consider
the
community
from
that


standpoint
.
no
—
no
—
we
know
what
the
community
want
;
it
want
something


solid
,
it
want
good
wage
,
equal
opportunity
,
good
condition
of


live
,
that
’
what
the
community
want
.
it
do
n’t
want
anything


subtle
or
difficult
.
duty
be
very
plain
—
keep
in
mind
the
material
,
the


immediate
welfare
of
every
man
,
that
’
all
.




so
there
come
over
Skrebensky
a
sort
of
nullity
,
which
more
and
more


terrify
Ursula
.
she
feel
there
be
something
hopeless
which
she
have


to
submit
to
.
she
feel
a
great
sense
of
disaster
impend
.
day
after


day
be
make
inert
with
a
sense
of
disaster
.
she
become
morbidly


sensitive
,
depressed
,
apprehensive
.
it
be
anguish
to
she
when
she
see


one
rook
slowly
flap
in
the
sky
.
that
be
a
sign
of
ill
-
oman
.
and


the
foreboding
become
so
black
and
so
powerful
in
she
,
that
she
be


almost
extinguish
.




yet
what
be
the
matter
?
at
the
bad
he
be
only
go
away
.
why
do


she
mind
,
what
be
it
she
fear
?
she
do
not
know
.
only
she
have
a


black
dread
possess
she
.
when
she
go
at
night
and
see
the
big
,


flash
star
they
seem
terrible
,
by
day
she
be
always
expect


some
charge
to
be
make
against
she
.




he
write
in
March
to
say
that
he
be
go
to
South
Africa
in
a
short


time
,
but
before
he
go
,
he
would
snatch
a
day
at
the
Marsh
.




as
if
in
a
painful
dream
,
she
waited
suspend
,
unresolved
.
she
do
not


know
,
she
could
not
understand
.
only
she
feel
that
all
the
thread
of


her
fate
be
be
hold
taut
,
in
suspense
.
she
only
weep
sometimes
as


she
go
about
,
say
blindly
:




"
I
be
so
fond
of
he
,
I
be
so
fond
of
he
.
"




he
come
.
but
why
do
he
come
?
she
look
at
he
for
a
sign
.
he
give
no


sign
.
he
do
not
even
kiss
she
.
he
behave
as
if
he
be
an
affable
,


usual
acquaintance
.
this
be
superficial
,
but
what
do
it
hide
?
she


wait
for
he
,
she
want
he
to
make
some
sign
.




so
the
whole
of
the
day
they
waver
and
avoid
contact
,
until


evening
.
then
,
laugh
,
say
he
would
be
back
in
six
month
’
time


and
would
tell
they
all
about
it
,
he
shake
hand
with
her
mother
and


take
his
leave
.




Ursula
accompany
he
into
the
lane
.
the
night
be
windy
,
the
yew


tree
seethe
and
hiss
and
vibrate
.
the
wind
seem
to
rush
about


among
the
chimney
and
the
church
-
tower
.
it
be
dark
.




the
wind
blow
Ursula
’s
face
,
and
her
clothe
cleave
to
her
limb
.
but


it
be
a
surging
,
turgid
wind
,
instinct
with
compressed
vigour
of
life
.


and
she
seem
to
have
lose
Skrebensky
.
out
there
in
the
strong
,
urgent


night
she
could
not
find
he
.




"
where
be
you
?
"
she
ask
.




"
here
,
"
come
his
bodiless
voice
.




and
grope
,
she
touch
he
.
a
fire
like
lightning
drench
they
.




"
Anton
?
"
she
say
.




"
what
?
"
he
answer
.




she
hold
he
with
her
hand
in
the
darkness
,
she
feel
his
body
again


with
hers
.




"
do
n’t
leave
I
—
come
back
to
I
,
"
she
say
.




"
yes
,
"
he
say
,
hold
she
in
his
arm
.




but
the
male
in
he
be
scotch
by
the
knowledge
that
she
be
not


under
his
spell
nor
his
influence
.
he
want
to
go
away
from
she
.
he


rest
in
the
knowledge
that
to
-
morrow
he
be
go
away
,
his
life
be


really
elsewhere
.
his
life
be
elsewhere
—
his
life
be
elsewhere
—
the


centre
of
his
life
be
not
what
she
would
have
.
she
be
different
—
there


be
a
breach
between
they
.
they
be
hostile
world
.




"
you
will
come
back
to
I
?
"
she
reiterate
.




"
yes
,
"
he
say
.
and
he
mean
it
.
but
as
one
keep
an
appointment
,
not


as
a
man
return
to
his
fulfilment
.




so
she
kiss
he
,
and
go
indoor
,
lose
.
he
walk
down
to
the
Marsh


abstracted
.
the
contact
with
she
hurt
he
,
and
threaten
he
.
he


shrank
,
he
have
to
be
free
of
her
spirit
.
for
she
would
stand
before


he
,
like
the
angel
before
Balaam
,
and
drive
he
back
with
a
sword
from


the
way
he
be
go
,
into
a
wilderness
.




the
next
day
she
go
to
the
station
to
see
he
go
.
she
look
at
he
,


she
turn
to
he
,
but
he
be
always
so
strange
and
null
—
so
null
.
he


be
so
collect
.
she
think
it
be
that
which
make
he
null
.


strangely
nothing
he
be
.




Ursula
stand
near
he

some
shame
at
the

,
dead
shame


for

be
the
eternal
audience
,
the
chorus
,
the
spectator
at


the

from
the

a
dirty
,
red

eyed
old
woman


came

sort
of

Ursula
have
only
two
more
term
at
school
.
she
be
study
for
she


matriculation
examination
.
it
be
dreary
work
,
for
she
have
very
little


intelligence
when
she
be
disjoint
from
happiness
.
stubbornness
and
a


consciousness
of
impending
fate
keep
she
half
-
heartedly
pin
to
it
.


she
know
that
soon
she
would
want
to
become
a
self
-
responsible
person
,


and
her
dread
be
that
she
would
be
prevent
.
an
all
-
contain
will


in
she
for
complete
independence
,
complete
social
independence
,


complete
independence
from
any
personal
authority
,
keep
she
dullishly


at
her
study
.
for
she
know
that
she
have
always
her
price
of


ransom
—
her
femaleness
.
she
be
always
a
woman
,
and
what
she
could
not


get
because
she
be
a
human
being
,
fellow
to
the
rest
of
mankind
,
she


would
get
because
she
be
a
female
,
other
than
the
man
.
in
she


femaleness
she
feel
a
secret
rich
,
a
reserve
,
she
have
always
the


price
of
freedom
.




however
,
she
be
sufficiently
reserve
about
this
last
resource
.
the


other
thing
should
be
try
first
.
there
be
the
mysterious
man
’s


world
to
be
adventure
upon
,
the
world
of
daily
work
and
duty
,
and


existence
as
a
work
member
of
the
community
.
against
this
she
have
a


subtle
grudge
.
she
want
to
make
her
conquest
also
of
this
man
’s


world
.




so
she
grind
away
at
her
work
,
never
give
it
up
.
some
thing
she


like
.
her
subject
be
English
,
Latin
,
french
,
mathematic
and


history
.
once
she
know
how
to
read
French
and
Latin
,
the
syntax
bore


she
.
most
tedious
be
the
close
study
of
English
literature
.
why
should


one
remember
the
thing
one
read
?
something
in
mathematic
,
their
cold


absoluteness
,
fascinated
she
,
but
the
actual
practice
be
tedious
.
some


people
in
history
puzzle
she
and
make
her
ponder
,
but
the
political


part
anger
she
,
and
she
hate
minister
.
only
in
odd
streak
do
she


get
a
poignant
sense
of
acquisition
and
enrichment
and
enlarge
from


her
study
;
one
afternoon
,
read
_
as
you
like
it
_
;
once
when
,
with


her
blood
,
she
hear
a
passage
of
Latin
,
and
she
know
how
the
blood


beat
in
a
Roman
’s
body
;
so
that
ever
after
she
feel
she
know
the
Romans


by
contact
.
she
enjoy
the
vagary
of
English
Grammar
,
because
it


give
her
pleasure
to
detect
the
live
movement
of
word
and
sentence
;


and
mathematic
,
the
very
sight
of
the
letter
in
Algebra
,
have
a
real


lure
for
she
.




she
feel
so
much
and
so
confusedly
at
this
time
,
that
her
face
get
a


queer
,
wonder
,
half
-
scared
look
,
as
if
she
be
not
sure
what
might


seize
upon
she
at
any
moment
out
of
the
unknown
.




odd
little
bit
of
information
stir
unfathomable
passion
in
she
.


when
she
know
that
in
the
tiny
brown
bud
of
autumn
be
fold
,
minute


and
complete
,
the
finish
flower
of
the
summer
nine
month
hence
,


tiny
,
fold
up
,
and
leave
there
wait
,
a
flash
of
triumph
and
love


go
over
she
.




"
I
could
never
die
while
there
be
a
tree
,
"
she
say
passionately
,


sententiously
,
stand
before
a
great
ash
in
worship
.




it
be
the
people
who
,
somehow
,
walk
as
an
upright
menace
to
she
.
she


life
at
this
time
be
unformed
,
palpitating
,
essentially
shrink
from


all
touch
.
she
give
something
to
other
people
,
but
she
be
never


herself
,
since
she
have
no
self
.
she
be
not
afraid
nor
ashamed
before


tree
,
and
bird
,
and
the
sky
.
but
she
shrink
violently
from
people
,


ashame
she
be
not
as
they
be
,
fix
,
emphatic
,
but
a
wavering
,


undefined
sensibility
only
,
without
form
or
being
.




Gudrun
be
at
this
time
a
great
comfort
and
shield
to
she
.
the
young


girl
be
a
lithe
,
_
farouche
_
animal
,
who
mistrust
all
approach
,
and


would
have
none
of
the
petty
secrecy
and
jealousy
of
schoolgirl


intimacy
.
she
would
have
no
truck
with
the
tame
cat
,
nice
or
not
,


because
she
believe
that
they
be
all
only
untamed
cat
with
a
nasty
,


untrustworthy
habit
of
tameness
.




this
be
a
great
stand
-
back
for
Ursula
,
who
suffer
agony
when
she


think
a
person
dislike
she
,
no
matter
how
much
she
despise
that


other
person
.
how
could
anyone

people

but
the
rim
,
the


shore
of
a
great
inner
darkness
and
void

she

very
much
to
be


on
the

time
Miss

free
as
a
shade

an
underworld

extinction

of
oblivion

Ursula
be
glad
,
with
a
kind
of
motionless
,


lifeless
gladness
,
that
her
mistress
be
extinct
,
go
out
of
she
.




in
the
morning
,
however
,
the
love
be
there
again
,
burn
,
burn
.


she
remember
yesterday
,
and
she
want
more
,
always
more
.
she
want


to
be
with
her
mistress
.
all
separation
from
her
mistress
be
a


restriction
from
live
.
why
could
she
not
go
to
she
to
-
day
,
to
-
day
?


why
must
she
pace
about
revoke
at
Cossethay
whilst
her
mistress
be


elsewhere
?
she
sit
down
and
write
a
burning
,
passionate
love
-
letter
:


she
could
not
help
it
.




the
two
woman
become
intimate
.
their
life
seem
suddenly
to
fuse
into


one
,
inseparable
.
Ursula
go
to
Winifred
’s
lodge
,
she
spend
there


her
only
live
hour
.
Winifred
be
very
fond
of
water,—of
swimming
,
of


row
.
she
belong
to
various
athletic
club
.
many
delicious


afternoon
the
two
girl
spend
in
a
light
boat
on
the
river
,
Winifred


always
row
.
indeed
,
Winifred
seem
to
delight
in
have
Ursula
in


her
charge
,
in
give
thing
to
the
girl
,
in
fill
and
enrichene


her
life
.




so
that
Ursula
develop
rapidly
during
the
few
month
of
her
intimacy


with
her
mistress
.
Winifred
have
have
a
scientific
education
.
she
have


know
many
clever
people
.
she
want
to
bring
Ursula
to
her
own


position
of
thought
.




they
take
religion
and
rid
it
of
its
dogma
,
its
falsehood
.
winifred


humanize
it
all
.
gradually
it
dawn
upon
Ursula
that
all
the
religion


she
know
be
but
a
particular
clothing
to
a
human
aspiration
.
the


aspiration
be
the
real
thing,—the
clothing
be
a
matter
almost
of


national
taste
or
need
.
the
Greeks
have
a
naked
Apollo
,
the
Christians
a


white
-
robe
Christ
,
the
Buddhists
a
royal
prince
,
the
Egyptians
their


Osiris
.
religion
be
local
and
religion
be
universal
.
christianity


be
a
local
branch
.
there
be
as
yet
no
assimilation
of
local
religion


into
universal
religion
.




in
religion
there
be
the
two
great
motive
of
fear
and
love
.
the


motive
of
fear
be
as
great
as
the
motive
of
love
.
christianity


accept
crucifixion
to
escape
from
fear
;
"
do
your
bad
to
I
,
that
I


may
have
no
more
fear
of
the
bad
.
"
but
that
which
be
fear
be
not


necessarily
all
evil
,
and
that
which
be
love
not
necessarily
all


good
.
fear
shall
become
reverence
,
and
reverence
be
submission
in


identification
;
love
shall
become
triumph
,
and
triumph
be
delight
in


identification
.




so
much
she
talk
of
religion
,
get
the
gist
of
many
writing
.
in


philosophy
she
be
bring
to
the
conclusion
that
the
human
desire
be


the
criterion
of
all
truth
and
all
good
.
truth
do
not
lie
beyond


humanity
,
but
be
one
of
the
product
of
the
human
mind
and
feeling
.


there
be
really
nothing
to
fear
.
the
motive
of
fear
in
religion
be


base
,
and
must
be
leave
to
the
ancient
worshipper
of
power
,
worship
of


Moloch
.




we
do
not
worship
power
,
in
our
enlightened
soul
.
power
be
degenerate


to
money
and
napoleonic
stupidity
.




Ursula
could
not
help
dream
of
Moloch
.
her
God
be
not
mild
and


gentle
,
neither
Lamb
nor
Dove
.
he
be
the
lion
and
the
eagle
.
not


because
the
lion
and
the
eagle
have
power
,
but
because
they
be
proud


and
strong
;
they
be
themselves
,
they
be
not
passive
subject
of


some
shepherd
,
or
pet
of
some
love
woman
,
or
sacrifice
of
some


priest
.
she
be
weary
to
death
of
mild
,
passive
lamb
and
monotonous


dove
.
if
the
lamb
might
lie
down
with
the
lion
,
it
would
be
a
great


honour
to
the
lamb
,
but
the
lion
’s
powerful
heart
would
suffer
no


diminish
.
she
love
the
dignity
and
self
-
possession
of
lion
.




she
do
not
see
how
lamb
could
love
.
lamb
could
only
be
love
.
they


could
only
be
afraid
,
and
tremblingly
submit
to
fear
,
and
become


sacrificial
;
or
they
could
submit
to
love
,
and
become
beloved
.
in
both


they
be
passive
.
rage
,
destructive
lover
,
seek
the
moment
when


fear
be
great
,
and
triumph
be
great
,
the
fear
not
great
than


the
triumph
,
the
triumph
not
great
than
the
fear
,
these
be
no
lamb


nor
dove
.
she
stretch
her
own
limb
like
a
lion
or
a
wild
horse
,
she


heart
be
relentless
in
its
desire
.
it
would
suffer
a
thousand
death
,


but
it
would
still
be
a
lion
’s
heart
when
it
rise
from
death
,
a
fiercer


lion
she
would
be
,
a
surer
,
know
herself
different
from
and
separate


from
the
great
,
conflicting
universe
that
be
not
herself
.




Winifred
Inger
be
also
interested
in
the
Women
’s
Movement
.




"
the
man
will
do
no
more,—they
have
lose
the
capacity
for
do
,
"
say


the
eld
girl
.
"
they
fuss
and
talk
,
but
they
be
really
inane
.
they


make
everything
fit
into
an
old
,
inert
idea
.
love
be
a
dead
idea
to


they
.
they
do
n’t
come
to
one
and
love
one
,
they
come
to
an
idea
,
and


they
say
'
you
be
my
idea
,
'
so
they
embrace
themselves
.
as
if
I
be


any
man
’s
idea
!
as
if
I
exist
because
a
man
have
an
idea
of
I

as
if
I


will
be
betray
by
he
,
lend
he
my
body
as
an
instrument
for
his


idea
,
to
be
a
mere
apparatus
of
his
dead
theory
.
but
they
be
too
fussy


to
be
able
to
act
;
they
be
all
impotent
,
they
ca
n’t
_
take
_
a
woman
.


they
come
to
their
own
idea
every
time
,
and
take
that
.
they
be
like


serpent
try
to
swallow
themselves
because
they
be
hungry

Ursula

provincial
society

as

it

a
chaos

like
the


end

a
terrible

almost
poisonous
despair

there

nothing

this
black
disintegration

yet
,
within
all
the


great
attack
of
disintegration
upon

she
remain
herself

it
be


the
terrible
core
of
all
her

,

the
thing

they
have
all
end
in
a

soul

under
an
utterly

.
it

not


instinctive
easiness
:
it
be
the
inevitable
outcome
of
his
nature
.
when


he

his

as

each
moment

like
a
separate
little

a
year
Wiggiston

,
a
great
mass
of
pinkish
row


of
thin
,
unreal
dwelling
of
five

.
the
street

of


the
side
of
the
square

along

pavement
heavily
to


work
,
seem
not
like
live
people
,
but
like
spectre
.
the
rigidity
of


the
blank
street
,
the
homogeneous
amorphous
sterility
of
the
whole


suggest
death
rather
than
life
.
there
be
no
meeting
place
,
no


centre
,
no
artery
,
no
organic
formation
.
there
it
lie
,
like
the
new


foundation
of
a
red
-
brick
confusion
rapidly
spread
,

a


skin

a
little
hill
,

Tom
Brangwen
’s
big
,


red

brick
house
.
it
look
from
the
front
upon
the
edge
of
the
place
,
a


meaningless
squalor
of
ash
-
pit
and
closet
and
irregular
row
of
the


back
of
house
,
each
with
its
small
activity
make
sordid
by
barren


cohesion
with
the
rest
of
the
small
activity
.
far
off
be
the


great
colliery
that
go
night
and
day
.

all
around
be
the
country
,


green
with
two

with
gorse
,
and
heath
,
the


dark
wood
in
the
distance
.




the
whole
place
be
just
unreal
,
just
unreal
.
even
now
,
when
he
have


be
there
for
two
year
,
Tom
Brangwen
do
not
believe
in
the
actuality


of
the
place
.
it
be
like
some
gruesome
dream
,
some
ugly
,
dead
,


amorphous
mood
become
concrete
.




Ursula
and
Winifred
be
meet
by
the
motor
-
car
at
the
raw
little


station
,
and
drive
through
what
seem
to
they
like
the
horrible
raw


beginning
of
something
.
the
place
be
a
moment
of
chaos
perpetuate
,


persist
,
chaos
fix
and
rigid
.
Ursula
be
fascinate
by
the
many


man
who
be
there
—
group
of
man
stand
in
the
street
,
four
or
five


man
walk
in
a
gang
together
,
their
dog
run
behind
or
before
.


they
be
all
decently
dress
,
and
most
of
they
rather
gaunt
.
the


terrible
gaunt
repose
of
their
bearing
fascinate
she
.
like
creature


with
no
more
hope
,
but
which
still
live
and
have
passionate
being
,


within
some
utterly
unliving
shell
,
they
pass
meaninglessly
along
,


with
strange
,
isolated
dignity
.
it
be
as
if
a
hard
,
horny
shell


enclose
they
all
.




shocked
and
startle
,
Ursula
be
carry
to
her
Uncle
Tom
’s
house
.
he


be
not
yet
at
home
.
his
house
be
simply
,
but
well
furnished
.
he
have


take
out
a
dividing
wall
,
and
make
the
whole
front
of
the
house
into
a


large
library
,
with
one
end
devote
to
his
science
.
it
be
a
handsome


room
,
appoint
as
a
laboratory
and
reading
room
,
but
give
the
same


sense
of
hard
,
mechanical
activity
,
activity
mechanical
yet
inchoate
,


and
look
out
on
the
hideous
abstraction
of
the
town
,
and
at
the


green
meadow
and
rough
country
beyond
,
and
at
the
great
,
mathematical


colliery
on
the
other
side
.




they
see
Tom
Brangwen
walk
up
the
curve
drive
.
he
be
get


stouter
,
but
with
his
bowler
hat
wear
well
set
down
on
his
brow
,
he


look
manly
,
handsome
,
curiously
like
any
other
man
of
action
.
his


colour
be
as
fresh
,
his
health
as
perfect
as
ever
,
he
walk
like
a


man
rather
absorb
.




Winifred
Inger
be
startled
when
he
enter
the
library
,
his
coat


fasten
and
correct
,
his
head
bald
to
the
crown
,
but
not
shiny
,
rather


like
something
naked
that
one
be
accustomed
to
see
cover
,
and
his


dark
eye
liquid
and
formless
.
he
seem
to
stand
in
the
shadow
,
like
a


thing
ashamed
.
and
the
clasp
of
his
hand
be
so
soft
and
yet
so


forceful
,
that
it
chill
the
heart
.
she
be
afraid
of
he
,
repel
by


he
,
and
yet
attract
.




he
look
at
the
athletic
,
seemingly
fearless
girl
,
and
he
detect
in


she
a
kinship
with
his
own
dark
corruption
.
immediately
,
he
know
they


be
akin
.




his
manner
be
polite
,
almost
foreign
,
and
rather
cold
.
he
still


laugh
in
his
curious
,
animal
fashion
,
suddenly
wrinkle
up
his
wide


nose
,
and
show
his
sharp
tooth
.
the
fine
beauty
of
his
skin
and
his


complexion
,
some
almost
waxen
quality
,
hide
the
strange
,
repellent


grossness
of
he
,
the
slight
sense
of
putrescence
,
the
commonness
which


reveal
itself
in
his
rather
fat
thigh
and
loin
.




winifred
see
at
once
the
deferential
,
slightly
servile
,
slightly


cunning
regard
he
have
for
Ursula
,
which
make
the
girl
at
once
so
proud


and
so
perplexed
.




"
but
be
this
place
as
awful
as
it
look
?
"
the
young
girl
ask
,
a


strain
in
her
eye
.




"
it
be
just
what
it
look
,
"
he
say
.
"
it
hide
nothing
.
"




"
why
be
the
man
so
sad
?
"




"
be
they
sad
?
"
he
reply
.




"
they
seem
unutterably
,
unutterably
sad
,
"
say
Ursula
,
out
of
a


passionate
throat
.




"
I
do
n’t
think
they
be
that
.
they
just
take
it
for
grant
.
"




"
what
do
they
take
for
grant
?
"




"
this
—
the
pit
and
the
place
altogether
.
"




"
why
do
n’t
they
alter
it
?
"
she
passionately
protest
.




"
they
believe
they
must
alter
themselves
to
fit
the
pit
and
the
place
,


rather
than
alter
the
pit
and
the
place
to
fit
themselves
.
it
be


easy
,
"
he
say
.




"
and
you
agree
with
they
,
"
burst
out
his
niece
,
unable
to
bear
it
.
"
you


think
like
they
do
—
that
live
human
being
must
be
take
and
adapt


to
all
kind
of
horror
.
we
could
easily
do
without
the
pit
.
"




he
smile
,
uncomfortably
,
cynically
.
Ursula
feel
again
the
revolt
of


hatred
from
he
.




"
I
suppose
their
life
be
not
really
so
bad
,
"
say
Winifred
Inger
,


superior
to
the
Zolaesque
tragedy
.




he
turn
with
his
polite
,
distant
attention
.




"
yes
,
they
be
pretty
bad
.

pit

very
deep

hot

Winifred
Inger

he
reply
gravely
.
it

.
now

home
to
face
that
empty
period
between
school
and
possible
marriage
.




at
first
she
think
it
would
be
just
like
holiday
all
the
time
,
she


would
feel
just
free
.
her
soul
be
in
chaos
,
blind
suffering
,
maim
.


she
have
no
will
leave
to
think
about
herself
.
for
a
time
she
must
just


lapse
.




but
very
shortly
she
find
herself
up
against
her
mother
.
her
mother


have
,
at
this
time
,
the
power
to
irritate
and
madden
the
girl


continuously
.
there
be
already
seven
child
,
yet
Mrs.
Brangwen
be


again
with
child
,
the
ninth
she
have
bear
.
one
have
die
of
diphtheria


in
infancy
.




even
this
fact
of
her
mother
’s
pregnancy
enrage
the
eld
girl
.
Mrs.


Brangwen
be
so
complacent
,
so
utterly
fulfil
in
her
breeding
.
she


would
not
have
the
existence
at
all
of
anything
but
the
immediate
,


physical
,
common
thing
.
Ursula
inflame
in
soul
,
be
suffer
all
the


anguish
of
youth
’s
reach
for
some
unknown
ordeal
,
that
it
ca
n’t


grasp
,
ca
n’t
even
distinguish
or
conceive
.
madden
,
she
be
fight


all
the
darkness
she
be
up
against
.
and
part
of
this
darkness
be
she


mother
.
to
limit
,
as
her
mother
do
,
everything
to
the
ring
of
physical


consideration
,
and
complacently
to
reject
the
reality
of
anything


else
,
be
horrible
.
not
a
thing
do
Mrs.
Brangwen
care
about
,
but
the


child
,
the
house
,
and
a
little
local
gossip
.
and
she
_
would
not
_
be


touch
,
she
would
let
nothing
else
live
near
she
.
she
go
about
,
big


with
child
,
slovenly
,
easy
,
have
a
certain
lax
dignity
,
take
she


own
time
,
please
herself
,
always
,
always
do
thing
for
the


child
,
and
feel
that
she
thereby
fulfil
the
whole
of


womanhood
.




this
long
trance
of
complacent
child
-
bearing
have
keep
she
young
and


undeveloped
.
she
be
scarcely
a
day
old
than
when
Gudrun
be
bear
.


all
these
year
nothing
have
happen
save
the
coming
of
the
child
,


nothing
have
matter
but
the
body
of
her
baby
.
as
her
child
come


into
consciousness
,
as
they
begin
to
suffer
their
own
fulfilment
,
she


cast
they
off
.
but
she
remain
dominant
in
the
house
.
Brangwen


continue
in
a
kind
of
rich
drowse
of
physical
heat
,
in
connection
with


his
wife
.
they
be
neither
of
they
quite
personal
,
quite
define
as


individual
,
so
much
be
they
pervade
by
the
physical
heat
of


breed
and
rear
their
young
.




how
Ursula
resent
it
,
how
she
fight
against
the
close
,
physical
,


limited
life
of
herded
domesticity
!
Calm
,
placid
,
unshakeable
as
ever
,


Mrs.
Brangwen
go
about
in
her
dominance
of
physical
maternity
.




there
be
battle
.
Ursula
would
fight
for
thing
that
matter
to
she
.


she
would
have
the
child
less
rude
and
tyrannical
,
she
_
would
_
have


a
place
in
the
house
.
but
her
mother
pull
she
down
,
pull
she
down
.


with
all
the
cunning
instinct
of
a
breeding
animal
,
Mrs.
Brangwen


ridicule
and
hold
cheap
Ursula
’s
passion
,
her
idea
,
she


pronunciation
.
Ursula
would
try
to
insist
,
in
her
own
home
,
on
the


right
of
woman
to
take
equal
place
with
man
in
the
field
of
action
and


work
.




"
ay
,
"
say
the
mother
,
"
there
’
a
good
crop
of
stocking
lie
ripe
for


mending
.
let
that
be
your
field
of
action
.
"




Ursula
dislike
mending
stocking
,
and
this
retort
madden
she
.
she


hate
her
mother
bitterly
.
after
a
few
week
of
enforce
domestic
life
,


she
have
have
enough
of
her
home
.
the
commonness
,
the
triviality
,
the


immediate
meaninglessness
of
it
all
drive
she
to
frenzy
.
she
talk
and


storm
idea
,
she
correct
and
nag
at
the
child
,
she
turn
she


back
in
silent
contempt
on
her
breeding
mother
,
who
treat
she
with


supercilious
indifference
,
as
if
she
be
a
pretentious
child
not
to
be


take
seriously
.




Brangwen
be
sometimes
drag
into
the
trouble
.
he
love
Ursula
,


therefore
he
always
have
a
sense
of
shame
,
almost
of
betrayal
,
when
he


turn
on
she
.
so
he
turn
fiercely
and
scathingly
,
and
with
a


wholesale
brutality
that
make
Ursula
go
white
,
mute
,
and
numb
.
she


feeling
seem
to
be
becoming
deaden
in
she
,
her
temper
hard
and


cold
.




Brangwen
himself
be
in
one
of
his
state
or
flux
.
after
all
these


year
,
he
begin
to
see
a
loophole
of
freedom
.
for
twenty
year
he
have


go
on
at
this
office
as
a
draughtsman
,
do
work
in
which
he
have
no


interest
,
because
it
seem
his
allotted
work
.
the
grow
up
of
his


daughter
,
their
develop
rejection
of
old
form
set
he
also
free
.




he
be
a
man
of
ceaseless
activity
.
blindly
,
like
a
mole
,
he
push
his


way
out
of
the
earth
that
cover
he
,
work
always
away
from
the


physical
element
in
which
his
life
be
capture
.
slowly
,
blindly
,


gropingly
,
with
what
initiative
be
leave
to
he
,
he
make
his
way


towards
individual
expression
and
individual
form
.




at
last
,
after
twenty
year
,
he
come
back
to
his
woodcarving
,
almost
to


the
point
where
he
have
leave
off
his
Adam
and
Eve
panel
,
when
he
be


court
.
but
now
he
have
knowledge
and
skill
without
vision
.
he
see
the


puerility
of
his
young
conception
,
he
see
the
unreal
world
in
which


they
have
be
conceive
.
he
now
have
a
new
strength
in
his
sense
of


reality
.
he
feel
as
if
he
be
real
,
as
if
he
handle
real
thing
.
he


have
work
for
many
year
at
Cossethay
,
build
the
organ
for
the


church
,
restore
the
woodwork
,
gradually
come
to
a
knowledge
of


beauty
in
the
plain
labour
.
now
he
want
again
to
carve
thing
that


be
utterance
of
himself
.




but
he
could
not
quite
hitch
on
—
always
he
be
too
busy
,
too
uncertain
,


confused
.
Wavering
,
he
begin
to
study
modelling
.
to
his
surprise
he


find
he
could
do
it
.
model
in
clay
,
in
plaster
,
he
produce


beautiful
reproduction
,
really
beautiful
.
then
he
set
-
to
to
make
a


head
of
Ursula
,
in
high
relief
,
in
the
Donatello
manner
.
in
his
first


passion
,
he
get
a
beautiful
suggestion
of
his
desire
.
but
the
pitch
of


concentration
would
not
come
.
with
a
little
ash
in
his
mouth
he
give


up
.
he
continue
to
copy
,
or
to
make
design
by
select
motive
from


classic
stuff
.
he
love
the
Della
Robbia
and
Donatello
as
he
have
love


Fra
Angelico
when
he
be
a
young
man
.
his
work
have
some
of
the


freshness
,
the
naïve
alertness
of
the
early
Italians
.
but
it
be
only


reproduction
.




having
reach
his
limit
in
modelling
,
he
turn
to
painting
.
but
he


try
water
-
colour
painting
after
the
manner
of
any
other
amateur
.
he


get
his
result
but
be
not
much
interested
.
after
one
or
two
drawing


of
his
beloved
church
,
which
have
the
same
alertness
as
his
modelling
,


he
seem
to
be
incongruous
with
the
modern
atmospheric
way
of


painting
,
so
that
his
church
tower
stand
up
,
really
stand
and
assert


its
standing
,
but
be
ashamed
of
its
own
lack
of
meaning
,
he
turn


away
again
.




he
take
up
jewellery
,
read
Benvenuto
Cellini
,
pore
over
reproduction


of
ornament
,
and
begin
to
make
pendant
in
silver
and
pearl
and
matrix
.


the
first
thing
he
do
,
in
his
start
of
discovery
,
be
really


beautiful
.
those
later
be
more
imitative
.
but
,
start
with
his


wife
,
he
make
a
pendant
each
for
all
his
womenfolk
.
then
he
make
ring


and
bracelet
.




then
he
take
up
beat
and
chisel
metal
work
.
when
Ursula
leave


school
,
he
be
make
a
silver
bowl
of
lovely
shape
.
how
he
delight


in
it
,
almost
lust
after
it
.




all
this
time
his
only
connection
with
the
real
outer
world
be
through


his
winter
evening
class
,
which
bring
he
into
contact
with
state


education
.
about
all
the
rest
,
he
be
oblivious
,
and
entirely


indifferent
—
even
about
the
war
.
the
nation
do
not
exist
to
he
.
he
be


in
a
private
retreat
of
his
own
,
that
have
neither
nationality
,
nor
any


great
adherent
.




Ursula
watch
the
newspaper
,
vaguely
,
concern
the
war
in
South


Africa
.
they
make
she
miserable
,
and
she
try
to
have
as
little
to
do


with
they
as
possible
.
but
Skrebensky
be
out
there
.
he
send
she
an


occasional
post
-
card
.
but
it
be
as
if
she
be
a
blank
wall
in
his


direction
,
without
window
or
outgoing
.
she
adhere
to
the
Skrebensky


of
her
memory
.




her
love
for
Winifred
Inger
wrench
her
life
as
it
seem
from
the


root
and
native
soil
where
Skrebensky
have
belong
to
it
,
and
she
be


aridly
transplant
.
he
be
really
only
a
memory
.
she
revive
his


memory
with
strange
passion
,
after
the
departure
of
Winifred
.
he
be
to


she
almost
the
symbol
of
her
real
life
.
it
be
as
if
,
through
he
,
in


he
,
she
might
return
to
her
own
self
,
which
she
be
before
she
have


love
Winifred
,
before
this
deadness
have
come
upon

so
she

she
must
take
her
freedom
where
she
could
.




on
Friday
her
father
say
there
be
a
place
vacant

this
could
most
probably

secure
for
she

quarter

she
have
have
a
taste
of
the
common
child
of
Ilkeston
.
they
have


shout
after
she
and
throw
stone
.
still
,
as
a
teacher
,
she
would
be


in
authority
.
and
it
be
all
unknown
.
she
be
excited
.
the
very
forest


of
dry
,
sterile
brick

some
fascination
for
she
.
it
be
so
hard

ugly
,
so
relentlessly
ugly
,
it
would
purge
she
of
some
of
her
float


sentimentality
.




she
dream
how
she
would
make
the
little
,

.
she


would
be
so

personal
.

teacher
be
always
so
hard
and
impersonal
.


there
be
no
vivid
relationship
.
she
would
make
everything
personal
and


vivid
,
she
would
give
herself
,
she
would
give
,
give
,
give
all
her
great


store
of
wealth
to
her
child
,
she
would
make
they
so
happy
,
and


they
would
prefer
she
to
any
teacher
on
the
face
of
the
earth
.




at
Christmas
she
would
choose
such
fascinating
Christmas
card
for


they
,

she
would
give
they
such
a
happy
party
in
one
of
the


class

the
headmaster

Mr.
Harby
,
be
a
short
,
thick
-
set
,
rather
common
man
,


she
think
.
but
she
would
hold
before
he
the
light
of
grace
and


refinement
,
he
would
have
she
in
such
high
esteem
before
long
.
she


would
be
the
gleam
sun
of
the
school
,
the
child
would
blossom


like
little
weed
,
the
teacher
like
tall
,
hard
plant
would
burst
into


rare
flower
.




the
Monday
morning
come

forward
to
the
new
land
.
the
old
be
blot
out

the
veil
would
be
rent
that
hide
the
new
world

she
be
grip
hard


with
suspense
as
she

down
the
hill
in
the
rain
,
carry
she


dinner

through
the
thin
rain
she
see
the
town
,
a
black
,
extensive
mount
.
she


must
enter
in
upon
it
.
she
feel
at
once
a
feeling
of
repugnance
and
of


excited
fulfilment
.
but
she
shrink
.




she
wait
at
the
terminus

a
small
baby
.
behind
she

ripe
on
the
hedge
.




as
she
wait
at
the
tram

terminus
she
revert
swiftly
to
she


childhood
;
her
tease
grandfather
,
with
his
fair
beard
and
blue
eye
,


and
his
big
,
monumental
body
;

have
got

her
grandmother

Ursula

sometimes
say
she
have
love
more
than
anyone

in
the


world
:
the
little
church
school

a
soldier


in
the
Life

one
be
a
collier
.
with
a
passion
she
cling
to


the
past
.




but
as
she
dream
of
it
,
she
hear
the
tram

car
grind
round
a
bend
,


rumble
dully
,
she
see
it
draw
into
sight
,
and
hum
near
.
it
sidle


round
the
loop
at
the
terminus
,
and
come
to
a
standstill
,
loom
above


she

some
shadowy
grey
people
step
from
the
far
end
,
the
conductor


be
walk
in
the
puddle
,
swinge
round
the
pole
.




she
mount
into
the
wet
,
comfortless
tram
,
whose
floor
be
dark
with


wet
,
whose
window
be
all
steamed
,
and
she

a
sort
of
charwoman
with
a
drab
,
wet
coat
.


Ursula
could
not
bear
the
waiting
of
the
tram
.
the
bell
clang
,
there


be
a
lurch
forward
.

cautiously
down
the
wet
street

into
her
new
existence
.
her
heart

with
pain
and
suspense
,
as
if
something
be

living
tissue

often
,
oh
often
the
tram
seem
to
stop
,
and
wet
,
cloak
people


mount
and
sit
mute
and
grey
in
stiff
row
opposite
she
,
their


umbrella
between
their
knee
.
the
window
of
the
tram
grow
more


steamy
;
opaque
.
she
be
shut
in
with
these
unliving
,
spectral
people
.


even
yet
it
do
not
occur
to
she
that
she

one
of
they

little
ring
of
his
clipper

a
pang
of
dread
through

but
her
ticket

terrible
grip
upon

and
which
now
so
fill
she
with
dread
and
dislike
,
that
she
wish
she


might
go
away
.
this
be
the
reality
,
and
Cossethay
,
her
beloved
,


beautiful
,
wellknown
Cossethay
,
which
be
as

.
this
prison
of
a

here
,
then
,
she


would
sit
in
state
,
the
queen
of
scholar
!
here
she
would
realize
she


dream
of
be
the
beloved
teacher
bring
light
and
joy
to
she


child
!
but
the
desk
before

have
an
abstract
angularity
that


bruise
her
sentiment
and
make
she
shrink
.
she
wince
,
feel
she
have


be
a
fool
in
her
anticipation
.
she
have
bring
her

queer
to


feel
that
one
ought
to
alter
one
’s
personality
.
she
be
nobody
,
there


be
no
reality
in

,
the
reality
be
all
outside

she


must
apply
herself
to
it

actively
unaware
of
another
person
,
so
occupied
.




when
he
have
a
moment
of

up
from

pleasant
light
in

"

stand
back
.
no
one
take
any


further
notice
of
she
.
she
beat
her
brain
for
something
to
say
,
but
in


vain
.




"

to
the

the

and
threatening
,
so
unreal
,
that


she
waver
,
become
neutral
and
non

existent
.
but
he
stand
there


watch
with
the
listening
-
genial
smile
of
the
eye
,
that
be
really


threaten
;
he
say
nothing
,
he
make
she
go
on
teaching
,
she
feel
she


have
no
soul
in
her
body
.
then
he
go
away
,
and
his
going
be
like
a


derision
.
the
class
be
his
class
.
she
be
a
waver
substitute
.
he


thrash
and
bully
,
he
be
hate
.
but
he
be
master
.
though
she
be


gentle
and
always
considerate
of
her
class
,
yet
they
belong
to
Mr.


Harby
,
and
they
do
not
belong
to
she
.
like
some
invincible
source
of


the
mechanism
he
keep
all
power
to
himself
.
and
the
class
own
his


power
.
and
in
school
it
be
power
,
and
power
alone
that
matter
.




soon
Ursula
come
to
dread
he
,
and
at
the
bottom
of
her
dread
be
a


seed
of
hate
,
for
she
despise
he
,
yet
he
be
master
of
she
.
then
she


begin
to
get
on
.
all
the
other
teacher
hate
he
,
and
fan
their


hatred
among
themselves
.
for
he
be
master
of
they
and
the
child
,
he


stand
like
a
wheel
to
make
absolute
his
authority
over
the
herd
.
that


seem
to
be
his
one
reason
in
life
,
to
hold
blind
authority
over
the


school
.
his
teacher
be
his
subject
as
much
as
the
scholar
.
only
,


because
they
have
some
authority
,
his
instinct
be
to
detest
they
.




Ursula
could
not
make
herself
a
favourite
with
he
.
from
the
first


moment
she
set
hard
against
he
.
she
set
against
Violet
Harby
also
.
Mr.


Harby
be
,
however
,
too
much
for
she
,
he
be
something
she
could
not


come
to
grip
with
,
something
too
strong
for
she
.
she
try
to
approach


he
as
a
young
,
bright
girl
usually
approach
a
man
,
expect
a


little
chivalrous
courtesy
.
but
the
fact
that
she
be
a
girl
,
a
woman
,


be
ignore
or
use
as
a
matter
for
contempt
against
she
.
she
do
not


know
what
she
be
,
nor
what
she
must
be
.
she
want
to
remain
her
own


responsive
,
personal
self
.




so
she
teach
on
.
she
make
friend
with
the
Standard
Three
teacher
,


Maggie
Schofield
.
Miss
Schofield
be
about
twenty
year
old
,
a
subdue


girl
who
hold
aloof
from
the
other
teacher
.
she
be
rather
beautiful
,


meditative
,
and
seem
to
live
in
another
,
lovely
world
.




Ursula
take
she
dinner
to
school
,
and
during
the

by
itself
and
have


window
on

,
look
on
to
the

.
it
be
a
passionate


relief
to
find
such
a
retreat
in
the
jarring
school
.
for
there
be


pot
of
chrysanthemum
and
coloured
leave
,
and
a
big
jar
of

an


air
of
intimacy
;
so
that
the
room
,
with
its
window
space
,
its
small
,


tidier
desk
,
its
touch
of
picture
and
flower
,
make
Ursula
at
once


glad
.
here
at
last
be
a
little
personal
touch
,
to
which
she
could


respond
.




it
be

.


she
look
forward
to
have
dinner
with
Maggie
.
that
be
the
bright


spot
in
the
day
.
Maggie
be
so
strong
and
remote
,
walk
with
slow
,


sure
step
down
a
hard
road
,
carry
the
dream
within
she
.
Ursula
go


through
the

must

learn
on
fifty

five
reluctant
child

have
all


the
time
an
ugly
,
rude
jealousy
behind
she

ready
to
throw
she
to
the


mercy
of
the
herd
of
child
,
who
would
like
to
rend
she
as
a
weak


representative
of
authority
.
a
great
dread
of
her
task
possess
she
.


she
see
Mr.
Brunt
,
Miss
Harby
,
Miss
Schofield
,
all
the
school
-
teacher
,


drudge
unwillingly
at
the
graceless
task
of
compelling
many
child


into
one
discipline
,
mechanical
set
,
reduce
the
whole
set
to
an


automatic
state
of
obedience
and
attention
,
and
then
of
command


their
acceptance
of
various
piece
of
knowledge
.
the
first
great
task


be
to
reduce
sixty
child
to
one
state
of
mind
,
or
be
.
this
state


must
be
produce
automatically
,
through
the
will
of
the
teacher
,
and


the
will
of
the
whole
school
authority
,
impose
upon
the
will
of
the


child
.
the
point
be
that
the
headmaster
and
the
teacher
should


have
one
will
in
authority
,
which
should
bring
the
will
of
the
child


into
accord
.
but
the
headmaster
be
narrow
and
exclusive
.
the
will
of


the
teacher
could
not
agree
with
his
,
their
separate
will
refuse
to


be
so
subordinated
.
so
there
be
a
state
of
anarchy
,
leave
the
final


judgment
to
the
child
themselves
,
which
authority
should
exist
.




so
there
exist
a
set
of
separate
will
,
each
strain
itself
to
the


utmost
to
exert
its
own
authority
.
child
will
never
naturally


acquiesce
to
sit
in
a
class
and
submit
to
knowledge
.
they
must


be
compel
by
a
strong
,
wise
will
.
against
which
will
they
must


always
strive
to
revolt
.
so
that
the
first
great
effort
of
every


teacher
of
a
large
class
must
be
to
bring
the
will
of
the
child
into


accordance
with
his
own
will
.
and
this
he
can
only
do
by
an
abnegation


of
his
personal
self
,
and
an
application
of
a
system
of
law
,
for
the


purpose
of
achieve
a
certain
calculable
result
,
the
imparting
of


certain
knowledge
.
whereas
Ursula
think
she
be
go
to
become
the


first
wise
teacher
by
make
the
whole
business
personal
,
and
use
no


compulsion
.
she
believe
entirely
in
her
own
personality
.




so
that
she
be
in
a
very
deep
mess
.
in
the
first
place
she
be


offer
to
a
class
a
relationship
which
only
one
or
two
of
the


child
be
sensitive
enough
to
appreciate
,
so
that
the
mass
be


leave
outsider
,
therefore
against
she
.
secondly
,
she
be
place


herself
in
passive
antagonism
to
the
one
fix
authority
of
Mr.
Harby
,


so
that
the
scholar
could
more
safely
harry
she
.
she
do
not
know
,
but


her
instinct
gradually
warn
she
.
she
be
torture
by
the
voice
of
Mr.


brunt
.
on
it
go
,
jarring
,
harsh
,
full
of
hate
,
but
so
monotonous
,
it


nearly
drive
she
mad
:
always
the
same
set
,
harsh
monotony
.
the
man
be


become
a
mechanism
work
on
and
on
and
on
.
but
the
personal
man
be


in
subdue
friction
all
the
time
.
it
be
horrible
—
all
hate
!
must
she
be


like
this
?
she
could
feel
the
ghastly
necessity
.
she
must
become
the


same
—
put
away
the
personal
self
,
become
an
instrument
,
an
abstraction
,


work
upon
a
certain
material
,
the
class
,
to
achieve
a
set
purpose
of


make
they
know
so
much
each
day
.
and
she
could
not
submit
.
yet


gradually
she
feel
the
invincible
iron
close
upon
she
.
the
sun
be


be
block
out
.
often
when
she
go
out
at
playtime
and
see
a


luminous
blue
sky
with
change
cloud
,
it
seem
just
a
fantasy
,
like


a
piece
of
paint
scenery
.
her
heart
be
so
black
and
tangle
in
the


teaching
,
her
personal
self
be
shut
in
prison
,
abolish
,
she
be


subjugate
to
a
bad
,
destructive
will
.
how
then
could
the
sky
be


shine
?
there
be
no
sky
,
there
be
no
luminous
atmosphere
of


out
-
of
-
door
.
only
the
inside
of
the
school
be
real
—
hard
,
concrete
,


real
and
vicious
.




she
would
not
yet
,
however
,
let
school
quite
overcome
she
.
she
always


say
.
"
it
be
not
a
permanency
,
it
will
come
to
an
end
.
"
she
could


always
see
herself
beyond
the
place
,
see
the
time
when
she
have
leave
it
.


on
sunday
and
on
holiday
,
when
she
be
away
at
Cossethay
or
in
the


wood
where
the
beech
-
leave
be
fall
,
she
could
think
of
St.


Philip
’s
Church
School
,
and
by
an
effort
of
will
put
it
in
the
picture


as
a
dirty
little
low
-
squat
building
that
make
a
very
tiny
mound


under
the
sky
,
while
the
great
beech
-
wood
spread
immense
about
she
,


and
the
afternoon
be
spacious
and
wonderful
.
moreover
the
child
,


the
scholar
,
they
be
insignificant
little
object
far
away
,
oh
,
far


away
.
and
what
power
have
they
over
her
free
soul
?
a
fleeting
thought
of


they
,
as
she
kick
her
way
through
the
beech
-
leave
,
and
they
be


go
.
but
her
will
be
tense
against
they
all
the
time
.




all
the
while
,
they
pursue
she
.
she
have
never
have
such
a
passionate


love
of
the
beautiful
thing
about
she
.
sit
on
top
of
the
tram
-
car
,


at
evening
,
sometimes
school
be
sweep
away
as
she
see
a
magnificent


sky
settle
down
.
and
her
breast
,
her
very
hand
,
clamour
for
the


lovely
flare
of
sunset
.
it
be
poignant
almost
to
agony
,
her
reach


for
it
.
she
almost
cry
aloud
see
the
sundown
so
lovely
.




for
she
be
hold
away
.
it
be
no
matter
how
she
say
to
herself
that


school
exist
no
more
once
she
have
leave
it
.
it
exist
.
it
be
within


she
like
a
dark
weight
,
control
her
movement
.
it
be
in
vain
the


high
-
spirited
,
proud
young
girl
fling
off
the
school
and
its


association
with
she
.
she
be
Miss
Brangwen
,
she
be
Standard
five


teacher
,
she
have
she
most
important
being
in
her
work
now
.




constantly
haunt
she
,
like
a
darkness
hover
over
her
heart
and


threaten
to
swoop
down
over
it
at
every
moment
,
be
the
sense
that


somehow
,
somehow
she
be
bring
down
.
bitterly
she
deny
unto
herself


that
she
be
really
a
schoolteacher
.
leave
that
to
the
Violet
Harbys
.


she
herself
would
stand
clear
of
the
accusation
.
it
be
in
vain
she


deny
it
.




within
herself
some
record
hand
seem
to
point
mechanically
to
a


negation
.
she
be
incapable
of
fulfil
her
task
.
she
could
never
for


a
moment
escape
from
the
fatal
weight
of
the
knowledge
.




and
so
she
feel
inferior
to
Violet
Harby
.
Miss
Harby
be
a
splendid


teacher
.
she
could
keep
order
and
inflict
knowledge
on
a
class
with


remarkable
efficiency
.
it
be
no
good
Ursula
’s
protest
to
herself


that
she
be
infinitely
,
infinitely
the
superior
of
Violet
Harby
.
she


know
that
Violet
Harby
succeed
where
she
fail
,
and
this
in
a
task


which
be
almost
a
test
of
she
.
she
feel
something
all
the
time
wear


upon
she
,
wear
she
down
.
she
go
about
in
these
first
week
try


to
deny
it
,
to
say
she
be
free
as
ever
.
she
try
not
to
feel
at
a


disadvantage
before
Miss
Harby
,
try
to
keep
up
the
effect
of
her
own


superiority
.
but
a
great
weight
be
on
she
,
which
Violet
Harby
could


bear
,
and
she
herself
could

wickedness
in
he

blaze
out
into
evil
rage

so
that
he

it
be


really
intolerable
.
the
jarring
be
torture
to
she
.
she
look
over
the


silent
,
attentive
class
that
seem
to
have
crystallize
into
order
and


rigid
,
neutral
form
.
this
he
have
it
in
his
power
to
do
,
to
crystallize


the
child
into
hard
,
mute
fragment
,
fix
under
his
will
:
his
brute


will
,
which
fix
they
by
sheer
force
.




she
too
must
learn
to
subdue
they
to
her
will

for
it
be
she


duty
,
since
the
school

such
.
he
have
crystallize
the

but
to
see
he

a
strong
,
powerful
man
,
use
all
his
power
for


such
a
purpose
,
seem
almost
horrible
.
there
be
something
hideous


about
it
.
the
strange
,
genial
light
in
his
eye
be
really
vicious
,
and


ugly
,
his
smile
be
one
of
torture
.
he
could
not
be
impersonal
.
he


could
not
have
a
clear
,
pure
purpose
,
he
could
only
exercise
his
own


brute
will
.
he
do
not
believe
in
the
least
in
the
education
he
keep


inflict
year
after
year
upon
the
child
.
so
he
must
bully
,
only


bully
,
even
while
it
torture
his
strong
,
wholesome
nature
with
shame


like
a
spur
always
gall
.
he
be
so
blind

ugly
and
out

Ursula
could
not
bear
it
as
he
stand
there
.
the
whole

be


wrong
and
ugly

the
lesson
be
finish
,
Mr.

away
.
at
the
far
end
of
the

the
whistle
and
the
thud
of
the

.
she
could
not

not
bear
it
when


the

she
feel
that

must
go
out
of

he
should
never

it
be
a

she

only
a
girl

obsess
by
the
fact
that

day
of
passionate
reaction

mad
with
the
taste
of
liberty
,
when
merely
to
be

in
the


morning
,
to
sit
down
at
her

a
passion
of
delight

this
be
only
a
respite
,
as
her
chained
heart
know
well
.
so
that
she


seize
hold
of
the
swift
hour
of
the
week
-
end
,
and
wring
the
last
drop


of
sweetness
out
of
they
,
in
a
little
,
cruel
frenzy
.




she
do
not
tell
anybody
how
this
state
be
a
torture
to
she
.
she
do


not
confide
,
either
to
Gudrun
or
to
her
parent
,
how
horrible
she
find


it
to
be
a
school
-
teacher
.
but
when
Sunday
night

the


Monday
morning
at
hand
,
she

string
up
tight
with
dreadful


anticipation
,
because
the
strain
and
the
torture
be
near
again
.




she
do
not
believe
that
she
could
ever
teach
that
great
,
brutish


class
,
in
that
brutal
school
:
ever
,
ever
.
and
yet
,
if
she
fail
,
she


must
in
some
way
go
under
.
she
must
admit
that
the
man
’s
world
be
too


strong
for
she
,
she
could
not
take
her
place
in
it
;
she
must
go
down


before
Mr.
Harby
.
and
all
her
life
henceforth
,
she
must
go
on
,
never


having
free
herself
of

world
,
never
having
achieve
the


freedom
of

great
world
of

work
.
Maggie

take
she


place
there
,
she
have
even
stand
level
with
Mr.

free
of


he
:
and
her
soul
be
always
wander
in
far
-
off
valley
and
glade
of


poetry
.
Maggie

free
.
yet
there
be
something
like
subjection
in


Maggie
’s
very
freedom
.
Mr.
Harby
,
the
man
,
dislike

envy
and
admire
Maggie
.
she


herself
have
still
to
get
where
Maggie
have
get
.
she
have
still
to
make


her
footing
.
she
have
take
up
a
position
on
Mr.
Harby
’s
ground
,
and
she


must
keep
it
.
for
he
be
now

a
regular
attack
on
she
,
to

.
she
could
not
keep
order
.
her
class


be
a
turbulent
crowd
,
and
the
weak
spot
in
the
school
’s
work
.


therefore
she
must
go
,
and
someone
more
useful
must
come
in
her
place
,


someone
who
could
keep
discipline
.




the
headmaster
have
work
himself
into
an
obsession
of
fury
against


she

which
be
his


very
life
in
school
,
the
outcome
of
his
bodily
movement
,
be

and
threaten
at
the
point
where
Ursula

.
she
be
the


danger
that
threaten
his
body
with
a
blow
,
a
fall
.
and
blindly
,


thoroughly
,
move
from
strong
instinct
of
opposition
,
he
set
to
work


to
expel
she
.




when
he
punish
one
of
her
child
as
he
have

the
boy

for
an
offence
against
_
himself
,
_
he
make
the
punishment
extra
heavy


with
the
significance
that
the
extra
stroke

in
because
of
the
weak


teacher
who
allow
all
these

be
.
when

punish
for
an


offence
against

he
punish
lightly
,
as
if

not
significant
.
which
all
the
child
know
,
and
they
behave


accordingly
.




every
now
and
again
Mr.

would
swoop
down
to
examine
exercise

it
be
true
,
since
she
have
come
,
the
composition

have


grow
more
and
more
untidy

to
those

"
such
a
condition
in
a
class

I
ca
n’t

"




then
in
a
rage
,
he
go
away
with
his
cane
,
leave
Ursula
to
confront


a
pale
,
quiver
class
,
whose
childish
face
be
shut
in
blank


resentment
,
fear
,
and
bitterness
,
whose
soul
be
full
of
anger
and


contempt
for
she
rather
than
of
the
master
,
whose
eye
look
at
she


with
the
cold
,
inhuman
accusation
of
child
.
and
she
could
hardly


make
mechanical
word
to
speak
to
they
.
when
she
give
an
order
they


obey
with
an
insolent
off
-
handedness
,
as
if
to
say
:
"
as
for
you
,
do


you
think
we
would
obey
_
you
,
_
but
for
the
master
?
"
she
send
the


blubber
,
cane
boy
to
their
seat
,
know
that
they
too
jeer
at


she
and
her
authority
,
hold
her
weakness
responsible
for
what


punishment
have
overtake
they
.
and
she
know
the
whole
position
,
so
that


even
her
horror
of
physical
beating
and
suffering
sink
to
a
deep


pain
,
and
become
a
moral
judgment
upon
she
,
bad
than
any
hurt
.




she
must
,
during
the
next
week
,
watch
over
her
book
,
and
punish
any


fault
.
her
soul
decide
it
coldly
.
her
personal
desire
be
dead
for


that
day
at
least
.
she
must
have
nothing
more
of
herself
in
school
.
she


be
to
be
Standard
five
teacher
only
.
that
be
her
duty
.
in
school
,
she


be
nothing
but
Standard
five
teacher
.
Ursula
Brangwen
must
be


exclude
.




so
that
,
pale
,
shut
,
at
last
distant
and
impersonal
,
she
see
no
long


the
child
,
how
his
eye
dance
,
or
how
he
have
a
queer
little
soul
that


could
not
be
bother
with
shape
handwriting
so
long
as
he
dash


down
what
he
think
.
she
see
no
child
,
only
the
task
that
be
to
be


do
.
and
keep
her
eye
there
,
on
the
task
,
and
not
on
the
child
,


she
be
impersonal
enough
to
punish
where
she
could
otherwise
only
have


sympathize
,
understand
,
and
condone
,
to
approve
where
she
would
have


be
merely
uninterested
before
.
but
her
interest
have
no
place
any


more
.




it
be
agony
to
the
impulsive
,
bright
girl
of
seventeen
to
become


distant
and
official
,
have
no
personal
relationship
with
the


child
.
for
a
few
day
,
after
the
agony
of
the
Monday
,
she
succeed
,


and
have
some
success
with
her
class
.
but
it
be
a
state
not
natural
to


she
,
and
she
begin
to
relax
.




then
come
another
infliction
.
there
be
not
enough
pen
to

he
could
read
with
fluency
,

have
plenty
of
cunning
intelligence

he
could

he
have
a
kind
of
sickness
very
repulsive


to
a
sensitive
girl

something
cunning

etiolate
and
degenerate

once

at
this

the
boy
near
snort
with
laughter
.


for
Williams
be
an
actor
,
he
could
tickle
the
feeling
of
his
hearer


subtly
.
particularly
he
could
tickle
the
child
with
he
into


ridicule
his
teacher

feel
too
much
upset

home
,
she

a
little
far
into
the


town
,
and
get
down
from
the
tram
at
a
small
tea

shop
.
there
,
in
the


dark
little
place
behind
the
shop
,

her
tea
and
eat


bread
-
and
-
butter
.
she
do
not
taste
anything
.
the
taking
of
tea
be


just
a
mechanical
action
,
to
cover
over
her
existence
.
there
she
sit
in


the
dark
,
obscure
little
place
,
without

.
there
be
nothing
for
she


there
.
she
have
,
true
,
only
to
pretend
to
be
normal
.
there
be
nobody


she
could
speak
to
,
nowhere
to
go
for
escape
.
but
she
must
keep
on
,


under
this
red
sunset
,
alone
,
know
the
horror
in
humanity
,
that


would
destroy
she
,
and
with
which
she
be
at
war
.
yet

to
herself
.
she

in
the
hand
of
some
big
,


strong
,
coarser
will
.




school
be
fairly
quiet
.
but
she
could
feel
the
class

instinct
be

of
the
class
instinct
to


catch
she
if
she
be
weak
.
but
she

cold
and
be
guard

and
they
would
have


tear
she
to
piece
.
they
choose
Mr.
Harby
.
well
then
,
they
must
know
she


as
well
as
Mr.
Harby
,
they
must
first
be
subjugate
to
she
.
for
she
be


not
go
to
be
make
nought
,
no
,
neither
by
they
,
nor
by
Mr.

,
nor


by

she
.
she
be
not
go
to
be
put
down
,


prevent
from
stand
free
.
it
be
not
to
be
say
of
she
,
she
could


not
take
her
place
and
carry
out
her
task
.
she
would
fight
and
hold
she


place
in
this
state
also
,
in
the
world
of
work
and
man
’s
convention
.




she
be
isolate
now
from
the
life
of
her
childhood
,
a
foreigner
in
a


new
life
,
of
work
and
mechanical
consideration
.
she
and
Maggie
,
in


their
dinner
-
hour
and
their
occasional
tea
at
the
little
restaurant
,


discuss
life
and
idea
.
Maggie
be
a
great
suffragette
,
trust
in


the
vote
.
to
Ursula
the
vote
be
never
a
reality
.
she
have
within
she


the
strange
,
passionate
knowledge
of
religion
and
live
far


transcend
the
limit
of
the
automatic
system
that
contain
the


vote
.
but
her
fundamental
,
organic
knowledge
have
as
yet
to
take
form


and
rise
to
utterance
.
for
she
,
as
for
Maggie
,
the
liberty
of
woman


mean
something
real
and
deep
.
she
feel
that
somewhere
,
in
something
,


she
be
not
free
.
and
she
want
to
be
.
she
be
in
revolt
.
for
once
she


be
free
she
could
get
somewhere
.
ah
,
the
wonderful
,
real
somewhere


that
be
beyond
she
,
the
somewhere
that
she
feel
deep
,
deep
inside
she
.




in
come
out
and
earn
her
own
living
she
have
make
a
strong
,
cruel


move
towards
free
herself
.
but
have
more
freedom
she
only
become


more
profoundly
aware
of
the
big
want
.
she
want
so
many
thing
.
she


want
to
read
great
,
beautiful
book
,
and
be
rich
with
they
;
she


want
to
see
beautiful
thing
,
and
have
the
joy
of
they
for
ever
;
she


want
to
know
big
,
free
people
;
and
there
remain
always
the
want
she


could
put
no
name
to
.




it
be
so
difficult
.
there
be
so
many
thing
,
so
much
to
meet
and


surpass
.
and
one
never
know
where
one
be
go
.
it
be
a
blind
fight
.


she
have
suffer
bitterly
in
this
school
of
St.
Philip
’s
.
she
be
like


a
young
filly
that
have
be
break
in
to
the
shaft
,
and
have
lose
its


freedom
.
and
now
she
be
suffer
bitterly
from
the
agony
of
the


shaft
.
the
agony
,
the
galling
,
the
ignominy
of
she
break
in
.
this


wear
into
her
soul
.
but
she
would
never
submit
.
to
shaft
like
these


she
would
never
submit
for
long
.
but
she
would
know
they
.
she
would


serve
they
that
she
might
destroy
they
.




she
and
Maggie
go
to
all
kind
of
place
together
,
to
big
suffrage


meeting
in
Nottingham
,
to
concert
,
to
theatre
,
to
exhibition
of


picture
.
Ursula
save
her
money
and
buy
a
bicycle
,
and
the
two


girl
ride
to
Lincoln
,
to
Southwell
,
and
into
Derbyshire
.
they
have
an


endless
wealth
of
thing
to
talk
about
.
and
it
be
a
great
joy
,


find
,
discover
.




but
Ursula
never
tell
about
Winifred
Inger
.
that
be
a
sort
of
secret


side
-
show
to
her
life
,
never
to
be
open
.
she
do
not
even
think
of


it
.
it
be
the
closed
door
she
have
not
the
strength
to
open
.




once
she
be
break
in
to
her
teaching
,
Ursula
begin
gradually
to
have


a
new
life
of
her
own
again
.
she
be
go
to
college
in
eighteen


month
’
time
.
then
she
would
take
her
degree
,
and
she
would
—
ah
,
she


would
perhaps
be
a
big
woman
,
and
lead
a
movement
.
who
knows?—At
any


rate
she
would
go
to
college
in
eighteen
month
’
time
.
all
that


matter
now
be
work
,
work
.




and
till
college
,
she
must
go
on
with
this
teaching
in
St.
Philip
’s


School
,
which
be
always
destroy
she
,
but
which
she
could
now


manage
,
without
spoil
all
her
life
.
she
would
submit
to
it
for
a


time
,
since
the
time
have
a
definite
limit
.




the
class
-
teaching
itself
at
last
become
almost
mechanical
.
it
be
a


strain
on
she
,
an
exhausting
wearying
strain
,
always
unnatural
.
but


there
be
a
certain
amount
of
pleasure
in
the
sheer
oblivion
of


teaching
,
so
much
work
to
do
,
so
many
child
to
see
after
,
so
much
to


be
do
,
that
one
’s
self
be
forget
.
when
the
work
have
become
like


habit
to
she
,
and
her
individual
soul
be
leave
out
,
have
its
growth


elsewhere
,
then
she
could
be
almost
happy
.




her
real
,
individual
self
draw
together
and
become
more
coherent
during


these
two
year
of
teaching
,
during
the
struggle
against
the
odd
of


class
teaching
.
it
be
always
a
prison
to
she
,
the
school
.
but
it
be
a


prison
where
her
wild
,
chaotic
soul
become
hard
and
independent
.
when


she
be
well
enough
and
not
tired
,
then
she
do
not
hate
the
teaching
.


she
enjoy
get
into
the
swing
of
work
of
a
morning
,
put
forth


all
her
strength
,
make
the
thing
go
.
it
be
for
she
a
strenuous
form


of
exercise
.
and
her
soul
be
leave
to
rest
,
it
have
the
time
of
torpor


in
which
to
gather
itself
together
in
strength
again
.
but
the
teaching


hour
be
too
long
,
the
task
too
heavy
,
and
the
disciplinary


condition
of
the
school
too
unnatural
for
she
.
she
be
wear
very
thin


and
quiver
.




she
come
to
school
in
the
morning
see
the
hawthorn
flower
wet
,
the


little
,
rosy
grain
swim
in
a
bowl
of
dew
.
the
lark
quiver
their


song
up
into
the
new
sunshine
,
and
the
country
be
so
glad
.
it
be
a


violation
to
plunge
into
the
dust
and
greyness
of
the
town
.




so
that
she
stand
before
her
class
unwilling
to
give
herself
up
to
the


activity
of
teaching
,
to
turn
her
energy
,
that
long
for
the
country


and
for
joy
of
early
summer
,
into
the
dominating
of
fifty
child
and


the
transferring
to
they
some
morsel
of
arithmetic
.
there
be
a
little


absentness
about
she
.
she
could
not
force
herself
into
forgetfulness
.
a


jar
of
buttercup
and
fool’s
-
parsley
in
the
window
-
bottom
keep
she
away


in
the
meadow
,
where
in
the
lush
grass
the
moon
-
daisy
be


half
-
submerge
,
and
a
spray
of
pink
ragged
robin
.
yet
before
she
be


face
of
fifty
child
.
they
be
almost
like
big
daisy
in
a
dimness


of
the
grass
.




a
brightness
be
on
her
face
,
a
little
unreality
in
her
teaching
.
she


could
not
quite
see
her
child
.
she
be
struggle
between
two


world
,
her
own
world
of
young
summer
and
flower
,
and
this
other
world


of
work
.
and
the
glimmer
of
her
own
sunlight
be
between
she
and
she


class
.




then
the
morning
pass
with
a
strange
far
-
awayness
and
quietness
.


dinner
-
time
come
,
when
she
and
Maggie
eat
joyously
,
with
all
the


window
open
.
and
then
they
go
out
into
St.
Philip
’s
churchyard
,


where
be
a
shadowy
corner
under
red
hawthorn
tree
.
and
there
they


talk
and
read
Shelley
or
Browning
or
some
work
about
"
woman
and


labour
"
.




and
when
she
go
back
to
school
,
Ursula
live
still
in
the
shadowy


corner
of
the
graveyard
,
where
pink
-
red
petal
lie
scatter
from
the


hawthorn
tree
,
like
myriad
tiny
shell
on
a
beach
,
and
a
church
bell


sometimes
ring
sonorously
,
and
sometimes
a
bird
call
out
,
whilst


Maggie
’s
voice
go
on
low
and
sweet
.




these
day
she
be
happy
in
her
soul
:
oh
,
she
be
so
happy
,
that
she


wish
she
could
take
her
joy
and
scatter
it
in
armful
broadcast
.
she


make
her
child
happy
,
too
,
with
a
little
tingling
of
delight
.
but
to


she
,
the
child
be
not
a
school
class
this
afternoon
.
they
be


flower
,
bird
,
little
bright
animal
,
child
,
anything
.
they
only


be
not
standard
Five
.
she
feel
no
responsibility
for
they
.
it
be
for


once
a
game
,
this
teaching
.
and
if
they
get
their
sum
wrong
,
what


matter
?
and
she
would
take
a
pleasant
bit
of
reading
.
and
instead
of


history
with
date
,
she
would
tell
a
lovely
tale
.
and
for
grammar
,
they


could
have
a
bit
of
write
analysis
that
be
not
difficult
,
because


they
have
do
it
before
:




"
she
shall
be
sportive
as
a
fawn


that
wild
with
glee
across
the
lawn


or
up
the
mountain
spring
.
"






she
write
that
from
memory
,
because
it
please
she
.




so
the
golden
afternoon
pass
away
and
she
go
home
happy
.
she
have


finish
her
day
of
school
,
and
be
free
to
plunge
into
the
glow


evening
of
Cossethay
.
and
she
love
walk
home
.
but
it
have
not
be


school
.
it
have
be
play
at
school
beneath
red
hawthorn
blossom
.




she
could
not
go
on
like
this
.
the
quarterly
examination
be
come
,


and
her
class
be
not
ready
.
it
irritate
she
that
she
must
drag


herself
away
from
her
happy
self
,
and
exert
herself
with
all
she


strength
to
force
,
to
compel
this
heavy
class
of
child
to
work
hard


at
arithmetic
.
they
do
not
want
to
work
,
she
do
not
want
to
compel


they
.
and
yet
,
some
second
conscience
gnaw
at
she
,
tell
she
the


work
be
not
properly
do
.
it
irritate
she
almost
to
madness
,
and
she


let
loose
all
the
irritation
in
the
class
.
then
follow
a
day
of


battle
and
hate
and
violence
,
when
she
go
home
raw
,
feel
the


golden
evening
take
away
from
she
,
herself
incarcerate
in
some
dark
,


heavy
place
,
and
chain
there
with
a
consciousness
of
having
do


badly
at
work
.




what
good
be
it
that
it
be
summer
,
that
right
till
evening
,
when
the


corncrake
call
,
the
lark
would
mount
up
into
the
light
,
to
sing


once
more
before
nightfall
.
what
good
be
it
all
,
when
she
be
out
of


tune
,
when
she
must
only
remember
the
burden
and
shame
of
school
that


day
.




and
still
,
she
hate
school
.
still
she
cry
,
she
do
not
believe
in


it
.
why
should
the
child
learn
,
and
why
should
she
teach
they
?
it


be
all
so
much
mill
the
wind
.
what
folly
be
it
that
make
life
into


this
,
the
fulfilling
of
some
stupid
,
factitious
duty
?
it
be
all
so


make
up
,
so
unnatural
.
the
school
,
the
sum
,
the
grammar
,
the
quarterly


examination
,
the
register
—
it
be
all
a
barren
nothing
!




why
should
she
give
her
allegiance
to
this
world
,
and
let
it
so


dominate
she
,
that
her
own
world
of
warm
sun
and
grow
,
sap
-
fill


life
be
turn
into
nothing
?
she
be
not
go
to
do
it
.
she
be
not


go
to
be
a
prisoner
in
the
dry
,
tyrannical
man
-
world
.
she
be
not


go
to
care
about
it
.
what
do
it
matter
if
her
class
do
ever
so


badly
in
the
quarterly
examination
.
let
it
—
what
do
it
matter
?




nevertheless
,
when
the
time
come
,
and
the
report
on
her
class
be
bad
,


she
be
miserable
,
and
the
joy
of
the
summer
be
take
away
from
she
,


she
be
shut
up
in
gloom
.
she
could
not
really
escape
from
this
world


of
system
and
work
,
out
into
her
field
where
she
be
happy
.
she
must


have
her
place
in
the
work
world
,
be
a
recognize
member
with
full


right
there
.
it
be
more
important
to
she
than
field
and
sun
and


poetry
,
at
this
time
.
but
she
be
only
the
more
its
enemy
.




it
be
a
very
difficult
thing
,
she
think
,
during
the
long
hour
of


intermission
in
the
summer
holiday
,
to
be
herself
,
her
happy
self
that


enjoy
so
much
to
lie
in
the
sun
,
to
play
and
swim
and
be
content
,
and


also
to
be
a
school
-
teacher
get
result
out
of
a
class
of
child
.


she
dream
fondly
of
the
time
when
she
need
not
be
a
teacher
any
more
.


but
vaguely
,
she
know
that
responsibility
have
take
place
in
she
for


ever
,
and
as
yet
her
prime
business
be
to
work
.




the
autumn
pass
away
,
the
winter
be
at
hand
.
Ursula
become
more
and


more
an
inhabitant
of
the
world
of
work
,
and
of
what
be
call
life
.


she
could
not
see
her
future
,
but
a
little
way
off
,
be
college
,
and
to


the
thought
of
this
she
cling
fixedly
.
she
would
go
to
college
,
and
get


her
two
or
three
year
’
training
,
free
of
cost
.
already
she
have
apply


and
have
her
place
appoint
for
the
coming
year
.




so
she
continue
to
study
for
her
degree
.
she
would
take
French
,
Latin
,


English
,
mathematic
and
botany
.
she
go
to
class
in
Ilkeston
,
she


study
at
evening
.
for
there
be
this
world
to
conquer
,
this
knowledge


to
acquire
,
this
qualification
to
attain
.
and
she
work
with


intensity
,
because
of
a
want
inside
she
that
drive
she
on
.
almost


everything
be
subordinate
now
to
this
one
desire
to
take
her
place
in


the
world
.
what
kind
of
place
it
be
to
be
she
do
not
ask
herself
.
the


blind
desire
drive
she
on
.
she
must
take
her
place
.




she
know
she
would
never
be
much
of
a
success
as
an
elementary
school


teacher
.
but
neither
have
she
fail
.
she
hate
it
,
but
she
have
manage


it
.




Maggie
have
leave
St.
Philip
’s
School
,
and
have
find
a
more
congenial


post
.
the
two
girl
remain
friend
.
they
meet
at
evening
class
,
they


study
and
somehow
encourage
a
firm
hope
each
in
the
other
.
they
do


not
know
whither
they
be
make
,
nor
what
they
ultimately
want
.
but


they
know
they
want
now
to
learn
,
to
know
and
to
do
.




they
talk
of
love
and
marriage
,
and
the
position
of
woman
in


marriage
.
Maggie
say
that
love
be
the
flower
of
life
,
and
blossom


unexpectedly
and
without
law
,
and
must
be
pluck
where
it
be
find
,


and
enjoy
for
the
brief
hour
of
its
duration
.




to
Ursula
this
be
unsatisfactory
.
she
think
she
still
love
Anton


skrebensky
.
but
she
do
not
forgive
he
that
he
have
not
be
strong


enough
to
acknowledge
she
.
he
have
deny
she
.
how
then
could
she
love


he
?
how
then
be
love
so
absolute
?
she
do
not
believe
it
.
she


believe
that
love
be
a
way
,
a
mean
,
not
an
end
in
itself
,
as
Maggie


seem
to
think
.
and
always
the
way
of
love
would
be
find
.
but
whither


do
it
lead
?




"
I
believe
there
be
many
man
in
the
world
one
might
love
—
there
be
not


only
one
man
,
"
say
Ursula
.




she
be
think
of
Skrebensky
.
her
heart
be
hollow
with
the
knowledge


of
Winifred
Inger
.




"
but
you
must
distinguish
between
love
and
passion
,
"
say
Maggie
,


add
,
with
a
touch
of
contempt
:
"
man
will
easily
have
a
passion
for


you
,
but
they
wo
n’t
love
you
.
"




"
yes
,
"
say
Ursula
,
vehemently
,
the
look
of
suffering
,
almost
of


fanaticism
,
on
her
face
.
"
passion
be
only
part
of
love
.
and
it
seem
so


much
because
it
ca
n’t
last
.
that
be
why
passion
be
never
happy
.
"




she
be
staunch
for
joy
,
for
happiness
,
and
permanency
,
in
contrast


with
Maggie
,
who
be
for
sadness
,
and
the
inevitable
passing
-
away
of


thing
.
Ursula
suffer
bitterly
at
the
hand
of
life
,
Maggie
be


always
single
,
always
withhold
,
so
she
go
in
a
heavy
brooding
sadness


that
be
almost
meat
to
she
.
in
Ursula
’s
last
winter
at
St.
Philip
’s


the
friendship
of
the
two
girl
come
to
a
climax
.
it
be
during
this


winter
that
Ursula
suffer
and
enjoy
most
keenly
Maggie
’s


fundamental
sadness
of
enclosedness
.
Maggie
enjoy
and
suffer


Ursula
’s
struggle
against
the
confine
of
her
life
.
and
then
the
two


girl
begin
to
drift
apart
,
as
Ursula
break
from
that
form
of
life


wherein
Maggie
must
remain
enclose

year
old
.
he

very
tall
,
but


strong
and
well

with
brown

sunny
,
easy
eye
and
a

because

to
she
when
she
come


near
.
she
could
make
their
eye
light
up
and
quiver
,
she
could
make


Anthony
,
the
eld
,
twist
and
twist
his
moustache
.
she
know
she
could


move
they
almost
at
will
with
her
light
laughter
and
chatter
.
they


love
her
idea
,
watch
she
as
she
talk
vehemently
about
politic
or


economic
.
and
she
,
while
she
talk
,
see
the
golden
-
brown
eye
of


Anthony
gleam
like
the
eye
of
a
satyr
as
they
watch
she
.

not


listen
to
her
word
,
he
listen
to
she
.
it
excite
she
.




he
be
like
a
faun
pleased
when
she
would
go
with
he
over
his


hothouse
,
to
look
at
the
green
and
pretty
plant
,
at
the
pink
primula


nod
among
their
leave
,
and
cinarria
flaunt
purple
and
crimson


and
white
.
she
ask
about
everything
,
and
he
tell
she
very
exactly
and


minutely
,
in
a
queer
pedantic
way
that
make
she
want
to
laugh
.
yet
she


be
really
interested
in
what
he
do
.
and
he
have
the
curious
light
in


his
face
,
like
the
light
in
the
eye
of
the
goat
that
be
tether
by


the
farmyard
gate
.




she
go
down
with
he
into
the
warmish
cellar
,
where
already
in
the


darkness
the
little
yellow
knob
of
rhubarb
be
come
.
he
hold
the


lantern
down
to
the
dark
earth
.
she
see
the
tiny
knob
-
end
of
the


rhubarb
thrust
upwards
upon
the
thick
red
stem
,
thrust
itself


like
a
knob
of
flame
through
the
soft
soil
.
his
face
be
turn
up
to


she
,
the
light
glitter
on
his
eye
and
his
tooth
as
he
laugh
,
with


a
faint
,
musical
neigh
.
he
look
handsome
.
and
she
hear
a
new
sound


in
her
ear
,
the
faintly
-
musical
,
neigh
laugh
of
Anthony
,
whose


moustache
twist
up
,
and
whose
eye
be
luminous
with
a
cold
,
steady
,


arrogant
-
laugh
glare
.
there
seem
a
little
prance
of
triumph
in
his


movement
,
she
could
not
rid
herself
of
a
movement
of
acquiescence
,
a


touch
of
acceptance
.
yet
he
be
so
humble
,
his
voice
be
so
caressing
.


he
hold
his
hand
for
she
to
step
on
when
she
must
climb
a
wall
.
and
she


step
on
the
live
firmness
of
he
,
that
quiver
firmly
under
she


weight
.




she
be
aware
of
he
as
if
in
a
mesmeric
state
.
in
her
ordinary
sense
,


she
have
nothing
to
do
with
he
.
but
the
peculiar
ease
and


unnoticeableness
of
his
enter
the
house
,
the
power
of
his
cold
,


gleam
light
on
she
when
he
look
at
she
,
be
like
a
bewitchment
.
in


his
eye
,
as
in
the
pale
grey
eye
of
a
goat
,
there
seem
some
of
that


steady
,
hard
fire
of
moonlight
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
day
.
it


make
she
alert
,
and
yet
her
mind

out
like
an
extinguished
thing
.


she
be
all
sense
,
all
her
sense

alive
.




then
she
see
he
on
Sunday
,
dress
up
in
Sunday
clothe
,
try
to


impress

and
he
look
ridiculous
.
she
clung
to
the
ridiculous


effect
of
his
stiff
,
Sunday
clothe
.




she
be
always
conscious
of
some
unfaithfulness
to
Maggie
,
on
Anthony
’s


score
.
Poor
Maggie

apart
as

affection
and
a
poignancy
of
pity
.
which
Maggie

with
a
little


stiffness
.
then

the
place
of

they
take
the
key
of
the

and
wander
into
the
park
.

be
a


white
world
on
which

in
its
unawareness
.




Ursula

a
robin
glance

bright
eye
and

into


the
hedge
,

a


traveller
,
she

an


isolate
creature

in
the
fulfilment
of

a
traveller
.
she
know
Anthony
,
that


he

but
oh
,
ultimately
and
finally

must
go
on
and
on
,


seek
the
goal

.
she
see
herself
travel
round
a


circle
,
only
an
arc
of
which
remain
to

.
then
,
she
be
in
the


open
,
like
a
bird

Brangwen
have
keep
his
carelessness
about

work
in
the
lace
designing
mean
little
to

,
always


grope
on
.




when

of
the
post


as

work
instructor
,
post
about
to
be
create
by
the
Nottingham


Education
Committee
,
it
be
as
if
a
space
have
be
give
to
he
,
into


which
he
could
remove
from
his
hot
,
dusky
enclosure
.
he
send
in
his


application
,
confidently
,
expectantly
.
he
have
a
sort
of
belief
in
his


supernatural
fate
.
the
inevitable
weariness
of
his
daily
work
have


stiffen
some
of
his
muscle
,
and
make
a
slight
deadness
in
his
ruddy
,


alert
face
.
now
he
might
escape
.




he
be
full
of
the
new
possibility
,
and
his
wife
be
acquiescent
.
she


be
willing
now
to
have
a
change
.
she
too
be
tired
of
Cossethay
.
the


house
be
too
small
for
the
grow
child
.
and
since
she
be
nearly


forty
year
old
,
she
begin
to
come
awake
from
her
sleep
of
motherhood
,


her
energy
move
more
outward
.
the
din
of
grow
life
rouse
she


from
her
apathy
.
she
too
must
have
her
hand
in
make
life
.
she
be


quite
ready
to
move
,
take
all
her
brood
.
it
would
be
well
now
if


she
transplant
they
.
for
she
have
bear
her
last
child
,
it
would
be


grow
up
.




so
that
in
her
easy
,
unused
fashion
she
talk
plan
and
arrangement


with
her
husband
,
indifferent
really
as
to
the
method
of
the
change
,


since
a
change
be
come
;
even
if
it
do
not
come
in
this
way
it
would


come
in
another
.




the
house
be
full
of
ferment
.
Ursula
be
wild
with
excitement
.
at
last


her
father
be
go
to
be
something
,
socially
.
so
long
,
he
have
be
a


social
cypher
,
without
form
or
standing
.
now
he
be
go
to
be
art
and


Handwork
instructor
for
the
County
of
Nottingham
.
that
be
really
a


status
.
it
be
a
position
.
he
would
be
a
specialist
in
his
way
.
and
he


be
an
uncommon
man
.
Ursula
feel
they
be
all
get
a

who
else
that

could
turn
out


from
his
own
finger
the
beautiful
thing
her
father
could
produce
?
she


feel
he
be
certain
of
this
new
job
.




they
would
move
.
they
would
leave
this
cottage
at
Cossethay
which
have


grow
too
small
for
they
;
they
would
leave
Cossethay
,
where
the


child
have
all
be
bear
,
and
where
they
be
always
keep
to
the
same


measure
.
for
the
people
who
have
know
they
as
child
along
with
the


other
village
boy
and
girl
would
never
,
could
never
understand
that


they
should
grow
up
different
.
they
have
hold
"
Urtler
Brangwen
"
one
of


themselves
,
and
have
give
she
her
place
in
her
native
village
,
as
in
a


family
.
and
the
bond
be
strong
.
but
now
,
when
she
be
grow
to


something
beyond
what
Cossethay
would
allow
or
understand
,
the
bond


between
she
and
her
old
associate
be
become
a
bondage
.




"
'
ello
,
urs’ler
,
'
ow
be
yer
goin’
on
?
"
they
say
when
they
meet
she
.


and
it
demand
of
she
in
the
old
voice
the
old
response
.
and
something


in
she
must
respond
and
belong
to
people
who
know
she
.
but
something


else
deny
bitterly
.
what
be
true
of
she
ten
year
ago
be
not
true


now
.
and
something
else
which
she
be
,
and
must
be
,
they
could
neither


see
nor
allow
.
they
feel
it
there
nevertheless
,
something
beyond
they
,


and
they
be
injure
.
they
say
she
be
proud
and
conceited
,
that
she


be
too
big
for
her
shoe
nowadays
.
they
say
,
she
need
n’t
pretend
,


because
they
know
what
she
be
.
they
have
know
she
since
she
be
bear
.


they
quote
this
and
that
about
she
.
and
she
be
ashamed
because
she


do
feel
different
from
the
people
she
have
live
amongst
.
it
hurt
she


that
she
could
not
be
at
her
ease
with
they
any
more
.
and
yet
—
and


yet
—
one
’s
kite
will
rise
on
the
wind
as
far
as
ever
one
have
string
to


let
it
go
.
it
tug
and
tug
and
will
go
,
and
one
be
glad
the
furth
it


go
,
even
it
everybody
else
be
nasty
about
it
.
so
Cossethay
hamper


she
,
and
she
want
to
go
away
,
to
be
free
to
fly
her
kite
as
high
as


she
like
.
she
want
to
go
away
,
to
be
free
to
stand
straight
up
to


her
own
height
.




so
that
when
she
know
that
her
father
have
the
new
post
,
and
that
the


family
would
move
,
she
feel
like
skip
on
the
face
of
the
earth
,
and


make
psalm
of
joy
.
the
old
,
bound
shell
of
Cossethay
be
to
be
cast


off
,
and
she
be
to
dance
away
into
the
blue
air
.
she
want
to
dance


and
sing
.




she
make
dream
of
the
new
place
she
would
live
in
,
where
stately


cultured
people
of
high
feeling
would
be
friend
with
she
,
and
she


would
live
with
the
noble
in
the
land
,
move
to
a
large
freedom
of


feeling
.
she
dream
of
a
rich
,
proud
,
simple
girl
-
friend
,
who
have


never
know
Mr.
Harby
and
his
like
,
nor
ever
have
a
note
in
her
voice
of


bondage
contempt
and
fear
,
as
Maggie
have
.




and
she
give
herself
to
all
that
she
love
in
Cossethay
,
passionately
,


because
she
be
go
away
now
.
she
wander
about
to
her
favourite


spot
.
there
be
a
place
where
she
go
trespassing
to
find
the


snowdrop
that
grow
wild
.
it
be
evening
and
the
winter
-
darken


meadow
be
full
of
mystery
.
when
she
come
to
the
wood
an
oak
tree


have
be
newly
chop
down
in
the
dell
.
pale
drop
of
flower


glimmer
many
under
the
hazel
,
and
by
the
sharp
,
golden
splinter
of


wood
that
be
splash
about
,
the
grey
-
green
blade
of
snowdrop
leave


pricked
unheeding
,
the
drooping
still
little
flower
be
without
heed
.




Ursula
pick
some
lovingly
,
in
an
ecstasy
.
the
golden
chip
of
wood


shine
yellow
like
sunlight
,
the
snowdrop
in
the
twilight
be
like
the


first
star
of
night
.
and
she
,
alone
amongst
they
,
be
wildly
happy
to


have
find
her
way
into
such
a
glimmer
dusk
,
to
the
intimate
little


flower
,
and
the
splash
of
wood
chip
like
sunshine
over
the
twilight


of
the
ground
.
she
sit
down
on
the
felled
tree
and
remain
awhile


remote
.




go
home
,
she
leave
the
purplish
dark
of
the
tree
for
the
open
lane
,


where
the
puddle
shine
long
and
jewel
-
like
in
the
rut
,
the
land
about


she
be
darken
,
and
the
sky
a
jewel
overhead
.
oh
,
how
amazing
it
be


to
she
!
it
be
almost
too
much
.
she
want
to
run
,
and
sing
,
and
cry


out
for
very
wildness
and
poignancy
,
but
she
could
not
run
and
sing
and


cry
out
in
such
a
way
as
to
cry
out
the
deep
thing
in
her
heart
,
so


she
be
still
,
and
almost
sad
with
loneliness
.




at
Easter
she
go
again
to
Maggie
’s
home
,
for
a
few
day
.
she
be
,


however
shy
and
fugitive
.
she
see
Anthony
,
how
suggestive
he
be
to


look
on
,
and
how
his
eye
have
a
sort
of
supplicate
light
,
that
be


rather
beautiful
.
she
look
at
he
,
and
she
look
again
,
for
he
to


become
real
to
she
.
but
it
be
her
own
self
that
be
occupy


elsewhere
.
she
seem
to
have
some
other
being
.




and
she
turn
to
spring
and
the
opening
bud
.
there
be
a
large
pear


tree
by
a
wall
,
and
it
be
full
,
throng
with
tiny
,
grey
-
green
bud
,


myriad
.
she
stand
before
it
arrest
with
delight
,
and
a
realization


go
deep
into
her
heart
.
there
be
so
great
a
host
in
array
behind
the


cloud
of
pale
,
dim
green
,
so
much
to
come
forth
—
so
much
sunshine
to


pour
down
.




so
the
week
pass
on
,
trance
-
like
and
pregnant
.
the
pear
tree
at


Cossethay
burst
into
bloom
against
the
cottage
-
end
,
like
a
wave
burst


into
foam
.
then
gradually
the
bluebell
come
,
blue
as
water
standing


thin
in
the
level
place
under
the
tree
and
bush
,
flow
in
more


and
more
,
till
there
be
a
flood
of
azure
,
and
pale
-
green
leave


burn
,
and
tiny
bird
with
fiery
little
song
and
flight
.
then
swiftly


the
flood
sink
and
be
go
,
and
it
be
summer
.




there
be
to

Ursula

rather
sad
.
instead
of
having
arrive
at
distinction
they


have
come
to
new
red
-
brick
suburbia
in
a
grimy
,
small
town
.




Mrs.
Brangwen
be
happy
.
the

be
splendidly
large
—
a
splendid


dining
-
room
,
drawing
-
room
and
kitchen
,
besides
a
very
pleasant
study


downstairs
.
everything
be
admirably
appoint
.
the

have
settle


herself
in
lavishly
.
she
be
a
native
of

reign
almost
queen
.
her

of
oak
,
her

massive
and
oaken
,
with
bulging
,


columnar
support
.




"
good
and
substantial
,
"
be
the
keynote
.
but
Ursula
resent
the
stout
,


inflated
prosperity
imply
everywhere
.
she
make
her
father
promise
to


chisel
down
the
bulge
oaken
chimney
-
piece
,
chisel
they
flat
.
that


sort
of
important
paunch
be
very
distasteful
to
she
.
her
father
be


himself
long
and
loosely
build
.
what
have
he

do
with
so
much
"

they
buy
a
fair
amount
also
of
the
widow
’s
furniture
.
it
be
in


common
good
taste
—
the
great
Wilton
carpet
,
the
large
round
table
,
the


Chesterfield
cover
with
glossy
chintz
in
rose
and
bird
.
it
be
all


really
very
sunny
and
nice
,
with
large
window
,
and
a
view
right
across


the
shallow
valley
.




after
all
,
they
would
be
,
as
one
of
their
acquaintance
say
,
among
the


elite
of
Beldover
.
they
would
represent
culture
.
and
as
there
be
no


one
of
high
social
importance
than
the
doctor
,
the


colliery
-
manager
,
and
the
chemist
,
they
would
shine
,
with
their
Della


Robbia
beautiful
Madonna
,
their
lovely
relief
from
Donatello
,
their


reproduction
from
Botticelli
.
nay
,
the
large
photograph
of
the

Aphrodite
and
the
Nativity
in
the
dining
-
room
,
the


ordinary
reception
-
room
,
would
make
dumb
the
mouth
of
Beldover
.




and
after
all
,
it
be
well
to
be
princess
in
Beldover
than
a
vulgar


nobody
in
the
country
.




there
be
great
preparation
make
for

and
the
freedom

.
it
be
as
if
the
wall
of
the


school
be
go
to
melt
away
.
already
they

be
break

.
soon

chiming
of


the
big
church
bell
,
so
much
harsh
and
more
insistent
than

they
look
through
the
window
past

she
be
a
great
strapping
,
bold


hussy
,
indifferent
to
all
high
claim
.
she
would
stay
at
home
.
the


other
be
at
school
,
except
the
young
.
when
term
start
,
they


would
all
be
transfer
to
the
Grammar
School
at
Willey
Green
.




Ursula
be
excite
at
make
acquaintance
in
Beldover
.
the
excitement


soon
pass
.
she
have
tea
at
the
clergyman
’s
,
at
the
chemist
’s
,
at
the


other
chemist
’s
,
at
the
doctor
’s
,
at
the
under
-
manager’s
—
then
she
know


practically
everybody
.
she
could
not
take
people
very
seriously
,
though


at
the
time
she
want
to
.




she
wander
the
country
,
on
foot
and
on
her
bicycle
,
find
it
very


beautiful
in
the
forest
direction
,
between
Mansfield
and
Southwell
and


Worksop
.
but
she
be
here
only
skirmish
for
amusement
.
her
real


exploration
would
begin
in
college
.




term
begin
.
she
go
into
town
each
day
by
train
.
the
cloister
quiet


of
the
college
begin
to
close
around
she
.




she
be
not
at
first
disappointed
.
the
big
college
build
of
stone
,


stand
in
the
quiet
street
,
with
a
rim
of
grass
and
lime
tree
all
so


peaceful
:
she
feel
it
remote
,
a
magic
land
.
its
architecture
be


foolish
,
she
know
from
her
father
.
still
,
it
be
different
from
that
of


all
other
building
.
its
rather
pretty
,
playthe
,
gothic
form
be


almost
a
style
,
in
the
dirty
industrial
town
.




she
like
the
hall
,
with
its
big
stone
chimney
-
piece
and
its
Gothic


arch
support
the
balcony
above
.
to
be
sure
the
arch
be
ugly
,


the
chimney
-
piece
of
cardboard
-
like
carve
stone
,
with
its
armorial


decoration
,
look
silly
just
opposite
the
bicycle
stand
and
the


radiator
,
whilst
the
great
notice
-
board
with
its
flutter
paper


seem
to
slam
away
all
sense
of
retreat
and
mystery
from
the
far
wall
.


nevertheless
,
amorphous
as
it
might
be
,
there
be
in
it
a
reminiscence


of
the
wondrous
,
cloistral
origin
of
education
.
her
soul
fly
straight


back
to
the
mediæval
time
,
when
the
monk
of
God
hold
the
learning
of


man
and
impart
it
within
the
shadow
of
religion
.
in
this
spirit
she


enter
college
.




the
harshness
and
vulgarity
of
the
lobby
and
cloak
-
room
hurt
she
at


first
.
why
be
it
not
all
beautiful
?
but
she
could
not
openly
admit
she


criticism
.
she
be
on
holy
ground
.




she
want
all
the
student
to
have
a
high
,
pure
spirit
,
she
want


they
to
say
only
the
real
,
genuine
thing
,
she
want
their
face
to
be


still
and
luminous
as
the
nun
'
and
the
monk
’
face
.




alas
,
the
girl
chatter
and
giggle
and
be
nervous
,
they
be


dress
up
and
frizzed
,
the
man
look
mean
and
clownish
.




still
,
it
be
lovely
to
pass
along
the
corridor
with
one
’s
book
in


one
’s
hand
,
to
push
the
swinging
,
glass
-
panel
door
,
and
enter
the


big
room
where
the
first
lecture
would
be
give
.
the
window
be
large


and
lofty
,
the
myriad
brown
student
’
desk
stand
wait
,
the
great


blackboard
be
smooth
behind
the
rostrum
.




Ursula
sit
beside
her
window
,
rather
far
back
.
look
down
,
she
see


the
lime
tree
turn
yellow
,
the
tradesman
’s
boy
pass
silent
down


the
still
,
autumn
-
sunny
street
.
there
be
the
world
,
remote
,
remote
.




here
,
within
the
great
,
whisper
sea
-
shell
,
that
whisper
all
the


while
with
reminiscence
of
all
the
century
,
time
fade
away
,
and
the


echo
of
knowledge
fill
the
timeless
silence
.




she
listen
,
she
scribble
her
note
with
joy
,
almost
with
ecstasy
,


never
for
a
moment
criticize
what
she
hear
.
the
lecturer
be
a


mouth
-
piece
,
a
priest
.
as
he
stand
,
black
-
gown
,
on
the
rostrum
,
some


strand
of
the
whispering
confusion
of
knowledge
that
fill
the
whole


place
seem
to
be
single
out
and
weave
together
by
he
,
till
they


become
a
lecture
.




at
first
,
she
preserve
herself
from
criticism
.
she
would
not
consider


the
professor
as
man
,
ordinary
man
who
eat
bacon
,
and
pull
on
their


boot
before
come
to
college
.
they
be
the
black
-
gown
priest
of


knowledge
,
serve
for
ever
in
a
remote
,
hush
temple
.
they
be
the


initiate
,
and
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
the
mystery
be
in
their


keep
.




curious
joy
she
have
of
the
lecture
.
it
be
a
joy
to
hear
the
theory
of


education
,
there
be
such
freedom
and
pleasure
in
range
over
the
very


stuff
of
knowledge
,
and
see
how
it
move
and
live
and
have
its


be
.
how
happy
Racine
make
she
!
she
do
not
know
why
.
but
as
the
big


line
of
the
drama
unfold
themselves
,
so
steady
,
so
measured
,
she


feel
a
thrill
as
of
be
in
the
realm
of
the
reality
.
of
Latin
,
she


be
do
Livy
and
Horace
.
the
curious
,
intimate
,
gossip
tone
of
the


latin
class
suit
Horace
.
yet
she
never
care
for
he
,
nor
even
Livy
.


there
be
an
entire
lack
of
sternness
in
the
gossipy
class
-
room
.
she


try
hard
to
keep
her
old
grasp
of
the
roman
spirit
.
but
gradually
the


Latin
become
mere
gossip
-
stuff
and
artificiality
to
she
,
a
question
of


manner
and
verbosity
.




her
terror
be
the
mathematic
class
.
the
lecturer
go
so
fast
,
she


heart
beat
excitedly
,
she
seem
to
be
strain
every
nerve
.
and
she


struggle
hard
,
during
private
study
,
to
get
the
stuff
into
control
.




then
come
the
lovely
,
peaceful
afternoon
in
the
botany
laboratory
.


there
be
few
student
.
how
she
love
to
sit
on
her
high
stool
before


the
bench
,
with
her
pith
and
her
razor
and
her
material
,
carefully


mount
her
slide
,
carefully
bring
her
microscope
into

,
then

record
her
observation
,
draw
joyfully
in
she


book
,
if
the
slide
be
good
.




she
soon
make
a
college
friend
,
a
girl
who
have
live
in
Florence
,
a


girl
who
wear
a
wonderful
purple
or
figured
scarf
drape
over
a
plain
,


dark
dress
.
she

Dorothy
Russell
,
daughter
of
a
south
-
country


advocate
.
Dorothy
live
with
a
maiden
aunt
in
Nottingham
,
and
spend
she


spare
moment
slaving
for
the
Women
’s
Social
and
Political
Union
.
she


be
quiet
and
intense
,
with
an
ivory
face
and
dark
hair
loop
plain


over
her
ear
.
Ursula
be
very
fond
of
she
,
but
afraid
of
she
.
she


seem
so
old
and
so
relentless
towards
herself
.
yet
she
be
only


twenty
-
two
.
Ursula
always
feel
she
to
be
a
creature
of
fate
,
like


Cassandra
.




the
two
girl
have
a
close
,
stern
friendship
.
Dorothy
work
at
all


thing
with
the
same
passion
,
never
spare
herself
.
she
come
close


to
Ursula
during
the
botany
hour
.
for
she
could
not
draw
.
Ursula
make


beautiful
and
wonderful
drawing
of
the
section
under
the
microscope
,


and
Dorothy
always
come
to
learn
the
manner
of
the
drawing
.




so
the
first
year
go
by
,
in
magnificent
seclusion
and
activity
of


learn
.
it
be
strenuous
as
a
battle
,
her
college
life
,
yet
remote
as


peace
.




she
come
to
Nottingham
in
the
morning
with
Gudrun
.
the
two
sister
be


distinguish
wherever
they
go
,
slim
,
strong
girl
,
eager
and


extremely
sensitive
.
Gudrun
be
the
more
beautiful
of
the
two
,
with
she


sleepy
,
half
-
languid
girlishness
that
look
so
soft
,
and
yet
be


balanced
and
inalterable
underneath
.
she
wear
soft
,
easy
clothing
,
and


hat
which
fall
by
themselves
into
a
careless
grace
.




Ursula
be
much
more
carefully
dress
,
but
she
be
self
-
conscious
,


always
fall
into
depth
of
admiration
of
somebody
else
,
and


model
herself
upon
this
other
,
and
so
produce
a
hopeless


incongruity
.
when
she
dress
for
practical
purpose
she
always
look


well
.
in
winter
,
wear
a
tweed
coat
-
and
-
skirt
and
a
small
hat
of


black
fur
pull
over
her
eager
,
palpitant
face
,
she
seem
to
move


down
the
street
in
a
drift
motion
of
suspense
and
exceed


sensitive
receptivity
.




at
the
end
of
the
first
year
Ursula
get
through
her
Intermediate
Arts


examination
,
and
there
come
a
lull
in
her
eager
activity
.
she


slacken
off
,
she
relax
altogether
.
wear
nervous
and
inflammable
by


the
excitement
of
the
preparation
for
the
examination
,
and
by
the
sort


of
exaltation
which
carry
she
through
the
crisis
itself
,
she
now
fall


into
a
quiver
passivity
,
she
will
all
loosen
.




the
family
go
to
scarborough
for
a
month
.
Gudrun
and
the
father
be


busy
at
the
handicraft
holiday
school
there
,
Ursula
be
leave
a
good


deal
with
the
child
.
but
when
she
could
,
she
go
off
by
herself
.




she
stand
and
look
out
over
the
shine
sea
.
it
be
very
beautiful
to


she
.
the
tear
rise
hot
in
her
heart
.




out
of
the
far
,
far
space
there
drift
slowly
in
to
she
a
passionate
,


unborn
yearning
.
"
there
be
so
many
dawn
that
have
not
yet
rise
.
"
it


seem
as
if
,
from
over
the
edge
of
the
sea
,
all
the
unrisen
dawn
be


appeal
to
she
,
all
her
unborn
soul
be
cry
for
the
unrisen
dawn
.




as
she
sat
look
out
at
the
tender
sea
,
with
its
lovely
,
swift


glimmer
,
the
sob
rise
in
her
breast
,
till
she
catch
her
lip
suddenly


under
her
tooth
,
and
the
tear
be
force
themselves
from
she
.
and
in


her
very
sob
,
she
laugh
.
why
do
she
cry
?
she
do
not
want
to
cry
.
it


be
so
beautiful
that
she
laugh
.
it
be
so
beautiful
that
she
cry
.




she
glance
apprehensively
round
,
hope
no
one
would
see
she
in
this


state
.




then
come
a
time
when
the
sea
be
rough
.
she
watch
the
water


travel
in
to
the
coast
,
she
watch
a
big
wave
run
unnoticed
,


to
burst
in
a
shock
of
foam
against
a
rock
,
envelop
all
in
a
great


white
beauty
,
to
pour
away
again
,
leave
the
rock
emerge
black
and


teem
.
oh
,
and
if
,
when
the
wave
burst
into
whiteness
,
it
be
only


set
free
!




sometimes
she
loiter
along
the
harbour
,
look
at
the
sea
-
brown


sailor
,
who
,
in
their
close
blue
jersey
,
lounge
on
the
harbour
-
wall
,


and
laugh
at
she
with
impudent
,
communicative
eye
.




there
be
establish
a
little
relation
between
she
and
they
.
she
never


would
speak
to
they
or
know
any
more
of
they
.
yet
as
she
walk
by
and


they
lean
on
the
sea
-
wall
,
there
be
something
between
she
and
they
,


something
keen
and
delightful
and
painful
.
she
like
well
the
young
one


whose
fair
,
salty
hair
tumble
over
his
blue
eye
.
he
be
so
new
and


fresh
and
salt
and
not
of
this
world
.




from
Scarborough

go
to
her
Uncle
Tom

.
Winifred
have
a
small


baby
,
bear
at
the
end
of
the
summer
.
she
have
become
strange
and
alien


to
Ursula
.
there
be
an
unmentionable
reserve
between
the
two
woman
.


Tom
Brangwen
be
an
attentive
father
,
a
very
domestic
husband
.
but


there
be
something
spurious
about
his
domesticity
,
Ursula
do
not
like


he
any
more
.
something
ugly
,
blatant
in
his
nature
have
come
out
now
,


make
he
shift
everything
over
to
a
sentimental
basis
.
a


materialistic
unbeliever
,
he
carry
it
all
off
by
become
full
of


human
feeling
,
a
warm
,
attentive
host
,
a
generous
husband
,
a
model


citizen
.
and
he
be
clever
enough
to
rouse
admiration
everywhere
,
and


to
take
in
his
wife
sufficiently
.
she
do
not
love
he
.
she
be
glad
to


live
in
a
state
of
complacent
self
-
deception
with
he
,
she
work


accord
to
he
.




Ursula
be
relieve
to
go
home
.
she
have
still
two
peaceful
year
before


she
.
her
future
be
settle
for
two
year
.
she
return
to
college
to


prepare
for
her
final
examination
.




but
during
this
year
the
glamour
begin
to
depart
from
college
.
the


professor
be
not
priest
initiate
into
the
deep
mystery
of
life


and
knowledge
.
after
all
,
they
be
only
middle
-
man
handle
ware
they


have
become
so
accustomed
to
that
they
be
oblivious
of
they
.
what
be


latin?—so
much
dry
good
of
knowledge
.
what
be
the
latin
class


altogether
but
a
sort
of
second
-
hand
curio
shop
,
where
one
buy


curio
and
learn
the
market
-
value
of
curio
;
dull
curio
too
,
on
the


whole
.
she
be
as
bore
by
the
latin
curiosity
as
she
be
by
Chinese


and
japanese
curiosity
in
the
antique
shop
.
"
antiques”—the
very
word


make
her
soul
fall
flat
and
dead
.




the
life
go
out
of
her
study
,
why
,
she
do
not
know
.
but
the
whole


thing
seem
sham
,
spurious
;
spurious
gothic
arch
,
spurious
peace
,


spurious
Latinity
,
spurious
dignity
of
France
,
spurious
naïveté
of


chaucer
.
it
be
a
second
-
hand
dealer
’s
shop
,
and
one
buy
an


equipment
for
an
examination
.
this
be
only
a
little
side
-
show
to
the


factory
of
the
town
.
gradually
the
perception
steal
into
she
.
this


be
no
religious
retreat
,
no
perception
of
pure
learning
.
it
be
a


little
apprentice
-
shop
where
one
be
far
equip
for
make
money
.


the
college
itself
be
a
little
,
slovenly
laboratory
for
the
factory
.




a
harsh
and
ugly
disillusion
come
over
she
again
,
the
same
darkness
and


bitter
gloom
from
which
she
be
never
safe
now
,
the
realization
of
the


permanent
substratum
of
ugliness
under
everything
.
as
she
come
to
the


college
in
the
afternoon
,
the
lawn
be
froth
with
daisy
,
the
lime


tree
hang
tender
and
sunlit
and
green
;
and
oh
,
the
deep
,
white
froth


of
the
daisy
be
anguish
to
see
.




for
inside
,
inside
the
college
,
she
know
she
must
enter
the
sham


workshop
.
all
the
while
,
it
be
a
sham
store
,
a
sham
warehouse
,
with
a


single
motive
of
material
gain
,
and
no
productivity
.
it
pretend
to


exist
by
the
religious
virtue
of
knowledge
.
but
the
religious
virtue
of


knowledge
be
become
a
flunkey
to
the
god
of
material
success
.




a
sort
of
inertia
come
over
she
.
mechanically
,
from
habit
,
she
go
on


with
her
study
.
but
it
be
almost
hopeless
.
she
could
scarcely
attend


to
anything
.
at
the
Anglo
-
Saxon
lecture
in
the
afternoon
,
she
sit


look
down
,
out
of
the
window
,
hear
no
word
,
of
Beowulf
or
of


anything
else
.
down
below
,
in
the
street
,
the
sunny
grey
pavement
go


beside
the
palisade
.
a
woman
in
a
pink
frock
,
with
a
scarlet
sunshade
,


cross
the
road
,
a
little
white
dog
run
like
a
fleck
of
light


about
she
.
the
woman
with
the
scarlet
sunshade
come
over
the
road
,
a


lilt
in
her
walk
,
a
little
shadow
attend
she
.
Ursula
watch


spell

.
the

and
the
flickering


terri

—
and
whither

in
what
world
of
reality
be
the
woman
in
the
pink
dress
walk
?
to


what
warehouse
of
dead
unreality
be
she
herself
confine
?




what
good
be
this
place
,
this
college
?
what
good
be
Anglo
-
Saxon
,
when


one
only
learn
it
in
order
to
answer
examination
question
,
in
order


that
one
should
have
a
high
commercial
value
later
on
?
she
be
sick


with
this
long
service
at
the
inner
commercial
shrine
.
yet
what
else


be
there
?
be
life
all
this
,
and
this
only
?
everywhere
,
everything
be


debase
to
the
same
service
.
everything
go
to
produce
vulgar
thing
,


to
encumber
material
life
.




suddenly
she
throw
over
French
.
she
would
take
honour
in
botany
.
this


be
the
one
study
that
live
for
she
.
she
have
enter
into
the
life
of


the
plant
.
she
be
fascinate
by
the
strange
law
of
the
vegetable


world
.
she
have
here
a
glimpse
of
something
work
entirely
apart
from


the
purpose
of
the
human
world
.




College
be
barren
,
cheap
,
a
temple
convert
to
the
most
vulgar
,
petty


commerce
.
have
she
not
go
to
hear
the
echo
of
learn
pulse
back
to


the
source
of
the
mystery?—the
source
of
mystery
!
and
barrenly
,
the


professor
in
their
gown
offer
commercial
commodity
that
could

to
good
account
in
the
examination
room
;
ready
-
make
stuff
too
,


and
not
really
worth
the
money
it
be
intend
to
fetch
;
which
they
all


know
.




all
the
time
in
the
college
now
,
save
when
she
be
labour
in
she


botany
laboratory
,
for
there
the
mystery
still
glimmer
,

feel
she


be
degrade
herself
in
a
kind
of
trade
of

.




angry
and
stiff
,

go
through
her
last
term
.
she
would
rather
be


out
again
earn
her
own
living
.
even
Brinsley
Street
and
Mr.
Harby


seem
real
in
comparison
.
her
violent
hatred
of
the
Ilkeston
School


be
nothing
compare
with
the
sterile
degradation
of
college
.
but
she


be
not
go
back
to
Brinsley
Street
either
.
she
would
take
she
B.A.
,


and
become
a
mistress
in
some
Grammar
School
for
a
time
.




the
last
year
of
her
college
career
be
wheel
slowly
round
.
she


could
see
ahead
her
examination
and
her
departure
.
she
have
the
ash
of


disillusion
grit
under
her
tooth
.
would
the
next
move
turn
out
the


same
?
always
the
shine
doorway
ahead
;
and
then
,
upon
approach
,
always


the
shine
doorway
be
a
gate
into
another
ugly
yard
,
dirty
and
active


and
dead
.
always
the
crest
of
the
hill
gleaming
ahead
under
heaven
:
and


then
,
from
the
top
of
the
hill
only
another
sordid
valley
full
of


amorphous
,
squalid
activity
.




no
matter
!
every
hill
-
top
be
a
little
different
,
every
valley
be


somehow
new
.
Cossethay
and
her
childhood
with
her
father
;

the
little
Church

the
dance
in
the
moonlight
between
the
fire
;
then
the


time
she
could
not
think
of
without
be
blast
,
Winifred
Inger
,
and


the
month
before
become
a

teacher
;
then
the
horror
of


Brinsley
Street
,
lapse
into
comparative
peacefulness
,
Maggie
,
and


Maggie
’s
brother
,
whose
influence
she
could
still
feel
in
her
vein
,


when

conjure
he
up
;
then
college
,
and
Dorothy

,
who
be


now
in

then
the
next
move
into
the
world
again
!




already
it
be
a
history
.
in
every
phase
she
be
so
different
.
yet
she


be
always
Ursula
Brangwen
.
but
what
do
it
mean
,
Ursula
Brangwen
?
she


do
not
know
what
she
be
.
only
she
be
full
of
rejection
,
of
refusal
.


always
,
always
she
be
spit
out
of
her
mouth
the
ash
and
grit
of


disillusion
,
of
falsity
.
she
could
only
stiffen
in
rejection
,
in


rejection
.
she
seem
always
negative
in
her
action
.




that
which
she
be
,
positively
,
be
dark
and
unreveale
,
it
could
not


come
forth
.
it
be
like
a
seed
bury
in
dry
ash
.
this
world
in
which


she
live
be
like
a
circle
light
by
a
lamp
.
this
light
area
,
light


up
by
man
’s
complete
consciousness
,
she
think
be
all
the
world
:


that
here
all
be
disclose
for
ever
.
yet
all
the
time
,
within
the


darkness
she
have
be
aware
of
point
of
light
,
like
the
eye
of
wild


beast
,
gleam
,
penetrate
,
vanish
.
and
her
soul
have
acknowledge


in
a
great
heave
of
terror
only
the
outer
darkness
.
this
inner
circle


of
light
in
which
she
live
and
move
,
wherein
the
train
rush
and


the
factory
ground
out
their
machine
-
produce
and
the
plant
and
the


animal
work
by
the
light
of
science
and
knowledge
,
suddenly
it


seem
like
the
area
under
an
arc
-
lamp
,
wherein
the
moth
and
child


play
in
the
security
of
blind
light
,
not
even
know
there
be


any
darkness
,
because
they
stay
in
the
light
.




but
she
could
see
the
glimmer
of
dark
movement
just
out
of
range
,
she


see
the
eye
of
the
wild
beast
gleam
from
the
darkness
,
watch
the


vanity
of
the
camp
fire
and
the
sleeper
;
she
feel
the
strange
,
foolish


vanity
of
the
camp
,
which
say
"
beyond
our
light
and
our
order
there
be


nothing
,
"
turn
their
face
always
inward
towards
the
sink
fire
of


illuminate
consciousness
,
which
comprise
sun
and
star
,
and
the


creator
,
and
the
System
of
Righteousness
,
ignore
always
the
vast


darkness
that
wheel
round
about
,
with
half
-
reveal
shape
lurk
on


the
edge
.




yea
,
and
no
man
dare
even
throw
a
firebrand
into
the
darkness
.
for
if


he
do
he
be
jeered
to
death
by
the
other
,
who
cry
"
fool
,


anti
-
social
knave
,
why
would
you
disturb
we
with
bogey
?
there
_
be
_
no


darkness
.
we
move
and
live
and
have
our
be
within
the
light
,
and


unto
we
be
give
the
eternal
light
of
knowledge
,
we
comprise
and


comprehend
the
innermost
core
and
issue
of
knowledge
.
fool
and
knave
,


how
dare
you
belittle
we
with
the
darkness
?
"




nevertheless
the
darkness
wheel
round
about
,
with
grey
shadow
-
shape


of
wild
beast
,
and
also
with
dark
shadow
-
shape
of
the
angel
,
whom


the
light
fence
out
,
as
it
fence
out
the
more
familiar
beast
of


darkness
.
and
some
,
have
for
a
moment
see
the
darkness
,
see
it


bristle
with
the
tuft
of
the
hyena
and
the
wolf
;
and
some
have


give
up
their
vanity
of
the
light
,
having
die
in
their
own
conceit
,


see
the
gleam
in
the
eye
of
the
wolf
and
the
hyena
,
that
it
be
the


flash
of
the
sword
of
angel
,
flash
at
the
door
to
come
in
,
that
the


angel
in
the
darkness
be
lordly
and
terrible
and
not
to
be
deny
,


like
the
flash
of
fang
.




it
be
a
little
while
before
Easter
,
in
her
last
year
of
college
,
when


Ursula
be
twenty
-
two
year
old
,
that
she
hear
again
from
Skrebensky
.


he
have
write
to
she
once
or
twice
from
South
Africa
,
during
the
first


month
of
his
service
out
there
in
the
war
,
and
since
have
send
she
a


post
-
card
every
now
and
then
,
at
ever
long
interval
.
he
have
become
a


first
lieutenant
,
and
have
stay
out
in
Africa
.
she
have
not
hear
of


he
now
for
more
than
two
year
.




often
her
thought
return
to
he
.
he
seem
like
the
gleaming
dawn
,


yellow
,
radiant
,
of
a
long
,
grey
,
ashy
day
.
the
memory
of
he
be
like


the
thought
of
the
first
radiant
hour
of
morning
.
and
here
be
the


blank
grey
ashiness
of
later
daytime
.
ah
,
if
he
have
only
remain
true


to
she
,
she
might
have
know
the
sunshine
,
without
all
this
toil
and


hurt
and
degradation
of
a
spoiled
day
.
he
would
have
be
her
angel
.
he


hold
the
key
of
the
sunshine
.
still
he
hold
they
.
he
could
open
to
she


the
gate
of
succeed
freedom
and
delight
.
nay
,
if
he
have
remain


true
to
she
,
he
would
have
be
the
doorway
to
she
,
into
the
boundless


sky
of
happiness
and
plunge
,
inexhaustible
freedom
which
be
the


paradise
of
her
soul
.
ah
,
the
great
range
he
would
have
open
to
she
,


the
illimitable
endless
space
for
self
-
realization
and
delight
for


ever
.




the
one
thing
she
believe
in
be
in
the
love
she
have
hold
for
he
.
it


remain
shine
and
complete
,
a
thing
to
hark
back
to
.
and
she
say
to


herself
,
when
present
thing
seem
a
failure
:




"
ah
,
I
_
be
_
fond
of
he
,
"
as
if
with
he
the
lead
flower
of
she


life
have
die
.




now
she
hear
from
he
again
.
the
chief
effect
be
pain
.
the
pleasure
,


the
spontaneous
joy
be
not
there
any
long
.
but
she
_
will
_
rejoice
.


her
will
have
fix
itself
to
he
.
and
the
old
excitement
of
her
dream


stir
and
wake
up
.
he
be
come
,
the
man
with
the
wondrous
lip
that


could
send
the
kiss
waver
to
the
very
end
of
all
space
.
be
he
come


back
to
she

do
not
believe

closely
and
rapidly
.
she

on
her
slide
some
special
stuff
come
up
from
London
that
day
,

the
professor
be
fussy
and
excited
about
it
.
at
the

time
,
as
she


focus
the
light
on
her
field
,
and
see
the
plant

animal
lie
shadowy


in
a
boundless
light

over
a
conversation
she

have


a
few
day
ago
with
Dr.

a
woman

in
the
college
.




"
no
,
really
,
"
Dr.
Frankstone
have
say
,
"
I
do
n’t
see
why
we
should


attribute
some
special
mystery
to
life
—
do
you
?
we
do
n’t
understand
it


as
we
understand
electricity
,
even
,
but
that
do
n’t
warrant
our
say


it
be
something
special
,
something
different
in
kind
and
distinct
from


everything
else
in
the
universe
—
do
you
think
it
do
?
may
it
not
be


that
life
consist
in
a
complexity
of
physical
and
chemical
activity
,


of
the
same
order
as
the
activity
we
already
know
in
science
?
I
do
n’t


see
,
really
,
why
we
should
imagine
there
be
a
special
order
of
life
,


and
life
alone
—
—
"




the
conversation
have
end
on
a
note
of
uncertainty
,
indefinite
,


wistful
.
but
the
purpose
,
what
be
the
purpose
?
Electricity
have
no


soul
,
light
and
heat
have
no
soul
.
be
she
herself
an
impersonal
force
,


or
conjunction
of
force
,
like
one
of
these
?
she
look
still
at
the


unicellular
shadow
that
lie
within
the
field
of
light
,
under
she


microscope
.
it
be
alive
.
she
see
it
move
—
she
see
the
bright
mist
of


its
ciliary
activity
,
she
see
the
gleam
of
its
nucleus
,
as
it
slide


across
the
plane
of
light
.
what
then
be
its
will
?
if
it
be
a


conjunction
of
force
,
physical
and
chemical
,
what
hold
these
force


unified
,
and
for
what
purpose
be
they
unified
?




for
what
purpose
be
the
incalculable
physical
and
chemical
activity


nodalize
in
this
shadowy
,
move
speck
under
her
microscope

what
be


the
will
which
nodalize
they
and
create
the
one
thing
she
see
?
what


be
its
intention

to
be
itself
?
be
its
purpose
just
mechanical
and


limited
to
itself
?




it
intend
to
be
itself
.
but
what
self
?
suddenly
in
her
mind
the
world


gleam
strangely
,
with
an
intense
light
,
like
the
nucleus
of
the


creature
under
the
microscope

suddenly
she
have
pass
away
into
an


intensely
-
gleam
light
of
knowledge
.
she
could
not
understand
what
it


all
be
.
she
only
know
that
it
be
not
limited
mechanical
energy
,
nor


mere
purpose
of
self
-
preservation
and

.
it
be
a


consummation
,
a

a

to

it
would
be
a
new
beginning
.
she
must
hurry
.




she
flit
down
the
corridor
on
swift
foot
,
her
razor
and
note
-
book


and
pencil
in
one
hand
,
she
pinafore
over
her
arm
.
her
face
be
lift


and
tense
with
eagerness
.
he
might
not

issue
from
the
corridor
,
she
see
he
at
once
.
she
know
he
at
once
.


yet
he
be
so
strange
.
he
stand
with
the
curious
self
-
effacing


diffidence
which
so
frighten
she
in
well
-
breed
young
man
whom
she


know
.
he
stand
as
if
he
wish
to
be
unseen
.
he
be
very
well
-
dress
.


she
would
not
admit
to
herself
the
chill
like
a
sunshine
of
frost
that


come
over
she
.
this
be
he
,
the
key
,
the
nucleus
to
the
new
world
.




he
see
she
come
swiftly
across
the
hall
,
a
slim
girl
in
a
white


flannel
blouse
and
dark
skirt
,
with
some
of
the
abstraction
and
gleam


of
the
unknown
upon
she
,
and
he
start
,
excited
.
he
be
very
nervous
.


other
student
be
loiter
about
the
hall
.




she
laugh
,
with
a
blind
,
dazzle
face
,
as
she
give
he
her
hand
.
he


too
could
not
perceive
she
.




in
a
moment
she
be
go
,
to
get
her
outdoor
thing
.
then
again
,
as


when
she
have
be
at
school
,
they
walk
out
into
the
town
to
tea
.
and


they
go
to
the
same
tea
-
shop
.




she
know
a
great
difference
in
he
.
the
kinship
be
there
,
the
old


kinship
,
but
he
have
belong
to
a
different
world
from
hers
.
it
be
as


if
they
have
cry
a
state
of
truce
between
he
and
she
,
and
in
this


truce
they
have
meet
.
she
know
,
vaguely
,
in
the
first
minute
,
that
they


be
enemy
come
together
in
a
truce
.
every
movement
and
word
of
his


be
alien
to
her
being
.




yet
still
she
love
the
fine
texture
of
his
face
,
of
his
skin
.
he
be


rather
browner
,
physically
strong
.
he
be
a
man
now
.
she
think
his


manliness
make
the
strangeness
in
he
.
when
he
be
only
a
youth
,
fluid
,


he
be
near
to
she
.
she
think
a
man
must
inevitably
set
into
this


strange
separateness
,
cold
otherness
of
be
.
he
talk
,
but
not
to


she
.
she
try
to
speak
to
he
,
but
she
could
not
reach
he
.




he
seem
so
balanced
and
sure
,
he
make
such
a
confident
presence
.
he


be
a
great
rider
,
so
there
be
about
he
some
of
a
horseman
’s
sureness


and
habitual
definiteness
of
decision
,
also
some
of
the
horseman
’s


animal
darkness
.
yet
his
soul
be
only
the
more
wavering
,
vague
.
he


seem
make
up
of
a
set
of
habitual
action
and
decision
.
the


vulnerable
,
variable
quick
of
the
man
be
inaccessible
.
she
know


nothing
of
it
.
she
could
only
feel
the
dark
,
heavy
fixity
of
his
animal


desire
.




this
dumb
desire
on
his
part
have
bring
he
to
she
?
she
be
puzzle
,


hurt
by
some
hopeless
fixity
in
he
,
that
terrify
she
with
a
cold


feeling
of
despair
.
what
do
he
want
?
his
desire
be
so
underground
.


why
do
he
not
admit
himself
?
what
do
he
want
?
he
want
something


that
should
be
nameless
.
she
shrink
in
fear
.




yet
she
flash
with
excitement
.
in
his
dark
,
subterranean
male
soul
,


he
be
kneel
before
she
,
darkly
expose
himself
.
she
quiver
,
the


dark
flame
run
over
she
.
he
be
wait
at
her
foot
.
he
be
helpless
,


at
her
mercy
.
she
could
take
or
reject
.
if
she
reject
he
,
something


would
die
in
he
.
for
he
it
be
life
or
death
.
and
yet
,
all
must
be


keep
so
dark
,
the
consciousness
must
admit
nothing
.




"
how
long
,
"
she
say
,
"
be
you
stay
in
England

"




"
I

not
sure

but
not
later
than
July

I
believe
.
"




then
they
be
both
silent
.
he
be
here
,
in
England
,
for
six
month
.


they
have
a
space
of
six
month
between

iron

adjust
itself
to
the

"

you

she
ask
.




"

his
own
soul

goat
’s

stiffen
to
wood
in
the

but
man
’s
leg

,


ugly
,
mechanical

happy
,

alone
,
now
.
the
glimmering
grin

face
.
he

no
long
any
necessity
to
take
part
in
the
performing


trick
of
the
rest

he
have
discover
the
clue
to
himself
,
he
have


escape
from
the
show
,
like
a
wild
beast
escape
straight
back
into
its


jungle
.
have
a
room
in
a
quiet
hotel
,
he
hire
a
horse
and
ride
out


into
the
country
,
stay
sometimes
for
the
night
in

village

the
next
day
.




he
feel
rich
and
abundant
in
himself
.
everything
he
do
be
a


voluptuous
pleasure
to
he
—
either
to
ride
on
horseback
,
or
to
walk
,
or


to
lie
in
the
sun
,
or
to
drink
in
a
public
-
house
.
he
have
no
use
for


people
,
nor
for
word
.
he
have
an
amused
pleasure
in
everything
,
a
great


sense
of
voluptuous
richness
in
himself
,
and
of
the
fecundity
of
the


universal
night
he
inhabit
.
the
puppet
shape
of
people
,
their


wood
-
mechanical
voice
,
he
be
remote
from
they
.




for
there
be
always
his
meeting
with
Ursula
.
very
often
,
she
do
not


go
to
college
in
the
afternoon
,
but
walk
with
he
instead
.
or
he
take


a
motor
-
car
or
a
dog
-
cart
and
they
drive
into
the
country
,
leave
the


car
and
go
away
by
themselves
into
the
wood
.
he
have
not
take
she


yet
.
with
subtle
,
instinctive
economy
,
they
go
to
the
end
of
each


kiss
,
each
embrace
,
each
pleasure
in
intimate
contact
,
know


subconsciously
that
the
last
be
come
.
it
be
to
be
their
final
entry


into
the
source
of
creation
.




she
take
he
home
,
and
he
stay
a
week
-
end
at
Beldover
with
she


family
.
she
love
have
he
in
the
house
.
strange
how
he
seem
to


come
into
the
atmosphere
of
her
family
,
with
his
laugh
,
insidious


grace
.
they
all
love
he
,
he
be
kin
to
they
.
his
raillery
,
his
warm
,


voluptuous
mocking
presence
be
meat
and
joy
to
the
Brangwen
household
.


for
this
house
be
always
quiver
with
darkness
,
they
put
off
their


puppet
form
when
they
come
home
,
to
lie
and
drowse
in
the
sun
.




there
be
a
sense
of
freedom
amongst
they
all
,
of
the
undercurrent
of


darkness
among
they
all
.
yet
here
,
at
home
,
Ursula
resent
it
.
it


become
distasteful
to
she
.
and
she
know
that
if
they
understand
the


real
relationship
between
she
and
Skrebensky
,
her
parent
,
her
father


in
particular
,
would
go
mad
with
rage
.
so
subtly
,
she
seem
to
be
like


any
other
girl
who
be
more
or
less
court
by
a
man
.
and
she
be
like


any
other
girl
.
but
in
she
,
the
antagonism
to
the
social
imposition
be


for
the
time
complete
and
final
.




she
wait
,
every
moment
of
the
day
,
for
his
next
kiss
.
she
admit
it


to
herself
in
shame
and
bliss
.
almost
consciously
,
she
wait
.
he


wait
,
but
,
until
the
time
come
,
more
unconsciously
.
when
the
time


come
that
he
should
kiss
she
again
,
a
prevention
be
an
annihilation
to


he
.
he
feel
his
flesh
go
grey
,
he
be
heavy
with
a
corpse
-
like


inanition
,
he
do
not
exist
,
if
the
time
pass
unfulfilled
.




he
come
to
she
finally
in
a
superb
consummation
.
it
be
very
dark
,
and


again
a
windy
,
heavy
night
.
they
have
come
down
the
lane
towards


Beldover
,
down
to
the
valley
.
they
be
at
the
end
of
their
kiss
,
and


there
be
the
silence
between
they
.
they
stand
as
at
the
edge
of
a


cliff
,
with
a
great
darkness
beneath
.




come
out
of
the
lane
along
the
darkness
,
with
the
dark
space


spread
down
to
the
wind
,
and
the
twinkle
light
of
the
station


below
,
the
far
-
off
windy
chuff
of
a
shunting
train
,
the
tiny


clink
-
clink
-
clink
of
the
wagon
blow
between
the
wind
,
the
light
of


beldover
-
edge
twinkling
upon
the
blackness
of
the
hill
opposite
,
the


glow
of
the
furnace
along
the
railway
to
the
right
,
their
step
begin


to
falter
.
they
would
soon
come
out
of
the
darkness
into
the
light
.
it


be
like
turn
back
.
it
be
unfulfilment
.
two
quiver
,
unwilling


creature
,
they
linger
on
the
edge
of
the
darkness
,
peer
out
at


the
light
and
the
machine
-
glimmer
beyond
.
they
could
not
turn
back
to


the
world
—
they
could
not
.




so
linger
along
,
they
come
to
a
great
oak
tree
by
the
path
.
in
all


its
bud
mass
it
roar
to
the
wind
,
and
its
trunk
vibrate
in
every


fibre
,
powerful
,
indomitable
.




"
we
will
sit
down
,
"
he
say
.




and
in
the
roaring
circle
under
the
tree
,
that
be
almost
invisible
yet


whose
powerful
presence
receive
they
,
they
lie
a
moment
look
at
the


twinkle
light
on
the
darkness
opposite
,
see
the
sweeping
brand
of
a


train
past
the
edge
of
their
darken
field
.




then
he
turn
and
kiss
she
,
and
she
wait
for
he
.
the
pain
to
she


be
the
pain
she
want
,
the
agony
be
the
agony
she
want
.
she
be


catch
up
,
entangle
in
the
powerful
vibration
of
the
night
.
the
man
,


what
be
he?—a
dark
,
powerful
vibration
that
encompass
she
.
she


pass
away
as
on
a
dark
wind
,
far
,
far
away
,
into
the
pristine


darkness
of
paradise
,
into
the
original
immortality
.
she
enter
the


dark
field
of
immortality
.




when
she
rise
,
she
feel
strangely
free
,
strong
.
she
be
not


ashamed,—why
should
she
be
?
he
be
walk
beside
she
,
the
man
who
have


be
with
she
.
she
have
take
he
,
they
have
be
together
.
whither
they


have
go
,
she
do
not
know
.
but
it
be
as
if
she
have
receive
another


nature
.
she
belong
to
the
eternal
,
changeless
place
into
which
they


have
leapt
together
.




her
soul
be
sure
and
indifferent
of
the
opinion
of
the
world
of


artificial
light
.
as
they
go
up
the
step
of
the
foot
-
bridge
over
the


railway
,
and
meet
the
train
-
passenger
,
she
feel
herself
belong
to


another
world
,
she
walk
past
they
immune
,
a
whole
darkness
divide


she
from
they
.
when
she
go
into
the
light
dining
-
room
at
home
,
she


be
impervious
to
the
light
and
the
eye
of
her
parent
.
her
everyday


self
be
just
the
same
.
she
merely
have
another
,
strong
self
that
know


the
darkness
.




this
curious
separate
strength
,
that
exist
in
darkness
and
pride
of


night
,
never
forsook
she
.
she
have
never
be
more
herself
.
it
could
not


occur
to
she
that
anybody
,
not
even
the
young
man
of
the
world
,


Skrebensky
,
should
have
anything
at
all
to
do
with
her
permanent
self
.


as
for
her
temporal
,
social
self
,
she
let
it
look
after
itself
.




her
whole
soul
be
implicate
with
Skrebensky
—
not
the
young
man
of
the


world
,
but
the
undifferentiated
man
he
be
.
she
be
perfectly
sure
of


herself
,
perfectly
strong
,
strong
than
all
the
world
.
the
world
be


not
strong
—
she
be
strong
.
the
world
exist
only
in
a
secondary


sense:—she

she
continue
at
college
,
in
her
ordinary
routine
,
merely
as
a
cover
to


her
dark
,
powerful
under
-
life
.
the
fact
of
herself
,
and
with
she


Skrebensky
,
be
so
powerful
,
that
she
take
rest
in
the
other
.
she
go


to
college
in
the
morning
,
and
attend
her
class
,
flowering
,
and


remote
.




she
have
lunch
with
he
in
his
hotel
;
every
evening
she
spend
with
he
,


either
in
town
,
at
his
room
,
or
in
the
country
.
she
make
the
excuse
at


home
of
evening
study
for
her
degree
.
but
she
pay
not
the
slight


attention
to
her
study
.




they
be
both
absolute
and
happy
and
calm
.
the
fact
of
their
own


consummate
be
make
everything
else
so
entirely
subordinate
that
they


be
free
.
the
only
thing
they
want
,
as
the
day
go
by
,
be
more


time
to
themselves
.
they
want
the
time
to
be
absolutely
their
own
.




the
Easter
vacation
be
approach
.
they
agree
to
go
right
away
.
it


would
not
matter
if
they
do
not
come
back
.
they
be
indifferent
to


the
actual
fact
.




"
I
suppose
we
ought
to
get
marry
,
"
he
say
,
rather
wistfully
.
it


_
be
_
so
magnificently
free
and
in
a
deep
world
,
as
it
be
.
to
make


public
their
connection
would
be
to
put
it
in
range
with
all
the
thing


which
nullify
he
,
and
from
which
he
be
for
the
moment
entirely


dissociate
.
if
he
marry
he
would
have
to
assume
his
social
self
.
and


the
thought
of
assume
his
social
self
make
he
at
once
diffident
and


abstract
.
if
she
be
his
social
wife
,
if
she
be
part
of
that


complication
of
dead
reality
,
then
what
have
his
under
-
life
to
do
with


she
?
one
’s
social
wife
be
almost
a
material
symbol
.
whereas
now
she


be
something
more
vivid
to
he
than
anything
in
conventional
life


could
be
.
she
give
the
complete
lie
to
all
conventional
life
,
he
and


she
stand
together
,
dark
,
fluid
,
infinitely
potent
,
give
the
living


lie
to
the
dead
whole
which
contain
they
.




he
watch
her
pensive
,
puzzle
face
.




"
I
do
n’t
think
I
want

she
say
,
her
brow
cloud
.




it
pique
he
rather
.




"
why
not
?
"
he
ask
.




"
let
’s
think
about
it
afterwards
,
shall
we
?
"
she
say
.




he
be
cross
,
yet
he
love
she
violently
.




"
you
’ve
get
a

not
a

he
say
.




"

I

"
she
cry
,
her
face
light
up
like
a
pure
flame
.
she


think
she
have
escape
.
yet
he
return
—
he
be
not
satisfied
.




"
why
?
"
he
ask
,
"
why
do
n’t
you
want
to
marry
I

"




"
I
do
n’t

she
say
.
"
I

"




"
all
right
,
"
he
say
.




he
would
rather
the
thing
be
leave
indefinite
,
and
that
she
take
the


responsibility
.




they
talk
of
the
Easter
vacation
.
she
think
only
of
complete


enjoyment
.




they
go
to
an
hotel
in
Piccadilly
.
she
be
suppose
to
be
his
wife
.


they
buy
a
wedding
-
ring
for
a
shilling
,
from
a
shop
in
a
poor


quarter
.




they
have
revoke
altogether
the
ordinary
mortal
world
.
their
confidence


be
like
a
possession
upon
they
.
they
be
possess
.
perfectly
and


supremely
free
they
feel
,
proud
beyond
all
question
,
and
surpass


mortal
condition
.




they
be
perfect
,
therefore
nothing
else
exist
.
the
world
be
a


world
of
servant
whom
one
civilly
ignore
.
wherever
they
go
,
they


be
the
sensuous
aristocrat
,
warm
,
bright
,
glance
with
pure
pride


of
the
sense
.




the
effect
upon
other
people
be
extraordinary
.
the
glamour
be
cast


from
the
young
couple
upon
all
they
come
into
contact
with
,
waiter
or


chance
acquaintance
.




_
"
Oui

Monsieur
le

"
_
she
would
reply
with
a
mocking
courtesy
to


her
husband
.




so
they
come
to
be
treat
as
title
people
.
he
be
an
officer
in
the


engineer
.
they
be
just
married
,
go
to
India
immediately
.




thus
a
tissue
of
romance
be
round
they
.
she
believe
she
be
a
young


wife
of
a
title
husband
on
the
eve
of
departure
for
India
.
this
,
the


social
fact
,
be
a
delicious
make
-
belief
.
the
live
fact
be
that
he


and
she
be
man
and
woman
,
absolute
and
beyond
all
limitation
.




the
day
go
by
—
they
be
to
have
three
week
together
—
in
perfect


success
.
all
the
time
,
they
themselves
be
reality
,
all
outside
be


tribute
to
they
.
they
be
quite
careless
about
money
,
but
they
do


nothing
very
extravagant
.
he
be
rather
surprised
when
he
find
that
he


have
spend
twenty
pound
in
a
little
under
a
week
,
but
it
be
only
the


irritation
of
have
to
go
to
the
bank
.
the
machinery
of
the
old
system


last
for
he
,
not
the
system
.
the
money
simply
do
not
exist
.




neither
do
any
of
the
old
obligation
.
they
come
home
from
the


theatre
,
have
supper
,
then
flit
about
in
their
dressing

gown
.
they


have
a
large
bedroom
and
a
corner
sitting
-
room
high
up
,
remote
and
very


cosy
.
they
eat
all
their
meal
in
their
own
room
,
attend
by
a
young


german
call
Hans

who
think
they
both
wonderful
,
and
answer


assiduously
:

run
far
ahead

and
which
be
now
vague

then
,
as

become
strong
,
they
open
the
glass
door


and
go
on
to
the
giddy
balcony
,
feel
triumphant
as
two
angel
in


bliss
,
look
down
at
the
still
sleep
world
,
which
would
wake
to
a


dutiful

rumble
,
sluggish
turmoil
of
unreality

the

they
go
into

before


go
to

quick
,


unconscious
movement

electric
light

he
stand
out
of

flat
over
his

press
the

out
of
his
eye
.
he
be
slender
,
and
,


to
she

perfect
,
a
clean
,
straight

youth
,
without
a
grain

soft

indeed
,
with
such
respect
,
that


she
begin
to
think
she
be
really
quite
of
the
whole
universe
,
of
the


old
world
as
well
as
of
the
new

she
forget
she
be
outside

think
she
have
bring

by
the
one
be


a
reality
and
an
adventure
to
the
other
.
they
do
not
want
outside


excitement
.
they
go
to
very
few
theatre
,
they
be
often
in
their


sit
-
room
high
up
over
Piccadilly
,
with
window
open
on
two

and
the
door
open
on
to
the
balcony
,
look
over
the
Green
Park
,
or


down
upon
the
minute
travel
of
the
traffic
.




then
suddenly
,
look
at
a
sunset
,
she
want
to
go
.
she
must
be
go
.


she
must
be

in
two
hour

and
for
a
few
day


she
be
happy
in
the
novelty
of
Paris
.




then
,
for
some
reason
,
she
must
call
in
Rouen
on
the
way
back
to


London
.
he
have
an
instinctive
mistrust
of
her
desire
for
the
place
.


but
,
perversely
,
she
want
to
go
there
.
it
be
as
if
she
want
to
try


its
effect
upon
she
.




for
the
first
time
,
in
Rouen
,
he
have
a
cold
feeling
of
death
;
not


afraid
of
any
other
man
,
but
of
she
.
she
seem
to
leave
he
.
she


follow
after
something
that
be
not

she
do
not
want
he
.
the


old
street
,
the
cathedral
,
the

to
it
as
if
to
something
she


have
forget
,
and
want
.
this
be
now
the
reality

there
in
its
mass
,
which
know
no
transience
nor


hear
any
denial
.
it
be
majestic
in
its
stability
,
its
splendid


absoluteness
.




her
soul
begin
to
run
by
itself
.
he
do
not
realize
,
nor
do
she
.
yet


in
Rouen
he
have
the
first
deadly
anguish
,
the
first
sense
of
the
death


towards
which
they
be
wander
.
and
she
feel
the
first
heavy


yearning
,
heavy
,
heavy
hopeless
warning
,
almost
like
a
deep
,
uneasy


sink
into
apathy
,
hopelessness
.




they
return
to
London
.
but
still
they
have
two
day
.
he
begin
to


tremble
,
he
grow
feverish
with
the
fear
of
her
departure
.
she
have
in


she
some
fatal
prescience
,
that
make
her
calm
.
what
would
be
,
would
be
.




he
remain
fairly
easy
,
however
,
still
in
his
state
of
heighten


glamour
,
till
she
have
go
,
and
he
have
turn
away
from
St.

,


and
sit
on
the

up
Pimlico
to
the
"
Angel
"
,
to
Moorgate


street
on
Sunday
evening
.




then
the
cold
horror
gradually
soak
into
he
.
he
see
the
horror
of


the
City
Road
,
he
realize
the
ghastly
cold
sordidness
of
the
tram
-
car


in
which
he
sit
.
cold
,
stark
,
ashen
sterility
have
he
surround
.
where


then
be
the
luminous
,
wonderful
world
he
belong
to
by
right
?
how


do
he
come
to
be
throw
on
this
refuse
-
heap
where
he
be
?




he
be
as
if
mad
.
the
horror
of
the
brick
building
,
of
the
tram
-
car
,


of
the
ashen
-
grey
people
in
the
street
make
he
reel
and
blind
as
if


drunk
.
he
go
mad
.
he
have
live
with
she
in
a
close
,
live
,
pulse


world
,
where
everything
pulse
with
rich
being
.
now
he
find
himself


struggle
amid
an
ashen
-
dry
,
cold
world
of
rigidity
,
dead
wall
and


mechanical
traffic
,
and
creep
,
spectre
-
like
people
.
the
life
be


extinct
,
only
ash
move
and
stir
or
stand
rigid
,
there
be
a


horrible
,
clattering
activity
,
a
rattle
like
the
falling
of
dry
slag
,


cold
and
sterile
.
it
be
as
if
the
sunshine
that
fall
be
unnatural


light
expose
the
ash
of
the
town
,
as
if
the
light
at
night
be
the


sinister
gleam
of
decomposition
.




quite
mad
,
beside
himself
,
he
go
to
his
club
and
sit
with
a
glass
of


whisky
,
motionless
,
as
if
turn
to
clay
.
he
feel
like
a
corpse
that
be


inhabit
with
just
enough
life
to
make
it
appear
as
any
other
of
the


spectral
,
unliving
being
which
we
call
people
in
our
dead
language
.


her
absence
be
bad
than
pain
to
he
.
it
destroy
his
being
.




dead
,
he
go
on
from
lunch
to
tea
.
his
face
be
all
the
time
fix
and


stiff
and
colourless
,
his
life
be
a
dry
,
mechanical
movement
.
yet
even


he
wonder
slightly
at
the
awful
misery
that
have
overcome
he
.
how


could
he
be
so
ashlike
and
extinct
?
he
write
she
a
letter
.




"

more
when
I

go

India
,
I
could
very
probably
stay

I
think
you
would
like
India
.
you
could
ride
,
and
you


would
know
just
everybody
out
there
.
perhaps
if
you
stay
on
to
take


your
degree
,
we
might
marry
immediately
after
that
.
I
will
write
to


your

within
the
taxi

cab
,

face
still

,
whilst
occasionally
he
make
quick
slight
movement
of
the


head
,
to
shake
away
his
tear
.
he
never
move
his
hand
.
she
could
not

wet
,
and

occasionally
,

hand
still
lay
motionless
.
but
his
eye

quite


still
,
like
a
washed
sky
after
rain
,
full
of
a
wan
light
,
and
quite


steady
,
almost
ghost
-
like
.




a
pain
flame
in
her
womb
,
for
he
.




"

without
my
knowing

quite
still
,

,
but
wash
all
wan
and
without


feeling

some
curious
,


not

understandable
creature

"
you
wo
n’t
cry
again
,
will
you

Tony

"




some
shame
and
bitterness
against
she
burn
he
in
the
question
.
she


notice
how
his
moustache

well
as
he
would
have

it


himself
.




her
handkerchief
be
too
small
.
it
be
soon
wet
through

she
grope
in


his

her
sleep

not
very


deep
nor
very
real

she
wake
in
the
morning
to
a
sound
of
water
dash
on
a
courtyard
,
to


sunlight
stream
through
a
lattice

still


asleep
.




she
watch
the
sunshine
come
in
bar
through
the
_
persienne
,

and


her
immediate
surrounding
again
melt
away
.




she
be
in
some
other
land
,
some
other
world
,
where
the
old
restraint


have
dissolve
and
vanish
,
where
one
move
freely
,
not
afraid
of
one
’s


fellow
man
,
nor
wary
,
nor
on
the
defensive
,
but
calm
,
indifferent
,
at


one
’s
ease
.
vaguely
,
in
a
sort
of
silver
light
,

wander
at
large


and
at
ease
.
the
bond
of
the
world
be
break
.
this
world
of
England


have
vanish
away
.

hear
a
voice
in
the
yard
below
call
:




"

and
she
know
she
be
in
a
new
country
,
in
a
new
life
.
it
be
very


delicious
to
lie
thus
still
,
with
one
’s
soul
wander
freely
and


simply
in
the
silver
light
of
some
other
,
simple
,
more
finely
natural


world
.




but
always
there
be
a
foreboding
wait
to
command
she

she
become


more
aware
of
Skrebensky
.
she

must
modify


her
soul

further
world
,

awake
.
he
lie
still
,
with
a
concrete
stillness
,
not
as


when
he
sleep
.
then
his
arm
tighten
almost
convulsively
upon
she
,
and

she
be
not


effective
:
she
be
not
beautiful
:
she
be
nothing
.
even
before


Skrebensky
she
feel
unimportant
,
almost
inferior
.
he
could
take
his


part
very
well
with
the
rest
.




he
and
she
go
out
into
the
night
.
there
be
a
moon
behind
cloud
,


shed
a
diffused
light
,
gleam
now
and
again
in
bit
of
smoky


mother
-
of
-
pearl
.
so
they
walk
together
on
the
wet
,
rib
sand
near


the
sea
,
hear
the
run
of
the
long
,
heavy
wave
,
that
make
a
ghostly


whiteness
and
a
whisper
.




he
be
sure
of
himself
.
as
she
walk
,
the
soft
silk
of
her
dress
—
she


wear
a
blue
shantung
,
full
-
skirt
—
blow
away
from
the
sea
and
flap


and
clung
to
her
leg
.
she
wish
it
would
not
.
everything
seem
to


give
she
away
,
and
she
could
not
rouse
herself
to
deny
,
she
be
so


confused
.




he
would
lead
she
away
to
a
pocket
in
the
sand
-
hill
,
secret
amid
the


grey
thorn
-
bush
and
the
grey
,
glassy
grass
.
he
hold
she
close
against


he
,
feel
all
her
firm
,
unutterably
desirable
mould
of
body
through
the


fine
fibre
of
the
silk
that
fall
about
her
limb
.
the
silk
,
slip


fierily
on
the
hidden
,
yet
reveal
roundness
and
firmness
of
her
body
,


her
loin
,
seem
to
run
in
he
like
fire
,
make
his
brain
burn
like


brimstone
.
she
like
it
,
the
electric
fire
of
the
silk
under
his
hand


upon
her
limb
,
the
fire
fly
over
she
,
as
he
draw
near
and
near
to


discovery
.
she
vibrate
like
a
jet
of
electric
,
firm
fluid
in
response
.


yet
she
do
not
feel
beautiful
.
all
the
time
,
she
feel
she
be
not


beautiful
to
he
,
only
exciting
.
[
she
let
he
take
she
,
and
he
seem


mad
,
mad
with
excited
passion
.
but
she
,
as
she
lie
afterwards
on
the


cold
,
soft
sand
,
look
up
at
the
blotted
,
faintly
luminous
sky
,
feel


that
she
be
as
cold
now
as
she
have
be
before
.
yet
he
,
breathe


heavily
,
seem
almost
savagely
satisfied
.
he
seem
revenged
.




a
little
wind
waft
the
sea
grass
and
pass
over
her
face
.
where
be


the
supreme
fulfilment
she
would
never
enjoy
?
why
be
she
so
cold
,
so


unroused
,
so
indifferent
?




as
they
go
home
,
and
she
see
the
many
,
hateful
light
of
the


bungalow
,
of
several
bungalow
in
a
group
,
he
say
softly
:




"
do
n’t
lock
your
door

"
I

it
.
"




she
do
not
answer
.
he
take
her
silence
for
consent
.




he
share
his
room
with
another
man
.




"
I
suppose
,

he
say
,
"

the
house
if
I
go
across
to


happy

"
so
long
as
you
do

Skrebensky
go
out
in
his
wide
-
stripe
sleeping
suit
.
he
cross
the


big
dining
hall
,
whose
low
firelight
smell
of
cigar
and
whisky
and


coffee
,
enter
the
other
corridor
and
find
Ursula
’s
room
.
she
be


lie
awake
,
wide
-
eyed
and
suffering
.
she
be
glad
he
have
come
,
if
only


for
consolation
.
it
be
consolation
to
be
hold
in
his
arm
,
to
feel
his


body
against
hers
.
yet
how
foreign
his
arm
and
body
be
!
yet
still
,


not
so
horribly
foreign
and
hostile
as
the
rest
of
the
house
feel
to


she
.
]




she
do
not
know
how
she
suffer
in
this
house
.
she
be
healthy
and


exorbitantly
full
of
interest
.
so
she
play
tennis
and
learn
golf
,


she
row
out
and
swam
in
the
deep
sea
,
and
enjoy
it
very
much


indeed
,
full
of
z
.
yet
all
the
time
,
among
those
other
,
she
feel


shocked
and
wincing
,
as
if
her
violently
-
sensitive
nakedness
be


expose
to
the
hard
,
brutal
,
material
impact
of
the
rest
of
the
people
.




the
day
go
by
unmarked
,
in
a
full
,
almost
strenuous
enjoyment
of


one
’s
own
physique
.
Skrebensky
be
one
among
the
other
,
till
evening


come
,
and
he
take
she
for
himself
.
she
be
allow
a
great
deal
of


freedom
and
be
treat
with
a
good
deal
of
respect
,
as
a
girl
on
the


eve
of
marriage
,
about
to
depart
for
another
continent
.




the
trouble
begin
at
evening
.
then
a
yearning
for
something
unknown


come
over
she
,
a
passion
for
something
she
know
not
what
.
she
would


walk
the
foreshore
alone
after
dusk
,
expect
,
expect
something
,
as


if
she
have
go
to
a
rendezvous
.
the
salt
,
bitter
passion
of
the
sea
,


its
indifference
to
the
earth
,
its
swinge
,
definite
motion
,
its


strength
,
its
attack
,
and
its
salt
burning
,
seem
to
provoke
she
to
a


pitch
of
madness
,
tantalize
she
with
vast
suggestion
of
fulfilment
.


and
then
,
for
personification
,
would
come
Skrebensky
,
Skrebensky
,
whom


she
know
,
whom
she
be
fond
of
,
who
be
attractive
,
but
whose
soul


could
not
contain
she
in
its
wave
of
strength
,
nor
his
breast
compel


she
in
burning
,
salty
passion
.




one
evening
they
go
out
after
dinner
,
across
the
low
golf
link
to


the
dune
and
the
sea

the
sky
have
small
,
faint

still


and
faintly
dark

they
walk
together
in
silence

plough
,


labour
,
through
the
heavy
loose
sand
of
the
gap
between
the
dune

they
go
in
silence
under
the
even
,
faint
darkness
,
in
the
dark


shadow
of
the
sandhill

a
dazzling
,
terrifying
glare

white
light

down
her
cheek

,
draw
tense
,
for
some


minute
,
watch
the
unaltering
,
rigid
face
like
metal
in
the


moonlight
,
the
fix
,
unseee
eye
,
in
which
slowly
the
water
gather
,


shake
with
glittering
moonlight
,
then
surcharge
,
brim
over
and
run


trickle
,
a
tear
with
its
burden
of
moonlight
,
into
the
darkness
,
to


fall
in
the
sand
.




he
draw
gradually
away
as
if
afraid
,
draw
away
—

do
not
move
.
he


glance
at
she
—
she

the
same
.
could
he
break
away
?
he
turn
,
see


the
open
foreshore
,
clear
in
front
of
he
,
and
he
plunge
away
,
on
and


on
,
ever
far
from
the
horrible
figure
that
lie
stretch
in
the


moonlight
on
the
sand
with
the
tear
gather
and
travel
on
the


motionless
,
eternal
face
.

feel
,
if
ever
he
must
see
she
again
,
his
bone
must
be
break
,
his


body
crush
,
obliterate
for
ever
.
and
as
yet
,

the
love
of
his


own
living
body
.

wander
on
a
long
,
long
way
,
till
his
brain
draw


dark
and
he
be
unconscious
with
weariness
.
then
he
curl
in
the


deep
darkness
he
could
find
,
under
the
sea
-
grass
,
and
lie
there


without
consciousness
.




she
break
from
her
tense
cramp
of
agony
gradually
,
though
each
movement


be
a
goad
of
heavy
pain
.
gradually
,
she
lift
her
dead
body
from
the


sand
,
and
rise
at
last
.
there
be
now
no
moon
for
she
,
no
sea
.
all
have


pass
away
.
she
trail
her
dead
body
to
the
house
,
to
her
room
,
where


she
lie
down
inert
.

a
new
access
of
superficial

wicked
,

that
other
thing

would
marry

a
just
and
true
light

have
take
the
life

have
not

great
mood
of

on
my
knee
,
take
what
God
have
give


I
,
I
must
have
the
moon
in
my
keeping
,
I
must
insist
on
have
the


moon
for
my
own
.
because
I
could
not
have
it
,
everything
else
must
go
.




"
I
do
not
know
if
you
can
ever
forgive
I
.
I
could
die
with
shame
to


think
of
my
behaviour
with
you
during
our
last
time
,
and
I
do
n’t
know


if
I
could
ever
bear
to
look
you
in
the
face
again
.
truly
the
good


thing
would
be
for
I
to
die
,
and
cover
my
fantasy
for
ever
.
but
I


find
I
be
with
child
,
so
that
can
not
be
.




"
it
be
your
child
,
and
for
that
reason
I
must
revere
it
and
submit
my


body
entirely
to
its
welfare
,
entertain
no
thought
of
death
,
which


once
more
be
largely
conceit
.
therefore
,
because
you
once
love
I
,
and


because
this
child
be
your
child
,
I
ask
you
to
have
I
back
.
if
you


will
cable
I
one
word
,
I
will
come
to
you
as
soon
as
I
can
.
I
swear
to


you
to
be
a
dutiful
wife
,
and
to
serve
you
in
all
thing
.
for
now
I


only
hate
myself
and
my
own
conceited
foolishness
.
I
love
you
—
I
love


the
thought
of
you
—
you
be
natural
and
decent
all
through
,
whilst
I


be
so
false
.
once
I
be
with
you
again
,
I
shall
ask
no
more
than
to


rest
in
your
shelter
all
my
life

after

in
India
—
within
three
week


of
his
arrival
there
.
in
a
month
’s
time
she

be
aware
,
however
,
of
a


gather
restiveness
,
a
tumult
impend
within

.
she
try
to

away

curious
how
little
she

before
.
it
be

would
get
the


require
answer
,
that
be
all
.




one
afternoon
in
early
October
,
feel
the
seethe
rise
to
madness


within
she
,
she
slip
out
in
the
rain
,
to
walk
abroad
,
lest
the
house


should
suffocate
she
.
everywhere
be
drench
wet
and
deserted
,
the


grimed
house
glow
dull
red
,
the
butt
house
burn
scarlet
in
a


gleam
of
light
,
under
the
glistening
,
blackish
purple
slate
.
Ursula


go
on
towards
Willey
Green
.
she
lift
her
face
and
walk
swiftly
,


see
the
passage
of
light
across
the
shallow
valley
,
see
the


colliery
and
its
cloud
of
steam
for
a
moment
visionary
in
dim


brilliance
,
away
in
the
chaos
of
rain
.
then
the
veil
close
again
.
she


be
glad
of
the
rain
’s
privacy
and
intimacy
.




make
on
towards
the
wood
,
she
see
the
pale
gleam
of
Willey
Water


through
the
cloud
below
,
she
walk
the
open
space
where
hawthorn
tree


stream
like
hair
on
the
wind
and
round
bush
be
presence
slow


through
the
atmosphere
.
it
be
very
splendid
,
free
and
chaotic
.




yet
she
hurry
to
the
wood
for
shelter
.
there
,
the
vast
boom


overhead
vibrate
down
and
encircle
she
,
tree
-
trunk
span
the


circle
of
tremendous
sound
,
myriad
of
tree
-
trunk
,
enormous
and


streaked
black
with
water
,
thrust
like
stanchion
upright
between
the


roar
overhead
and
the
sweeping
of
the
circle
underfoot
.
she
glide


between
the
tree
-
trunk
,
afraid
of
they
.
they
might
turn
and
shut
she


in
as
she
go
through
their
martialle
silence
.




so
she
flit
along
,
keep
an
illusion
that
she
be
unnoticed
.
she


feel
like
a
bird
that
have
fly
in
through
the
window
of
a
hall
where


vast
warrior
sit
at
the
board
.
between
their
grave
,
boom
rank
she


be
hasten
,
assume
she
be
unnoticed
,
till
she
emerge
,
with


beat
heart
,
through
the
far
window
and
out
into
the
open
,
upon
the


vivid
green
,
marshy
meadow
.




she
turn
under
the
shelter
of
the
common
,
see
the
great
veil
of


rain
swinge
with
slow
,
float
wave
across
the
landscape
.
she
be


very
wet
and
a
long
way
from
home
,
far
envelop
in
the
rain
and
the


wave
landscape
.
she
must
beat
her
way
back
through
all
this


fluctuation
,
back
to
stability
and
security
.




a
solitary
thing
,
she
take
the
track
straight
across
the
wilderness
,


go
back
.
the
path
be
a
narrow
groove
in
the
turf
between
high
,


sere
,
tussocky
grass
;
it
be
scarcely
more
than
a
rabbit
run
.
so
she


move
swiftly
along
,
watch
she
footing
,
go
like
a
bird
on
the


wind
,
with
no
thought
,
contain
in
motion
.
but
her
heart
have
a
small
,


live
seed
of
fear
,
as
she
go
through
the
wash
of
hollow
space
.




suddenly
she
know
there
be
something
else
.
some
horse
be
loom
in


the
rain
,
not
near
yet
.
but
they
be
go
to
be
near
.
she
continue


her
path
,
inevitably
.
they
be
horse
in
the
lee
of
a
clump
of
tree


beyond
,
above
she
.
she
pursue
her
way
with
bent
head
.
she
do
not
want


to
lift
her
face
to
they
.
she
do
not
want
to
know
they
be
there
.
she


go
on
in
the
wild
track
.




she
know
the
heaviness
on
her
heart
.
it
be
the
weight
of
the
horse
.


but
she
would
circumvent
they
.
she
would
bear
the
weight
steadily
,
and


so
escape
.
she
would
go
straight
on
,
and
on
,
and
be
go
by
.




suddenly
the
weight
deepen
and
her
heart
grow
tense
to
bear
it
.
she


breathing
be
labour
.
but
this
weight
also
she
could
bear
.
she
know


without
look
that
the
horse
be
move
near
.
what
be
they
?
she


feel
the
thud
of
their
heavy
hoofs
on
the
ground
.
what
be
it
that
be


draw
near
she
,
what
weight
oppress
her
heart
?
she
do
not
know
,


she
do
not
look
.




yet
now
her
way
be
cut
off
.
they
be
block
she
back
.
she
know
they


have
gather
on
a
log
bridge
over
the
sedgy
dike
,
a
dark
,
heavy
,


powerfully
heavy
knot
.
yet
her
foot
go
on
and
on
.
they
would
burst


before
she
.
they
would
burst
before
she
.
her
foot
go
on
and
on
.
and


tense
,
and
more
tense
become
her
nerve
and
her
vein
,
they
run
hot
,


they
run
white
hot
,
they
must
fuse
and
she
must
die
.




but
the
horse
have
burst
before
she
.
in
a
sort
of
lightning
of


knowledge
their
movement
travel
through
she
,
the
quiver
and
strain


and
thrust
of
their
powerful
flank
,
as
they
burst
before
she
and
draw


on
,
beyond
.




she
know
they
have
not
go
,
she
know
they
await
she
still
.
but
she


go
on
over
the
log
bridge
that
their
hoofs
have
churn
and
drum
,


she
go
on
,
know
thing
about
they
.
she
be
aware
of
their
breast


grip
,
clench
narrow
in
a
hold
that
never
relax
,
she
be
aware
of


their
red
nostril
flame
with
long
endurance
,
and
of
their
haunch
,


so
rounded
,
so
massive
,
press
,
press
,
press
to
burst
the
grip


upon
their
breast
,
press
for
ever
till
they
go
mad
,
run


against
the
wall
of
time
,
and
never
burst
free
.
their
great


haunch
be
smooth
and
darken
with
rain
.
but
the
darkness
and


wetness
of
rain
could
not
put
out
the
hard
,
urgent
,
massive
fire
that


be
lock
within
these
flank
,
never
,
never
.




she
go
on
,
draw
near
.
she
be
aware
of
the
great
flash
of
hoofs
,
a


bluish
,
iridescent
flash
surround
a
hollow
of
darkness
.
large
,
large


seem
the
bluish
,
incandescent
flash
of
the
hoof
-
iron
,
large
as
a
halo


of
lightning
round
the
knotted
darkness
of
the
flank
.
like
circle
of


lightning
come
the
flash
of
hoofs
from
out
of
the
powerful
flank
.




they
be
await
she
again
.
they
have
gather
under
an
oak
tree
,


knot
their
awful
,
blind
,
triumph
flank
together
,
and
wait
,


wait
.
they
be
wait
for
her
approach
.
as
if
from
a
far
distance


she
be
draw
near
,
towards
the
line
of
twiggy
oak
tree
where
they


make
their
intense
darkness
,
gather
on
a
single
bank
.




she
must
draw
near
.
but
they
break
away
,
they
canter
round
,
make
a


wide
circle
to
avoid
notice
she
,
and
canter
back
into
the
open


hillside
behind
she
.




they
be
behind
she
.
the
way
be
open
before
she
,
to
the
gate
in
the


high
hedge
in
the
near
distance
,
so
she
could
pass
into
the
small
,


cultivate
field
,
and
so
out
to
the
high
-
road
and
the
ordered
world
of


man
.
her
way
be
clear
.
she
lull
her
heart
.
yet
her
heart
be
couch


with
fear
,
couch
with
fear
all
along
.




suddenly
she
hesitate
as
if
seize
by
lightning
.
she
seem
to
fall
,


yet
find
herself
falter
forward
with
small
step
.
the
thunder
of


horse
gallop
down
the
path
behind
she
shake
she
,
the
weight
come


down
upon
she
,
down
,
to
the
moment
of
extinction
.
she
could
not
look


round
,
so
the
horse
thunder
upon
she
.




cruelly
,
they
swerve
and
crash
by
on
her
left
hand
.
she
see
the


fierce
flank
crinkle
and
as
yet
inadequate
,
the
great
hoofs
flash


bright
as
yet
only
brandish
about
she
,
and

together
into
a
knot

,
two
hundred
yard
down
the
slope
,
the
thick
hedge
run
parallel
.


at
one
point
there
be
an
oak
tree
.
she
might
climb
into
the
bough
of


that
oak
tree
,
and
so
round
and
drop
on
the

side
of

hedge
.




shudder
,
with
limb
like
water
,
dread
every
moment
to
fall
,
she


begin
to
work
her
way
as
if
make
a
wide
detour
round
the
horse
-
mass
.


the
horse
stir
their
flank
in
a
knot
against
she
.
she
tremble


forward
as
if
in
a
trance
.




then
suddenly
,
in
a
flame
of
agony
,
she
dart
,
seize
the
rugged
knot


of
the
oak
tree
and
begin
to
climb
.
her
body
be
weak
but
her
hand


be
as
hard
as
steel
.
she
know
she
be
strong
.
she
struggle
in
a


great
effort
till
she
hang
on

bough
.
she
know

.
she
be

her
way
round


to
the
other
side
of
the
tree
.
as
they
start
to
canter
towards
she
,


she
fall
in
a
heap
on
the
other
side
of
the
hedge
.




for
some
moment
she
could
not
move
.
then
she
see
through
the


rabbit
-
clear
bottom
of
the
hedge
the
great
,
work
hoofs
of
the


horse
as
they
canter
near
.
she
could
not
bear
it
.
she
rise
and


walk
swiftly
,
diagonally
across
the
field
.
the
horse
gallop
along


the
other
side
of
the
hedge
to
the
corner
,
where
they
be
hold
up
.
she


could
feel
they
there
in
their
huddled
group
all
the
while
she
hasten


across
the
bare
field
.
they
be
almost
pathetic
,
now
.
her
will
alone


carry
she
,
till
,
tremble
,
she
climb
the
fence
under
a
lean


thorn
tree
that
overhang
the
grass
by
the
high
-
road
.
the
use
go
from


she
,
she
sit
on
the
fence
lean
back
against
the
trunk
of
the
thorn


tree
,
motionless
.




as
she
sit
there
,
spend
,
time
and
the
flux
of
change
pass
away
from


she
,
she
lie
as
if
unconscious
upon
the
bed
of
the
stream
,
like
a


stone
,
unconscious
,
unchanging
,
unchangeable
,
whilst
everything
roll


by
in
transience
,
leave
she
there
,
a
stone
at
rest
on
the
bed
of
the


stream
,
inalterable
and
passive
,
sink
to
the
bottom
of
all
change
.




she
lie
still
a
long
time
,
with
her
back
against
the
thorn
tree
trunk
,


in
her
final
isolation
.
some
collier
pass
,
tramp
heavily
up
the


wet
road
,
their
voice
sound
out
,
their
shoulder
up
to
their
ear
,


their
figure
blotch
and
spectral
in
the
rain
.
some
do
not
see
she
.


she
open
her
eye
languidly
as
they
pass
by
.
then
one
man
go


alone
see
she
.
the
white
of
his
eye
show
in
his
black
face
as
he


look
in
wonderment
at
she
.
he
hesitate
in
his
walk
,
as
if
to
speak


to
she
,
out
of
frightened
concern
for
she
.
how
she
dread
his
speaking


to
she
,
dread
his
question
she
.




she
slip
from
her
seat
and
go
vaguely
along
the
path
—
vaguely
.
it


be
a
long
way
home
.
she
have
an
idea
that
she
must
walk
for
the
rest
of


her
life
,
wearily
,
wearily
.
step
after
step
,
step
after
step
,
and


always
along
the
wet
,
rainy
road
between
the
hedge
.
step
after
step
,


step
after
step
,
the
monotony
produce
a
deep
,
cold
sense
of
nausea
in


she
.
how
profound
be
her
cold
nausea
,
how
profound
!
that
too
plumb


the
bottom
.
she
seemed
destine
to
find
the
bottom
of
all
thing


to
-
day
:
the
bottom
of
all
thing
.
well
,
at
any
rate
she
be
walk


along
the
bottom
-
most
bed
—
she
be
quite
safe
:
quite
safe
,
if
she
have
to


go
on
and
on
for
ever
,
see
this
be
the
very
bottom
,
and
there
be


nothing
deep
.
there
be
nothing
deep
,
you
see
,
so
one
could
not
but


feel
certain
,
passive
.




she
arrive
home
at
last
.
the
climb
up
the
hill
to
Beldover
have
be


very
try
.
why
must
one
climb
the
hill
?
why
must
one
climb
?
why
not


stay
below
?
why
force
one
’s
way
up
the
slope
?
why
force
one
’s
way
up


and
up
,
when
one
be
at
the
bottom
?
oh
,
it
be
very
trying
,
very


weary
,
very
burdensome
.
always
burden
,
always
,
always
burden
.


still
,
she
must
get
to
the
top
and
go
home
to
bed
.
she
must
go
to
bed
.




she
get
in
and
go
upstairs
in
the
dusk
without
its
be
notice
she


be
in
such
a
sodden
condition
.
she
be
too
tired
to
go
downstairs


again
.
she
get
into
bed
and
lie
shudder
with
cold
,
yet
too
apathetic


to
get
up
or
call
for
relief
.
then
gradually
she
become
more
ill
.




she
be
very
ill
for
a
fortnight
,
delirious
,
shake
and
rack
.
but


always
,
amid
the
ache
of
delirium
,
she
have
a
dull
firmness
of
be
,
a


sense
of
permanency
.
she
be
in
some
way
like
the
stone
at
the
bottom


of
the
river
,
inviolable
and
unalterable
,
no
matter
what
storm
rage
in


her
body
.
her
soul
lie
still
and
permanent
,
full
of
pain
,
but
itself


for
ever
.
under
all
her
illness
,
persist
a
deep
,
inalterable


knowledge
.




she
know
,
and
she
care
no
more
.
throughout
her
illness
,
distort
into


vague
form
,
persist
the
question
of
herself
and
Skrebensky
,
like
a


gnaw
ache
that
be
still
superficial
,
and
do
not
touch
she


isolated
,
impregnable
core
of
reality
.
but
the
corrosion
of
he
burn


in
she
till
it
burn
itself
out
.




must
she
belong
to
he
,
must
she
adhere
to
he
?
something
compel


she
,
and
yet
it
be
not
real
.
always
the
ache
,
the
ache
of
unreality
,


of
she
belong
to
Skrebensky
.
what
bind
she
to
he
when
she
be
not


bind
to
he
?
why
do
the
falsity
persist
?
why
do
the
falsity
gnaw
,


gnaw
,
gnaw
at
she
,
why
could
she
not
wake
up
to
clarity
,
to
reality
.
if


she
could
but
wake
up
,
if
she
could
but
wake
up
,
the
falsity
of
the


dream
,
of
her
connection
with
Skrebensky
,
would
be
go
.
but
the
sleep
,


the
delirium
pin
she
down
.
even
when
she
be
calm
and
sober
she
be


in
its
spell
.




yet
she
be
never
in
its
spell
.
what
extraneous
thing
bind
she
to
he
?


there
be
some
bond
put
upon
she
.
why
could
she
not
break
it
through
?


what
be
it
?
what
be
it
?




in
her
delirium
she
beat
and
beat
at
the
question
.
and
at
last
she


weariness
give
she
the
answer
—
it
be
the
child
.
the
child
bind
she
to


he
.
the
child
be
like
a
bond
round
her
brain
,
tighten
on
her
brain
.


it
bind
she
to
Skrebensky
.




but
why
,
why
do
it
bind
she
to
Skrebensky
?
could
she
not
have
a
child


of
herself
?
be
not
the
child
her
own
affair
?
all
her
own
affair
?
what


have
it
to
do
with
he
?
why
must
she
be
bind
,
ache
and
cramp
with


the
bondage
,
to
Skrebensky
and
Skrebensky
’s
world
?
Anton
’s
world
:
it


become
in
her
feverish
brain
a
compression
which
enclose
she
.
if
she


could
not
get
out
of
the
compression
she
would
go
mad
.
the
compression


be
Anton
and
Anton
’s
world
,
not
the
Anton
she
possess
,
but
the
Anton


she
do
not
possess
,
that
which
be
own
by
some
other
influence
,
by


the
world
.




she
fight
and
fight
and
fight
all
through
her
illness
to
be
free
of


he
and
his
world
,
to
put
it
aside
,
to
put
it
aside
,
into
its
place
.


yet
ever
anew
it
gain
ascendency
over
she
,
it
lay
new
hold
on
she
.


oh
,
the
unutterable
weariness
of
her
flesh
,
which
she
could
not
cast


off
,
nor
yet
extricate
.
if
she
could
but
extricate
herself
,
if
she


could
but
disengage
herself
from
feeling
,
from
her
body
,
from
all
the


vast
encumbrance
of
the
world
that
be
in
contact
with
she
,
from
she


father
,
and
her
mother
,
and
her
lover
,
and
all
her
acquaintance
.




repeatedly
,
in
an
ache
of
utter
weariness
she
repeat
:
"
I
have
no


father
nor
mother
nor
lover
,
I
have
no
allocate
place
in
the
world
of


thing
,
I
do
not
belong
to
Beldover
nor
to
Nottingham
nor
to
England


nor
to
this
world
,
they
none
of
they
exist
,
I
be
trammelle
and


entangle
in
they
,
but
they
be
all
unreal
.
I
must
break
out
of
it
,


like
a
nut
from
its
shell
which
be
an
unreality
.
"




and
again
,
to
her
feverish
brain
,
come
the
vivid
reality
of
acorn
in


February
lie
on
the
floor
of
a
wood
with
their
shell
burst
and


discard
and
the
kernel
issue
naked
to
put
itself
forth
.
she
be
the


naked
,
clear
kernel
thrust
forth
the
clear
,
powerful
shoot
,
and
the


world
be
a
bygone
winter
,
discard
,
her
mother
and
father
and
Anton
,


and
college
and
all
her
friend
,
all
cast
off
like
a
year
that
have
go


by
,
whilst
the
kernel
be
free
and
naked
and
strive
to
take
new
root
,


to
create
a
new
knowledge
of
Eternity
in
the
flux
of
Time
.
and
the


kernel
be
the
only
reality
;
the
rest
be
cast
off
into
oblivion
.




this
grow
and
grow
upon
she
.
when
she
open
her
eye
in
the
afternoon


and
see
the
window
of
her
room
and
the
faint
,
smoky
landscape
beyond
,


this
be
all
husk
and
shell
lie
by
,
all
husk
and
shell
,
she
could
see


nothing
else
,
she
be
enclose
still
,
but
loosely
enclose
.
there
be
a


space
between
she
and
the
shell
.
it
be
burst
,
there
be
a
rift
in
it
.


soon
she
would
have
her
root
fix
in
a
new
day
,
her
nakedness
would


take
itself
the
bed
of
a
new
sky
and
a
new
air
,
this
old
,
decay
,


fibrous
husk
would
be
go
.




gradually
she
begin
really
to
sleep
.
she
sleep
in
the
confidence
of
she


new
reality
.
she
sleep
breathe
with
her
soul
the
new
air
of
a
new


world
.
the
peace
be
very
deep
and
enrichening
.
she
have
her
root
in
new


ground
,
she
be
gradually
absorb
into
growth
.




when
she
wake
at
last
it
seem
as
if
a
new
day
have
come
on
the
earth
.


how
long
,
how
long
have
she
fight
through
the
dust
and
obscurity
,
for


this
new
dawn
?
how
frail
and
fine
and
clear
she
feel
,
like
the
most


fragile
flower
that
open
in
the
end
of
winter
.
but
the
pole
of
night


be
turn
and
the
dawn
be
come
in
.




very
far
off
be
her
old
experience
—
Skrebensky
,
her
part
with


he
—
very
far
off
.
some
thing
be
real
;
those
first
glamorous
week
.


before
,
these
have
seem
like
hallucination
.
now
they
seem
like


common
reality
.
the
rest
be
unreal
.
she
know
that
Skrebensky
have
never


become
finally
real
.
in
the
week
of
passionate
ecstasy
he
have
be


with
she
in
her
desire
,
she
have
create
he
for
the
time
be
.
but
in


the
end
he
have
fail
and
break
down
.




strange
,
what
a
void
separate
he
and
she
.
she
like
he
now
,
as
she


like
a
memory
,
some
bygone
self
.
he
be
something
of
the
past
,
finite
.


he
be
that
which
be
know
.
she
feel
a
poignant
affection
for
he
,
as


for
that
which
be
past
.
but
,
when
she
look
with
her
face
forward
,
he


be
not
.
nay
,
when
she
look
ahead
,
into
the
undiscovered
land
before


she
,
what
be
there
she
could
recognize
but
a
fresh
glow
of
light
and


inscrutable
tree
go
up
from
the
earth
like
smoke
.
it
be
the


unknown
,
the
unexplored
,
the
undiscovered
upon
whose
shore
she
have


land
,
alone
,
after
cross
the
void
,
the
darkness
which
wash
the


New
World
and
the
Old
.




there
would
be
no
child
:
she
be
glad
.
if
there
have
be
a
child
,
it


would
have
make
little
difference
,
however
.
she
would
have
keep
the


child
and
herself
,
she
would
not
have
go
to
Skrebensky
.
Anton


belong
to
the
past
.




there
come
the
cablegram
from
Skrebensky
:
"
I
be
married
.
"
an
old
pain


and
anger
and
contempt
stir
in
she
.
do
he
belong
so
utterly
to
the


cast
-
off
past
?
she
repudiate
he
.
he
be
as
he
be
.
it
be
good
that


he
be
as
he
be
.
who
be
she
to
have
a
man
accord
to
her
own


desire
?
it
be
not
for
she
to
create
,
but
to
recognize
a
man
create
by


God
.
the
man
should
come
from
the
Infinite
and
she
should
hail
he
.
she


be
glad
she
could
not
create
her
man
.
she
be
glad
she
have
nothing
to


do
with
his
creation
.
she
be
glad
that
this
lie
within
the
scope
of


that
vast
power
in
which
she
rest
at
last
.
the
man
would
come
out


of
Eternity
to
which
she
herself
belong
.




as
she
grow
well
,
she
sit
to
watch
a
new
creation
.
as
she
sit
at
she


window
,
she
see
the
people
go
by
in
the
street
below
,
collier
,
woman
,


child
,
walk
each
in
the
husk
of
an
old
fruition
,
but
visible


through
the
husk
,
the
swelling
and
the
heaving
contour
of
the
new


germination
.
in
the
still
,
silence
form
of
the
collier
she
see
a


sort
of
suspense
,
a
waiting
in
pain
for
the
new
liberation
;
she
see
the


same
in
the
false
hard
confidence
of
the
woman
.
the
confidence
of
the


woman
be
brittle
.
it
would
break
quickly
to
reveal
the
strength
and


patient
effort
of
the
new
germination
.




in
everything
she
see
she
grasp
and
grope
to
find
the
creation
of


the
live
God
,
instead
of
the
old
,
hard
barren
form
of
bygone
living
.


sometimes
great
terror
possess
she
.
sometimes
she
lose
touch
,
she


lose
her
feeling
,
she
could
only
know
the
old
horror
of
the
husk
which


bind
in
she
and
all
mankind
.
they
be
all
in
prison
,
they
be
all


go
mad
.




she
see
the
stiffen
body
of
the
collier
,
which
seem
already


enclose
in
a
coffin
,
she
see
their
unchanging
eye
,
the
eye
of
those


who
be
bury
alive
:
she
see
the
hard
,
cut
edge
of
the
new


house
,
which
seem
to
spread
over
the
hillside
in
their
insentient


triumph
,
the
triumph
of
horrible
,
amorphous
angle
and
straight
line
,


the
expression
of
corruption
triumphant
and
unopposed
,
corruption
so


pure
that
it
be
hard
and
brittle
:
she
see
the
dun
atmosphere
over
the


blacken
hill
opposite
,
the
dark
blotch
of
house
,
slate
roof
and


amorphous
,
the
old
church
-
tower
stand
up
in
hideous
obsoleteness


above
raw
new
house
on
the
crest
of
the
hill
,
the
amorphous
,
brittle
,


hard
edge
new
house
advance
from
Beldover
to
meet
the
corrupt
new


house
from
Lethley
,
the
house
of
Lethley
advance
to
mix
with
the


house
of
Hainor
,
a
dry
,
brittle
,
terrible
corruption
spread
over


the
face
of
the
land
,
and
she
be
sick
with
a
nausea
so
deep
that
she


perish
as
she
sit
.
and
then
,
in
the
blow
cloud
,
she
see
a
band
of


faint
iridescence
colour
in
faint
colour
a
portion
of
the
hill
.
and


forget
,
startled
,
she
look
for
the
hover
colour
and
see
a


rainbow
form
itself
.
in
one
place
it
gleam
fiercely
,
and
,
she


heart
anguish
with
hope
,
she
seek
the
shadow
of
iris
where
the
bow


should
be
.
steadily
the
colour
gather
,
mysteriously
,
from
nowhere
,
it


take
presence
upon
itself
,
there
be
a
faint
,
vast
rainbow
.
the
arc


bend
and
strengthen
itself
till
it
arch
indomitable
,
make
great


architecture
of
light
and
colour
and
the
space
of
heaven
,
its
pedestal


luminous
in
the
corruption
of
new
house
on
the
low
hill
,
its
arch
the


top
of
heaven
.




and
the
rainbow
stand
on
the
earth
.
she
know
that
the
sordid
people
who


creep
hard
-
scale
and
separate
on
the
face
of
the
world
’s
corruption


be
live
still
,
that
the
rainbow
be
arch
in
their
blood
and
would


quiver
to
life
in
their
spirit
,
that
they
would
cast
off
their
horny


covering
of
disintegration
,
that
new
,
clean
,
naked
body
would
issue


to
a
new
germination
,
to
a
new
growth
,
rise
to
the
light
and
the
wind


and
the
clean
rain
of
heaven
.
she
see
in
the
rainbow
the
earth
’s
new


architecture
,
the
old
,
brittle
corruption
of
house
and
factory
sweep


away
,
the
world
build
up
in
a
live
fabric
of
Truth
,
fit
to
the


over
-
arch
heaven
.
